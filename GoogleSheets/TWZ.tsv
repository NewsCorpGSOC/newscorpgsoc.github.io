Army Confirms It’s Exploring Requirements For A New Heavy-Lift He...	The U.S. Army is actively exploring options for a new-generation heavy-lift rotorcraft to replace the CH-47 Chinook. Although plans are still very much in their infancy, they have broader implications for future heavy-lift capabilities, especially for the Pacific theater. Confirmation that work on a Chinook successor is ongoing comes as the service progresses with its Future Long-Range Assault Aircraft (FLRAA) tiltrotor, which will replace part of the UH-60 Black Hawk fleet, and after its cancelation of the Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft (FARA), which would have partially replaced the OH-58D Kiowa Warrior armed scout helicopter, now retired without any plans for a direct successor. In response to a question from TWZ, Brig. Gen. Cain Baker, the director of the Future Vertical Lift Cross-Functional Team, or FVL CFT, at Army Futures Command, provided an update on Chinook replacement plans at the Association of the U.S. Army’s annual symposium yesterday. Within the Army, this is known as Capability Set, or 'Cape Set,' Four, part of the wider Future Vertical Lift (FVL) effort. FLRAA and FARA were responses to other FVL Capability Sets. Cap Set 4 also evolved in part from earlier efforts, including the Joint Heavy Lift (JHL) and Joint Multi-Role (JMR) programs. Future Vertical Lift Cross-Functional Team Director Brig. Gen. Cain Baker (center) at the 2024 iteration of the Experimental Demonstration Gateway Event (EDGE) at Yima Proving Ground earlier this year. Mark Schauer/U.S. Army It is important to note that Cape Set Four is not new and the Army announced the start of a new study into a potential Chinook replacement last year. 'We’ve done some initial studies on what a Cape Set Four looks like,' Brig. Gen. Baker explained. 'Those studies are still ongoing, very, very cognizant of the size of it, the type of lift capabilities we want from it, but also the affordability of that.' For Baker, Cape Set Four is very much a lower priority than FLRAA, which is anticipated to enter low-rate initial production in 2028 after which units will start to use them operationally in 2030.

Bell Textron Bell Baker continued: 'We will start looking eventually at Cape Set Four, as we get the feedback on what we see out in industry that’s available, and then, more importantly, does it potentially meet the requirements that we think we need.' Of those requirements, Baker listed longer range, heavier payload, and fuel efficiency. While Baker admitted that there is still 'a lot of work to do on Cape Set Four,' he also made clear that 'it is definitely out there on the horizon that we’ve got to look at.' In the meantime, the Army's Chinook fleet — which numbers more than 470 aircraft — will soldier on as the service's heavy-lift rotorcraft for many more years to come. This could be aided by the latest Chinook Block II upgrade program. This includes new rotor blades, a revised fuel tank configuration, and other improvements, while there is also a separate option to add more powerful General Electric T408 engines. So far, however, the Army has only bought them for its special operations units. The first picture of a CH-47, tail number 067, with the new T408 engines, which emerged in late 2019. U.S. Army 'We’re going to ride the Chinook like we’re riding the C-130' added Maj. Gen. Clair Gill, Commanding General at the U.S. Army Aviation Center of Excellence and Fort Novosel, also speaking at AUSA and referencing the Air Force’s long-lived turboprop transport plane. Nevertheless, the Army's determination to field a Chinook replacement at some point in the future is a notable turnaround, compared with previous comments. 'There is no plan right now for a Cape Set Four or Five and the Army has been pretty consistent in saying that' Gen. John Murray, then the commanding general of Army Futures Command, declared in May 2021. 'The FARA — Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft — and the Future Long-Range Assault Aircraft are the two plans, [or] programs, we have working right now. There is nothing working for a replacement for the CH-47.' The first Raider X competitive prototype for the now-canceled FARA program in a hangar at Sikorsky’s West Palm Beach, Florida, facility. Sikorsky The first Raider X competitive prototype in a hanger at Sikorsky’s West Palm Beach, Florida, facility. Sikorsky Photo While that plan has now changed, it’s likely that the current focus on FLRAA has highlighted the demand for greater speed and range in the vertical-lift domain, especially in the Pacific scenario. The Army is already preparing for the step-change in vertical-lift capability that the FLRAA promises to bring. This will include a new ability to conduct Large-Scale, Long-Range Air Assault, or L2A2, operations, defined by the ability to 'deliver one Brigade Combat Team in one period of darkness, over 500 miles, arriving behind enemy lines, and be able to conduct sustained combat operations,' Maj. Gen. Brett Sylvia, head of the 101st Airborne Division, said during a separate talk at AUSA. L2A2 currently relies upon a fast-flying tiltrotor to be realized, with the specific range and speed advantage of Bell’s V-280 Valor demonstrator very likely being a major factor behind its choice for FLRAA instead of Boeing’s rival SB>1 Defiant. FLRAA is derived from the V-280 design. How this does or doesn’t translate to a heavy-lift rotorcraft is an open question. There is no tiltrotor in this category currently flying or in development — although the idea has certainly been raised in the past — leaving a dearth of any kind of platform that can fulfill the Army’s Cape Set Four requirements. A concept from the Karem Aircraft Company shows a future heavy-lift tiltrotor, in the C-130 size category, schemed for the previous Joint Heavy Lift program, which also fed into Future Vertical Lift. Karem Aircraft Company rendering While the structural and performance enhancements introduced in the Chinook Block II program add speed and lift to an airframe design that’s now over 60 years old, the helicopter offers nothing close to FLRAA levels of performance. At the same time, Chinook Block II has always been seen as a stopgap until a replacement platform can be defined, a conundrum Cape Set Four is now grappling with. Other than the Chinook, the only other suitable heavy-lift rotorcraft currently in production is the CH-53K King Stallion, as operated by the U.S. Marine Corps.

U.S. Marine Corps photo by Lance Cpl. Meshaq Hylton This program has been anything but trouble-free, with issues during its development prompting a demand from Congress that the Marines examine potential alternatives, such as the Chinook. On top of the Chinook Block II, another potential stopgap solution for the Army would be to re-engine its CH-47 fleet with T408 engines. This would provide a significantly more capable helicopter, building on its speed, payload, and hot-and-high performance. The T408s engines each produce 7,500 shaft horsepower (shp), around 2,500 shp more than the T55-GA-714As on standard CH-47F models. In the past, the Army’s reluctance to re-engine its Chinooks — and to buy Block IIs for regular Army units — seemed to be driven, at least in part, by a stated desire to move beyond the venerable design and instead look toward fielding a new heavy-lift rotary-wing aircraft, something that has previously attracted pushback from Congress.

Thomas Mort However, for some years now, there’s been a growing realization that today’s Chinook is not survivable enough in some scenarios for potential future conflicts with peer or near-peer adversaries. 'We needed a capability that could fly great distances at great speeds and penetrate, let’s say, a Russian air defense system,' Army Secretary Mark Esper told members of the House Appropriations Committee's defense subcommittee, back in 2019, defending Army plans to shift funds from the Chinook to future aircraft programs and modernization programs. 'The decision, I think, for the CH-47s for the conventional Army — what probably changed was, when the National Defense Strategy was issued, it told us to move away from counterinsurgency to high-intensity conflict,' Esper added.

U.S. Army photo by Markus Rauchenberger That means switching to advanced aircraft like the FLRAA tiltrotor and — until its cancelation — FARA, which emphasize high speed and long range as well as other measures to enhance their over survivability. The survivability question, in general, is one that has consistently been raised about rotorcraft of all types, especially when it comes to future high-end fights. In the meantime, the dense air defense environment faced by tactical aircraft — including rotorcraft — in Ukraine has demonstrated the vulnerability of traditional platforms even when exposed to older-generation threats. Along with concerns over rotorcraft survivability is the interest expressed by the Army (as well as the Marine Corps and Air Force) in distributed logistics chains, leveraging, at least in part, increasingly large uncrewed aerial cargo platforms. This could also raise questions about whether a new heavy-lift platform is necessary or cost-effective. A video showing the Kaman KARGO drone, one of the uncrewed aerial cargo designs the Marine Corps is currently considering acquiring. Another uncrewed option for future heavy-lift, vertical-lift requirements might be found in a fan-in-wing vertical take-off-and-landing capable type. Earlier this month, we reported on how Aurora Flight Sciences is working on a demonstrator aircraft in this category, as well as a scaled-up cargo aircraft based on the same technology. The demonstrator is being developed under a U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) program and reflects Air Force interest in a new high-speed, runway-independent special operations transport plane. If this concept actually comes to fruition and is operationally viable, it would provide a C-130-like payload with VTOL capability, and, even though it likely would not be procured by the Army, it could assume aspects of the mission set for the service. An Aurora Flight Sciences rendering of an uncrewed fan-in-wing VTOL-capable cargo aircraft. Aurora Flight Sciences Looking further ahead, the need for higher-performance vertical lift could potentially be provided by some kind of High-Speed Vertical Take-Off and Landing, or HSVTOL, aircraft. This is a concept that Bell is meanwhile has been working on, including now as part of the same DARPA program that Aurora's lift fan design is under development for. While this kind of aircraft promises to combine the ability to take off and land vertically using rotors as well as fly at jet speeds in forward flight, it is still very much in its infancy and significant hurdles — especially as regards the nature of the propulsion system — still need to be overcome. Bell’s latest three HSVTOL concepts are progressively larger, beginning with the smallest, known as HSVTOL Light, which is unmanned and scaling up to a roughly C-130-size transport. Bell The experience with FARA demonstrates just how quickly Army requirements can change and be superseded. With upgrades to ensure it remains relevant, the Chinook will be at the center of Army airlift for decades to come, but service officials are now talking openly about the need for a successor, even if that might not emerge until around the 2060s. With very few options, beyond more Chinooks, which don’t appear to meet long-term requirements, an all-new design currently looks almost certain. Rachel S. Cohen contributed to this story.

Secretive Phoenix Ghost Kamikaze Drones Rushed To Ukraine Finally...	The secretive Phoenix Ghost kamikaze drone, first developed for the U.S. Air Force and supplied to Ukraine in its ongoing fight against Russia, has finally emerged publicly. We now know for sure that Phoenix Ghost is not a single design, but a family of increasingly larger and longer-ranged one-way attack munitions from AEVEX Aerospace, some of which have been seen before, while at least one was only revealed this week. AEVEX confirmed the connection between various kamikaze drones it offers and the Phoenix Ghost effort at the Association of the U.S. Army’s (AUSA) main annual symposium in Washington, D.C., this week. The Pentagon first announced Phoenix Ghost kamikaze drones provided by AEVEX would be headed to Ukraine back in 2022, but scant information about them had subsequently emerged before now. Disruptor, one of the AEVEX kamikaze drones now known to be part of the Phoenix Ghost family. Jamie Hunter 'It’s been a long time coming,' Elizabeth Trammell, senior director of business development at AEVEX, told TWZ Tuesday. 'This has been around for a while … We’ve been able to receive specific permission to talk about it.' The Phoenix Ghost family of one-way attack munitions includes types with distinctly different forms and performance capabilities. At least some of the designs were derived from aerial targets that AEVEX originally developed for testing counter-drone systems, according to the company. Phoenix Ghosts were among the first kamikaze drones the U.S. military publicly announced it would be sending to Ukraine, but it had not been previously confirmed what they were and no conclusive imagery showing one had emerged before now. It is worth noting that the development of the Phoenix Ghost family, which traces back to a project under the Air Force's Big Safari special projects office, also predates Russia's all-out invasion of Ukraine in 2022. As such, AEVEX was very much ahead in the United States in working on one-way-attack drones, in general. I find it odd that with all the imagery and video pouring out of Ukraine of virtually every weapon system before, action, in action, or after action, we have yet to see a single confirmed image of a Phoenix Ghost suicide drone/loitering munition.&mdash; Tyler Rogoway (@Aviation_Intel) July 25, 2022 All 'AEVEX loitering munitions use visual-based navigation to autonomously identify and follow landmarks or features in their environment, enabling precise positioning and pathfinding without reliance on GPS,' according to the company's website. 'Our systems leverage alternative PNT [precision navigation and timing] solutions to maintain precise navigation and operational capability in GPS-denied or degraded environments.' In addition, 'AEVEX loitering munitions automatically detect, identify, locate, report (DILR) and deliver lethal and non-lethal effects against threats across multiple scenarios and domains with unprecedented accuracy and speed' and are able to 'navigate, make decisions, and complete missions without direct intervention,' the company says. However, the drones can also be fitted with line-of-sight links and/or mesh networked radios, as well as electro-optical and infrared sensors, to provide some degree of direct control. In addition to acting as kamikaze drones, AEVEX says the uncrewed aerial systems in its product line can be configured for electronic and cyber warfare and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) missions. Among the specific kamikaze drones AEVEX has now disclosed as being part of the Phoenix Ghost family are Dominator and Disruptor, which are in the so-called Group 3 category. The U.S. military defines Group 3 drones as weighing between 55 and 1,320 pounds, being able to fly at altitudes between 3,500 and 18,000 feet, and having top speeds of between 100 and 250 knots. While the Dominator was previously disclosed, Disruptor was only publicly unveiled this week. Disruptor, which has a tubular carbon fiber main body, a pair of straight main wings, and a v-tail configuration, is 10.1 feet long and has a wingspan of 15.75 feet. It has a maximum takeoff weight of 185 pounds when launched pneumatically, but this can be increased to 205 pounds by using a rocket-assisted launch method. AEVEX also states that the Disruptor can be vehicle-launched, but has not provided any further details. Powered by a small internal combustion engine driving a two-bladed pusher propeller, Disruptor can stay aloft for 4.5 hours and fly out to a maximum range of at least 372 miles (598 kilometers) with a 50-pound payload. The company also offers a version using electronic fuel injection (EFI), increasing its endurance to 11.6 hours and extending its range out to 822 miles (1,322 kilometers). Disruptor's engine and propeller. Jamie Hunter Disruptor is interestingly similar, at least in very broad strokes, to kamikaze drones that Iran has developed or helped its proxies develop, such as the Shahed 101. AEVEX says the Group 3 Dominator is dimensionally identical to Disruptor in terms of overall length and wingspan, but it has a completely different twin-boom configuration with an inverted v-shaped tailplane. This a very common configuration for drones in this general size class, with the RQ-7 Shadow, which the U.S. Army announced plans to retire in Febraury, being just one example. There is also the Aerosonde family, versions of which remain in service with the U.S. special operations community. Other twin boom drones with v-shaped and straight tailplanes, including ones made in China, are also in widespread use globally. The Dominator drone. AEVEX Dominator has maximum takeoff weights of 205 and 225 pounds when launched pneumatically or in a rocket-assisted mode, respectively. With a similar, if not identical propulsion system to Disruptor, Dominator has maximum endurances of 4.6 and 11.7 hours and ranges of 293 and 743 miles (492 and 1,196 kilometers) with and without EFI. A Dominator drone on a pneumatic launcher. AEVEX The Phoenix Ghost family also includes a smaller Group 2 drone called Atlas, another design that AEVEX has previously shown publicly. Per the U.S. military definitions, uncrewed aerial systems in this category weigh between 21 and 55 pounds, can fly at altitudes up to 3,500 feet, and attain top speeds of up to 250 knots. The Atlas, which has what looks to be pop-out main wings and v-tail, has a maximum takeoff weight of 20.9 pounds, including an 8.1-pound payload, and is 2.9 feet long and has a wingspan of 5.5 feet, per AEVEX's website. Its stated endurance is between one and two hours, with a maximum range of at least 74 miles (120 kilometers). How Atlas is powered is not immediately clear, but it has a pusher propeller at the rear. The Atlas drone. AEVEX At AUSA this week, AEVEX had a product card detailing another drone called Dagger, which also does not appear to have been previously disclosed and looks to be a Group 2 analog to Disruptor. It is unclear whether the electrically powered Dagger is technically part of the Phoenix Ghost family or is a design that followed on from that work. Dagger is six feet long and has a wingspan of 8.7 feet, has a maximum takeoff weight of 35 pounds (including an eight-pound payload), and can fly for up to 80 minutes and out to a range of 120 miles (193 kilometers). A picture of the rendering of the Dagger drone seen on the AEVEX product card at AUSA. Jamie Hunter Dagger is designed to make it easier for troops to 'move in, get out, set up, shoot off, and … get out of there,' AEVEX's Trammell explained to TWZ at AUSA. AEVEX's Trammel also said that the Phoenix Ghost family encompasses multiple other assets that the company is keeping under wraps for now. The company is also continuing to evolve its product line, in part based on experiences from the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. AEVEX uses a two-week design cycle to let the company quickly respond to new threats and conditions troops encounter on the ground. 'We've learned a lot,' Trammell said. 'This [Distruptor] does not look anywhere near what it was when we first put it out.' The nose cone has changed, she said, as has the color. She indicated the colors have evolved to better camouflage the weapons around the clock. Ukrainian officials notably began highlighting Russia's use of black or otherwise darkly painted kamikaze drones, and that this had made it difficult to visually spot and track them, especially at night, last year. Ukraine has since been observed employing kamikaze drones with similar paint schemes. Another view of the Disruptor drone on the floor of this year's AUSA show, highlighting its dark paint job. Jamie Hunter As the war in Ukraine grinds through its third year, Trammell also expects demand will grow for the drones to collect more intelligence and play a larger role in electronic warfare. AEVEX is also known to be looking at enhancing Phoenix Ghost’s resistance to GPS jamming, something that has been a significant problem in Ukraine, for both drones and guided munitions. The company says its acquisition of Veth Research Associates should see that company’s guidance and navigation technology inserted into Phoenix Ghost drones, according to Aviation Week. When it comes to Ukraine, it remains unclear what types of Phoenix Ghost drones the country has received to date and how they are specifically configured in terms of payloads and guidance capabilities. To date, the U.S. military has pledged at least 1,800 Phoenix Ghosts to Ukraine. The U.S. military said had obligated approximately $576 million for the purchase of drones in this family from AEVEX for the Ukrainian armed forces through the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative (USAI), as of August. AEVEX was shipping around 230 loitering munitions each month at the height of its deliveries, and is still delivering fresh weapons every two weeks, Trammell told TWZ. Back in April 2022, then-top Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby did say that the Phoenix Ghost drones Ukraine was getting had similar, 'but not [the] exact,' capabilities as the AeroVironment Switchblade 300 tube-launched loitering munition, which could point to the smaller Atlas or Dagger. However, officials added at that time that there are differences 'in the scope of capability for the Phoenix Ghost.' Another view of the Atlas drone. AEVEX Kirby's statement is one of a number of signs that had emerged before this year's AUSA gathering pointing to Phoenix Ghost actually being a family of drones and that Ukraine had received multiple types, something David Hambling just explored in more detail for Forbes last month. 'It’s a system of systems that varies in range and payload and type,' Skip Arny, a Vice President at Aevex Aerospace, also said about Phoenix Ghost at the AUSA show in 2022, according to Defense News. 'It’s a great example of a quick-reaction capability, and we basically got a request to put a system together, and that’s what it is.' Just this summer, pictures also began to emerge of a drone design that had not been previously observed in use by Ukraine, which independent defense analyst H.I. Sutton noted on his website Covert Shores looked similar if not identical to the AEVEX Dominator. Questions have been raised about whether these drones are actually Dominators or are a local derivative or clone of some kind given that they were reportedly recovered in Russia. The U.S. government has, at least from what is known publicly to date, placed significant restrictions on the use of American-supplied munitions against targets inside Russian territory, but various exceptions and caveats are also known to exist. Drones can stray from their intended flight paths for various reasons, too. Ukraine's arsenal of longer-range kamikaze drones has otherwise steadily expanded in the past two years, predominantly through the fielding of new domestically developed types. The wreckage of a one-way attack drone — which looks to be the Dominator, or a derivative of it — used to attack Russia earlier this year. via X Not knowing what kinds of Phoenix Ghost drones Ukraine has or how they are configured, it is also unclear what kinds of target sets the drones are being employed against. 'We haven’t really gotten into anti-tank or anti-armor, just because it’s not been a requirement for us,' AEVEX's senior director of business development Trammell told TWZ at AUSA this week. 'A lot of our aircraft, we had the base capability and then our customers came in and said, ‘This is what we want.’' Trammell's mention of 'customers' plural also raises questions about who else may have received Phoenix Ghost drones. As of June, AEVEX had reportedly delivered 4,000 drones under U.S. military contracts, well beyond the 1,800 Phoenix Ghosts publicly committed to Ukraine through USAI. It is certainly possible that the Ukrainian military has received more Phoenix Ghosts than is publicly known, but demand for various tiers of kamikaze drones is also growing globally. Earlier this year, the U.S. government approved the potential sale of more than 1,000 kamikaze drones, a mix of Switchblade 300 and ALTIUS 600M types, to Taiwan. That comes amid broader U.S. military plans to help the island turn the airspace and waters around it into a 'hellscape' full of uncrewed platforms in the event of an invasion from the mainland, as you can read more about here. The now routine use of multiple tiers of kamikaze drones in the conflict in Ukraine has helped push the Taiwan 'hellscape' plans forward and is also driving efforts across the U.S. military to acquire and field these types of uncrewed aerial systems. Last year, the Pentagon kicked off an initiative dubbed Replicator specifically with the goal of helping get thousands of new and relatively cheap uncrewed platforms with high degrees of autonomy into the hands of U.S. forces across all domains by 2025. In August, the Army awarded an especially massive contract valued at nearly $1 billion to AeroVironment for Switchblade 300 and 600-series drones, which is now the subject of a formal protest. 'There are a lot of companies in this space, so Switchblades are one of our first efforts here, but it's not going to be our last or our only one,' Doug Bush, the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Acquisition, Logistics, and Technology, told TWZ and other outlets at a media roundtable on the sidelines of the AUSA conference this week. 'I think you will see soon a diversity of companies getting contracts for that kind capability. It's a really healthy part of industry. We don't have, like, just one place to go.' Each branch of the U.S. armed forces — particularly the Army and Air Force — has been interested 'in some way, shape or form' in AEVEX's product line, Trammell told TWZ. Furthermore, 'as the conflict [in Ukraine] dwindles, there's other opportunities that this can go for,' she said. 'There's a lot of big programs that are looking for midsize UAS systems, and we're trying to advertise to that.' Still, the experience AEVEX has now gained from working on the now less-secretive Phoenix Ghost effort for Ukraine could give the company an important leg up as kamikaze drones continue to make their mark worldwide.

B-2 Spirits Just Sent A Very Ominous Message To Iran	The Pentagon is stating that B-2 Spirit stealth bombers, along with other U.S. forces, conducted a strike on Houthi underground weapon storage sites in Yemen. This it the first operational strike mission for the Spirit in years and the first into Yemen. It sends a very specific and powerful message that only B-2 can to the Houthi's benefactor, Iran. It also occurred on what appears to be the precipice of an unprecedented Israeli retaliation strike. As to why the B-2 was used against the Houthis, who have only rudimentary air defenses, we will address in a moment, but it was by design a very ominous and potentially historic act that might have featured the first use of an incredibly rare weapon. Even if it did not, the message was the same. The Pentagon's statement reads: 'Today, U.S. military forces, including U.S. Air Force B-2 bombers, conducted precision strikes against five hardened underground weapons storage locations in Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen. U.S. forces targeted several of the Houthis' underground facilities housing various weapons components of types that the Houthis have used to target civilian and military vessels throughout the region. This was a unique demonstration of the United States' ability to target facilities that our adversaries seek to keep out of reach, no matter how deeply buried underground, hardened, or fortified. The employment of U.S. Air Force B-2 Spirit long-range stealth bombers demonstrate U.S. global strike capabilities to take action against these targets when necessary, anytime, anywhere. For over a year, the Iran-backed Houthis, Specially Designated Global Terrorists, have recklessly and unlawfully attacked U.S. and international vessels transiting the Red Sea, the Bab Al-Mandeb Strait, and the Gulf of Aden. The Houthis' illegal attacks continue to disrupt the free flow of international commerce, threaten environmental catastrophe, and put innocent civilian lives and U.S. and partner forces' lives at risk. At the direction of President Biden, I authorized these targeted strikes to further degrade the Houthis' capability to continue their destabilizing behavior and to protect and defend U.S. forces and personnel in one of the world's most critical waterways. Again, the United States will not hesitate to take action to defend American lives and assets; to deter attacks against civilians and our regional partners; and to protect freedom of navigation and increase the safety and security in these waterways for U.S., coalition, and merchant vessels. We will continue to make clear to the Houthis that there will be consequences for their illegal and reckless attacks. I am grateful for the professionalism and skill of the brave American troops who took part in today's actions and who continue to stand guard in defense of our Nation.' The DoD's description of the targets is very important. 'Hardened underground weapons storage locations,' followed by declaring 'the United States' ability to target facilities that our adversaries seek to keep out of reach, no matter how deeply buried underground, hardened, or fortified.' This directly highlights the B-2's special ability to carry out unique penetrating 'bunker buster' strikes, specifically via its ability to carry the GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrator, better known as the MOP. Although it isn't clear if this weapon was used, it's certainly possible for a number of reasons, and that is really all that matters. The MOP, weighing in around 30,000lbs, can only be carried by the B-2. Two can be lugged aloft by each of the stealth bombers at a time. These are highly specialized and prized weapons only available in relatively tiny numbers. MOP is able to penetrate deeper than any other conventional bomb on earth and is specifically designed and has been repeatedly upgraded to go after deeply buried, high-value targets, especially those in Iran. These sites include command and control centers and missile storage and launch facilities, as well as aircraft storage areas, tunneled into mountains. But above all else, the MOP's top targets would be extremely hardened sites related to Iran's nuclear program. This is a reality we have been discussing for many years and in detail. Even with the MOP, they will be a challenge to destroy, but anything short of a nuclear weapon, ground invasion, or use of an 'exotic' tactic like irradiation, the MOPs have the best shot at severely damaging these facilities and degrading their utility over the long term. Iran's Natanz nuclear site burrowed in a mountain.(PHOTO © 2023 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION) The Houthis also have high-value sites dug into mountains. They are not nearly as advanced as those found in Iran, and while hitting weak points, support areas, and entrances may degrade their utility, truly destroying them may very well necessitate the MOP's special penetrating abilities. Even if the target set didn't require it, a demonstration of MOP's capabilities — if it was indeed used — may have been a strategic messaging decision, but more about that in a moment. The Houthis are going underground. In 2019, the movement seems to have reactivated a Saleh-era underground facility at Hafa military base in Sanaa, which had been destroyed by coalition airstrikes back in 2015. (15.325075° 44.239581°) pic.twitter.com/g4Ep5CltEX&mdash; Fabian Hinz (@fab_hinz) March 14, 2021 The timing of such a strike makes perfect sense as it happened just as the tension between Israel and Iran is about to hit uncharted territory as the world awaits what is by all indications going to be a significant strike by Israel directly on Iran. Sending a very direct reminder that the U.S. has the ability to destroy extremely hardened sites with conventional weapons and it is willing to use them seems right on cue in terms of deterrence theater. This is only magnified if MOP was indeed used for the first time. In fact, MOP-related news often peculiarly pops-up during times of escalation with America's 'rogue state' foes, although a demonstration of operational use has never occurred. Regardless, striking these sites with any munitions also degrades the Houthi's long-range capabilities ahead of an Israeli operation, which is important. The B-2 also has the ability to deliver Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAMs) with penetrating warheads in the 2,000-pound class (BLU-109), as well as, at least in the past, 5,000-pound class bunker busters, the latter being a much rarer weapon the exact status of which in the B-2's inventory is unclear. You can read more about this class of weapon's origins here and murky status here. A very early graphic from the MOP program showing the bomb able to penetrate up to 60 feet under the ground. By 2007, the weapon was reportedly capable of burrowing nearly four times deeper than this. This also offers a comparison between the 2,000lb BLU-109-equipped guided bomb and 5,000lb GBU-28. DOD via GlobalSecurity.org The B-2 is capable of carrying 16 of the 2,000lb class weapons, allowing it to 'dig down' through hardened targets that do not necessitate a MOP by having one weapon follow through the hole made by the one that just struck before it and so on. It is creative 'weaponeering' that allows for lesser bunker busters to achieve greater burrowing effects. Even the MOP could use this tactic for striking very deeply buried targets, like some of those in Iran. Otherwise disabling sites by going after entrance tunnels and other weaker, but less centralized areas may be an option. GBU-31 JDAMs equipped with BLU-109 penetrator warheads. (USAF) But if common 2,000lb bunker busters were used, why leverage the B-2, a precious asset of which only 19 exist, on targets that sit under airspace that is barely defended? There are a number of reasons for this that we already addressed after the Spirit was selected to strike targets in Libya in 2017. You can read that post here. But once again, the messaging related to the B-2 and its ability to penetrate deep into contested airspace to deliver a highly specialized weapon that threatens Iran's most guarded military and nuclear assets is the most glaring reason. We will have to wait to find out exactly what was stuck and how, but as it sits now, this mission was far more than just an attack operation to achieve a kinetic effect. It was meant to send a blindingly bright message to Iran at a critically high-risk and pivotal moment.

Command Center Stryker Teamed With Uncrewed Ground Vehicle ‘Wingm...	General Dynamics Land Systems (GDLS) unveiled a new Mission Command On The Move (MCOTM) concept and its supporting hardware at the Association of the United States Army's biggest annual conference (AUSA '24), which wrapped up today outside of Washington, D.C. The idea is to take an advanced command center filled with communications and a crew that can interpret critical data and make fast decisions, pack it all into a nimble armored vehicle, and push it forward toward the edge of battle along with an array of uncrewed ground vehicles (UGVs) also under its control. This concept appears to aim to accomplish a couple of key objectives. First, it makes a command and control node more nimble, protected, and thus far more survivable on a modern battlefield. Fixed command centers, which often have a major footprint and the multi-spectral signatures that go with it, are more vulnerable than ever, especially as precision-guided missile and drone technology proliferate at an alarming space. So allowing it to reposition rapidly, and even keep up with the forces it supports, is seen as an attractive capability. There is also a major logistics burden when it comes to establishing, breaking down, and repositioning traditional command centers in tents and trailers. The other is to allow this mobile C2 node to also control an array of UGVs that can work in a defensive manner, protecting the command center and friendly forces, and even in an offensive one. Seeing as the C2 node is armored, deeply networked, and highly mobile, it could stay in relatively close proximity to at least some of the UGVs it controls, allowing for line-of-sight connectivity between them. The UGVs can provide direct fire, reconnaissance, air defense, and additional transport capabilities. This kind of manned-unmanned teaming armored ecosystem is very much the direction the Army is interested in heading in the coming years. Central to this concept is the 8&#215;8 Mission Command On The Move (MCOTM) armored vehicle, which is based on the StrykerX demonstrator. This rolling battlefield management node works as a forward brain for friendly forces and a quarterback for the aforementioned UGVs even in hotly contested areas. The General Dynamics Land Systems Stryker Mission Command On The Move (MCOTM) command vehicle. (General Dynamics Land Systems) Like the StrykerX, which was unveiled at the AUSA show in 2022, the Stryker MCOTM system features hybrid-electric propulsion. This also builds on a previous StrykerQB concept that was rolled out for AUSA conference last year. Painted like a football uniform, it was displayed to show the Army 'the 'art of the possible' when it comes to using existing platforms for manned-unmanned teaming, or human-machine integration,' Breaking Defense reported at the time. The earlier StrykerQB vehicle. (General Dynamics Land Systems) The new Stryker MCOTM is another step forward in that development. With increased interior space thanks to a raised rear roof, it has room for seven soldiers. The command vehicle uses GDLS's KATALYST Next Generation Electronic Architecture (NGEA) to connect all its systems together and provide for ease of upgradability of its hardware and modification of its software. That enables the vehicle to adapt more quickly to changing tactical realities and technologies. The NGEA system offers 'cyber defense, and individual communication devices for end-to-end secure communications, at echelon,' the company states. 'Integrating innovative intra-command post communications helps substantively reduce electromagnetic signatures, enabling the MCOTM command post to 'hide in plain sight.'' Extra attention has been put on reducing the vehicle's signature beyond the radio frequency spectrum, including thermal and acoustic. The vehicle's hybrid propulsion helps with both. For self-protection, the Stryker MCOTM showcased on the showroom floor features the Iron Fist Light active protection system. The system is designed to shoot down approaching anti-tank guided missiles and other infantry anti-armor weapons, and could be used to also swat down incoming kamikaze drones and drone-launched projectiles in the near future. GDLS has shown the Stryker MCOTM paired with the newest version of the company's 8&#215;8 Multi-Utility Tactical Transport (MUTT) robotic vehicle, known as the MUTT XM, and the latest iteration of its TRX Defender, a 10-ton modular tracked robotic vehicle that can be configured to provide ground and air defense fire support. At AUSA this year, GDLS also highlighted MUTT XM as a robot dog carrier vehicle, capable of releasing and retrieving these mechanical and potentially deadly quadrupeds in forward areas. They can also be used for outer security around the MCOTM. At AUSA, the specific robot dog shown together with the MUTT XM was a Ghost Robotics Vision 60 quadrupedal UGV (Q-UGV), a design The War Zone has covered extensively in the past. This particular Vision 60 was carrying MIMIC spoofing technology from General Dynamics Mission Systems, 'providing a deployed layer of protection for the MCOTM command vehicles,' according to the company. A key part of our Mission Command on the Move (MCOTM) concept at AUSA 2024 is the MUTT XM, the newest member of our family of Multi-Utility Tactical Transport robotic vehicles.MUTT XM is bigger, faster and stronger than its predecessors and is hardened against electromagnetic… pic.twitter.com/7MLtXYW0Xm&mdash; General Dynamics Land Systems (@GD_LandSystems) October 15, 2024 The MUTT XM by itself 'is bigger, faster, and stronger than its predecessors and is hardened against electromagnetic interference,' GDLS stated in a release. It 'lightens the load as an equipment-carrying 'robotic mule' but also has built-in flexibility for a wide variety of combat, combat support, and combat service support functions and payloads.'

(Jamie Hunter) The Army has been experimenting with versions of the MUTT vehicle for a while, something we noted in February 2022. In an opposition forces exercise, the 8×8 wheeled, hybrid-electric-powered uncrewed ground vehicles (UGV) were each configured with a Common Remotely Operated Weapon Station (CROWS) equipped with a 7.62mm M240 machine gun and a Javelin anti-tank guided missile (ATGM) launcher. It also had a tethered quadcopter drone with an array of video cameras allowing it to provide additional surveillance and reconnaissance capacity, as well as act as a signal relay. That extends how far the MUTT can operate from its human operators. You can see one example of that configuration in the image below. An 8&#215;8 Multi-Utility Tactical Transport (MUTT) as seen during a 2022 demonstration. (U.S. Army) TRX, which GDLS had first unveiled at the AUSA gathering in 2020, is a tracked semi-autonomous vehicle with a flat deck that can be configured in numerous ways, including for direct and indirect fire, autonomous resupply, complex obstacle breaching, counter-unmanned aerial systems (C-UAS), electronic warfare (EW), reconnaissance, and other battlefield missions. The core design was developed to meet the Army's need for a 10- to 20-ton UGV. That vehicle was the company’s submission to the Army’s Robotic Combat Vehicle-Medium (RCV-M) competition that Howe & Howe ultimately won with its M5. The General Dynamics Land Systems TRX in a SHORAD configuration. (Jamie Hunter) Another view of the SHORAD-configured TRX. (Jamie Hunter) As seen above and below, the TRX on display at AUSA this year was mocked up as a short-range air defense (SHORAD) system with faux Stinger short-range heat-seeking surface-to-air missiles, Coyote anti-drone interceptors, a 30mm automatic cannon, and a 7.62x51mm machine gun. This is an impressive and diverse loadout for a relatively small tracked vehicle. Vehicles that are capable of rebuffing drone attacks, are armored, and can keep up with frontline forces are becoming a growing priority for the U.S. Army and this is clearly a major business growth area for industry. Having just such a vehicle to protect the manned command and control Stryker that could operate detached from forward forces is also key. (Jamie Hunter) Another version of TRX we wrote about in 2021 was set up as a launch platform for 50 AeroVironment Switchblade-series loitering munitions. Such a configuration could venture forward and launch a devastating drone swarm at the command of the MCOTM. The General Dynamics Land Systems TRX configured as Switchblade launch platform on display at the 2021 AUSA conference. (Joseph Trevithick) www.twz.com The Army is increasingly looking to integrate UGVs with its crewed armored formation on the battlefield. Similar to how the USAF wants its Next Generation Air Dominance manned 'fighter' to be the centerpiece of a family of systems that will be dominated by uncrewed types, working as the central C2 node 'quarterback' for these drones, GDLS is presenting a similar concept for ground operations. Moving the controller forward not only helps with connectivity and awareness, but also allows for deficiencies in autonomy to be overcome by proximity. Advances in autonomy will change those relationships over time, but this kind of on-the-move management will be important at least in the near term as the U.S. military has stressed that having humans at least somewhere 'on-the-loop' is a requisite for uncrewed platforms. As far as the MCOTM's more traditional command and control functions, those are not clear, but even possessing some of these abilities and being able to keep them on the move and forward while flanked by a protective phalanx of UGVs is an enticing concept to ponder. Another view of the Stryker MCOTM on display at this year's AUSA show. Jamie Hunter Regardless of whether this system fills this role for the Army or anyone else, the general concept behind it is something we're going to be seeing more of in the coming years.

Army’s Future Vertical Lift Tiltrotor Will Differ Significantly F...	The U.S. Army's Future Long-Range Assault Aircraft (FLRAA) tiltrotor is shaping up to be significantly different from the V-280 Valor from which it is derived. Changes range from the design of the drive train to the fuselage layout to the arrangement of the seats inside the main cabin. The service's goal is to have the initial FLRAA configuration largely nailed down by next year and development work is already informing exploration of how the new aircraft will be used operationally. Army officials provided new details about the FLRAA program at a panel discussion today at the Association of the U.S. Army's (AUSA) main annual conference in Washington, D.C. The service picked Bell and its V-280-based design as the winner of the FLRAA competition in 2022. A so-called Critical Design Review (CDR) is expected to occur next summer ahead of the planned delivery of the first of six FLRAA prototypes in 2026. The program schedule as it exists now sees low-rate initial production of the tiltrotors starting in 2028 and units beginning to use them operationally in 2030. Bell 'To be very clear, and that's why I very rarely use the term V-280 for FLRAA, the name of the aircraft will be different, the nomenclature will be different, the changes are significant,' Army Col. Jeffrey Poquette, the head of the program on the Army side, explained at AUSA. 'The drive train has already been upsized to meet the purposes and intent for meeting our requirements.' In terms of general performance, requirements the Army previously laid out publicly for FLRAA called for a design capable of hitting a top speed of at least 250 knots (285 miles per hour), and potentially up to 280 knots (320 miles per hour), and with an unrefueled combat radius of between 200 and 300 nautical miles. In testing to date, the experimental V-280, which has been flying since 2017, has reached a top speed of over 300 knots. The stated maximum speed and range of a typical current-generation Black Hawk under normal operating conditions is around 163 knots (187.5 miles per hour) and 268 nautical miles, respectively, according to Lockheed Martin, the parent company of the helicopter's manufacturer Sikorsky. The Army has also said in the past that it wants FLRAA to be able to carry 12 passengers, 4,000 pounds, or a mix of both, internally, as well as between 10,000 pounds and 13,100 pounds of additional cargo slung underneath the fuselage. FLRAA is also expected to have the ability to carry munitions and other stores on stub wings just like Black Hawk variants and the exact configuration of sensors, antennas and other systems will need to be finalized, as well. A future special operations-focused subvariant is set to have other specialized features, too, including aerial refueling capability. FLRAA will have other notable internal and external differences compared to the V-280. 'Something as simple as, will we have cockpit doors? The answer is no. But the Valor does,' Col. Poquette added. 'We've already decided that the original [boarding] step [into the main cabin] was a little too narrow.' 'The things that matter to soldiers in the back are not drive trains or engines or rotors. What matters to them [are things like] is my seat comfortable? Does my ruck[sack] have to sit on my toes when I'm trying to get out? Am I going to trip over the guy in front of me?' the FLRAA program head continued. 'So we spend a lot of time early trying to get the insight from the people that matter to us.' Poquette highlighted experimentation utilizing a wooden FLRAA mock-up earlier this year at Wheeler Army Airfield in Hawaii earlier this year that involved personnel from the 25th Infantry Division as having provided key feedback. 'We spent a week out there with them [the members of the 25th Infantry Division], iterating on the two [internal] configurations we wanted to test. We started with one, the one actually that we thought we were going to choose with [regard to] seat configuration,' Poquette said. 'We ran the soldiers through [drills]&#8230; without any combat gear, and then we added weapons, then we added body armor, then we added MOPP gear. We timed them.' MOPP is the U.S. military's suite of Mission Oriented Protective Posture protective gear, which includes gas masks and full body suits designed to help shield soldiers from chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear hazards. MOPP gear is notoriously physically straining to wear, especially in extremely hot and humid environments. A member of the 25th Infantry Division carrying their weapon and other gear exits the FLRAA mockup during testing at Wheeler Army Airfield in Hawaii in September 2024. US Army Spc. Charles Clark 'The people that do this kind of human systems science are technical experts, We measured every soldier with giant human-sized calipers,' Poquette continued. 'We wanted to make sure we could take care of the fifth percentile soldier, the 95th percent percentile soldier. 'We ran it [the tests] at combat speed &#8230; even as the soldiers came out, they ran out, they went into the prone with their weapon, so it was as tactical as we could make it while getting the information that we need,' he added.' 'What we found out is that soldiers really liked the second configuration better,' the FLRAA program chief said. 'Why did they like it? It was more comfortable, it was faster. They weren't tripping over each other.' Work on the internal configuration is not just limited to the arrangements of the passenger seats. There is the matter of where crew chiefs and other crew members will sit, as well as the positioning of weapons for self-defense. As seen below, the mock-ups the Army used in the tests in Hawaii had a crew-operated 7.62x51mm M240H machine gun mounted in a window on the side of the fuselage similar to the arrangement on the service's existing Black Hawks. US Army Spc. Charles Clark Poquette said today that the configuration of the controls and other features in the FLRAA's cockpit will also be different compared to how things are laid out on the V-280. The Army has been conducting other similar testing with units beyond the 25th Infantry Division. Other experimentation to help lay the groundwork for the future fielding of the FLRAA is already well underway, as you can read more about here. A so-called 'virtual prototype' has been helping personnel get a more hands-on look at FLRAA even before the first real aircraft is built. 'A virtual prototype is similar to a simulator, to the average person it is a simulator, but it's a little more fidelity than that,' according to Col. Poquette. 'It really involves using the software that is going to be in the aircraft, coupling that with a model, or what we call a dynamics model, of how the aircraft flies and how it reacts to conditions and inputs.' As can be seen in the picture below from the testing involving the mock-up earlier this in Hawaii, the Army has also been using augmented reality to give personnel a more in-depth experience so they can provide better feedback. US Army Spc. Charles Clark All of the initial FLRAA user testing and experimentation is particularly important given that the FLRAA is set to be the first-ever operational tiltrotor aircraft in the U.S. Army's inventory and is expected to be a major transformational moment in its history. This will require the service's pilots, especially, to learn entirely new skills sets and concepts of operations. 'How do I do an air assault with an aircraft that's going nearly 300 knots? That's something that Army aviators have never done before&#8230; as far as I know. It's a different mindset,' Poquette explained. 'We are helicopter pilots. &#8230; it's [FLRAA] only a helicopter for like takeoff and land. That's the whole point.' 'The Marine Corps does this. The Air Force Special Operations [Command] does. So we spend a lot of time with them on the program,' he continued. 'I know there is a plan to familiarize Army rotary pilots [with tiltrotors]. We have the V-22, the V-22 is a tiltrotor. So I've already started meeting Army aviators who have experience in the V-22. I just hired an experimental test pilot who is qualified in the V-22. So we're starting to build up the familiarity with a technology that the Army is just not really using.' A US Air Force Special Operations Command CV-22 Osprey. USAF A stock picture of a US Air Force CV-22B Osprey. USAF Bell, together with Boeing, developed the V-22 Osprey, which continues to be a controversial aircraft with a complicated track record. This was underscored by a fatal crash last year that led to virtually all of those aircraft being grounded for some three months. Work is still underway to address the root causes of that mishap and get Marine, Navy, and Air Force V-22 fleets back to their prior operational tempos. The V-280 and the FLRAA derived from it are clean-sheet Bell developments that differ greatly from the Osprey, as The War Zone has explored in detail before. The Army has also previously said that it is already looking toward future FLRAA variants with new and improved capabilities. The service has long touted its key demand that FLRAA use a modular open-architecture approach as making it easier to integrate new systems and functionality onto the aircraft in the future, something that officials at AUSA reiterated today. High-fidelity modeling and other digital engineering tools are also being actively employed now to help refine the baseline FLRAA design. The U.S. military continues to put heavy emphasis on digital engineering, especially in helping to avoid potentially costly issues down the road, despite growing internal and external assessments that the value of these techniques has at least been over-hyped. 'One of the things I try to impress upon people is budgets are tight. FLRAA is expensive. It's the largest program in Army history,' Col. Poquette stressed today. 'We can't afford to make a big mistake. &#8230; we can't afford to build the wrong thing. We can't build four or eight prototypes that miss the mark on the thing that's important to the Army.' US Army soldiers 'board' a FLRAA mock-up at Redstone Arsenal in Alabama. US Army Program Executive Office, Aviati As of this year, the estimated total development cost for FLRAA is approximately $652 million, according to the Government Accountability Office. It could ultimately cost the Army around $70 billion to also acquire as many as 2,000 of the tiltrotors and sustain them across decades of expected service life. Tiltotor aircraft development, in general, has historically involved significant risk and FLRAA's ongoing development comes as expected future battlefield realities also continue to evolve. If all goes according to plan now, the Army will have largely finalized all the changes to its future FLRAA tilt-rotors from the V-280 design by the middle of next year, a key step forward toward getting the transformational aircraft into production and operational service.

Leonardo DRS Gives Details On Its Directed-Energy Counter-Drone S...	The War Zone met up with Leonardo DRS’ Ed House and Blue Halo’s Trip Ferguson at the Association of the United States Army’s biggest annual symposium, AUSA ‘24, which is currently underway in Washington, D.C. to get all the details on the new Counter-Uncrewed Aerial Systems Directed Energy (C-UAS DE) Stryker. You can read our initial report on the armored vehicle that is bristling with counter-drone capabilities here, but House and Ferguson put much more color on the canvas for us in terms of exactly what their creation is capable of and where it will sit in a forces’ air defense force structure. Check it out in the video posted at the top of the story. Background: The new C-UAS DE Stryker is armed with a 26-kilowatt version of the LOCUST laser directed energy weapon from BlueHalo, installed on a retractable mount. It’s also equipped with laser-guided 70mm rockets, a 30mm XM914 automatic cannon that fires proximity burst shells, an M240 machine gun, a potent counter-drone electronic warfare suite, radars, electronic surveillance measures, and other sensors and communications gear. Combined, it’s a feature-packed, multi-layer, counter-drone-optimized, short-range air defense battery that can spot, track, and defeat drones — both kinetically and non-kinetically. All of this is packed into a fast-moving armored vehicle that can easily keep up with the troops it is tasked with protecting. The U.S. Army is looking to significantly grow its short-range air defense capabilities in the coming years, especially to counter the ballooning threat from drones, and the service is specifically interested in directed energy options. Leonardo DRS led a team that developed this unique Stryker variant that included seven other partners – BlueHalo, EOS Defense Systems USA, Northrop Grumman, BAE Systems, Arnold Defense, AMPEX, and Digital Systems Engineering. It took this eclectic consortium just eight months from design, build, and test, to culminate in a live fire exercise at the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico that resulted in multiple drones being swatted out of the sky. Now, after unveiling their creation at AUSA ‘24, C-UAS DE Stryker is heading to more trials.	https://www.twz.com/sponsored-content/leonardo-drs-gives-details-on-its-directed-energy-counter-drone-stryker	2024-10-16T12:09:16-07:00	https://www.twz.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/ldrs-ls-stryker-atemrtc-3034-edited-copy.jpg?quality=85
Aerovironment’s New P550 Flies Five Hours On A Charge, Drops Two-...	AeroVironment on Monday unveiled its new drone that can tote weapons and conduct surveillance for up to five hours on a single charge as the company vies for a spot in the Army’s Long-Range Reconnaissance program. The P550, a highly modular battery-powered unmanned aerial system that can take off and land vertically and is able to carry up to 15 pounds of munitions and sensors, made its debut at the Association of the U.S. Army’s annual meeting in Washington. It’s a fresh entrant in a fast-paced competition that looks to improve soldiers’ real-time battlefield awareness at relatively low cost. 'There are things that fly as long, there are things that carry as much, but there's nothing that does both of that … without being fueled in some manner,' Product Line Manager Cris Cornell said Monday. 'There's nothing on the market performing like that in this space.' Soldiers already use small drones like AeroVironment’s hand-launched RQ-11 Raven for battlefield recon. But the LRR program — part of a broader effort to expand the Army’s arsenal of small drones capable of operating at various altitudes and ranges — promises to bring on a new generation of easily transportable drones that can strike targets while relaying combat data back to troops. The reusable P550 builds on the company’s Raven and Puma drones but adds VTOL capability and room for heavier payloads. Measuring about 17 feet wide, 9 feet long and weighing up to 55 pounds, the Group 2 UAS is designed to be a light lift on the battlefield, easy to assemble and simple to operate and upgrade. That wingspan allows the P550 to ferry multiple weapons and sensors at once, in an expansion of capability over AeroVironment’s existing designs. Rachel Cohen/TWZ The war in Ukraine has proven that the U.S. must adopt a strike role for its growing arsenal of small drones to remain lethal and relevant, Cornell said. 'You’ve got to be able to carry stuff — and not just stuff, you’ve got to be able to carry munitions,' Cornell said. The P550 can fly with the GPS-guided Shryke, a munition weighing less than 2.5 pounds developed by L3Harris and Corvid Technologies; Cornell said the company is exploring other options as well. The display at AUSA showed the drone’s fuselage outfitted with a surveillance payload, a signals-intelligence payload and a communications payload to demonstrate its ability to handle multiple missions compared to its predecessors. Rachel Cohen/TWZ Each aircraft can automatically recognize and catagorize targets, freeing up soldiers who would otherwise sift through imagery and other data for hours each day, and transmit that information via data link. It can also save its findings for later in case enemy jamming prevents it from sending the data in real time or for when emissions control is critical to survival. As the data link market has expanded, it’s become more feasible to design a drone that can connect anywhere — unlike the P550’s predecessors and older legacy systems, said Trace Stevenson, AeroVironment’s senior vice president of uncrewed systems. That relies on a modular open systems approach that aims to keep today’s UAS flexible in combat and could stop it from becoming obsolete in a matter of months or a handful of years. AeroVironment in April announced it had partnered with Parry Labs to design the P550’s software and plug-and-play mission systems. 'It's radio-agnostic, payload-agnostic and [ground control station]-agnostic,' Stevenson said. 'We have the common standards that allow the customer to determine what they want to put on the platform. As technology evolves, it'll be able to incorporate any of those … battery packs, payloads, ground control stations going forward.' That’s another lesson learned from Ukraine, Cornell said: '[The battlefield] changes so fast, and you have to have your system set up to be able to adapt to it.' Aerovironment Soldiers don’t need tools to assemble or disassemble the P550; the drone breaks down into three cases that can be tossed on the back of a Joint Light Tactical Vehicle or packed up as part of a larger pallet of equipment. Battalions can be 'up and flying in under 10 minutes and have eyes on top of them out to 40 km-plus range' to scout out a route ahead, watch enemy movement and more, Cornell said. 'We can do searches, map an area, find out where all the targets are, pass those targets to different elements,' he said. Rachel Cohen/TWZ The P550 has already begun flight testing and demonstrations for potential customers. In January 2023, the Army called on industry to offer options for a drone that could vertically take off and land and collect intelligence over nearly 19 miles and at least five hours in flight. The service plans to tap two vendors to mature their designs within the next few months before picking a winner, Stevenson said. Budget documents project it will begin buying the aircraft in fiscal 2027. The Army looks to buy upward of 600 drones for LRR, Cornell said. Soldiers could use a few in tandem to monitor a larger area, but aren’t likely to deploy them in groups of dozens at a time, he added. Officials across the military want to buy legions of drones, large and small, to grow the number of eyes in the sky and multiply their strike capability while sparing fewer dollars to replace a more advanced aircraft if it goes down. Stevenson said the company is preparing to build thousands of P550s each year. The AeroVironment reps declined to answer how much the UAS costs per unit.

Shield AI Looks To Unleash Its Hivemind Autonomy Software On Mult...	Artificial Intelligence (AI) is touching our lives in varying forms every day and that is only set to accelerate. It is also becoming a massive growth sector in the defense industry. It is posited by friends and adversaries alike that whoever can possess AI supremacy will have a huge advantage on tomorrow’s battlefield. Defense contractor Shield AI has established a firm footing at the bleeding edge, using AI-infused cognitive autonomy to enhance military capability. The company has developed its own family of small quadcopters that use its AI algorithms to efficiently sweep buildings for threats, and its larger drone known as V-BAT that can launch vertically, transition to forward flight, and operate as part of an automated swarming team. Shield AI says its autonomy is designed to be sufficiently versatile to be platform agnostic, meaning that it can be scaled and implemented across an infinite number of different platforms, and not just those in its own stable. NATO defines autonomy as a system's ability to function without outside intervention based on acquired knowledge and situational awareness. Within this, there are two main types when it comes to applying AI to military weapon systems: platform and mission autonomy. Platform autonomy focuses on self-management tasks like flight, navigation, and communication, as well as handling functions such as takeoff, landing, and fault detection. Mission autonomy, however, is more advanced, enabling systems to execute complex tasks, make tactical decisions, and seamlessly coordinate with other systems in dynamic environments. Shield AI's V-BAT drone employs Hivemind autonomy. Shield AI The War Zone sat down with Shield AI’s vice president of engineering for Hivemind, Christian Gutierrez, who is in charge of autonomy engineering and Shield AI’s vision of steadily expanding through integration on an increasing variety of military platforms. TWZ: Before we dive into Shield AI’s autonomy, and specifically your Hivemind product, can you outline your background and technical specializations that you bring to Shield AI? Gutierrez: Well, I started my career as an avionics technician in the U.S. Air Force, working on F-117 Nighthawks and then F-16 Vipers that I deployed with to Iraq back in 2005. I also worked command and control, and battle management for NORAD [North American Aerospace Defense Command] in the Homeland defense alert mission. I then joined Lockheed Martin’s Skunk Works as an embedded software engineer working on a critical development program for future-generation aircraft and ground systems. That work included a lot of development testing in that realm before I transitioned to human space flight and deep space missions with my work being focused on software and navigation, learning about the hostility of deep space. Then I became the chief of systems engineering for a family of hypersonic missiles. In that role, I led electrical mechanical ordnance propulsion and the whole lifecycle of the systems. That program ran from inception, through capture, design development, and multiple flight tests for many customers including the U.S. Army and the Navy. All of that experience led me to my current role with Shield AI and our vision of deploying our AI [artificial intelligence] solution across a host of platforms and domains. Right now we’re focused on the air segment, but we're already growing and scaling to expand into different domains such as maritime. We see our success in this industry surrounding our ability to develop the capability to suit the varying needs of different warfighters. TWZ: Can you give us your take on the expansion of autonomy in the military space and explain Shield AI’s approach to mission autonomy, and the opportunities this creates. Gutierrez: When I was at Lockheed Martin – as a platform provider – we started touching on the early phases of what we call platform autonomy, so for example, an autopilot with enhanced features. Since that time a clear bifurcation between platform autonomy and mission autonomy has developed. Think of the latter as a valuable blend of a mission planner and a pilot. Shield AI’s Hivemind autonomy can help companies that excel in developing and building platforms to push the envelope through the employment of mission autonomy. There has to be maturity in both the platform and the autonomy so that we can collectively execute this successfully. In terms of challenges, we need alignment and standards to be fully established around autonomy, much like the automotive industry has done. That will allow us to make aligned progress ahead of our adversaries. At a high level, we think there is industry consensus on the split between mission and platform autonomy. We are working with industry partners to promote understanding of where this lies in terms of defining those levels of autonomy. At Shield AI we are sending a strong message around establishing and maintaining stringent industry standards. We know what they are for automotive, and leaders of AI and autonomy, and the world's leading defense contractors, are now working together to define the standards for our industry. Shield AI is focused on building trust with our customers and developing relationships. That is formed around clearly understanding concepts of operations, understanding the operational needs of different theaters, and understanding the limitations of technology that currently exists. Then we can start to help advance those technologies with our technology. Success in the defense industry is relatively straightforward – it’s the ability to develop and deliver for the warfighter. So first you have to understand what it is the warfighter needs. For that, Shield AI has recruited industry experts to help us shape our operational analysis and our understanding of exactly what is needed. It’s then about having the required expertise to take it through development, integration, and testing. We also need to be very direct with how we regulate all of this and ensure we have the right certification and standards in place. TWZ: Could you share examples of mission autonomy in action? Any real-world wins that demonstrate the effectiveness of your autonomy software and how these successes have shaped your strategy? Gutierrez: Mission autonomy is real – this isn’t theory or PowerPoint. Our technical approach is informed by our experiences with Hivemind, which started out in our small Nova quadcopter drones from 2018. This was years before most people had even heard of mission autonomy. Since then we've been scaling up to Group 3 unmanned air vehicles such as V-BAT and we're doing it seamlessly thanks to how we have developed our Hivemind software stack, which was developed from the outset to be extensible and modular. Our software stack is about perception, cognition, and action. We perceive something, we identify it, then we take action. Hivemind runs through our V-BAT unmanned system, and it has been proven in projects such as the X-62A VISTA [Variable-stability In-flight Simulator Test Aircraft] where we were in complete control of maneuvering an F-16 fighter and showcasing that we could go head-to-head with crewed fighters in dogfights. The X-62A VISTA used Hivemind autonomy to fly the aircraft – a modified F-16. Shield AI We've got several flight tests that we are currently running, including showcasing operations in denied environments. That’s exercising our state estimation algorithms – which is about aggregating data from various sensors to establish where the platform is at in terms of state, so the platform can continue its mission. We also recently completed live fly testing with two Kratos MQM-178 Firejets and two crewed chase aircraft. That testing was about proving the ability to operate what we call intelligent mass, that means crewed and uncrewed platforms coming together and breaking apart at will. That was a huge accomplishment in a first-of-its-kind test. The team is extraordinarily excited about that because we are developing and maturing our technology and it's a huge win at the Group 5 unmanned level. You can read more about this here. TWZ: Can you explain how Hivemind can support enhancements in different platforms? Gutierrez: It goes back to that bifurcation of platform autonomy and mission autonomy. In the military aviation world, the platforms have to fly. But they also have to accomplish a mission, and that's where we come in – where our Hivemind autonomy stack can accomplish a mission. For example, military combat platforms typically have a set of sensors and a feed from those sensors. So, they might need to locate a target. We take those inputs and use AI to make decisions. The decisions being made can be as complex as working out a location or finding an object or target. When we talk about our AI in air platforms, the natural immediate thought is that it's a pilot. That’s right in part, because yes, the AI is flying the aircraft, but that is only a very small part of what you're doing. It's actually the mission side of it that's more of a critical area. You're relying on the platform autonomy to fly the aircraft, and the mission autonomy is telling it to bank and maneuver and climb, etc, to achieve the mission objectives. On the VISTA program we were closer to the control part, the stick controls and things like that to actually fly the actual airplane. But that’s not really the environment we are focused on, it’s much more about the mission autonomy. We aren’t building a bespoke solution that only meets the needs of one platform, and we definitely don’t want it to be locked down in that way. We need to offer modularity, the ability to scale across different platforms in any class or group, adaptability, and interoperability. We need to be able to scale across maritime, space, missile defense, you name it, applying government standards of open architecture so we can operate within anybody's environment via a set of tooling. That means you can generate an AI pilot for example, and we can license that tool suite so a customer can either maintain what we generated for them or develop their own AI for whatever segment or platform they have in mind. A platform manufacturer can come to us as world renowned experts in AI and software development and we can work with them to help develop their own solution for their fleet of aircraft. So, we get away from that vendor lock situation by being open and able to integrate on any system or within any business model. We essentially license our software to them and then work as a partner. This way they get full access to the system, and they are able to do some development themselves. The U.S. government really wants to show that suppliers are integrating with a host of industry partners and that you can deliver a product that’s not solely controlled and owned by the prime contractor. A way of doing that is to expose the interfaces to ensure that everyone has access. That's exactly what we do with our solution. Our bread and butter is the underlying algorithms that generate that AI effect, and it can then be customized as required to meet needs and missions. Shield AI recently completed highly-successful tests with its AI embedded in Kratos Firejets. Shield AI TWZ: What are the key factors that differentiate Shield AI from competitors, especially in terms of your technology? Gutierrez: You have reference architecture, which is the pilot. The core reference implementation is the Intellectual Property [IP], which is all the underlying algorithms, then you have the enterprise, that’s the tooling. Our middleware strategy with industry compliance and modular design enables rapid customization. Having middleware allows you to integrate in a host of hardware environments. It doesn't mean you account for all of them, and that’s why we're also investing in our own computer hardware so that we can offer to work in their hardware environment, or we can bring our own computer box. That middleware is critical, and we've invested in it over the years. We can adapt to any platform with any sensor and with any mission with ease, and we can do it ourselves, or we can enable that provider to do it themselves. That's a huge differentiator. We can show a customer how to do one example and then they can take over and continue to execute while we provide support. That approach seems to really resonate with the customer. The goal is to be able to integrate Hivemind into any hardware environment that a platform provider has. If the environment isn't suitable, for example it doesn't have enough compute, or it doesn't have the power, then we can provide our own ‘compute box.’ We can speak whatever protocol the platform might have, be it MIL-STD-1553 or whatever, there's all kinds of protocols on board these platforms. So having a compute box that can speak to many interfaces is hugely important and just the kind of detail that we think through to ensure that it is a low bar to entry with platform providers. We talk a lot about reinforcement learning and the AI technologies and techniques that we use to conduct a mission. How we learn from the mission, adapt it and then redeploy it onto a platform within hours. Then there's the stack of the cognition, perception, and action, which is tied to our task and behavior model which mimics human behavior. With the VISTA tests, and what we have just seen with Firejet, we are leaps ahead of everyone else. With Firejet, the customer said that was the best flight performance they’d seen. The maneuverability, everything, just went phenomenally well. We know that it is the best, but we also know the hard work that went into it and our competitors have a lot to do to keep up with us, but competition keeps us on the edge of our seats. TWZ: Modern flight tests are very rigorous. Do you see autonomy working in the same boundaries or do you foresee a need to rewrite the rulebook to be more agile? Gutierrez: I think the rulebook is being rewritten as we speak. We are at the bleeding edge and forcing regulators to catch up. Shield AI holds unique expertise in this industry, and our experts are able to explain the intent and then work with customers to shape test plans and meet criteria. We are hiring industry experts especially in mission planning airworthiness certification, which is a huge piece for us – managing FAA regulations, safety boards, and those kinds of areas. Also, professionals with a test and integration background, plus experts in modeling and simulation as well as operational analysis. Shield AI experts are working closely with the military and other industry partners. Shield AI The operational analysis, integration, and test modeling and simulation create that trifecta needed to successfully navigate operational test and evaluation and to build trust with your customer. You must have that pedigree of testing, especially for that kind of automated testing. It’s imperative that we show our customers that we understand how to develop and integrate with complex weapons systems. We are also talking about the definitions of the levels of autonomy, which hasn't been formally written down, so it’s difficult for certification boards to say whether you meet the intent and criteria. We are defining this and applying the tried and trusted methods that we're adopting. I mean, we don’t see a need to reinvent the wheel, just automate it. Adapting to what we see in the field is critical, making fixes, then getting it through testing fast. We must shorten that timeline. Historically, it’s taken months before a patch is deployed, and we want to get these upgrades out into the field within hours. We need to be audacious. TWZ: How do you envision Shield AI’s technologies and products complementing those of prime contractors or aircraft builders? Gutierrez: Traditionally, having a gap in capability leads to investing a ton of money to develop a very exquisite system. Once that system is finally operational, it may no longer be relevant. We've wrapped up the war in the Middle East and now we have a problem in the South China Sea, so a platform designed for one may no longer be effective for the other. That’s where Shield AI comes in and makes a weapon system more effective. For example, we can increase range. That’s not fuel range, but operating range, mission effectiveness range, advancing capabilities and technologies. We are not pitching our capabilities as a threat to industry, but as a vital partner to success. The bigger the partner and platform portfolio, the more powerful Shield AI’s value proposition becomes through the embedding of our Hivemind software. For example, the need to address stand-off in the South China Sea when a platform cannot penetrate. We can look at the set of problems around that penetration and develop a set of technologies to help overcome deficiencies in maybe something that has changed since the original requirements were set. Traditionally, this might necessitate a new aircraft or a different block upgrade, which equates to billions of dollars of investment. Shield AI can assess the issue and potentially help with a solution. It’s not easy to just drop in new hardware, but our compute hardware is super lightweight and small and it is absolutely able to make these more intelligent systems. TWZ: Can you explain how Shield AI autonomy can enhance platforms right now. Gutierrez: We talk about coming in as a software upgrade not hardware. They are currently limited to platform autonomy because they don’t have the technology to do the mission autonomy. Particularly with regard to unmanned systems, it's critically important to be able to push the envelope there. If you think of crewed aircraft such as the F-35, for example, a Shield AI solution could be configurable as a co-pilot. There’s a lot of things we can do to help protect the asset. You could enable cognitive behavior within your electronic warfare sensor suite. There might be signals that are not recognized, that haven't been registered before and you need to come back and send the signal out to somebody to process and then have a new jamming effect drawn up and then implemented. We could automatically update the mission data in flight, there and then, and the system would learn from it. That could continue exponentially. Shield AI says that it's autonomy could be used in the F-35, for example. Jamie Hunter TWZ: Looking forward, how do you see Shield AI’s approach to mission autonomy evolving? Gutierrez: We're trailblazing here and frankly ahead of what people can wrap their head around. We have to demonstrate our credentials, and we have to do all this ethically and partner with the right agencies. When we talk about working at the edge, we are talking about no communications – it’s the platform and its mission autonomy. So, how do you ensure it’s still doing the right things that you wanted it to do? We're currently working through that with a really slick solution that ensures there's essentially a third voter. Sort of like an arbitrator. It’s something that we're actively working on right now. It’s going to build great trust with our customers. It's not even the way it will monitor and ensure the location we want our platform to be at, it’s about keeping what we're doing safe and it's within the boundaries of the mission profile. TWZ: In terms of mission technology that’s developing fast, I’d assume Ukraine is a big focus right now? Gutierrez: We're keeping a close eye on what's going on there. We're seeing firsthand some of the technologies that are being employed by the Russians. The agility and speed to adapt and iterate has been shown to be critical, particularly in denied environments. It’s easy to see how you might initially enter an environment like that and operate effectively. But maybe just a few days later the adversary has adapted to throw your sensors off. You need to adapt, evolve, and that’s where we can help. But you can’t teach a system that’s not there. If you don’t have the hardware in the first place you cannot have an effect. That’s why we are not a threat to the platform, we're a partner capability enhancer. TWZ: In the next five years, what do you think will surprise people about developments in autonomy for aircraft, and perhaps other types of platforms. Gutierrez: We are assimilating a body of industry experts, and we've got fantastic leads and opportunities that will help us to address gaps in maritime operations, for example, be that surface or subsurface or within the space domain, within missile defense. There are legacy systems out there that need life extension, that next-generation capability and we are actively expanding into those market spaces. The definition of what cognitive autonomy is will be fully defined, and we will be at the bleeding edge of it. We have also been very thoughtful about awarding certification and about safety. We've also been very thoughtful about how we integrate into existing or developing platforms with our own compute hardware or our middleware. So, you're going to see Shield AI proliferate across many domains. Cognitive autonomy will become more understood and widely embraced, so in five years if we’re only talking about aircraft flying with our autonomy I would be surprised!

Australia To Send M1 Abrams Tanks To Ukraine	Australia will provide Ukraine with 49 M1A1 Abrams main battle tanks, a significant boost for Kyiv’s armored units, as they continue to face down Russia’s full-scale invasion. The announcement comes amid lingering questions about the effectiveness of the Abrams tanks that have already been supplied to Ukraine, including reports from this summer suggesting they had been briefly withdrawn from combat operations. We can’t confirm they actually were withdrawn, and surviving examples have meanwhile been upgraded, reflecting their continued relevance. Pat Conroy, Australia’s Minister for Defense Industry and Capability Delivery, told the press today that the surplus M1A1s would be transferred to Ukraine, ending a long period of speculation about their fate. The tanks have an estimated value of $164 million and bring total Australian military assistance to Ukraine to more than $1.3 billion. A formal announcement about the transfer will be made tomorrow, at the meeting of NATO defense ministers in Brussels. An Australian Army M1A1 Abrams tank from the 2nd Cavalry Regiment and an Australian Army soldier from the 3rd Battalion, The Royal Australian Regiment during Exercise Brolga Sprint 24 at Townsville Field Training Area, Queensland, in June 2024. Australian Department of Defense TPR Dana Millington 'These tanks will deliver more firepower and mobility to the Ukrainian Armed Forces, and complement the support provided by our partners for Ukraine for Ukraine’s armored brigades,' Conroy said in a statement. 'We stand shoulder-to-shoulder with Ukraine in their fight against Russia’s illegal invasion,' Conroy added. Since the tanks were originally sold to Australia by the United States, Washington had to approve the transfer to Ukraine. In an interview with ABC, Ukraine’s ambassador to Australia Vasyl Myroshnychenko described the tank transfer as a 'significant contribution' to Ukraine’s war effort. The development also marks a U-turn by the Australian government. Earlier this year, Australian Minister for Defense Richard Marles said that providing the tanks to Ukraine was 'not on the agenda.' Kyiv had previously requested that Australia consider providing it with Abrams tanks, as well as other heavy weapons. In the past, we pointed out how the upgraded former Australian F/A-18A/B Hornet fleet could be very useful for Ukraine, after which Ambassador Myroshnychenko confirmed to TWZ that Ukraine was indeed exploring if the fighters could be suitable for its very pressing needs. Since then, there have not been any further developments in this area, as far as we know. Also on Kyiv’s list was Australia’s fleet of 45 MRH90 Taipan helicopters, withdrawn last year after repeated cost increases, fleet groundings, and two major crashes. You can read more about that here. An Australian Army MRH90 Taipan at Townsville Field Training Area, Townsville, Queensland. Australian Department of Defense An Australian Army MRH90 Taipan from the 5th Aviation Regiment lands as part of air mobility operations with the 3rd Battalion, The Royal Australian Regiment on Exercise Brolga Run 23 at Townsville Field Training Area, Townsville, Queensland. COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA, DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE In the event, rather than donate the helicopters, Australia decided to strip them of valuable parts and bury them. Canberra’s decision to now provide the Abrams tanks should at least help assuage Ukraine’s disappointment in not securing the Taipans. On the other hand, it should also be noted that the age of the surplus M1A1s means that it might not be possible to put them all into service. Some may well also have to be reduced to spare parts if they are otherwise deemed too worn-out for frontline use. The Australian Army is able to give up its M1A1 fleet as it’s now receiving 75 new M1A2 Abrams, in the highly capable SEPv3 variant. You can read more about Australia’s $2.5-billion M1A2 acquisition here. One of the first M1A2 Abrams tanks for the Australian Army on display at the Land Forces Melbourne 2024 exhibition earlier this year. Australian Department of Defense Cpl Michael Currie Australia also confirmed that a small number of its 59 old tanks — 10 in total — will be retained to assist in the transition to the new tanks. It’s unclear if these will be used permanently for training or testing purposes or if they will also head to Ukraine later. Ukraine previously received 31 M1A1 tanks from the United States. The first of these had arrived in the country at least by September of last year, although the first video showing one of the tanks in action on the front lines didn’t emerge until February of this year. While the arrival of the U.S.-supplied Abrams in Ukraine came amid much fanfare, an apparent first loss of an M1A1, also in February, led to questions being raised about just how survivable these tanks are on the country’s highly contested battlefields. Imagery captured from a drone that looks to show one of Ukraine’s prized U.S.-supplied M1A1 Abrams tanks having suffered significant damage. via X Initially, it seems that the M1A1s were deployed mainly around Avdiivka, the key city in the eastern Donbas region, which was captured by Russian forces in mid-February. By May of this year, Ukrainian M1A1 were starting to get production-standard anti-drone armor screens, also commonly known as 'cope cages,' on their turrets. The modified Abrams also started receiving additional explosive reactive armor (ERA). A Ukrainian M1A1 Abrams with anti-drone armor screens on its turret. Metinvest Since then even more extreme modifications have surfaced, with one configuration including new plate armor and other additions. Via X Nevertheless, as losses continued to mount, unconfirmed reports emerged in the spring suggesting that Ukraine had withdrawn its M1A1s from frontline operations. By that time, five of the 31 tanks were confirmed as having been lost to Russian attacks. It was said that the reason for the withdrawal was the tank’s vulnerability to drone attacks, although the reasoning was somewhat hazy. As TWZ speculated at the time, it seems more likely that if the tanks were pulled it was because they are considered especially valuable assets, and having more examples knocked out — or, worse still, captured — by Russia would be an unpleasant propaganda and materiel loss for Kyiv. Preserving the dwindling force for when it was needed most and quickly upgrading them with additional protection could have also been a real factor. A knocked-out and captured Ukrainian M1A1 Abrams tank at an exhibition of trophy military equipment in Moscow, which opened on May 1, 2024. Photo by Vlad Karkov/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images SOPA Images Whatever the reasoning, and the reality of the supposed ‘combat pause,’ the U.S.-supplied M1A1s have recently been in the thick of the action, including contributing to the Ukrainian incursion into Russia’s Kursk region, which began in early August. Also involved have been examples of Ukraine’s other higher-end tank types, including the Challenger 2, Leopard 2, and T-80. A video from the fighting in Kursk from August showed the destruction of another M1A1, which brought the total losses to 16, according to the Oryx open-source tracking group — over half the force. While tank losses are always to be expected, especially during breakthrough operations and when faced with a proliferation of attack drones as well as relentless Russian artillery, questions about the Ukrainian Abrams have refused to go away. Ukrainian personnel interviewed by Western media outlets have raised concerns about the U.S.-made tank’s reliability and its vulnerability to Russian attacks. Explosive reactive tiles attached to a Ukrainian M1A1 Abrams. Unknown author/Twitter/X screencap Nevertheless, there’s no doubt that the M1A1 remains a very useful weapon and one that Ukraine only wants more of. This is especially the case now, as it begins to lose some ground to the larger Russian force. Kyiv is also still feeling the effects of the months-long pause on deliveries of military hardware from the United States after the funding available for security assistance to Ukraine ran out. The United States has so far not signaled that it’s willing to send more Abrams tanks to Ukraine even as they continue to commit to fielding more Bradley Fighting Vehicles. This makes today’s announcement from Australia all the more welcome for Ukraine. While we don’t yet know when the Australian-provided Abrams tanks will start to arrive in Ukraine, they will, at the very least, bolster what was always a fairly tokenistic force, in terms of numbers of vehicles. At the same time, increasing M1A1 numbers and growing experience with these tanks may yet see them finally overturn persisting doubts around their usefulness.

Army Looking To Shrink Typhon Missile System After Lessons Learne...	The U.S. Army is already interested in scaling down its new Typhon ground-based missile system, if possible, to help make it easier to deploy and operate. The service only sent Typhon, which currently uses large tractor-trailer launchers to fire Tomahawk cruise missiles and SM-6 multi-purpose missiles, overseas for the first time to the Philippines earlier this year. Typhon, also known as the Mid-Range Capability (MRC), was among the topics of discussion at a panel talk centered on the Army's new Multi-Domain Task Forces (MTDF) at the Association of the U.S. Army's (AUSA) main annual conference earlier today. Typhon is a key component of the current approved force structure for the service's three MDTFs. In addition to Typhon, each of the task forces is set to eventually incorporate units armed with the Dark Eagle hypersonic missiles and the Precision Strike Missile (PrSM) short-range ballistic missiles, as well as a variety of air and missile defense, counter-drone, electronic warfare, and other advanced capabilities. A Typhon launcher in the Philippines. US Army 'So, the Mid-Range Capability, we fielded it, we have put it into the theater, but we're learning lessons on how we can improve the next evolutions of that,' Army Col. Michael Rose, commander of the 3rd MDTF headquartered at Fort Shafter in Hawaii, said today at AUSA. 'How do we make it more mobile? How do we make it smaller? How do we make it more agile? How do we employ it most effectively and how do we sustain it? A lot of those lessons are feeding back into our RDT&E [research, development, test, and evaluations] and acquisitions professionals to improve and enhance that new operational capability.' Rose did not elaborate further, but it is not hard to see how Typhon's current configuration, which is technically road-mobile and air-transportable, might present certain operational limitations. At the core of a typical Typhon battery at present are four trailer-based launchers, each towed by an 8&#215;8 tractor from the Heavy Expanded Mobility Tactical Truck (HEMTT) family. A fifth trailer, also towed by a HEMTT tractor, provides a mobile battery operations center (BOC). There are other supporting vehicles and equipment in the unit's inventory, as well. A briefing slide laying on the basic components of a typical Typhon battery. US Army It's also worth noting that each Typhon launcher, which is derived from the Mk 41 Vertical Launch System (VLS) used on various U.S. and foreign warships, can only hold up to four missiles at a time. As such, the entire battery can fire 16 missiles before needing to reload, which requires additional vehicles and equipment. The system does offer a wide breadth of capabilities given the abilities of the Tomahawk and the SM-6 to strike targets on land and at sea. The Army has also been eying the very versatile SM-6 for potential ground-based use in its surface-to-air mode. A crane is used to maneuver a missile canister during training to reload a US Army Typhon launcher in the Philippines. US Army Capt. Ryan DeBooy The picture seen below of a Typhon launcher rolling off a U.S. Air Force C-17 during 1st MDTF's first overseas deployment of elements of the system to the Philippines in April underscores the large size of the trailer-based components and their HEMTT prime movers. US Army Air Force cargo aircraft are in high demand even in peacetime and there are concerns already about the capacity of existing fleets to meet operational needs during future conflicts, especially in a potential high-end fight in the Pacific against China. There is a also growing focus within the U.S. military on concepts of operations involving dispersing forces across a wide network of operating locations to reduce their vulnerability, and many of those sites could well be completely inaccessible to larger airlifters like the C-17. There is also the matter of increasingly more capable and longer-range air defense threats. To be fair, it would have been an easy geolocation. There are just a few 1000 m runways for a C-17 in Luzon, and the very first image showed the launcher in front of a wall we've seen before. (The US has exercised here before.) Ultimately, @USARPAC_CG released an aerial shot. pic.twitter.com/xHVw1LlAiF&mdash; Dr. Jeffrey Lewis (@ArmsControlWonk) May 26, 2024 Our friends at @planet have a really nice series of images of the 'Typhon' missile launchers that the US has temporarily deployed in the Philippines. A couple of observations. pic.twitter.com/FW9B97sAMU&mdash; Dr. Jeffrey Lewis (@ArmsControlWonk) May 26, 2024 Typhon's size and weight could limit the ability to deploy the system by sea, especially in the absence of available established port facilities, or even over land depending on the environment. Insufficiently wide and/or strong bridges are already a well-known impediment to the movement of tanks and other heavy armored vehicles. Deployment limitations, along with other factors, also impact how and where the Typhon can be employed and create potential vulnerabilities. Col. Rose and the others on the MDTF panel at AUSA today did not offer any examples of potential or notional options for how Typhon might be scaled down or otherwise improved upon. The U.S. Marine Corps, which has been completely reorganizing itself to align with new expeditionary and distributed concepts of operations, is in the process of fielding a ground-based Tomahawk cruise missile launcher mounted on an uncrewed derivative of the 4&#215;4 Joint Light Tactical Vehicle. The Marines' Long Range Fires (LRF) launcher is substantially smaller and lighter than the Typhon launcher, but also can only be loaded with a single Tomahawk at a time. A Marine Corps Long Range Fires launcher vehicle. USMC The Army has also been experimenting with an uncrewed derivative of the M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) called the Autonomous Multi-domain Launcher (AML) with a particular eye toward future dispersed operations. AML and HIMARS can both fire 227mm guided artillery rockets, as well as Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) and PRSM ballistic missiles, but, at least in their current forms, the launchers are not long enough to accommodate Tomahawk. AML might still be a starting place for a more truncated launcher for use with Typhon. HIMARS itself was originally developed as a way to fit at least some of the capabilities of the M270 Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) into a package that could squeeze inside a C-130 cargo plane. It's also worth noting here that the U.S. Navy has been experimenting with containerized Mk 70 launchers, which are very similar in form and function to the Typhon launchers and are also based on the Mk 41 VLS, in ship and ground-based configurations. However, the ground-based arrangement that has been demonstrated to date is also a relatively large tractor-trailer setup.

US Navy New, smaller missiles might be another option for scaling down Typhon. As a tangential example, the new PRSMs are notably smaller than the ATACMSs they are replacing, but offer longer range and other important capability boosts. At the same time, this would be a major shift for Typhon, especially given the investments the Army has made already in Tomahawk and SM-6. Developing something entirely new would be costly, as well. A test launch of a PRSM from a HIMARS launcher. Lockheed Martin In the meantime, Typhon has already made a significant mark in the Pacific region, being lauded by the U.S. military's counterparts in the Philippines and drawing the ire of China. The Philippine armed forces have even expressed an interest in acquiring their own Typhons. This has certainly presented a counter-example to questions raised in the past about where Typhon systems, as well as Dark Eagle hypersonic missiles, might be deployed, especially in the Pacific, at all due in part to potential resistance from allies and partners to host them. From where elements of the system are currently deployed in Northern Luzon, Typhon holds targets at risk in the southeastern end of mainland China, as well as on Hanan Island in the northern end of the South China Sea. Several Chinese man-made outposts elsewhere in the South China Sea, as well as targets at sea in the surrounding areas, would also be in range. Hainan, in particular, is home to several highly strategic naval and other bases. In September, the People's Liberation Army also conducted an extremely rare intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) launch out over the Pacific from the island. All of this is a reminder of the importance of Typhon, and being able to deploy and employ it effectively, as well as the possible vulnerabilities that might come along with the system in its current form. Typhon, as well as Dark Eagle, which could face many of the same deployability issues with its trailer-based launchers, are presently set to be low-density, high-value assets that would be prime targets for an opponent, especially in a large-scale conflict. With all this in mind, it will be interesting to see how Typhon does or doesn't evolve, size-wise in or in any other regard, based on what the Army is still learning from its early fielding of the system.

Army Already Preparing For V-280 Valor To Dramatically Transform ...	The U.S. Army doesn’t expect to get its hands on the new V-280 Valor Future Long-Range Assault Aircraft, or FLRAA, until 2030 at the earliest, but it’s already developing tactics for when the advanced tiltrotor arrives. This fact illustrates just how much of a revolution FLRAA is anticipated to bring, including entirely overhauling the speed, range, and survivability of air assault operations. Speaking earlier today at the Association of the U.S. Army’s annual symposium, Maj. Gen. Brett Sylvia, commanding general of the 101st Airborne Division, explained the degree to which FLRAA will change the way that historic division, and other Army units, will go to war. U.S. Army Brig. Gen. Brett Sylvia, at that time 1st Cavalry Division Forward commander, now the commanding general of the 101st Airborne Division, at a combined arms rehearsal in Poland, June 6, 2020. U.S. Army photo by Spc. Javan Johnson Spc. Javan Johnson The forthcoming arrival of FLRAA has led to a new concept of operations for the Army, which is now taking shape. This is Large-Scale, Long-Range Air Assault, or L2A2, and, simply put, it relies upon the new tiltrotor to be realized. As TWZ has explored in the past, the specific range and speed advantage of the V-280 Valor was very likely a significant reason why it was chosen for FLRAA ahead of Boeing’s rival SB>1 Defiant. While the engineering and manufacturing development phase for FLRAA continues, the Army is practicing the L2A2 concept using the aircraft it has on hand. According to Sylvia, L2A2 is defined by the ability to 'deliver one Brigade Combat Team in one period of darkness, over 500 miles, arriving behind enemy lines, and be able to conduct sustained combat operations.' 'We can’t do that right now is because the platforms that we have organic to the 101st are not enough in order for us to be able to do that in one period of darkness,' Sylvia added.

Jacob Derry Staff Sgt. Jacob Derry Instead, over the last 12 months, the 'The Screaming Eagles' have undertaken four exercises to explore what it takes to move a Brigade Combat Team over that distance, all the while moving exclusively at night. In the latest of these training events, the division’s 2nd Brigade Combat Team was moved to the Joint Readiness Training Center (JRTC) at Fort Johnson, Louisiana. The 101st is home-based at Fort Campbell, Kentucky, 575 miles distant, from where the simulated air assault was launched. While moving from one location to the other was achieved, it required the division to set up two mission support sites and six Forward Arming and Refueling Points (FARPs) en route to ensure the movement of the helicopter assault force. More significantly, it also required three nights in order to be able to move that entire Brigade Combat Team under the cover of darkness. Meanwhile, staffing all of the mission support sites and FARPs, as well as related security and sustainment forces, required almost a thousand soldiers.

Wes Wright The next part of the training was done as a simulation, this time involving the future Air Assault CAB, a formation created to ensure the Army can conduct L2A2. As Sylvia explained, the Air Assault CAB is going to have four times the number of heavy-lift aircraft than what he has available today, and all of the unit’s UH-60 Black Hawks will be replaced by FLRAA.

U.S. Army 'When we ran that in simulation, we were able to execute that one Brigade Combat Team move in one period of darkness, so we made our timeline,' Sylvia said. 'But the second thing, and probably more critical than that, was that we cut in half that sustainment and security that we needed. We went down to one mission support site and only three Forward Arming and Refueling Points in order to be able to execute that. I don’t think I need to tell you what that does in terms of our survivability, because of our speed and our lower signature when we can execute that.' Over the course of the next few years, the Army will continue to build its Air Assault Combat Aviation Brigade, to meet L2A2 aspirations. In the meantime, as Sylvia said, 'We are doing the things in order to be able to build the foundation so that all we have to do is just receive the aircraft and we’ll be ready to execute.' 'What we can do, is we can build the tactics, techniques, and procedures, build the doctrine, build the structures, understand the sustainment in order to be able to do that.'

(Bell) Sylvia also addressed how the Army was working to adapt how its future mission support sites and FARPs would look like so that they can survive and be effective during large-scale conflicts with peer or near-peer adversaries, including over significant distances, as will be found in the Indo-Pacific theater. Sylvia said the 101st Airborne Division’s current training is exploring changes to support sites and FARPs so they can 'operate in a semi-permissive or in a non-permissive environment.' In the future, the Army’s FARPs will have to be 'dispersed, distributed, and much smaller,' Sylvia noted. Sylvia recalled one of the exercises that explored new ways of distributing FARPs. 'We didn’t land like we traditionally do, where you go, you take over an airfield, and you park all your aircraft out there in the field. So now we are taking our aircraft, we are parking them in a very distributed manner, not on airfields. We’re camouflaging the aircraft, camouflaging the FARPs out there.'

U.S. Air Force photo by Capt. Jessica Tait Capt. Jessica Tait A resurgence in interest in camouflaging such assets to deceive opponents and otherwise help to conceal the movements and activities of friendly forces is something that we have examined in the past and is especially relevant for any future high-end fight involving the United States, such as one against China in the Pacific. Initial findings have been highly encouraging, Sylvia noted. 'During one of our exercises, when we got done afterward, and we were talking with the opposing force commander, he said, ‘Hey, I had great success in finding and targeting your FARPs.’ And I said, ‘Yeah, how many did you get?’ And he said, ‘I got two.’ I said, ‘Did you know I had nine out there?’ And he said, ‘Obviously I wasn’t as good as I thought I was.’ And so that’s the point. We do have to think about how we do these things differently. New capabilities certainly are great, but I think our tactics and techniques are the things that are going to be most effective in the near term.' A first FLRAA for the Army is expected to take to the air in 2026, with low-rate initial production slated to begin in 2028, leading to initial fielding in 2030. While the Army may be pinning its hopes of achieving Large-Scale, Long-Range Air Assault firmly on FLRAA, that doesn’t mean the UH-60 will be disappearing any time soon. A prototype V-280 Valor.

Clair Gill, Commanding General at the U.S. Army Aviation Center of Excellence and Fort Novosel, said that the future force mix will come down to the specific situation and operational demands at the time — as well as budgetary constraints. 'Would I love to put a FLRAA everywhere that there's a Black Hawk? Sure. Do I think it’s affordable? Probably not,' Gill told reporters. 'The Black Hawk is coming up on 40 years old, I believe, and my sense is the Black Hawk is going to compete with the B-52 and C-130 for going the distance. We’re going to have Black Hawks in our formation as long as any of us are reading the news.' 'I think FLRAA is going to come on.' Gill continued. 'We’re going to learn a lot about it. We’re going to scale it. We’re going to see where we are in the 2030s, once we go to full-rate production and we get that first limited test unit out, learn a lot about it, we got to figure out how we train it. We start proliferating it. And if it, if it is that game-changing technology and everybody says that we’ve got to double down, then maybe we buy more. But I think initially it’s going to be some sort of a mix, and I don’t see the Black Hawk going away.'

Thousands Of North Korean Troops To Help Russia Fight Ukraine: Re...	Thousands of North Korean troops are being trained to provide combat power in Ukraine to help Russia make up for mounting losses, according to reports. The move is part of a growing alliance between Moscow and Pyongyang that benefits both parties in several ways. 'The North Koreans will form part of the ‘Special Buryat Battalion,’ organized within the 11th Separate Airborne Assault Brigade of the Russian Armed Forces,' the Ukrainian Liga media outlet reported on Tuesday. 'The battalion is expected to include up to 3,000 North Korean troops and is currently being supplied with small arms and ammunition.' First notable glimpse at DPRK troop contribution to Russia. A 'Buryat battalion' consisting of DPRK personnel were stood up in the 11th Guards Air Assault Brigade. It’s made up of around 3,000 personnel for Ukraine’s Kursk salient. 18 members deserted. Dillon Payton (@dillonrpayton) October 15, 2024 Liga suggested that the battalion could be deployed near the Ukrainian-occupied town of Sudzha in Russia’s Kursk region, but the exact location or arrival time remains unknown. The Ukrainian Suspline news outlet suggested that there are already a number of North Korean troops there. Meanwhile, North Koreans could also find themselves fighting on Ukrainian soil, Andriy Kovalenko, head of Ukraine’s Center for Countering Disinformation, said on Telegram. Thousands of North Korean infantry soldiers are undergoing training in Russia and could be deployed to the front line in Ukraine by the end of this year, The Washington Post wrote last week, citing a Ukrainian military intelligence official. 'The official said North Korean officers are already on the ground in Russia-occupied Ukraine to observe Russian forces and study the battlefield, but Kyiv hasn’t seen any North Korean units fighting yet,' the Post reported. As we previously noted, dozens of North Koreans are behind Russian lines in Ukraine. They are operating 'in teams that support launcher systems for KN-23 [short-range ballistic] missiles,' a source in Ukraine told The Guardian last week. North Korea began supplying Russia with those missiles, also known as Hwasong-11s, but about half were defective, according to an analysis from Ukrainian state prosecutors. One report claims that 10,000 North Korean troops have been dispatched to assist Russia. North Korean troops, as we previously noted, have already been killed in Ukraine. While Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Thursday dismissed claims of Pyongyang sending military personnel to fight in Ukraine as a 'hoax,' Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky insisted that it is happening. 'We see an increasing alliance between Russia and regimes like North Korea,' Zelensky said during his evening address on Sunday. 'This is no longer just about transferring weapons. It is actually about transferring people from North Korea to the occupying military forces. Obviously, in such circumstances, our relations with partners need to develop further.' On Monday, Russian President Vladimir Putin submitted a draft law to the Russian State Duma seeking ratification of a strategic partnership between Moscow and Pyongyang, hammered in June. It calls for each side to provide military assistance to each other in the event of war. 'In the event that one of the Parties is subjected to an armed attack by a State or several States and thus finds it in a state of war, the other Party will immediately provide military and other assistance with all available means at its disposal, in accordance with Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations and in accordance with the legislation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Russian Federation,' the agreement stated. While the western world maintains a strategy of wishing it will all go away, Putin solidifies North Korea as the weapons manufacturing department of his terror coalition, submitting for ratification the mutual defense treaty between the two countries. KyivPost (@KyivPost) October 15, 2024 All this comes in the wake of North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un’s visit to Russia last year for a summit with Putin where the two men bolstered their deepening ties with a shadowy arms deal. It was reported that, among other things, it called for Pyongyang to send construction and engineering forces to Russia-occupied territories of Ukraine for rebuilding work. There was no indication of how many personnel would be involved or the exact nature of their work. It is unclear whether that actually occurred. There are several reasons why a mutual aid pact could be highly attractive to both parties. It benefits North Korea in several ways. The cash-starved nation can receive economic and military assistance from Russia by providing its biggest available resource - personnel - in return. It could also gain real-world combat experience on a relatively modern battlefield, something its troops have not had in decades. Pyongyang has already been sanctioned by the U.S. for sending forced labor to distant counties as a way of raising money for the regime. North Korean troops fighting Ukraine help Russia make up for what the Pentagon said is the loss of some 600,000 troops killed and wounded since the beginning of the all-out invasion. It also assists Putin in avoiding an unpopular larger conscription, according to the Kyiv Post, citing sources in the Ukrainian Defense Intelligence Directorate (GUR). 'Putin is doing everything possible to delay and avoid the decision to conduct a new full-fledged wave of mobilization on the territory of the Russian Federation,' the publication reported. Last month, GUR commander Lt. Gen. Kyrylo Budanov said Russia was facing a troop shortfall. 'In this period (in the summer of 2025), they will face a dilemma - either to announce mobilization or in some way it is necessary to reduce the intensity of hostilities a little, which may, in the end, be critical for them,' he said, according to the Interfax news outlet. How well North Korean troops will perform is an open question. About 18 have already fled their positions in Kursk and Bryansk, according to the Ukrainian Suspine news outlet. 18 servicemen from North Korea reportedly escaped from Russian positions on the border of Bryansk region and Kursk region, Ukraine's Suspilnyi reports, citing intelligence sources.The reasons for the escape have not been established. Russian Army has launched a search. pic.twitter.com/BMQNCxSKnL&mdash; Clash Report (@clashreport) October 15, 2024 Another huge issue is language, said Kovalenko. 'Less than 1% of the personnel officers of the army of the DPRK speak Russian,' he noted. 'This is important to understand in order to analyze the possibilities of involving these military personnel in the actions of the Russian army in the future.' North Korea is no stranger to foreign deployments. It sent a fighter squadron to back up its communist ally North Vietnam during that conflict, noted Samual Ramani, DPhil/PhD Intl Relations @UniofOxford Associate Fellow @RUSI_org and author 'Russia in Africa' and 'Putin's War on Ukraine.' It dispatched pilots to fly on Egyptian jets during the 1973 Arab-Israeli War and military trainers to back up Iran's forces during the Iran-Iraq War. 'North Korea simultaneously was carrying out an even higher intensity military campaign in Angola,' Ramani said on Twitter. 'About 3,000 North Korean troops and 1,000 advisors backed the Angolan MPLA alongside Cuba and against apartheid South Africa's forces.' Pyongyang provided military assistance to other African nations as well, including Mozambique and Zimbabwe. 'Post-Cold War, North Korea's interventions dried up but training (including allegedly of Hezbollah on tunnel building) persisted Syria was a theatre where the Chalma brigades fought on Bashar al-Assad's behalf,' Ramani wrote. North Korea has been accused of sending forces to UkraineNorth Korea has a long history of deploying forces to overseas conflictsHere's the whole history /1&mdash; Samuel Ramani (@SamRamani2) October 14, 2024 While relatively small numbers of troops from other nations help both sides in this conflict, there has been no large-scale mobilization of foreign forces for either party. North Korea sending thousands of soldiers to help Russia would be a major change in that status quo, although just how much effect they could have remains unclear.

Oshkosh Talks Its 30mm Cannon-Wielding Medium Caliber Weapon Syst...	Oshkosh Defense’s 30mm Medium Caliber Weapon System (MCWS), integrated with the Stryker Infantry Carrier Vehicle Double V Hull, offers what the company calls 'a transformative lethality solution for the U.S. Army.' Since the MCWS contract award in 2021, Oshkosh has partnered with the Army to incorporate a range of features designed specifically for the Stryker mission. The MCWS turret leverages the proven Rafael Samson Remote Weapon System and Fire Control System, providing heavy firepower with its XM813 30mm cannon and M240 coaxial weapon, as well as increased engagement range and enhanced situational awareness, all without compromising the Stryker’s mobility and survivability. The Stryker MCWS will replace the predecessor Infantry Carrier Vehicle – Dragoon (ICVD). Soldiers recently had a chance to test the MCWS during Follow-on Operational Test and Evaluation (FOT&E), which assessed operational effectiveness and suitability in realistic conditions. Oshkosh Defense is actively delivering vehicles to the U.S. Army to ensure the timely fielding to the first Stryker Brigade Combat Team (SBCT) in early 2025, marking a key milestone in the program.

Joint German-Italian Battle Tank Venture Could Shake Up European ...	Two major defense players from Italy and Germany have teamed up to build tanks and infantry fighting vehicles, initially aimed to meet the requirements of the Italian Army, but also for other customers, as armored warfare makes a resurgence in Europe and elsewhere. Under a 50:50 joint venture announced today, and following on from an earlier corresponding Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), Leonardo Rheinmetall Military Vehicles (LRMV) will develop and then build a version of Rheinmetall company’s KF51 Panther main battle tank and KF41 Lynx infantry fighting vehicle for the Italian Army. Thereafter, the two firms will market the vehicles to other potential customers. Whilst not a contract award, the establishment of the joint venture suggests it’s highly likely that the Panther and Lynx will be the platforms of choice for Italy, especially as other possible candidates have dropped out of the running. Should that happen, the two solutions from LRMV be chosen, as seems likely, the Panther will replace the Italian Army’s current fleet of locally made Ariete main battle tanks, developed in the 1980s. Italian Army Ariete tanks during an exercise at Capo Teulada in October 2022. Italian Army Meanwhile, the Lynx infantry fighting vehicle would be at the center of the Italian Army’s Armored Infantry Combat System (AICS) program, replacing the current Dardo IFVs, and surviving Cold War-era M113 armored personnel carriers. AICS is a wide-ranging effort that will eventually field as many as 16 different variants, including recovery, combat engineer, and bridge-laying vehicles. Italian Army troops exiting a Dardo infantry fighting vehicle. Italian Army The AICS also includes specialized combat vehicles, among them reconnaissance and anti-tank versions, as well as ones fitted with the Skyranger air defense system, reflecting the growing importance of short-range air defenses to deal with drones and other battlefield aerial threats. A prototype KF41 Lynx fitted with a Skyranger 30mm air defense turret. Rheinmetall Angela Micheletto LRMV determines that all its AICS vehicles will be based on the Lynx infantry fighting vehicle version, benefiting from the modular nature of its design. The AICS initiative calls for advanced features including open architecture, significant command-and-control capability, and the ability to share targeting data with a variety of other platforms. The fighting vehicles will also be expected to work alongside drones and uncrewed ground vehicles and to engage targets with different rounds, including airburst types. Scalable armor and other protective systems will defend them against improvised explosive devices, anti-tank missiles, and swarming drones, among other threats. . The Italian Army has a requirement for over one thousand AICS vehicles of all types. Reportedly, Italy plans to build 20 prototypes of the AICS by 2027 or 2028, with deliveries to begin between 2029 and 2041. Production of all vehicles for Italy — Panther and AICS — will be primarily handled at a new plant in La Spezia, Italy. This facility will be responsible for 60 percent of the manufacture of all vehicles. Italy’s Leonardo will also be responsible for the mission systems, electronics suites, and weapons integration on all vehicles ordered for the Italian Army. 'We are creating a new heavyweight in European tank production,' said Armin Papperger, CEO of Rheinmetall. 'Leonardo and Rheinmetall, two leading European suppliers of defense technology, are joining forces to carry out ambitious projects. We are primarily addressing the Italian market, but we will also be targeting other partner nations which are in need of modernizing their combat systems in the future. Rheinmetall has the perfect technologies for Italy’s requirements.' Meanwhile, Roberto Cingolani, CEO of Leonardo, described the joint venture as 'a significant step towards the creation of a European defense system based on specialized shared platforms. Rheinmetall and Leonardo aim at developing state-of-the-art technologies able to compete at international level.' A prototype KF41 Lynx with the Skyranger 30mm air defense turret. Rheinmetall Today’s announcement is also a significant turnaround for Italian Army armored vehicle development and one that could have major repercussions across the continent. Before Leonardo teamed up with Rheinmetall, it had planned to develop and build new fighting vehicles for Italy in partnership with KNDS. KNDS is a European defense company that came from the merger between Germany’s Krauss-Maffei Wegmann and France’s Nexter Systems. Under the earlier agreement, Leonardo and KNDS would have jointly produced Leopard 2 main battle tanks (originally designed by Krauss-Maffei Wegmann) for the Italian Army. Lynx KF41 infantry fighting vehicle. Rheinmetall The Italian parliament had even approved the Leopard 2 purchase, before the collapse of the partnership, which came about when KNDS reportedly rejected Leonardo’s plans to install a significant proportion of its own systems on the tanks. By going with Rheinmetall and the still-in-development KF51 Panther, Italy should be able to tailor the tank more closely to its own requirements. On the other hand, while the Leopard 2 was an off-the-shelf product that would have been able to be fielded fairly rapidly by the Italian Army, the service will have to wait longer for the Panther — perhaps as long as 10 years, according to some accounts. That long timeline also raises the possibility of a clash of rival European tank designs. While Rheinmetall introduced its Panther as a private venture project, Germany and France had meanwhile teamed up on a political level to push the development of another new main battle tank, the more ambitious Main Ground Combat System (MGCS). MGCS is set to replace German Leopard 2 and French Leclerc main battle tanks and was due to arrive in service beginning in 2035. While a technology demonstrator for the MGCS program, the Enhanced Main Battle Tank, combining Leclerc and Leopard 2 components, was unveiled in 2018, progress since then has been slow. A French Army Leclerc tank during the Strong Europe Tank Challenge co-hosted by U.S. Army Europe and the German Army, in May 2017. U.S. Army photo by Staff Sgt. Kathleen V. Polanco Staff Sgt. Kathleen Polanco A reported requirement for the MGCS is for its gun to be at least 50 percent more capable than the existing 120mm types on either the Leclerc or Leopard 2. As TWZ has discussed in the past, a larger 130mm or 140mm gun would certainly offer improved range and armor penetration capabilities. Earlier this year, KNDS rolled out a new version of the Leopard 2 with a completely uncrewed turret that can be armed with a 140mm main gun. KNDS plans to offer the tank for sale but also expects it to be a key stepping stone to the next-generation MGCS. A Leopard 2 demonstrator with an uncrewed turret armed with a 140mm main gun. KNDS Notably, the KF51 Panther is armed with a 130mm caliber main gun. Having Italy choose the Panther is a major vote of confidence that might lead to it forming the basis of the MGCS, but that might well not be a satisfying result for Krauss-Maffei Wegmann, in particular, which is currently still building the Leopard 2 and would want to stay firmly in the MBT game, perhaps with an up-gunned Leopard 2 or a derivative for MGCS. In the meantime, the value of the Italian procurement will be significant. When it was still planning to buy Leopard 2s, Italy expected the acquisition program would be worth around $8.6 billion, for 270 tanks, while another $16 billion would be invested in the AICS program.

Photo by Craig Stennett/Getty Images Craig Stennett An armored vehicle spending spree of this kind would have been surprising only a few years ago, but Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine has dramatically changed the defense and security landscape in Europe. In particular, with tank warfare being a prominent feature of the fighting in Ukraine, the idea of investing in new main battle tank fleets, as well as spending on armored fighting vehicles in general, has made a comeback. As we noted in our previous discussion of the Panther, the design of this tank seems to be especially relevant for this new era. Overall, it should be lighter and more agile than current main battle tanks, while carrying a bigger main gun, and having the ability to provide stand-in surveillance and strike with loitering munitions. This addresses some of the concerns about the vulnerability of tanks to various weapons, especially loitering munitions and first-person view (FPV) drones, which have played a prominent role in Ukraine. With Italy looking now more likely than ever to emerge as the first customer for the KF51 Panther, this may well encourage further orders for the tank, as well as for the KF41 Lynx. Meanwhile, LRMV will be paying close attention to developments in the MGCS, with the Panther now looking well-positioned to make a challenge for this highly important program, too.

'That was going to be a very expensive endeavor. &#8230; Interceptors in that family or class of interceptors are very capable, but also very expensive.' The Army had previously defined 'lower-tier' in this instance as the 'lower tier portion of the ballistic missile defense battlespace' and described the LTFI as being set to help 'increase Air and Missile Defense (AMD) capability through increased velocity, altitude, and maneuverability.' Lozano did not elaborate on cost, but the unit price of a PAC-3 Missile Segment Enhancement (MSE) interceptor, the most advanced type now available for Patriot, is just under $4.2 million, according to Army budget documents. 'After going through a business case analysis within the PEO and with the Army senior leaders, what we've decided to do is, one, look at continuing to upgrade the PAC-3 MSE missile, which I believe is probably the best air defense missile in the world, [and] continue to advance that capability so that it can remain relevance against the evolving threats,' Lozano added. The PAC-3 MSE is already a substantial improvement over precious PAC-3 variants, as you can read about in more detail here. Current Patriot launchers can also be loaded with a mix of PAC-3 MSEs and older interceptor types. An overview of the improvements found on the PAC-3 MSE variant over its predecessors. Lockheed Martin An overview of the improvements found on the PAC-3 MSE variant over its predecessors, including a 'New LE [lethality enhancer].' Lockheed Martin A graphic highlighting the ability to load multiple types of interceptors onto a single Patriot launcher. Lockheed Martin A complete Patriot battery today can consist of up to eight launchers, along with an AN/MPQ-65 multifunction phased array radar and various fire control, communications, and other support equipment. The Army is also in the process of adding a new radar, called the Lower Tier Air and Missile Defense Sensor (LTAMDS), to the Patriot ecosystem. In addition, Lozano said that the Army has been looking more at how the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) ballistic missile defense system can directly complement Patriot thanks to the new ICBS network. Developed by Northrop Grumman, IBCS is designed to offer an open-architecture command and control and networking environment to link together various air defense sensors and effectors, as you can learn more about here. 'What that would allow us to do is create a tighter coupling between the THAAD system and the Patriot system and via that tighter coupling, then you can manage the battle space in a much more efficient way,' Lozano told Judson. 'You could launch a THAAD interceptor against a particular target and then, as backup, launch a PAC-3 interceptor and it opens up the amount of battle space that you can use to take advantage of two interceptors against a very stressing threat&#8230; and in that same vein maintain the magazine depth of both family of interceptors.' The Missile Defense Agency (MDA), in cooperation with the Army and others, has been experimenting with the integration of components of the THAAD and Patriot systems in recent years. The decision to axe the LFTI effort also highlights broader discussions the Army is having now about the future of its Patiort force, which has been and continues to be in extremely high demand, but also too small to adequately meet those operational needs. The total number of THAAD batteries is even smaller and that system is also managed outside of the Army by the MDA. These are issues The War Zone has highlighted in the past, including just yesterday in the context of the emergency THAAD deployment to Israel. A THAAD transporter-erector-launcher is loaded onto a US Air Force C-17A Globemaster III transport aircraft at Fort Sill, Texas, bound for Israel as part of a training exercise in 2019. DOD The Army is looking to expand its Patriot force, but also scale back its use. 'We have relied too long on the Patriot system as the centric system to air and missile defense,' Army Lt. Gen. Sean Gainey, head of that service’s Space and Missile Defense Command (SDMC), said during a panel discussion at AUSA yesterday. 'We are modernizing now with the short-range air defense and moving forward with our IFPC [Indirect Fire Protection Capability] cruise missile defense, and our improvements to our current system[s], with the integration into IBCS, it will eventually start to relieve that significant stress.' The IFPC program, and the Enduring Shield system at the center of it, is a particularly significant part of the Army's broader air and missile defense modernization plans. The primary interceptor for Enduring Shield, which the service is working toward fielding operationally now, is the AIM-9X Sidewinder. An palletized Enduring Shield launcher. Leidos There are already plans for a second interceptor for Enduring Shield that is more optimized for the counter-cruise missile role. The Army has publicly laid out a vision for a design that offers capabilities akin to the AIM-120D Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM), but in the same form factor as the AIM-9X. Whatever the new interceptor might look like, it could give Enduring Shield an expanded medium-range air and missile defense capability. The Army's current lack of a surface-to-air missile system in this middle tier has added to the strain on the Patriot force, which has filled this gap since the retirement of the Hawk system in the 1990s. The Army is also looking to deploy and employ all of its ground-based air defense capabilities in more tailored and potentially disaggregated ways in the future, thanks in large part to the power of the IBCS network. 'The force structure that we are building and growing is tailorable, it's adaptable, and it is able to kind of flexibly meet whatever needs we have in any hotspot in the world,' Gabe Camarillo, Under Secretary of the Army, said at the same AUSA panel yesterday as Lt. Gen. Gainey. 'We can compose this in any shape or fashion.' 'What I want to be able to do is to be able to provide a Chinese menu, if you will, to combatant commanders, so that once they perform their assessment of the threat, they can say, 'Frank, give me three of those, one of those, 10 of those, four of those,'' Brig. Gen. Lozano, another member of the panel, also said. 'And we deliver that capability, integrated and able to function and work together to defeat any threat any given Combat Commander faces.' There are questions about how realistic this kind of mission-to-mission tailoring of air defense force packages might be in terms of maintaining readiness and cohesion, especially when it comes to training and otherwise preparing disparate units to work together down range. The Army does seem to be betting heavily on the ability of IBCS to allow the rapid fuzing of different air and missile defense capabilities down-range. At the panel yesterday, Brig. Gen. Lozano shared an anecdote about how lessons learned from the ongoing war in Ukraine are reinforcing the service's focus on IBCS: 'About a year and a half ago, I took a trip over to Poland to visit Ukrainian soldiers training on the first two batteries of Patriot that we were donating to them. One was a U.S. battery, one was a German battery. Had the privilege of eating lunch with some of those Ukrainian Air defenders. And at the end of that lunch, I asked them, I'm curious, &#8230; based on your employment of Patriot, and Avenger, and Hawk, and Stinger MANPAD [man portable air defense] systems, NASAMS [National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System], how are you managing the battle space to ensure you have the most efficient application of combat power against the threats that Russia is throwing at you. And they said, you know, sir, you've hit on our most significant struggle. If there was a way that we had a system that could integrate all of those capabilities that would make us much more effective in that employment of combat power. Do you have something you can give us? And I said, Well, I can't get ahead of the President. I'm not allowed to offer anything up, but I will tell you that we've recognized that same thing. And so when a lot of people ask me, what are some of the most important lessons that we've learned from Ukraine, from an air and missile defense perspective, what has been reaffirming to me is that the modernization path that we are on is exactly the right path to be on.' The video below highlights various Western-supplied and other air defense systems in service in Ukraine, including Patriot. The fighting in Ukraine has also broadly underscored the importance of layered integrated air defense networks capable of tackling multiple tiers of threats, from kamikaze drones to ballistic missiles, and doing so simultaneously. Much still remains to be seen about how the Army's air and missile defense force structure evolves going forward. At the same time, it is clear that major developments in terms of capabilities, as well as tactics, techniques, and procedures, are still on the horizon despite the end of plans for the next-generation interceptor for Patriot.

China’s Large Tiltrotor Drone Breaks Cover	China has revealed the first example of a new tiltrotor drone, United Aircraft’s UR6000, that has clear military potential, despite initially being pitched for civilian missions. The drone is notably large, providing a very useful load-carrying capability, and relatively offering high-speed and long-range. The photo, seen at the top of this story, dated October 11, shows what is said to be the first completed UR6000 prototype on the production line at the Wuhu United Aircraft Production Workshop in the Wuhu Aviation Industrial Park in China’s eastern Anhui province. A placard in front of the aircraft states that this is 'the first machine delivered off the line.' An official confirmed earlier this year that the project was at that time in the early prototyping phase. United Aircraft The UR6000 project — also apparently known as the R6000 and as the Zhang Ying, or Steel Shadow — was originally launched at the Singapore Airshow earlier this year when a less-than-detailed conceptual model was presented. Featuring high-mounted wings of constant chord, the UR6000 has tilting three-blade proprotors in engine nacelles mounted on the wingtips. It appears that the design has copied Bell’s new-generation tiltrotor technology, as used in the V-280 Valor, where instead of the whole nacelle rotating, only the front portion pivots. This solution is said to decrease complexity and increase reliability, as well as performance, compared with earlier tiltrotor concepts where the whole nacelle rotates, like on the V-22 Osprey. The V-280 Valor demonstrator during a test flight. Bell The Valor demonstrator during a test flight. (Bell) The U-shaped tail has a plank-like horizontal tailplane with a large vertical stabilizer mounted on each end. Two large canard-like surfaces are mounted just aft of the cockpit. Although these appear to be mainly intended to accommodate the main landing gear, it's possible they could perhaps also be used to mount smaller stores or sensors. Initial concept artwork shows a large cargo door on the port side, located toward the aft section of the fuselage. At this stage, the powerplant for the UR6000 is unclear, although it is certainly planned to be powered by turboshaft engines. Initial assessments suggest that each engine will be rated at between 1,500 and 2,000 horsepower and that a variable-speed gearbox is used to manage the different power requirements for vertical and horizontal flight modes. United Aircraft has released some provisional specifications for the tiltrotor drone. These include a maximum takeoff weight of 13,448 pounds (6,100 kilograms), a payload capacity of 4,409 pounds (2,000 kilograms), a cruise speed of 432 miles an hour (550 kilometers an hour), a service ceiling of 25,000 feet (7,620 meters), and a maximum range of 932 miles (1,500 kilometers). How accurate these numbers end being is yet to be seen. Reportedly, development of the UR6000 began in 2021 and certification is expected to be completed by 2027. It seems the next milestone could be at the Zhuhai Air Show later this year, with reports that the prototype of the tiltrotor drone will be formally unveiled there. #ZhuhaiAirShow2024 get readyWorld's first 6 ton tilt-rotor huge UAV 'Steel Shadow' R6000to be unveiled pic.twitter.com/4cunj4WEL0&mdash; Húrin (@Hurin92) October 2, 2024 The UR6000 is described by the manufacturer as an autonomous aerial vehicle (AAV), however, there are also reports that, in the longer term, the design will be adapted to carry up to 10 passengers as an alternative to cargo. That indicates that a larger crewed version of the tiltrotor is also envisaged. Concept artwork of an apparent crewed version of the UR6000 in a generic civil-type color scheme. United Aircraft At this stage, the tiltrotor drone is being pitched for civilian missions, although it would seem to have obvious military applications too. At least one picture on United Aircraft’s website now shows the UR6000 in People’s Liberation Army (PLA) markings. United Aircraft While United Aircraft is not among the largest Chinese aerospace entities, it does have considerable experience designing and building rotary-wing drones, including smaller quadcopters as well as larger types with coaxial rotor arrangements. These are primarily intended for logistics and surveillance, as well as firefighting and emergency response.

Its accommodation for 10, passengers also compares closely with the AW609’s seating for up to 12 passengers in a high-density configuration. Leonardo's AW609 tiltrotor conducts shipboard trials aboard the Italian aircraft carrier ITS Cavour. Leonardo Leonardo In the military realm, the UR6000 also makes an interesting comparison with Bell’s V-247 Vigilant, which was originally pitched to meet the U.S. Marine Corps multirole, VTOL-capable drone program, known as MUX. The Marines wanted MUX to have a minimum internal payload capacity of 3,000 pounds, the ability to carry between 3,000 to 9,000 pounds of weapons or other stores externally, a cruising speed between 230 and 345 miles per hour, an unrefueled combat radius of 350 to 700 miles, and the ability to refuel in flight. In its original form, the V-247 was designed with a maximum gross weight of over 30,000 pounds, but this has since been downsized to about 28,000 pounds to satisfy U.S. Navy requirements, including operating from smaller-deck warships. Vigilant’s long-range cruise is now listed as 240 knots with a maximum continuous cruising speed of 300 knots. Its redesigned internal mission payload is 2,000 pounds and it has a 9,000-pound slingload capacity. A proposed U.S. Navy version of Bell’s V-247 Vigilant. Bell It's very possible that the PLA may order further specific military modifications of the UR6000 to suit its requirements. The tiltrotor could also join a growing family of fixed-wing Chinese transport drones that have dual-role civilian and military applications. A tiltrotor drone, in particular, could well be suitable for a range of missions, especially in the Indo-Pacific theater, in which access to conventional airstrips would likely be limited in wartime and there is an enduring requirement to deliver cargoes to remote locations like Chinese island outposts in the South China Sea. While the U.S. military is increasingly looking at how to best address expeditionary missions in this environment, it’s also of huge importance for the PLA, as it seeks to expand its reach across the Pacific, including operations from small island airstrips as well as a growing fleet of amphibious assault ships that would be ideal platforms for the UR6000. Potentially offering long-range and fast-cruising, as well as a significant payload capacity for a VTOL drone, the UR6000 is certainly an intriguing although somewhat familiar design. Moreover, it’s one that would appear to be eminently suited to island-hopping operations of the kind considered likely in a future large-scale conflict in the Indo-Pacific. Above all else, it shows China's real interest in breaking into the larger tiltrotor realm.

BriteStorm Miniature Electronic Warfare System Can Allow Small Dr...	A new miniature electronic warfare jammer that is relatively low-cost enough to be a payload on loyal wingman-type drones and even expandable loitering munitions has hit the market from defense contractor Leonardo. Focused on stand-in jamming, the BriteStorm payload is based on technology pioneered in the BriteCloud air-launched decoy, which The War Zone has covered in detail in the past. Like its predecessor, BriteStorm can scoop up hostile radar emissions and emulate returns to create large numbers of false and confusing 'ghost' tracks and can also execute more traditional jamming, with even more adaptive capabilities on the horizon. Leonardo, which is headquartered in Italy, officially unveiled BriteStorm at the Association of the U.S. Army's main annual conference, which opened today in Washington, D.C. The company's subsidiary based in the United Kingdom has led the development of the new jammer, as well as the preceding BriteCloud decoy. 'A standard BriteStorm fit incorporates a platform-specific antenna, transmit-receive modules and Leonardo’s Miniature Technique Generator,' according to a press release today from Leonardo. BriteStorm weighs just five and a half pounds (two and a half kilograms), the company also told Breaking Defense. This is small, but still substantially heavier than the soda can-sized BriteCloud, which weighs just over a pound (or half a kilogram). From left to right, examples of a BriteStorm antenna, transmit-receive module, and Miniature Technique Generator. Leonardo 'BriteStorm is platform agnostic&#8230; You can put it on almost anything, as long as it has a payload bay and the power of equivalent of something like a Humvee battery,' Michael Lea, Vice President Of Sales for Electronic Warfare at Leonardo, told The War Zone and other attendees at AUSA. 'And when it comes to price, BriteStorm has been designed to sit at a point that makes it attritable. &#8230; [meaning it] is not prohibitively expensive, and it won't cause a major strategic, strategic issue if lost.' Lea did not further elaborate on cost. BriteStorm is focused on providing stand-in jamming support – which Leonardo defines as an 'airborne electronic warfare capability, deployed ahead of the main force, to deliver high-powered interference against a wide spectrum of threats' – while installed on any of a variety of different platforms. 'By doing so, BriteStorm degrades the enemy’s IADS [integrated air defense system network], supressing its ability to detect and lock onto other platforms, protecting friendly forces and enabling their mission,' according to a company press release. When it comes to how the system works, regardless of what it is installed on, 'BriteStorm is the first stand-in jammer on the market to use the gold-standard digital radio frequency memory, or DRFM, technology, which means it can record the pulse of an enemy radar system perfectly,' Lea added. 'The pulse is then manipulated and projected back, confusing the enemy and significantly degrading their situational awareness.' BriteStorm's DRFM capabilities are based on those found on the BriteCloud decoy, which has been seeing increasing sales worldwide, most recently as a new addition to the F-35 stealth fighter's array of radiofrequency countermeasures. It is worth noting here Leonardo's division in the United Kingdom has also been supplying the electronic warfare payload for the still-in-development stand-in jammer derivative of the Select Precision Effects At Range Capability Three (SPEAR-3) mini-cruise missile from European consortium MBDA. The SPEAR-EW version has been leveraging past work on BriteCloud. 'BriteStorm is highly effective against radars in the NATO A to J bands,' the Leonardo executive continued. 'This means that BriteStorm is effective against all types of&#8230; surveillance, target acquisition, and tracking radars.' As The War Zone has highlighted in the past with regard to BriteCloud, DRFM's signal mimicry can take the form of entire fleets of illusionary targets, not only confusing, but overwhelming radar operators. Integrated onto aerial drones or other uncrewed platforms, the new BriteStorm jammers could also be sent into a target area from multiple different vectors at once, creating additional problems for enemy defenders trying to prioritize their resources. Leonardo says that BriteStorm can also work by using more traditional jamming functionality, 'barraging the enemy system with electronic noise.' A graphic depicting BriteStorm installed on a notional drone. Leonardo As such, BriteStorm jammers could help shield friendly crewed and uncrewed aircraft, as well as cruise missiles, from hostile air defenses, including drawing away surface-to-air missiles from the primary force. Just stimulating the enemy's defenses could help assets tasked with suppression and destruction of enemy air defenses, allowing them to cut a clear path to a target area for incoming strikers. Leonardo's LEA specifically highlighted the U.S. Army's Air Launch Effects (ALE) and Future Tactical Uncrewed Aircraft System (FTUAS) programs, the U.S. Air Force's Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) program, and the United Kingdom's Autonomous Collaborative Platforms (ACP) drone program as ones that the company is now eying as potential opportunities for BriteStorm. Leonardo has three unspecified aerial assets in the United States now that it is using to demonstrate the capability to potential customers. In the United Kingdom, the Royal Air Force's (RAF) Rapid Capabilities Office (RCO) has already taken delivery of several BriteStorm payloads and has conducted some degree of flight testing. Leonardo already conducted at least one test back in 2020 in cooperation with the RAF RCO that involved a group of drones employing BriteCloud decoys against a mock enemy integrated air defense network. A graphic Leonardo released as part of its announcement of the 2020 test. Leonardo 'We're having quite interesting conversations with a number of end users about CONOPS [concepts of operations] for operation of BriteStorm at the moment,' Leonardo's Lea said. 'And I think it's fair to say that in the world of CCA and ACP, coalition forces are trying to work out the right force mix between large, exquisite platforms, uncrewed platforms, and then potential attritable platforms, as well.' In addition, 'BriteStorm is supplied with a very comprehensive mission data and generation tool. And you can observe the effects BriteStorm&#8230; has on opposition radars, and then reprogram it, depending on what you've seen and the threat that's out there,' Michael Lea from Leonardo explained today. 'We are looking again in the capability roadmap, about how you may change the waveforms that BriteStorm can generate by connecting it back to other systems, which are elsewhere.' Responding to a question at the roll-out presentation at AUSA from The War Zone's Jamie Hunter about whether this might mean the system could be reprogrammed on the fly, representatives from Leonardo said the current plan is for any changes to be made in between missions. No mention was made of so-called cognitive electronic warfare capabilities in regard to BriteStorm, but remote updating of systems in the middle of operations to respond to new and evolving threats is a key part of that overall concept. An electronic warfare suite that can process incoming signals and autonomously adjust its outputs to be most effective in response without any outside input is the absolute 'holy grail' that the concept envisions, as you can read more about here. No explicit mention was made today about networking BriteStorms together, but doing so would provide critical additional capability. A networked group of platforms carrying the electronic warfare systems would have synergistic effects. It would make it harder for an opponent to realize they've been deceived and how, with multiple coordinated EW tactics occurring over a broad area and from different vectors and platforms. A grouping like this would also be more resilient to attacks since it would still be able to continue its electronic attacks even if some of the platforms in the network are lost. A graphic depicting BriteStorm installed on different tiers of drones. Leonardo It's interesting to point out here that the U.S. Navy has been pushing ahead in recent years with plans for a similar-sounding distributed and deeply networked electronic warfare ecosystem that includes uncrewed decoys and other nodes capable of mimicking friendly forces to protect them from threats and deceive opponents. The Navy has referred to this concept in the past as the Netted Emulation of Multi-Element Signature against Integrated Sensors, or NEMESIS, which The War Zone was first to really report on. We have highlighted in the past that some of these developments might help explain some number of sightings of so-called unexplained aerial phenomena (UAP). Furthermore, Leonardo's unveiling BriteStorm at the AUSA conference raises the question of whether the system might be usable against target sets beyond enemy air defense networks. Preventing enemy counter-battery radars from getting an accurate fix on artillery units or coastal radars from spotting and tracking ships at sea would also be valuable capabilities to have. More generally, BriteStorm reflects a broad resurgence of demand in the West, especially within the U.S. military, in higher-end electronic warfare capabilities that had increasingly fallen into disuse after decades of counter-terrorism and other lower-intensity missions. American officials now regularly talk about how dominating in the electromagnetic spectrum will be a key factor in succeeding in future high-end fights, such as one in the Pacific against China. The ongoing war in Ukraine has only provided further evidence of the importance of various tiers of electronic warfare capabilities, as well as an important source of more direct lessons learned for the United States and others. How and where BriteStorm may be fielded operationally in the future remains to be seen, but the U.S. military and other armed forces globally have clear and still-growing interest in the kinds of distributed electronic warfare capabilities it has to offer.

Emergency THAAD Deployment To Israel Heightens Concerns On Strain...	Sending one of the U.S. Army’s seven prized Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) batteries to Israel highlights the strain on the service’s air defense systems and personnel, which are increasingly deployed around the globe. This is a glaring issue we explored in-depth nearly a year ago, which you can read about here. Since then, the demand for these systems has only increased, especially now that Israel and Iran are trading escalating blows and as the threat from China looms larger in the Pacific with each passing day. The deteriorating security situation in Europe and Ukraine's massive appetite for air defenses is also a major factor stressing America's organic air defense capacity. While the deployment of the THAAD battery and about 100 soldiers to Israel will not add 'a tremendous amount of additional strain broadly to the community…the air defense artillery community is the most stressed,' Army Secretary Christine Wormuth told reporters Monday, including from The War Zone. 'They have the highest [operational tempo]…and what we are trying to do to manage that is two things.' Lt. Gen. Patrick Frank, U.S. Army Central Commanding General, meets with a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) crew next to a launcher emplaced and prepared to launch interceptors to counter ballistic missile threats at an undisclosed location in the CENTCOM Area of Operations, Dec. 12, 2023. (U.S. Army Courtesy Photo) The first is 'modernizing our integrated air and missile defenses to try to create more capacity,' said Wormuth, speaking at a reporter’s roundtable at the 2024 AUSA Conference in Washington D.C. One step toward that goal is moving toward the integration of the Patriot battery’s new Lower Tier Air and Missile Defense Sensor (LTAMDS) into the Army’s Integrated Battle Command System (IBCS) network. LTAMDS is designed to provide higher-fidelity sensing capability at much further distances and process a wider array of data more quickly than the Patriot's current radar. It can also offer 360-degree coverage, which the current system cannot. The IBCS connects various sensors to effectors like, gun systems, lasers, missile systems, and electronic warfare capabilities and combines all this data on the entire air defense situation into a single actionable 'picture' for operators. The combination is meant to give air defenders a much greater ability to better react to and if necessary shoot down a multitude of threats at once. 'That will greatly increase the capacity of the existing Patriot force that we have, and that will help reduce some of the stress on our soldiers,' the Secretary explained. Patriot batteries are especially stretched, with the need for training, testing, maintenance and upgrades back at home competing with increasing obligations abroad. The other line of effort is 'constantly trying to be disciplined as we can' in providing inputs to Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin so he can 'accurately assess the strain on the force when he's considering future operational deployment. We have to be as choosy as we can be about what we take on.' That is easier said than done, however. In this case, the THAAD battery and troops are being sent to bolster Israel’s defenses as it faces glaringly real ballistic missile threats from Iran and some of the higher-end ballistic missiles Iran has provided Hezbollah. The announcement of its pending delivery comes ahead of an expected Israeli retaliation for Tehran’s massive missile barrage earlier this month. You can see part of that attack in the following video. Dozens of ballistic missile impacts in Israel pic.twitter.com/eGTd0JCBMY&mdash; ELINT News (@ELINTNews) October 1, 2024 'I think we should view this THAAD deployment as for what it is, which is another visible statement of our commitment to the security of Israel…' Wormuth said. A THAAD battery can include up to nine transporter-erector-launchers, each carrying eight interceptors at the ready, as well as a long-range AN/TPY-2 X-band radar, a mobile fire control and command and control center, and various supporting equipment. Additional interceptors would be available to reload the launchers during a combat deployment, as well. A briefing slide showing the general composition of THAAD batteries as of 2016., MDA THAAD is designed to intercept short-, medium, and intermediate-range ballistic missiles during their terminal phase of flight when they are plunging toward their target. The system sits at the top-end of air defense systems capable of terminal phase air defense, which include Patriot, the SM-6, and Israel's Stunner. THAAD can reach up higher and is capable of swatting down faster threats, like longer-range ballistic missiles. The system made its first combat kill in 2020, defending the United Arab Emirates from a ballistic missile launched by Houthi rebels of Yemen. A basic overview of where THAAD fits into the missile defense ecosystem. (MDA) THAADs are in short supply and extremely high demand. In addition to the THAAD battery being sent to Israel, the Army shipped a THAAD battery to the Middle East region shortly after the surprise Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas incursion into southern Israel amid fears that the conflict could erupt into a regional war. In addition, two more are also deployed outside of the continental United States, one in South Korea and one on the U.S. island of Guam in the Western Pacific. THAAD has also been sent on deployments to Europe in recent years. The Army is currently hoping to field an eighth THAAD battery by 2025. This is not the first time THAAD has been sent to Israel. As we reported in March 2019, the first time was part of a Pentagon effort to be able to quickly deploy capabilities and keep adversaries from having too much foreknowledge about U.S. military plans. THAAD's arrival there and the following exercises were very much to prepare for a similar situation as what Israel is facing now and Iran's ballistic missile capabilities have only grown more potent over the last half decade. Though a full THAAD battery was deployed to Israel for the first time five years ago, members of the U.S. Army’s 10th Army Air and Missile Defense Command have maintained the system's long-range AN/TPY-2 X-band radar at a so-called 'cooperative security location' known as Site 512 in Israel’s Negev Desert permanently at least since 2012. This little talked about arrangement means THAAD could deploy without the need to move its staple sensor system there. THAAD seen during its first deployment to Israel in 2019. DoD While Israel faces numerous aerial threats from Hezbollah, the Houthis and various Iranian-backed militias in Iraq and Syria, deploying a THAAD battery at this point seems to be a clear signal to Tehran that not only does the U.S. have Israel’s back, but it is willing to put additional troops and prized materiel on the ground to defend it. The U.S. has been building up capabilities in the region for months now, including other missile defense assets, namely destroyers capable of midcourse intercept of ballistic missiles, in an effort to deter Iran and be better ready to respond should a wider conflict erupt in the region. All that being said, given its capabilities, the THAAD battery would make a prime target for Iran or any of its proxies. But it will also be among the most defended assets in the region and Iran is already fully aware of Israel's strategic missile defense assets and installations. Still, with additional U.S. troops now in harms way, the possibility for a conflict widening if they are harmed is certainly elevated.

North Korea Sending GPS-Equipped Balloons Across The Border	Among the balloons being sent across the border from North Korea to the South are examples carrying GPS transmitters, according to the Republic of Korea military. Waves of excrement and trash-filled balloons have been sent over South Korea since the summer, but the latest development suggests that the North is also using them for limited intelligence-gathering, perhaps in preparation for future contingencies, or to develop more balloon-based military capabilities. The announcement comes only days after Pyongyang accused the South of sending multiple waves of drones over the North Korean capital to drop propaganda leaflets, as you can read about here. South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff says that GPS transmitters were found in some of the North Korean balloons. Although it’s unclear when exactly these balloons were sent, there have been no previous reports of them carrying such devices, since the current campaign began. Pieces of garbage (at the bottom of the picture) fall to the ground after a trash-carrying balloon is launched across the border by North Korea in the sky above Seoul on October 4, 2024. Photo by ANTHONY WALLACE / AFP ANTHONY WALLACE A South Korean defense official said the military is 'tracking North Korea’s possible development of balloon flotation technology and preparing for contingencies.' The implication is that North Korea has been using the GPS data sent back by appropriately equipped balloons to study their flight data. A balloon of this kind cannot have its course altered based on returned GPS data, but the equipment could have other implications of varying degrees of impact. Tracking balloon movements over time would show North Korea the kinds of routes they are taking, how far they can travel, and at what speeds. By their nature, the balloons are very likely to be intact once they come down — provided they are not shot down — meaning that the signal can still be transmitted, at least until it descends below the recieving station's horizon. However, if the balloons are brought down by South Korean air defenses, resulting in a sudden loss of connectivity, it’s the resulting data could also help to highlight potential strong and weak spots in the country’s defensive coverage. South Korean soldiers take part in an anti-terror drill, as part of the Ulchi Freedom Shield exercise between the United States and South Korea, in Seoul on August 20, 2024. This was a city-wide civil defense exercise designed to better prepare for any future trash balloons, as well as North Korean drone attacks. Photo by ANTHONY WALLACE / AFP ANTHONY WALLACE Perhaps more significantly, the development could point to North Korea working on other new capabilities for its balloons. The utility of balloons for surveillance was clearly highlighted by a spate of incidents over North America in early 2023, including a high-altitude balloon originating from China. It's a reality TWZ has warned about in great detail before those instances, as well. If North Korea were to fit its balloons with intelligence-gathering equipment, this could provide valuable data. For example, fitting balloons with basic onboard electronic surveillance systems would allow them to send back signatures of air defense systems they detect and their azimuths. While the data might be simple, multiple balloons could allow emissions to be rapidly triangulated, which would help locate air defense radars and other critical nodes, for instance. At the same time, a balloon equipped to send back such data would also generate electromagnetic radiation, revealing its presence and location to electronic surveillance measures, although this can be mitigated to a degree by sending very simple data streams in small bursts and leverage commercial satellite communications is another possibility. A woman passes by the 24-hour Yonhap News TV broadcast at Yongsan Railway Station in Seoul, which displays a news segment featuring a file image of North Korea’s balloons. Photo by Kim Jae-Hwan/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images SOPA Images More worryingly, North Korea may be studying the flight paths of its balloons with a view to providing them with lethal payloads. In the past, we have explored how such balloons could be deadly if filled with explosives, incendiary devices, radioactive materials, or chemical weapons, for example. GPS data, if comprehensive enough, could help North Korea develop tactics for sending balloons to the South with payloads of this kind, too. GPS can also be used to order the release of a balloon-borne weapon over certain predetermined areas. A campaign of this kind would not be accurate, but it would cause mayhem and havoc throughout the South, a primary goal of the North Koreans and something we explored in depth back in 2017. Were Pyongyang to launch a major cross-DMZ conflict, this could be just the kind of tactic that it would look for in combination with deep assaults into the South. Using balloons for lethal attacks is hardly new. Balloons carrying bombs and incendiary devices were a feature of World War II. As we have previously noted, Ukraine today also uses inflatable objects to drop explosives on Russians. The Ukrainian Armed Forces have launched a series of meteorological balloons equipped with explosives deep into Russia for the first time. One of them was intercepted by air defense systems in the Lipetsk region.According to Mash, a modified unmanned aerostat carrying kilograms… pic.twitter.com/0XjfgyzbSd&mdash; MD (@distant_earth83) April 17, 2024 Another option for North Korea would be to use balloons to help overwhelm the South’s formidable air defenses, in times of conflict. This would parallel Russia’s use of balloons with radar reflectors to stimulate, confuse and deplete Ukrainian air defenses. Just the fact that North Korea has displayed increasingly sophisticated use of basic balloons against the South makes them a real threat during a conflict, and thus would suck up precious air defense effectors. This is all in great contrast to North Korea’s balloon campaign up until now. This has involved payloads of trash as well as 'fecal matter and other contaminants.' As such, they have had mainly nuisance value, as well as providing a signal of Pyongyang’s ability to cause disruption in the South using the kinds of ‘gray zone’ tactics that inhabit the space between peace and war. A pedestrian uses a fan to inspect sweet wrappers suspected to be from trash balloons sent from North Korea, in Seoul on July 24, 2024. Photo by Anthony WALLACE / AFP ANTHONY WALLACE The number of balloons involved is also significant, with South Korean reports stating that some 260 balloons were launched by the North in one overnight action last May. This figure reflects the fact that balloons are relatively cheap and simple, making them more attractive for these kinds of operations. Concerns about the possible dangerous payloads have led to South Korea’s military deploying 'chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear response teams and bomb disposal units to collect the objects for a detailed analysis,' according to Yonhap. As far as North Korea is concerned, it has said that its balloon campaign is a response to propaganda balloons launched from the South, activities that have been primarily attributed to activists and North Korean defectors. Such balloons allegedly carry mainly aid parcels and leaflets condemning the North’s leadership. Last week, however, reports emerged of drones being launched from South Korea, apparently with the same purpose. North Korea said that South Korean drones were responsible for scattering a 'huge number' of leaflets with anti-North propaganda over its capital. Officials in Pyongyang described the action as a 'political and military provocation that could lead to armed conflict.' KCNA As TWZ reported at the time, Seoul didn’t admit responsibility for launching the leaflet-dropping drones, although this was a notably sophisticated operation for a group of volunteers or defectors — at least compared to drifting balloons. In particular, the drones would need considerable range, payload, and navigation capabilities to have specifically targeted Pyongyang and to have done so over several nights. At this point, it’s impossible to say whether North Korea’s GPS-equipped balloons are just an experiment or the sign of something more significant in the works. However, it is a useful innovation and may well not be the last we will see, as Pyongyang continues its balloon campaign amid growing tensions on the peninsula.

Experimental Fly-By-Wire UH-60M Black Hawk To Become Autonomy Tes...	An experimental U.S. Army UH-60M helicopter with fly-by-wire flight controls is now set to get a 'robotic brain' that will allow it to operate with a high degree of autonomy with or without any humans on board. This is the latest development in a series of tests stretching back years now that has been steadily working on ever-greater pilot-optional capabilities for the Black Hawk family, which could also find their way onto other aircraft. Sikorsky, now a subsidiary of Lockheed Martin, announced the plan to add its MATRIX autonomy system onto the fly-by-wire UH-60M, also known as the MX, earlier today. The integration is being done under a $6 million contract from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) in cooperation with the Army. Sikorsky first began developing MATRIX in 2013 and then further evolved the system as part of DARPA's Aircrew Labor In-Cockpit Automation System (ALIAS) program starting in 2014. The ALIAS/MATRIX autonomy package has already been demonstrated on a Sikorsky fly-by-wire pilot-optional UH-60A testbed, as well as an S-76 helicopter and a fixed-wing Cessna C-208 Caravan. 'As part of ALIAS in 2020, Sikorsky provided the hardware and engineering support to add fly-by-wire flight controls to the [UH-60M] MX aircraft,' according to a press release Lockheed Martin put out today. 'When combined with the MATRIX autonomy system, the MX aircraft will be a near-exact copy of Sikorsky’s UH-60A fly-by-wire Optionally Piloted Black Hawk helicopter, the company’s flying lab that has tested MATRIX autonomy over hundreds of flight hours.' 'The [ALIAS/MATRIX equipped MX] aircraft will enable DEVCOM to explore and mature the practical applications and potential concept of operations of a scalable autonomy system,' the release adds. 'Evaluation will include assessment of different sensor suites to perceive and avoid threats, obstacles and terrain, and develop standards and system specifications interfaced with the MATRIX system and a fly-by-wire flight control system.' The integration of ALIAS/MATRIX onto the MX Black Hawk is set to be completed next year. 'We're going to have a tablet. You push a button, and it'll go through all the pre-flight checks, it'll start, it'll take off, and perform that [assigned] mission,' Dan Tenney, Vice President, Strategy and Business Development for Lockheed Martin for Rotary and Mission Systems, also said today in explaining the current capabilities of the ALIAS/MATRIX system. 'And we're not talking about remote control. We're not talking about programmed waypoints. We're actually talking about putting a mission into the aircraft and allowing it to perform. ' Test pilots control an ALIAS/MATRIX-equipped UH-60A Black Hawk with a tablet interface during a previous test flight. Lockheed Martin 'Now the autonomy comes in of truly saying this is the mission we want you to perform,' he continued. 'And then when the aircraft goes through algorithms and says, this is the best way to perform that mission, and adjusts.' Tenney was talking to Defense News' Sebastian Sprenger in a live interview from the floor of the Association of the U.S. Army's (AUSA) main annual convention in Washington, D.C., which opened today, which The War Zone and other attendees listened in on. This high degree of autonomy 'becomes extremely important as you can think about supplementing a pilot. You know, if you have a pilot flying and there's other mission objectives they need to be working on, they can autonomously fly the aircraft [using ALIAS/MATRIX] – not just an autopilot, but actually tell it to do the mission,' Tenney added. 'It'll adjust because of weather, it'll adjust because of geography or threats that are out there that are being detected through sensors and space capabilities. And so you can also then send in other signals and how to go perform a different mission.' When it comes to the Black Hawk family specifically, the addition of digital fly-by-wire control systems is key to this next step in pilot-optional capabilities. 'So when we're fly-by-wire and we take out many of the mechanical linkages, we can then have crewed-uncrewed [capabilities], we can add autonomy into those systems, but you don't have to change the entire structure [of the aircraft],' Tenny explained. Sikorsky plans to conduct a new demonstration of ALIAS/MATRIX's capabilities as part of AUSA utilizing the existing UH-60A test helicopter, which will fly from the company's facility in Stratford, Connecticut under remote direction from the show floor. As The War Zone has highlighted in our reporting on ALIAS/MATRIX in the past, the capabilities the system offers open up valuable new avenues for the Army, as well as others, for operating existing helicopters like the Black Hawk series, while also limiting risks to pilots and other aircrew. 'So let's say you have a Black Hawk flying in theater, and you have troops on the ground that need an emergency MEDEVAC [medical evacuation], or an event like that. They could send a message to the Black Hawk, and the Black Hawk could reroute [automatically],' Lockheed Martin's Tenney offered as an example for the floor of AUSA. 'Now they'd have to have the right parameters to do that, okay, but they would send it. The Black Hawk would accept that mission, turn around, find the best place to land, and perform it.' Previous ALIAS/MATRIX testing has focused heavily on highly autonomous medical evacuation and resupply missions, including one instance in which the existing UH-60A testbed delivered real and simulated blood to a forward location. New ways to get key supplies to forward forces and otherwise operate critical logistics chains in contested environments are areas of significant interest to the Army, as well as the rest of the U.S. military, as part of planning now for future high-end fights, especially one across the broad expanses of the Pacific against China. The ability to rapidly switch between crewed and uncrewed operations would also give commanders more flexibility for conducting operations in both higher and lower-risk environments. Being able to position and reposition UH-60s from one location to another without the need for human flight crews could be just as valuable from a resource management perspective as having the option to send one into a more dangerous locale without risking real human personnel. Acting as an artificial intelligence-driven co-pilot, ALIAS/MATRIX could also just help provide extra margins of flight safety during crewed operations. 'Autonomy-enabled aircraft will reduce pilot workload, dramatically improve flight safety, and give battle commanders the flexibility to perform complex missions in contested and congested battlespace, day or night in all weather conditions,' Rich Benton, Sikorsky Vice President and General Manager, said in a statement today. 'Soldiers will rely on Black Hawk helicopters into the 2070s, and modernizing the aircraft today will pay dividends for decades across Army Aviation’s current and future aircraft.' The Army is also pursuing next-generation aviation capabilities, including the tilt-rotor Future Long-Range Assault Aircraft (FLRAA) that is set to supplant a significant portion of the service's UH-60s, which could also benefit from the ALIAS/MATRIX developments. As already mentioned, the autonomy package has been tested on other helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft already. What comes out of continued work on ALIAS/MATRIX could be of interest outside of the Army, as well. Contested logistics chains, in particular, are a major area of concern facing the entire U.S. military. Other branches are also actively looking at uncrewed aerial and other capabilities as ways to ensure forces, especially ones dispersed to far-flung locations to help reduce their vulnerability, can be adequately resupplied in the future. China, the United States' principal global competitor, is facing the prospect of future military operations with the same kinds of logistical demands and has been notably pushing ahead in its own development of uncrewed aerial cargo aircraft. It is important to note that questions have been and continue to be raised about the true extent of developments in the autonomy arena, especially when it comes to uncrewed aircraft. U.S. military and industry officials have repeatedly stressed that work in this regard is progressing along incremental approaches and that building operator trust in autonomous capabilities remains central to these developments. 'The first time that you give not a not good answer, a really bad answer to a user, they will never trust that system, that box, or potentially use a deliverer [company supplying the system], ever again,' Dr. Alex Miller, Chief Technology Officer for the Chief of Staff of the Army, said during a virtual roundtable discussion on artificial intelligence and related technologies that the Center for Strategic & International Studies (CSIS) think tank hosted back in September. 'And it's not because you're bad at your job, or the system's bad, it's because they don't want to spend more time being paranoid, double-checking the answers, because of one bad experience.' All of this points to the importance of the continued testing of ALIAS/MATRIX, which is now set to involve the MX Black Hawk, as the Army, DARPA, and Sikosrky move further ahead in pushing toward real operational autonomous capabilities for the UH-60 family and potentially other aircraft.

Navy Just Reloaded A Vertical Launch System For The First Time Wh...	One of the largest concerns regarding the U.S. Navy's ability to persist in a peer conflict in the vast Pacific is the ability to keep its prized major surface combatants — destroyers, cruisers and soon frigates — stocked with weapons. The conflict with the Houthis in and around the Red Sea has only underscored the need to figure out how to reload vertical launch systems (VLS) without coming into port. If an Iranian-backed rebel group can make a big dent in American warships' weapons stocks, China would be exponentially worse. You can read all about this glaring issue in our previous feature here. But now, the Navy has just demonstrated its fast-tracked possible solution to this pressing issue. USS Chosin (CG-65), a Ticonderoga class cruiser, came alongside Military Sealift Command's dry cargo ship USNS Washington Chambers (T-AKE 11) and transferred an empty VLS weapon container to the cruiser while sailing off the southern California coast on October 11th. The demonstration included USS Chosin and USNS Washington Chambers as participants. (USN/Composite) The device designed for this critical application is the Transferrable Reload At-sea Method or 'TRAM.' During the test, a U.S. Navy press release states: 'The sailors then used TRAM to move the missile canister along rails attached to the cruiser’s VLS modules, tilt it into a vertical position, and lower it into a VLS cell with TRAM’s built-in cable and pulley system&#8230; The successful demonstration marks a critical step in the capability to rearm warships at sea—a top priority outlined by Secretary of the Navy Carlos Del Toro.' The Secretary of the Navy, who was in attendance to watch the test, declared it a huge success. 'Today, we proved just how game-changing TRAM truly is—and what a powerful deterrent it will be to our competitors&#8230;,' he said. 'This demonstration marks a key milestone on the path to perfecting this capability and fielding it for sustained operations at sea.' Del Toro watches TRAM in action during the test. (USN) This demonstration was highly-anticipated, with Congress taking a major interest in the capability. A pier-side trial at Naval Surface Warfare Center Port Hueneme Division, which also developed the system, was successful in July, but doing it at sea was a big leap in terms of complexity. The hydraulically-powered TRAM system can be used while the ship is executing underway replenishment, which is a regular but demanding task, where all types of supplies are moved from a supply ship to a warship while moving parallel to one another. If TRAM proves fully successful and is fielded to the fleet, it means that Mk 41 Vertical Launch System weapons cells can also be replenished during these operations. Sailors from the Navy Expeditionary Logistics Support Group and USS Chosin (CG 65) prepare to operate the U.S. Navy’s Transferrable Rearming Mechanism as they demonstrate reloading a MK 41 Vertical Launching System cell on July 10 at Naval Surface Warfare Center, Port Hueneme Division’s Underway Replenishment Test Site.

(U.S. Navy photo/released) Getting this system into a deployable state is of utmost importance as the threat from China looms larger by the day. During a conflict in the Pacific, just the size of the theater will make resupplying highly dispersed warships very challenging, let alone the danger these vessels will be in. But the volume of fire that could occur in such a conflict could quickly leave America's most powerful warships without certain types of missiles in their VLS cells. This is especially concerning when it comes to weapons that are critical to defending the ships themselves. Ports capable of VLS resupply could be thousands of miles away from patrol areas and they too could be at risk of attack. On top of this, the U.S. Navy is finding it very challenging to meet its surface combatant hull goals of the future. Each ship that is operational at the time of the conflict will be very valuable and keeping them on scene longer will be critical to achieving overall military objectives. TRAM is supposed to go a long way in helping with these issues, although having enough ships to execute underway replenishment in such a huge theater, even with potential combat losses, is another issue entirely. As it sits now, Secretary Del Toro says the Navy is on track to begin fielding TRAM operationally in two to three years.

Drones Penetrate North Korean Air Defenses To Drop Propaganda Lea...	North Korea has accused South Korea of using drones to scatter propaganda leaflets over its capital, Pyongyang. The incident today comes after waves of excrement and trash-filled balloons launched by North Korea into the South, which started this summer, and during a period of overall worsening tensions on the peninsula overall. KCNA Photos released by the North Korean state news agency KCNA are of fairly poor quality, but appear to show triangular objects, perhaps broadly similar in configuration to the Israeli Harop long-range one-way attack drone. Other views suggest not so much a delta-wing platform as a swept-winged one, reminiscent of the U.S.-made ScanEagle long-endurance, low-altitude drone. It could also be the case that a variety of different drones were used for the airdrop mission. ScanEagle? pic.twitter.com/Qn5d3REYZe&mdash; JSF (@rockfish31) October 11, 2024 These drones, in turn, are shown seemingly releasing small objects. The news agency describes these objects as 'scattered leaflets,' or as 'bundles of leaflets.' KCNA KCNA A separate photo shows a close-up of what’s claimed to be one of the drone-delivered leaflets. The black, yellow, and white leaflets compare the economic situation in the South to that in the North and also criticize North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. KCNA North Korea said that South Korean drones were responsible for scattering a 'huge number' of leaflets with anti-North propaganda over its capital. Officials in Pyongyang described the action as a 'political and military provocation that could lead to armed conflict.' According to the North Korean Foreign Ministry, the drone incursions occurred on several nights this week — October 3, 9, and 10 — each time penetrating airspace over Pyongyang. The North Korean Foreign Ministry today said that the latest incursion demanded retaliatory action, according to KCNA. 'The ROK [South Korea] should immediately stop such irresponsible and dangerous provocation that may cause an armed conflict and lead to a war between the two sides,' the ministry was quoted as saying. The has issued a strongly worded statement to the South, saying there will be no more warnings and the North will immediately take action if another drone is sent from the South over its territory. Meanwhile, South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said they could not confirm the North’s accusations. They did, however, bring up the North Korean practice of sending balloons into South Korean airspace. Since the summer of this year, North Korea has sent hundreds of balloons, many filled with trash, into South Korea. via X The Joint Chiefs of Staff said they 'cannot confirm the truth of North Korea’s claims,' but added that 'All responsibility for the recent series of events' lies with the North. South Korea said that more balloons were launched toward its airspace today, citing this as more evidence of the North’s 'despicable, low-grade and internationally embarrassing acts of filth and garbage balloons and other provocations.' The North Korean balloon campaign began in May of this year and has so far seen thousands of balloons drift into the South’s airspace.

The balloons from the South allegedly carry mainly aid parcels and leaflets condemning the North’s leadership. It may be the case that the drones were also sent by activists or defectors, but this would be a very sophisticated operation for groups of volunteers — at least compared to drifting balloons. In particular, the drones would need considerable range, payload and navigation capabilities to have specifically targeted Pyongyang, and to have done so over several nights. An official at the South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff has said that there needs to be an investigation into whether the drones were sent into the North by a private group, according to a report from South Korea’s Yonhap news agency. In the past, we looked at how the North Korean balloon campaign demonstrated the potential for craft of this type to also be used to deliver deadly payloads, such as explosives, incendiary devices, radioactive materials, or chemical weapons. When the campaign began earlier this year, South Korea’s military reportedly deployed 'chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear response teams and bomb disposal units to collect the objects for a detailed analysis.' The same concerns, of course, apply to drones. The ability of drones — sophisticated or otherwise — to penetrate the heavily defended airspace over the North Korean capital will surely be a considerable worry to officials there and would appear to highlight deficiencies in the North’s best air defense coverage. As with the balloons from the North, the drones over Pyongyang don’t appear to have caused any major damage or contained anything dangerous, but the event will still have been alarming for the North — evidenced by the ferocity of its official statement in response.

Photo by Kim Jae-Hwan/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images SOPA Images Furthermore, while balloons are far from a precision threat and provide more of an annoyance than anything else, drones are very different. As TWZ has discussed for years, a drone that’s able to deliver a lethal payload or long distances, for example, with considerable accuracy is now well within the reach of non-state actors. At this stage, it remains unclear whether the drones in question were launched by private organizations or if they originated from the South Korean military or government, or if they were the result of a more shadowy ‘hybrid warfare’ effort. Provided the drones were not launched from the sea, Seoul should've been able to detect them fairly easily and know where they came from, raising questions about the theory of a non-state origin. Were the drones launched across the land border, they would also have to pass through some of the most heavily surveilled and best-defended airspace on the planet. A government operation seems far more likely, considering these were fairly sophisticated drones, able to fly long distances before dropping their payloads. South Korea certainly has drones with the capability and North Korea does too, as they increasingly invest in more advanced unmanned aircraft.

There is even a slim possibility that North Korea orchestrated the drone campaign, for whatever reason. North Korea has a track record of launching its own drones against the South. In December 2022, a North Korean drone entered a no-fly zone around the office of the South Korean president, according to military officials in Seoul. In response to this and earlier incursions, the South stepped up its anti-drone capabilities, including developing airborne laser weapons and signal jammers. In the meantime, the armed forces use aircraft, including KA-1 fixed-wing turboprops and MD500 helicopters, as well as soldiers armed with anti-drone jammer guns, to counter drones from the North. The truth is the North's drone incursions over the South go back many years. The wreckage of a crashed drone — believed to be from North Korea — seen on Baengnyeong Island, a border island between South Korea and North Korea on March 31, 2014. Photo by South Korean Defence Ministry via Getty Images Handout With the two Koreas still technically at war, and with officials from both countries already locked in a hyperbolic war of words. Just a few days ago, the North said it would sever road and railway access to the South, to make sure the two countries are 'completely separate.' Incidents like this also raise tensions and, with them, the risk of an overreaction or a misunderstanding leading to a much more serious escalation. The latest incursion is perhaps particularly concerning bearing in mind that a military campaign launched by the South against its neighbor would very likely also see extensive involvement by drones, including to confuse and overwhelm air defenses. This would be especially relevant ahead of any air campaign directed against Pyongyang, such as decapitation strikes against the leadership. With that in mind, it’s possible that the drones were also intended to serve as a warning from the South — whether sanctioned by official channels or not, or even some kind of trial run. Pyongyang’s angry response is predictable, but it remains to be seen exactly what kind of reaction will be prompted by any further such drone incursions.

Counter-Drone Stryker Armored Vehicle Armed With Lasers, Rockets,...	A new counter-drone focused variant of the 8&#215;8 Stryker light armored vehicle armed with a laser directed energy weapon, laser-guided 70mm rockets, a 30mm automatic cannon, radars and other sensors has broken cover. Defense contractor Leonardo DRS and its industry partners are actively pitching the vehicle to the U.S. Army, which is looking to significantly grow its short-range air defense capabilities in the coming years. That service is also very interested in new laser-armed options, specifically, after lackluster field tests of a different Stryker-based system earlier this year. Leonardo DRS, the U.S.-based subsidiary of Italy's Leonardo, released a video, seen below, detailing what it is currently calling the Counter-Uncrewed Aerial Systems Directed Energy (C-UAS DE) Stryker earlier today. The company says seven other partners – BlueHalo, EOS Defense Systems USA, Northrop Grumman, BAE Systems, Arnold Defense, AMPEX, and Digital Systems Engineering – contributed to the development of the prototype in around eight months. The laser directed energy weapon, a 26-kilowatt version of the LOCUST from BlueHalo installed on a retractable mount on top of the rear of the hull, is clearly the centerpiece of the new counter-drone Stryker prototype. 'It's going to provide a directed energy capability that can kill group ones, twos, three UASs at very long range,' Ed House Senior Director of Business Development at Leonardo DRS says in the video. Per the U.S. military's definitions, drones in these three categories, collectively, can weigh up to 1,320 pounds, fly at altitudes up to 18,000 feet, and get up to top speeds of 250 knots. BlueHalo does not appear to have disclosed a maximum engagement range for the LOCUST. Screen captures showing quadcopter-type drones being destroyed by the LOCUST on the C-UAS DE Stryker during testing.

Leonardo DRS capture The C-UAS DE Stryker also has a four-round launcher from Arnold Defense for 70mm laser-guided Advanced Precision Kill Weapon System II (APKWS II) rockets on a semi-retractable mount on top of the left side of the rear of the hull. This is a combination that is found on other counter-drone systems, including L3Harris VAMPIREs now being actively employed in Ukraine.

The XM914 is another increasingly common feature in counter-drone systems and can now fire proximity-fuzed shells, further increasing its effectiveness in this role. The cannon's manufacturer Northrop Grumman just recently rolled out a new dual-feed system that allows operators to remotely switch between two ammunition types, such as the proximity rounds and ones better suited for use against targets on the ground. A picture of an XM914 configured with the new dual-feed system. Northrop Grumman BlueHalo has also supplied a Titan SV system for the new Stryker prototype, which is a radiofrequency sensor to help detect and track hostile drones. In addition, the vehicle also has Next-Gen Multi-Mission Hemispheric Radars (nMHR), which are small form factor active electronically scanned array (AESA) types, as well as a 360-degree array of cameras, to help spot, classify and track targets. The promotional video labels another antenna at the rear as an 'HMS,' but it is not immediately clear what that system is. An annotated image of the C-UAS DE Stryker Leonardo DRS capture No explicit mention is made in the video about networking capabilities, but being able to feed in targeting data from off-board sources, including other C-UAS DE Strykers, and/or share the information that its sensor suite is collecting with other assets would make good sense. Still, it is 'this directed energy [that] gives commanders options. It increases the stowed kills [magazine depth] available to a unit commander, and this is technology that's available to the warfighter today,' House stresses in the video. 'You can see we're out in the desert in New Mexico now. We've shot several drones down with the laser weapon system.' Functionally unlimited magazine depth, which Leonardo DRS' House refers to in the video, is regularly cited as a key benefit of laser directed energy weapons, as well as high-power microwave types, when compared to traditional guns or surface-to-air missiles. There is also some amount of cool down/recharge time between 'shots,' but each engagement costs dollars rather than the tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of dollars compared to more traditional surface-to-air interceptors. Firing traditional guns can be costly, as well. Lasers are not without pitfalls, however. In general, they are sensitive to smoke, clouds, rain, and other environmental factors that can disrupt the beam and reduce its effectiveness. The beam's power also drops the further away it gets from the source. Directed energy weapons often come along with substantial power generation and cooling requirements, as well. Though the technology has advanced by leaps and bounds in the last decade, U.S. military laser directed energy weapon programs, in particular, have been experiencing new and significant reality checks in the past year or so. This includes issues uncovered with another Stryker variant the Army has been acquiring already, called the Directed Energy Maneuver-Short Range Air Defense (DE M-SHORAD), which is armed with a 50-kilowatt laser weapon from Raytheon. Four of those vehicles were deployed to the Middle East for a field test in March, according to Breaking Defense. One of the Army’s initial prototype DE M-SHORAD vehicles. US Army One of the Army's initial prototype DE M-SHORAD vehicles. US Army 'What we’re finding is where the challenges are with directed energy at different power levels,' Dough Bush, Assistant Secretary of the Army for Acquisition, Logistics, and Technology, told members of Congress in May, per Breaking Defense. 'That [50-kilowatt] power level is proving challenging to incorporate into a vehicle that has to move around constantly – the heat dissipation, the amount of electronics, kind of the wear and tear of a vehicle in a tactical environment versus a fixed site.' At that time, Bush that 'some' unspecified users were seeing other laser weapons emplaced at fixed sites 'proving successful.' The Army Assistant Secretary did not name those systems. It is worth noting here that the service has already procured at least two 20-kilowatt LOCUST variants, called Palletized High Energy Lasers (P-HEL), and sent them overseas for limited field testing. The BlueHalo LOCUST laser weapon system. BlueHalo 'We’ve worked with industry to increase reliability across a number of those systems,' Army Lt. Gen. Robert Rasch, head of the service's Rapid Capabilities and Critical Technologies Office (RCCTO), said in a more recent interview with Breaking Defense in August. 'For the enduring high-energy laser, we believe — based on what we’ve seen and collected data – that industry is ready to produce systems that can reach the reliability levels and the affordability levels, to get in that group one through three UAS range.' This certainly seems to be what Leonardo DRS and its partners are aiming for now with the new C-UAS DE Stryker. 'What this shows is when industry works together we can help the army solve problems, and, in this case, we're moving directed energy forward for the Army,' Leonardo DRS' House says in the video released today. The Army is in the midst of a larger push to expand and modernize its air defense capabilities, especially shorter-range systems, and with a heavy focus on defeating drones. In addition to the DE M-SHORAD Stryker, the Army has also been fielding a baseline M-SHORAD Stryker variant, now named the Sgt. Stout, which is armed with a combination of Stinger heat-seeking short-range surface-to-air missiles, radar-guided AGM-114L Hellfire missiles, and an XM914 cannon, as well as an array of small AESA radars. Sgt. Mitchell William Stout gave his life during the Vietnam War protecting his fellow soldiers from a grenade and was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor. The original M-SHORAD vehicle and the DE M-SHORAD are also known as Increments 1 and 2 of the overall M-SHORAD program. Increment 3 is focused on integrating a replacement for the venerable Stinger, which you can read more about here, into the family of the systems. Increment 4, the requirements for which the Army publicly laid out in May, calls for a new, lighter system that can be air-dropped or lifted by helicopters to better support airborne and airmobile operations. The Army has said that the Increment 4 system could be fitted to a 4&#215;4 Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV), an uncrewed ground vehicle, or a combination of both depending on the exact configuration of the components. The future Stinger replacement, Raytheon's Coyote counter-drone interceptor, APKWS II, and the XM914 have all been presented as possible armament options. The idea of porting over the Incerment 1 M-SHORAD system onto a variant of the tracked Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicle (AMPV) has also been discussed. The Army has also been eying a Sytryker equipped with a high-power microwave directed energy weapon for use against drones. A SHORAD-configured AMPV.

GDLS Beyond M-SHORAD, the Army also has a growing force of Mobile, Low, Slow, Unmanned Aircraft Integrated Defeat System (M-LIDS). M-LIDS currently consists of various components, including Coyote interceptors and XM914 cannons, as well as electronic warfare systems and sensors, split between a pair of 4&#215;4 M-ATV mine-resistant light tactical vehicles. The service is now moving to consolidate M-LIDS onto a single Stryker. This, in turn, is causing the line between the dedicated counter-drone M-LIDS and the broader short-range air-defense-focused M-SHORAD efforts to become increasingly blurred.

Leonardo DRS Threats posed by drones, including weaponized commercial types, are not new, as The War Zone regularly highlights. However, the ongoing war in Ukraine has been central to a clearer understanding of these issues finally entering the mainstream discourse. The regular use of various tiers of drones by both sides of that conflict has caused an explosion in demand for new and improved capabilities to destroy or at least disrupt uncrewed aerial threats. The need now to defend tanks and other armored vehicles against drones, especially highly maneuverable first-person view (FPV) kamikaze types, has become particularly visible. On-vehicle capabilities and ones that can be used on the move are increasingly critical, as you can read more about in these past features.

Its worth pointing out here that high-power microwaves offer advantages over lasers when it comes to engaging swarms. Swarming and other capabilities, further enabled by advances in artificial intelligence, are pushing drones, in general, toward a major new evolutionary, if not revolutionary moment. Increasingly more capable uncrewed aerial systems are set to continue proliferating globally, too. At the same time, the barrier to entry when it comes to acquiring and employing weaponized commercial drones, which can still be very threatening, remains extremely low. This is a reality that is not lost on other branches of the U.S. military beyond the Army. In terms of ground-based systems, the U.S. Marine Corps is also particularly active on this front. That service has plans now to at least test a LOCUST-equipped JLTV of its own, as well as a high power microwave system one of those 4&#215;4 vehicles can tow in a trailer. Still, despite the obvious flurry of activity, the Army, as well as the rest of the U.S. military, continue to very much lag behind in their efforts to actually field various tiers of anti-drone defenses. This was underscored just recently by the appearance of an apparent Chinese-made laser directed energy weapon that is similar in some respects to the LOCUST, at least on paper, in actual use in the Iranian capital Tehran along with other new counter-drone capabilities. The actual capabilities that system offers are unclear, but it does highlight the active work that is going on in this arena now outside of the United States, especially in China. As already noted, the Army, especially, is trying now to really push forward with dramatic expansion of its air defense and counter-drone capabilities and capacity. Time will tell, but C-UAS DE Stryker, or a similar configuration, could well be part of that future ecosystem.

France’s Radical-Looking New Frigate Has Gone To Sea	The French Navy’s remarkable-looking new frigate, the Amiral Ronarc’h, is quickly winning plaudits on account of its rakish good looks. But the warship — the first of a new class of so-called defense and intervention frigates — is not just noteworthy on account of its striking visual appearance. It’s also a very interesting study of how to pack a considerable number of weapons and sensors onto a relatively small hull and operate them with a limited crew complement. The Amiral Ronarc’h sets out for sea trials on October 7. DGA DGA The Amiral Ronarc’h (hull number D 660) officially started sea trials earlier this week, setting sail from the Naval Group’s Lorient shipyard, in Brittany, western France, on October 7. In French parlance, the new warship is the first of a new class of Frégate de Défense et d’Intervention (FDI), or defense and intervention frigate. The Amiral Ronarc’h is the first of five FDI frigates being built by Naval Group for the French Navy under a contract awarded in 2017. Construction of the lead ship began in 2019, it was laid down in December 2021, and launched in November 2022. A photograph taken in December 2021 shows a part of the first FDI frigate during the laying down ceremony in Lorient. Photo by SEBASTIEN SALOM-GOMIS/AFP via Getty Images SEBASTIEN SALOM-GOMIS The second FDI for the French Navy, the Amiral Louzeau (D 661), started construction in July 2023. The French Navy’s third FDI, the Amiral Castex (D 662), is also now under construction. The Amiral Ronarc’h under construction in Lorient, in December 2022. KRaikkonen01/Wikimedia Commons In the meantime, another three vessels in the FDI family are also being built. These were ordered by Greece in 2022 (with an option for a fourth) and are required under a more compressed timeline. They are also somewhat different, including being more heavily armed, as we will discuss later. For now, however, the spotlight is very much on the Amiral Ronarc’h, with imagery of this warship receiving much interest as it goes to sea for the first time. The new frigate looks very different from almost every other surface combatant currently in service. The most prominent feature is the wave-piercing knife-like bow, which gives an appearance reminiscent of the design configuration known as a reverse bow, or inverted bow. There is also a dramatic chine that extends from the bow along the entire hull line. One of the first photos of the Amiral Ronarc’h during at-sea trials. Naval Group The French Navy’s FDIs will each have a displacement of around 4,960 tons. These warships are 400 feet long, have a beam of 59 feet, and will be capable of speeds of 27 knots, driven by a combined diesel and diesel (CODAD) propulsion arrangement. They will have an at-sea endurance of 45 days. They will typically be operated by a crew of 125, with provision to embark 28 additional personnel if required for certain missions. Naval Group describes these innovative vessels as 'bringing together the best of French naval technologies on a compact platform,' with the resulting warships being 'designed to cope with constantly evolving threats.' A computer-generated image of a replenishment at sea (RAS) of the frigate Amiral Cabanier. French Navy The vessels were designed and are being produced using digital tools, while an onboard digital architecture will ensure that they can be modified and upgraded to keep up with those threats, as Naval Group contends. 'The FDIs will be able to deal with current and future high-spectrum threats, with 360-degree coverage in all frequency bands, and process an ever-increasing amount of data,' the manufacturer claims. To deal with those threats, the French Navy’s FDIs are notably well armed, with a variety of weapons allowing them to undertake missions including anti-ship, anti-air, anti-submarine, and special forces projection, as well as dealing with asymmetric threats. For anti-ship missions, the French FDIs will be armed with eight Exocet MM40 missiles, in the latest B3C version. Able to hit targets at a range of around 124 miles, the Exocet MM40 flies at very low altitudes and at high subsonic speeds. It has an active radar seeker and the B3C model introduces a new navigation and propulsion package. The navigation system allows for the programming of 3D waypoints, optimized trajectories, and simultaneous terminal attacks involving multiple missiles. The primary anti-air weapon is the Aster surface-to-air missile, 16 of which are carried in a pair of eight-cell launchers. Combat-proven, the Aster is available in two main versions. The smaller Aster 15 has a range of around 18 miles, while the larger Aster 30 is able to engage targets at more than 75 miles. Recent improvements to the Aster 30 include enhancing its capabilities against anti-ship ballistic missiles (ASBMs), a relatively new type of threat that is being employed by the Houthis in their campaign against shipping in the Red Sea. A computer-generated image of an Aster 30 launch from the frigate Amiral Cabanier. French Navy MU90 torpedoes, in two dual tubes, are available for anti-submarine warfare. The vessels are also equipped with guns of various calibers, including a 76mm Oto Melara Super Rapid main gun and a pair of Narwhal 20mm remote weapon stations. Aviation options include a helicopter, such as the Caïman Marine (a version of the NATO Frigate Helicopter, NFH), the future Guépard Marine, and/or a vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) drone, with a hangar bay and stern landing area. A computer-generated image of the Amiral Cabanier accompanied by a Guépard Marine, and a vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) drone. French Navy Two commando boats can also be embarked to deploy raiding teams, special forces, and for force protection and minor logistics. The comprehensive sensor suite includes the new-generation Thales Sea Fire radar with four fixed arrays, mounted on the prominent pyramidal mast. The FDIs are also the first French warships of their kind to be protected against cyber threats from the outset. This includes a redundant IT architecture based around two data centers. A tug moves the Amiral Ronarc’h out of port for its first at-sea trials. Naval Group The design is also tailored to be more resilient to other novel and emerging threats. 'In terms of operational innovation, the FDI is inaugurating the concept of a gateway dedicated to combating asymmetric threats. This system will make it possible to coordinate and lead the fight against small, close air and surface threats, in particular booby-trapped craft,' Naval Group has said. The sea trials for the Amiral Ronarc’h are planned to be especially comprehensive, involving not only testing of the navigation and propulsion systems but also the various combat systems, which will be put their paces in real-life conditions at sea. Feedback from these trials will also help refine the forthcoming vessels in the FDI program as well as paving the way for the Amiral Ronarc’h to enter service, planned for 2025. The four remaining frigates for the French Navy are all scheduled to be delivered by 2030. This is despite some delays in the program, since the first sea trials for the Amiral Ronarc’h were originally planned for 2023, followed by delivery in 2024. A computer-generated image of a fleet tanker performing an underway replenishment simultaneously with the next-generation French Navy aircraft carrier and an FDI frigate. French Navy Once in service, the five FDI frigates will supplement the eight FREMM-type frigates, and will eventually supersede the five La Fayette class frigates, with the last of these scheduled to be withdrawn in 2035. Greece’s Hellenic Navy, meanwhile, is slated to receive two FDI frigates in 2025 and one in 2026. To meet the timeline, the second and third hulls originally planned to be delivered to the French Navy are instead being completed for the Hellenic Navy, which refers to them as the Kimon class. The first two Greek frigates, Kimon and Nearchos, were launched in October 2023 and September 2024 respectively. The reported cost of the Greek program is $3.5 billion, for the first three vessels. The Greek ships demonstrate the capacity for growth in the FDI design, with these warships featuring heavier armament. They feature three rather than two eight-cell Aster launchers, for a total of 24 Aster 15/30 missiles, with further air defense missiles provided in the form of a 21-cell Mk 31 launcher for the Rolling Airframe Missile Block 2B, to tackle close-in threats. The Kimon class also adds a land attack capability, with an eight-cell launcher for the Missile de Croisière Naval (MdCN), meaning Naval Cruise Missile. The MdCN is a maritime version of the air-launched SCALP/Storm Shadow and allows conventional attacks on high-value targets at a range of 'several hundred kilometers,' according to French sources. Other weapons changes include the Leonardo Lionfish 20mm remote weapon stations in place of the Narwhal on the French hulls. Naval Group plans to ramp up production to deliver two ships per year starting in 2025. Offering a useful blend of capabilities, via advanced weapons and sensors, and with a significant degree for future modernization, as well as different equipment options, it would not be a surprise of the FDI design wins more export orders in the future.

Search For Barrett .50 Caliber Sniper Rifle Replacement Halted By...	U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM) is no longer looking for a new heavyweight sniper/anti-materiel rifle, at least for now. The Extreme Long Range Sniper Rifle (ELR-SR) effort had been seeking possible successors to the famed Barrett M82 family of .50 caliber semi-automatic rifles, as well as lesser-known bolt-action McMillan Mk 15s in the same caliber. A US Marine fires a Barrett .50 caliber M82-series semi-automatic rifle in training. USMC SOCOM quietly announced it was shelving the ELR-SR project back on September 26. 'At the moment, we are not moving forward with this effort,' the command said in a brief contracting notice. 'We appreciate your interest and hard work in responding to this RFI [request for information],' the notice added. 'Due to changing priorities, we are pursuing other efforts.' No further details were provided. The War Zone has reached out to SOCOM for more information. SOCOM's Special Operations Forces Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics Center (SOF AT&L) first publicly laid out requirements for the ELR-SR last December. This included demands for the new weapon to be a bolt-action design and be consistently effective out to a range of at least 2,500 meters [approximately 2,734 yards] – greater than the stated effective range of M82 series rifles (including modernized M107 variants) or the Mk 15. The new rifle also had to be shorter and lighter than the existing .50 caliber types. A Naval Special Warfare operator trains with a Mk 15 Mod 1 rifle. USN At the annual SOF Week conference in May, SOCOM confirmed that it was open to rifles in new calibers to meet its ELR-SR needs and that the effort was building off previous work done by the Pentagon's Irregular Warfare Technical Support Directorate (IWTSD). An earlier IWTSD project called Extreme Sniper Strike Operations (ESSO) has produced a new very long-range precision cartridge called the .375 EnABELR (Engineered by Applied Ballistics for Extreme Long Range) and a bolt-action rifle to go along with it, which you can read more about here. As of at least March, IWTSD was still pursuing further development of the .375 EnABELR round. An M30-TS rifle in .375 EnABLER being fired. Applied Ballistics Applied Ballistics It is not entirely clear if the 'other efforts' SOCOM says it is now pursuing in lieu of ELR-SR are related to meeting the same or similar underlying operational needs, but in a different way, or if they are completely separate requirements that have taken precedence. 'Even if it’s [ELR-SR] just [the] improvement of our current .50 Cal systems, that’s fine too,' U.S. Army Col. John 'Tosh' Lancaster had told The War Zone and other attendees at the SOF Week conference earlier this year. 'We can make the .50 Cal better than it is right now. We haven’t done anything with that in a while.' Col. Lancaster is the Program Manager for Special Operations Forces (SOF) Lethality with U.S. Special Operations Command’s (SOCOM) SOF Warrior Program Executive Office. Both the original Barrett M82 and the McMillan TAC-50 on which the Mk 15 is based were first developed in the 1980s. Though there are no indications one way or the other that the two things are related, SOCOM's announcement about ELR-SR came three days after Barrett received a sole-source contract from the U.S. Army worth nearly $15 million for an unspecified number of M82/M107-series rifles, as well as 'spare parts, accessories and training.' A member of the US Army fires an M82/M107-series rifle. USAF An official justification for the Army's sole-sourced deal with Barrett is heavily redacted. None of the unredacted sections elaborate on the reason for buying the rifles or their expected recipients. Some of the guns might be intended to replace examples the U.S. military has transferred to Ukraine or be bound themselves for foreign allies and partners, as well as other branches of the U.S. government.

On September 4, the company announced a new direct deal with the Norwegian armed forces to upgrade their existing M82A1s to the newer M107A1 standard. There clearly continues to be demand, including among special operations forces, for the kinds of very long-range precision engagement capabilities that .50 caliber heavyweight sniper/anti-materiel rifles offer. These rifles can be very useful for trying to destroy or at least disrupt a variety of specialized targets including fuel and ammunition storage dumps, radar dishes, and even light vehicles, as well as enemy personnel. They can also fire a range of specialized ammunition, including types capable of producing incendiary and/or explosive effects. What other new capabilities SOCOM might now pursue instead of ELR-SR, or if it ultimately returns to seeking another similar new long-range precision rifle, remains to be seen. In the meantime, American special operators will continue to use their M82-series and Mk 15 rifles.

ARRW Hypersonic Missile Program Gets New Funding Despite Signs Of...	Lockheed Martin has received more than $13 million in additional funds for the AGM-183A Air-Launched Rapid Response Weapon (ARRW) hypersonic missile program. The deal could be part of work to wind down the effort, but is also the latest in a string of developments that have raised questions about its current status. The War Zone has already explored signs pointing to a potential follow-on to ARRW, possibly tied in with work on a related program called Tactical Boost Glide (TBG), which may already be occurring in the classified realm. On September 26, the U.S. Air Force awarded Lockheed Martin's Missile and Fire Control division a new modification, valued at $13,447,746, to an existing ARRW contact. The contract's cumulative value increased to $1,319,270,400 as a result. The news came in the Pentagon's daily contracting notice. A low-quality image of an ARRW after launch during a previous live-fire flight test. USAF 'Work will be performed in Orlando, Florida, and is expected to be completed by Aug. 31, 2025,' the Pentagon's notice added. 'Fiscal 2023 research, development, test, and evaluation funds in the amount of $13,447,746 are being obligated at the time of award.' No further details about the work to be performed were included. The War Zone reached out to Lockheed Martin for more information and was directed to contact the Air Force. We have since reached out to the Air Force for more information about this contract and ARRW's current status, but have not yet received a response. The Air Force did not request any additional funds for ARRW in its most recent budget request for the 2025 Fiscal Year, which the service rolled out earlier this year. The air-launched ARRW is what is known as a hypersonic boost-glide vehicle weapon. The missile uses a rocket booster to propel an unpowered hypersonic glide vehicle to an optimal speed and altitude and then releases it to glide down along a largely atmospheric flight path to its target. The vehicle travels at hypersonic speed, defined as anything about Mach 5, and is also designed to be able to make erratic movements along the way. The combination of speed and maneuverability makes weapons of this kind difficult to detect in enough time to act, let alone intercept, presenting major complications for defenders. A graphic showing, in a very rudimentary way, the difference in trajectories between hypersonic boost-glide vehicles, traditional ballistic missiles, quasi or aeroballistic missiles, and air-breathing hypersonic cruise missiles. GAO For a time, the AGM-183A looked set to become the Air Force's first operational hypersonic weapon. However, last year, the service had indicated it was looking to close out work on ARRW and to shift focus to air-breathing hypersonic cruise missiles, which function in a completely different manner from hypersonic boost-glide vehicle weapons. The ARRW program had a mixed testing record, at least from what is known publicly. As noted, it is very possible that the new ARRW funding Lockheed Martin received last month is part of the work now to shut things down. 'ARRW will complete contract closeout, finalize documentation and analysis, and activities to support the leave behind capability,' the Air Force said in its 2025 Fiscal Year budget request. 'Testing will enable ARRW to collect valuable data, build capacity and capability, allow hypersonics programs to leverage and build upon each other, and project the overall technology forward.' In line with this, the Air Force continued with its previously planned flight testing schedule for ARRW even after announcing its intention to pull the plug on the program last year. This culminated with a final end-to-end test, at least that we know of, over the Western Pacific in March of this year. That launch also provided an opportunity for a significant demonstration of capability and show of force aimed particularly at the Chinese government, as The War Zone highlighted at the time and that you read more about here. A live AGM-183A ARRW under the wing of a B-52 bomber at Andersen Air Force Base on Guam ahead of a test over the Western Pacific earlier this year. USAF At the same time, it continues to be unclear whether or not the Air Force is truly through with ARRW and/or whether a direct follow-on program may already be in progress. 'When we're in the classified session, I can go into a little bit of detail about the differences between those two capabilities, specifically, and then we'll highlight again what characteristics you need based on the mission set,' Air Force Lt. Gen. Dale White, the Military Deputy at the Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics told members of the House Armed Services Committee at a hearing in March. White was responding directly to a question about whether his service was more committed to hypersonic cruise missiles than hypersonic boost-glide vehicle designs. 'Let’s just say that there is a plan,' William LaPlante, the Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment, the Pentagon's top weapons buyer, had told members of Congress at another hearing back in February. 'It’s not something we can talk about in this open [unclassified] session. But we’d like to talk [in a classified setting].' Similar uncertainty continues to surround TBG, a separate, but related program that the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and Air Force run jointly that also involves work on an unpowered hypersonic boost-glide vehicle design. A least one TBG flight test is understood to have occurred, but where or when that was conducted has not been confirmed. A rendering of DARPA’s Falcon Hypersonic Technology Vehicle 2 (HTV-2) being released. HTV-2 was among several previous hypersonic developments that DARPA said fed into the Tactical Boost Glide (TBG) program. DARPA A rendering of DARPA's Falcon Hypersonic Technology Vehicle 2 (HTV-2) being released. HTV-2 was among the previous hypersonic developments that DARPA said fed into the Tactical Boost Glide (TBG) program. DARPA When asked by The War Zone about TBG testing to date back in April, a DARPA spokesperson declined to confirm or deny any tests had occurred or provide any details about their outcomes. They also said they could not provide more information about the program beyond what is on the agency's website. 'The Tactical Boost Glide (TBG) program is a joint DARPA/U.S. Air Force (USAF) effort that aims to develop and demonstrate technologies to enable future air-launched, tactical-range hypersonic boost glide systems,' according to the TBG program description on DARPA's website at the time of writing. 'TBG is a two-phase effort that plans to include ground and flight testing to mature critical technologies, and aims to demonstrate the system performance achievable through the integration of those technologies. The program is using a disciplined systems engineering approach to define demonstration system objectives and identify enabling technologies needed for future systems.' TBG was originally presented as a lead-in to ARRW, but the programs ultimately ended up being conducted in parallel. Lockheed Martin, the prime contractor on both programs, has said in the past that ARRW had ultimately pulled ahead in terms of design maturity. The Air Force has also said previously that work done under TBG was incorporated into the development of ARRW. DARPA had been exploring the potential for turning the TBG system into a sea-launched weapon and there are plans to transition elements of the program to the U.S. Navy in the future, as well. The Navy is pursuing a separate hypersonic boost-glide vehicle weapon with the U.S. Army, which is set to be integrated onto Zumwalt class stealth destroyers and Block IV Virginia class submarines, as well as fired from ground-based launchers. That missile has experienced its own testing troubles. Separate questions have emerged previously about the Air Force's plans for its air-breathing Hypersonic Attack Cruise Missile (HACM) program. 'It is early days in the program, and so you certainly hope that a program like HACM is on track at this stage, because it’s quite early. And they typically are, right? And so, I’d say it’s on track but it is a challenging program,' Andrew Hunter, Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics, told DefenseScoop in an interview published in December 2023. 'That’s why we’re undertaking a rapid prototyping effort really is to work through some of the potential risks, some of the potential technical risks associated with the HACM concept.' A rendering Raytheon has previously released in relation to the HACM program. Raytheon The Air Force, in partnership with the Australian armed forces, is still very publicly moving ahead with HACM. The first test of that missile, which Raytheon is leading the development of, could come as early as this month. Last week, Raytheon also received a new $73 million contract to help lay the groundwork for the production of those weapons. The hope is that HACM will reach at least a limited operational capability in 2027. Whatever the future might hold now for ARRW, some type of work at least on that program is funded now well into next year.

Bolt-M Aims To Make Kamikaze Drone Attacks More User Friendly, Ef...	Newcomer defense contractor Anduril has revealed its Bolt-M, an machine-learning infused strike drone, a quadcopter-type design that’s easily transportable and aims to put lethal precision firepower in the hands of individual soldiers. Bolt-M is already being lined up for testing by the U.S. Marine Corps, as that service looks to harness the capabilities of kamikaze drones, while its autonomous features point the way to a new generation of loitering munitions that are easier to use and more reliable than those currently fielded. The promise and dangers of AI-enabled lower-end aerial drones on the battlefield is something that TWZ has explored in depth in the past. Anduril is now looking to secure its position in this fast-changing field. Announced yesterday, the Bolt-M is part of a wider family of autonomous air vehicles that are man-portable and use the same basic vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) quadcopter platform. While the baseline Bolt is intended for surveillance and search and rescue, the Bolt-M (for munition) is more intriguing, building on the success and proliferation of smaller strike drones that have been used to great effect in Ukraine and elsewhere. Unlike the low-end kamikaze drones that are proliferating in Ukraine, which are primarily improvized first-person view (FPV) types, the Bolt-M uses machine learning and automation from the outset to make it easier to employ. Onboard software is used to 'automate the flight behaviors required to accurately track and strike a target, while providing human operators with four simple decisions: where to look, what to follow, how to engage, and when to strike,' the company explains in a press release. While the pilot of an FPV drone requires extensive training to successfully find and strike targets, the Bolt-M aims to provide soldiers with a much simpler way of achieving similar effects. The Bolt-M employs the now-familiar quadcopter configuration widely used in smaller drones. Anduril/YouTube screencap At the heart of Bolt-M is Anduril’s Lattice software platform that leverages AI and machine learning technologies. This automates the flight behaviors required to navigate to, find, track, and strike dynamic targets. While the drone features semi-autonomous waypoint navigation, the operator can also modify the flightpath using a touchscreen interface, although more basic navigation decisions are still made by the Lattice software, allowing the user to concentrate on other tasks. The operator can also select the distance from the target at which the drone should loiter, and the type of engagement profile to execute, depending on the target type and battlefield conditions. The drone’s object tracking capability means that the operator can draw a bounding box around any visually-acquired target using the drone's dual electro-optical and infrared camera. Bolt-M will then follow that target autonomously, but if a new threat emerges, the soldier can select it instead, meaning that time-sensitive and pop-up threats can be prosecuted. Bolt-M can also be used multiple times for reconnaissance in this manner. A target is selected on the Bolt-M ground control station (GCS). Anduril/YouTube screencap Automated target tracking of this kind is already making its way to the battlefield in Ukraine, albeit in a more rudimentary form. Being able to lock on to a target and complete the attack even if a communications link is degraded or lost entirely is extremely beneficial. First, it overcomes major issues with line-of-sight connectivity as the drone dives low to the ground to hit its target, where the feed to its controller degrades due topography and structures. It also makes the drone far less vulnerable to short-range electronic warfare systems, especially those mounted on vehicles themselves. The drone can continue its terminal attack run even if its communications link is totally disrupted via electroinc attack during the terminal phase of its attack run. There are other precedents for this kind of technology, notably the AeroVironment Switchblade, a series of miniature loitering munitions that have been in production for well over a decade and used extensively in Ukraine. These also offer a limited degree of autonomous attack capability, since, like the Bolt-M, the drone can fly itself to its target once it is designated by a human. In the Switchblade, this feature serves, above all, to improve the probability of a kill, especially when striking moving targets, but it is more austere than the suite of technology Anduril is brining forward with its Bolt-M. A U.S. Marine Corps anti-tank missile gunner prepares to launch a Switchblade drone during Littoral Exercise II (LEX II) on Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, March 3, 2022.

Julian Alvarado, prepares to launch a Switchblade unmanned aircraft system during Littoral Exercise II (LEX II) on Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, March 3, 2022. U.S. Marine Corps photo by Lance Cpl. Ryan Ramsammy More complex engagements can be carried out by the Bolt-M, too. For example, once a target is identified in Lattice, the soldier can select a standoff position for the drone. Bolt-M will remain there, typically out of visual or acoustic detection range, keeping track of the target and then striking it once instructed by the operator to do so. The soldier operating the drone can also optimize that terminal attack, selecting the most effective engagement angle and warhead fuzing, for example. Throughout, the operator can intervene in the engagement process, ensuring that the drone retains a human-in-the-loop, at least till the attack order is finalized, in line with U.S. Department of Defense protocol for lethal autonomous weapons. A screencap from a promotional video shows the detonation of a Bolt-M above a utility vehicle. Anduril/YouTube screencap It's worth noting that profusion of videos showing the successful employment of FPV drones in Ukraine — sometimes achieving accuracy that is hard to believe — belies the fact that many of these drones fail to hit their target. The need to make this class of weapon more reliable and resilient is pressing, although it remains a factor that will be balanced against cost and quality.

In this way, information gathered by Bolt-series drones can be shared with third-party platforms and commanders. Operating on a common software platform and across a common network, it's also possible that Bolt-M could be rapidly adapted to make cooperative 'swarming' attacks with a high degree of autonomy, although such a function hasn't been disclosed yet. In terms of performance, the Bolt-M drone has more than 40 minutes of endurance and a range of around 12 miles. The types of warheads include anti-personnel and anti-materiel, each of which can weigh up to three pounds. Different munition payloads can be carried, including some developed in collaboration with Kraken Kinetics, and others from Anduril. Typical targets include static or moving ground-based targets, including light vehicles, dismounted personnel, trenches, and more, Anduril says. The Bolt-M is provided with a mountable ground control station (GCS), and it’s designed for user safety, including an electronic safe and arm device (ESAD), meaning it can be transported across the battlefield without risk of detonation, and can be unpacked and launched in only five minutes. The same GCS can also be used for training and simulation, using the handheld interface. The safety interface for the Bolt-M as seen in a company video. Anduril/YouTube screencap Clearly, Bolt-M is inspired by the effectiveness of FPV drones in Ukraine and in other combat theaters but expands on the advantages of these kinds of lightweight, man-portable loitering munitions. By introducing a refined user interface powered by very capable and rapidly adaptable software, it should be far more reliable, easier to operate, and effective than an improvised FPV drone. That being said, cost remains a glaring unknown. While added features are great to have and better effectiveness on the battlefield is always a good thing, brining the price down to a point where Bolt-M can be bought in very large numbers could be critical to its success. This is also a field that is rapidly growing in terms of competition and is bound to get very price competitive in the near future. So far, we don't know the exact developmental status of Bolt-M, however, Anduril has confirmed that the U.S. Marine Corps will start testing it over the next six months, as part of 'a pretty rigorous test and evaluation campaign,' according to Anduril Chief Strategy Officer Chris Brose. This compressed timeline suggests that Bolt-M may well be informed by the company having tested similar capabilities already in Ukraine, as has been suggested. In April this year, Anduril was one of three companies (the others being Teledyne FLIR Defense and AeroVironment) that received a U.S. Marine Corps Systems Command (MARCORSYSCOM) contract under its Organic Precision Fires-Light (OPF-L) program. While OPF-L doesn’t specifically call for autonomous operations, it is looking for easy-to-use, explosives-laden, man-portable loitering munitions, as well as launchers for these weapons on ground vehicles and uncrewed surface vessels. Regardless, the appearance of Bolt-M is another very clear indicator that highly automated, feature rich, production class lower-end strike drones are fast becoming a reality.

North Korea Wading Deeper Into Russia’s War Against Ukraine	North Korea appears to be getting more deeply involved in the Ukraine war, going beyond supplying Russia with munitions. Its military engineers 'have been deployed to help Russia target Ukraine with ballistic missiles' it provided to Russia, The Guardian reported, citing senior officials in Kyiv and Seoul. Dozens of North Koreans are behind Russian lines, 'in teams that support launcher systems for KN-23 [short-range ballistic] missiles,' a source in Ukraine told the publication. As we reported earlier this year, North Korea began supplying Russia with those missiles, also known as Hwasong-11s, but about half were defective, according to an analysis from Ukrainian state prosecutors. North Koreans deployed alongside Russian troops in Ukraine, sources say Guardian Australia (@GuardianAus) October 10, 2024 South Korea’s Defense Minister, Kim Yong-hyun, told members of parliament in Seoul this week that it was 'highly likely' that North Korean officers had been deployed to fight alongside Russians, and as we previously reported, several had died last week in an attack on a Russian base in the Donetsk region. He did not give further details. The head of Ukraine’s Center for Countering Disinformation, Andriy Kovalenko, concurred. In a post on Telegram, he said that some North Koreans had been killed in Ukraine. His organization is part of the National Security and Defense Council. All this comes in the wake of North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un's visit to Russia for a summit with President Vladimir Putin where the two men bolstered their deepening ties with a secret arms deal. It was reported that, among other things, it called for Pyongyang to send construction and engineering forces to Russia-occupied territories of Ukraine for rebuilding work. There was no indication of how many personnel would be involved or the exact nature of their work. The increasing evidence of North Korean troops in Ukraine marks a big escalation. Foreigners have fought as mercenaries for Russia, 'but if North Koreans are on the ground it would mark the first time a foreign government has sent troops in uniform to support Moscow’s war,' the Guardian noted 'North Korea is likely to deploy members of its regular armed forces to Ukraine in support of Russia, South Korea's defense chief said Tuesday, in the latest sign of deepening military cooperation between Pyongyang and Moscow&#8230;'As Russia and North Korea have signed a mutual… pic.twitter.com/1HBKWjfE3t&mdash; Rob Lee (@RALee85) October 9, 2024 Aside from helping Russia, North Korea benefits from this relationship by testing its weaponry and giving its troops live combat experience. 'For North Korea, which has supplied Russia with many shells and missiles, it’s crucial to learn how to handle different weapons and gain real-world combat experience,' Lim Eul-chul, a professor at the Institute for Far Eastern Studies in Seoul, the Guardian reported. 'This might even be a driving factor behind sending North Korean soldiers – to provide them with diverse experiences and wartime training.' In addition to troops, Pyongyang has given Moscow about three million artillery shells a year, about half of what Russian forces are using in Ukraine, according to Western intelligence, The Times of London reported. 'Although many of the shells are believed to be faulty, the sheer quantity has allowed Russia to make steady gains, most recently capturing the eastern Ukrainian city of Vuhledar. Lt. Gen. Kyrylo Budanov, head of the Ukrainian Defense Intelligence Directorate (GUR), warned in September that shipments of North Korean shells were tilting the war in Russia’s favor. 'Our biggest problem from all these allies of Russia is from North Korea. Because with the volume of military products that they supply, they actually affect the intensity of the fighting,' he said. About half of the artillery shells used by Russia, about 3 million annually, come from North Korea, according to The Times. pic.twitter.com/c2ySBCPSCg&mdash; MilitaryNewsUA (@front_ukrainian) October 5, 2024 In addition to killing the North Korean officers, Ukraine has also attacked Russian facilities storing North Korean arms. On Wednesday the Ukrainian military said it destroyed North Korean ammunition in a strike on a depot in the town of Karachev, in Russia's Bryansk region, 60 miles from the Ukrainian border, Kovalenko said on Telegram.

However it appears to be clearly escalating its role. The Latest On the battlefield, Ukraine is 'mounting a strong defense' against Russia, with Russia’s Kursk region and Donetsk in eastern Ukraine seeing the heaviest fighting, a senior U.S. military official told reporters, including from The War Zone, on Wednesday. 'Up in Kursk, there have been some limited counterattacks by the Russians, but really there are no meaningful gains or exchanges of territory in the last several weeks, and then down in Donetsk, while the Russians did make some advances earlier in the summer, those advances have slowed compared to that time period.' Since February 2022, Ukraine 'has inflicted more than 600,000 casualties on Russian forces,' a senior U.S. defense official said at the same press briefing. 'In September of this year, Russia, Russian forces sustained more casualties in terms of both killed and wounded in action than in any other month of the war.' The bulk of the Russian casualties last month came during attacks on Pokrovsk and Vuhledar in Donetsk, the senior military official said, adding that Ukraine is taking a 'defense in depth' approach, trading territory for time with an eye toward a new offensive next year. 'My assessment is that the Ukrainians will be able to maintain their position and Kursk for some amount of time here into the future, I think several months and potentially beyond,' tne senior military official posited. There was little territory exchanged over the past few days according to the latest assessment from the Insitute for the Study of War (ISW). Kursk: Ukrainian and Russian forces 'continued assaults in Glushkovsky Raion west of the main Ukrainian salient in Kursk Oblast on October 7, 8, and 9 but did not make any confirmed advances,' ISW reported. Kharkiv: Russian forces recently advanced within Vovchansk amid continued offensive operations in northern Kharkiv Oblast on October 7, 8, and 9. 'Geolocated footage published on October 7 showing a Russian soldier raising a Russian flag in a building at the Vovchansk Aggregate Plant indicates that Russian forces likely recaptured the plant.' Luhansk: Russian forces recently advanced northwest of Kreminna amid continued offensive operations along the Kupyansk-Svatove-Kreminna line on October 8 and 9. Donetsk: Russian forces recently advanced near Siversk, southern Toretsk, southwest of Donetsk City and southeast of Pokrosk amid continued Russian offensive operations. Russian forces continued offensive operations near Chasiv Yar on October 7, 8, and 9, but there were no confirmed changes to the frontline in this area. Meanwhile, Ukrainian forces recently advanced during a counterattack east of Pokrovsk. Zaporizhzhia: Russian forces 'recently marginally advanced south of Stepnohirsk amid continued assaults in western Zaporizhia Oblast on October 7, 8, and 9,' ISW reported. 'Geolocated footage published on October 8 indicates that Russian forces recently marginally advanced in southwestern Kamyanske (south of Stepnohirsk).' Kherson: Russian forces continued assaults in the Kherson direction on October 7, 8, and 9, but there were no confirmed changes to the frontline in this direction.

The ban, announced by the internet regulator Roskomnadzor on Tuesday, 'highlights a glaring technology lapse within the Russian military,' The Washington Post reported 'More than 2½ years into the war, it has failed to implement a secure, dependable Russian-made communications system, instead relying on privately owned platforms such as Discord and Telegram.' The ban has also renewed a wider debate about how Russia’s bureaucratic machine keeps frustrating the military effort. 'A replacement should have been created and commanders should have been alerted to the plans so that the work at the front would simply not be broken in an instant,' one blogger wrote. 'It’s called seeing a little further than your nose.' You can see the value of Discord for Russian drone operators in the video below. Video reportedly from a Russian command post in Bakhmut.

Secretive X-37B Spaceplane To Use Aerobraking Maneuvers To Rapidl...	One of America's secretive X-37Bs is set to perform a series of aerobraking maneuvers that will significantly change its orbit, which is said to be a first-of-its-kind event for the mini-space shuttle. This is part of the seventh known X-37B mission, which began last December, and has already involved the reusable spaceplane operating in a much higher orbit than ever before. The U.S. Space Force, to which the two X-37Bs are now assigned, announced the planned orbital maneuvers as part of the current Orbital Test Vehicle 7 (OTV-7) mission earlier today. The X-37B that is now in space was launched aboard a SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida on December 28, 2023. A SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket carrying one of two X-37B reusable spaceplanes blasts off from the Kennedy Space Center's Launch Complex 39A on December 28, 2023. USSF Through the 'series of novel maneuvers, called aerobraking' the X-37B will 'change its orbit around Earth and safely dispose of its service module components in accordance with recognized standards for space debris mitigation,' according to the Space Force release. 'The use of the aerobraking maneuver – a series of passes using the drag of Earth's atmosphere – enables the spacecraft to change orbits while expending minimal fuel.' It isn't clear if the X-37B has already dropped to a lower orbit ahead of the aerobraking. As noted, the mini-shuttle will have to pass relatively close to the Earth to drag in the atmosphere to execute the maneuver at all. The use of aerobraking in space flight is not new and has been employed by NASA and other space agencies globally to change the orbits of other spacecraft for decades now. In its release today, Space Force also explicitly cited 'decades of general lessons learned from the scientific community conducting Moon and Mars missions,' along with experience gained during the previous six X-37B missions, as having contributed to the planning around these new maneuvers. 'Once the aerobrake maneuver is complete, the X-378 [sic; X-37B] will resume its test and experimentation objectives until they are accomplished, at which time the vehicle will de-orbit and execute a safe return as it has during its six previous missions,' the release adds. 'Since December 28, 2023, the United States Space Force, supported by the Air Force Rapid Capabilities Office, has conducted radiation effect experiments and has been testing Space Domain Awareness technologies in a Highly Elliptical Orbit.' A picture of an X-37B after completing a previous mission. USAF 'This novel and efficient series of maneuvers demonstrates the Space Force's commitment to achieving groundbreaking innovation as it conducts national security missions in space,' Secretary of the Air Force Frank Kendall said in an accompanying statement. 'This first of a kind maneuver from the X-37B is an incredibly important milestone for the United States Space Force as we seek to expand our aptitude and ability to perform in this challenging domain,' Gen. Chance Saltzman, Chief of Space Operations, also said. This all being said, there are immediate questions about whether or not this is actually a first-of-its-kind event for the X-37B, which is already known to be extremely maneuverable. It 'can do an orbit that looks like an egg and, when it’s close to the Earth, it’s close enough to the atmosphere to turn where it is,' then-Secretary of the Air Force Heather Wilson said at the annual Aspen Security Forum in 2019. 'Which means our adversaries don’t know – and that happens on the far side of the Earth from our adversaries – where it’s going to come up next. And we know that that drives them nuts. And I’m really glad about that.' It remains unclear what exactly Wilson was describing and whether this was a capability the X-37B had actually demonstrated at that time. The War Zone has posited in the past that this might have pointed to the mini-shuttle's having the ability to dip its wing into the Earth's atmosphere as it passed by, and to use that force to rapidly redirect its orbit. Wilson's comments were already highly curious at that time and fed into long-standing speculation about the exact capabilities and mission sets of the X-37B. The reusable spaceplane has a truckbed-sized main payload bay and can carry additional payloads on a service module adapter attached to its tail end.

U.S. Space Force One of the two X-37Bs with a payload adapted fitted to its rear end, seen here ahead of a record-setting mission that began in 2020 and ended in 2022. U.S. Space Force As The War Zone was first to report on in 2021, the specific unit within the Space Force that now oversees the X-37Bs, Space Delta 9, has what is still a very nebulous 'orbital warfare' mission. Space Delta 9 'is the focal point for preparing, presenting and projecting assigned and attached forces for the purpose of conducting protect and defend operations and providing national decision authorities with response options to deter orbital threats,' is how the Space Force described the unit's mission following a routine change in its top leadership earlier this year. Space-based early warning satellites are the most commonly cited capabilities in this ecosystem, as seen in the video below. Currently, the Air Force only acknowledges having only one 'counter-space' system, a terrestrial electronic warfare jammer called the Counter Communications System (CCS). 'We &#8230; are looking at the role of EW [electronic warfare], particularly against some of the space threats that are coming out,' Air Force Secretary Kendall told The War Zone and other outlets at a media roundtable on the sidelines of the Air & Space Forces Association's (AFA) main annual conference last month. 'So the space-based side of it's very important to us.' In the face of these ever-expanding threats to U.S. assets in orbit, including Russian work on a new space-based nuclear-armed anti-satellite weapon, Space Force is 'creating counter-space capabilities that allows us to be more resilient&#8230; and then when they [adversaries] have offensive capabilities of their own, our ability to either maneuver, to deny, to hide, to run,' Chief of Space Operations Saltzman said at a separate roundtable at the AFA conference. This came in response to a direct question on this topic from our own Howard Altman. When asked if he could further elaborate on these developments, Saltzman flatly said 'no.' Aerobraking maneuvers could be one means for space-based assets to evade hostile attacks. 'We must conduct&#8230; responsible counter-space campaigning,' Gen. Michael Guetlein, Vice Chief of Space Operations, also said while speaking at the Defense News Conference in September. 'This means we must develop capabilities to&#8230; protect and defend ourselves, but in doing so, we need to demonstrate safe and professional behavior in alignment with international norms of behavior, and we must work hard to protect the environment from additional pollution that could jeopardize the use of space for generations to come.' At that time, Guetlein noted that 'most of this kit is classified,' but that 'a lot of it is focused on defeating the adversary's kill webs, if necessary.' Patches seen on the shoulder of a member of Space Delta 9 during a change-of-command ceremony in July 2024. USSF In 2022, the U.S. government announced a self-imposed moratorium on destructive direct-ascent anti-satellite weapon testing and called on others to do the same. Such testing, like one Russia conducted in 2021, creates clouds of debris that pose significant threats to other objects in orbit. In addition, the new details today about the X-37B's operating envelope and activities as part of OTV-7 highlight additional outstanding questions about future reusable spaceplanes, including ones with greater offensive capabilities, that the U.S. military might be pursuing. Space Force's first-ever officially commissioned piece of artwork, seen below, notably explicitly depicts a reusable space plane intercepting a hostile 'killer satellite.' USSF The War Zone asked officials at the AFA conference last month about any plans to expand the X-37B fleet or develop a follow-on vehicle, which they declined to answer at the time. We have reached out since for more information, but have yet to receive a response. In the meantime, just what we know about the X-37B OTV-7 mission, including the newly disclosed planned aerobraking maneuvers and the previously announced novel high elliptical orbit, continues to be especially interesting in of itself.

Orphaned A-29 Super Tucano Attack Planes Join USAF Test Pilot Sch...	The renowned U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School (USAF TPS) at Edwards Air Force Base in California has received a trio of Embraer A-29 Super Tucano two-seat single-engine turboprop attack planes, which it says are its first newly assigned aircraft in almost three decades. Originally acquired to help Air Force special operations aviators train their foreign counterparts, the A-29s are now set to be used for various testing purposes, including of new weapons and sensors. The three A-29s touched down at Edwards back in August, but the Air Force's 412th Test Wing, which is responsible for the USAF TPS, only officially announced their arrival today. Pictures released along with the announcement show that one of the Super Tucanos, seen below, is still wearing a special heritage paint scheme that pays homage to the World War II-era 1st Air Commando Group, which supported allied forces in the China, Burma, and India (CBI) theater. The other two A-29s have standard overall gray paint jobs. The Super Tucanos all still look to be configured as light attack aircraft with a .50 caliber machine gun in each wing and the ability to carry various munitions and other stores on any of five pylons, two under each wing and one underneath the fuselage. The A-29 also has the ability to mount a sensor turret containing electro-optical and/or infrared cameras underneath its fuselage. USAF Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) received the three A-29s starting in 2021 to support its Combat Aviation Advisor (CAA). However, the service subsequently decided to stand down its two dedicated CAA units, the 6th and 711th Special Operations Squadrons, ostensibly as part of a broader shift in the U.S. military to preparing for future high-end fights after decades of counter-insurgency and other lower-intensity missions. CAAs had been heavily utilized during the Global War on Terror era, as you can read more about in this feature from Task & Purpose. The Air Force had also notably helped facilitate the delivery of Super Tucanos to various allies and partners over the years, especially the now-defunct Afghan Air Force, and otherwise experimented with the type in the past. As of last year, the Air Force's plan had been to completely divest AFSOC's A-29s, with one possibility being that they might get passed on to foreign countries. USAF TPS, which provides advanced flight training for experimental test pilots, flight test engineers, and flight test navigators, now seems to have eagerly accepted the orphaned turboprops. 'The Air Force Test Center and [Test Pilot] School leadership saw these excess aircraft as a unique opportunity to expand the flight test and training capabilities at Edwards,' according to today's release from the 412th Test Wing. 'The decision to transfer A-29 aircraft to Edwards is a result of thoughtful analysis by the Test Pilot School and an excellent example of command agility and collaboration to take advantage of a unique, fleeting opportunity,' Michael Banzet, director of plans and programs for the Air Force Test Center, also said in a statement. 'Not only does this repurpose a $63 million taxpayer investment, it also modernizes and expands TPS curriculum to accelerate the fielding of combat capability for the USAF.' One of the gray-painted A-29 Super Tucanos that is now assigned to the USAF TPS. USAF Interestingly, the Air Force has also explicitly cited the demands of the U.S. military's new focus on future high-end conflicts as having helped drive this decision. 'As part of a broader shift in response to Global Power Competition, the Air Force Test Pilot School’s mission is evolving to meet strategic need,' the release from the 412th Test Wing says. 'A refined three-pillar focus includes development of world-class staff, creating highly adaptive critical thinking test leaders, and advancing cutting-edge research.' USAF 'While the A-29’s airframe design is perfect for spin testing, the Super Tucano also offers an array of modern avionics with the ability to externally hang equipment through various wing pylons,' it continues. 'This will allow the school to conduct training and research on a variety of multi-domain sensors and weapons, reducing reliance on T-38 and F-16 aircraft while enhancing the ability to perform aspects of the developmental test mission tasked to the Air Force Test Center.' In addition to T-38s and F-16s, the USAF TPS regularly makes use of Air Force C-12s, which are militarized variants of the twin-engine turboprop Beechcraft King Air family. A picture of an A-29 equipped with a sensor turret in service with the now-defunct Afghan Air Force. USAF It's also interesting to note here that around the same time AFSOC first acquired the three A-29s, the Air Force also purchased a pair of Beechcraft AT-6E Wolverines to support light attack experimentation efforts. The Wolverine is based on the T-6 Texan II trainer, which is in service with the Air Force and the U.S. Navy. This included work on a low-cost communications and data-sharing architecture intended primarily for American allies and partners called Airborne Extensible Relay Over-Horizon Network, or AEROnet. The two-seat single-engine turboprop AT-6E is similar, but also different in many respects to the Super Tucano, as you can read more about here. The current status of those aircraft is not immediately clear. One of the two AT-6Es the Air Force acquired in the early 2020s. USAF The acquisition of the AT-6Es had evolved from a succession of abortive Air Force light attack aircraft programs starting around 2017, which had in turn followed on-again-off-again interest in such a capability dating back even further. Those efforts have since evolved into U.S. Special Operations Command's Armed Overwatch program and the OA-1K Sky Warden, a light attack derivative of the Air Tractor AT-802 crop duster, which you can learn more about here. The arrival of the A-29s certainly comes at a particularly significant moment in time for USAF TPS. It is very actively involved at present in supporting work on artificial intelligence (AI), autonomous capabilities, and other advanced uncrewed aircraft efforts. This includes a milestone AI-driven dogfight involving the school's specialized X-62A test jet, a highly modified two-seat F-16D, earlier this year. Many of these developments are feeding into other programs, such as the Air Force's Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) effort. In this context, especially, using the A-29s to help free up F-16s, including the specialized X-62A, as well as T-38s for testing that requires their higher performance and other capabilities, makes good sense. The Super Tucanos do still offer high degrees of agility and performance, but at speeds closer to the USAF TPS' C-12s, allowing them to carry out tasks that fast jets simply cannot. The A-29s also have robust avionics packages that can be altered for all different test purposes. The A-29s give USAF TPS organic assets that are dissimilar from ones in widespread use in the U.S. military, as well. The school often contracts out for such aircraft to give students familiarity in a broader array of types. The speed and performance of the Super Tucanos would also make them well suited to acting as chase planes for drones. In addition, F-16s and T-38s could just have to fly less thanks to the arrival of the A-29s, helping to reduce operating costs and wear and tear on those jets. The Super Tucano offers a platform that is less expensive to fly, in general, regardless of what tasks it might be given. USAF If nothing else, the three ex-AFSOC A-29s are now entering a completely different chapter in their service to the Air Force.

Protective Nets To Shield F-22s Eyed For Airbase Swarmed By Myste...	U.S. Air Force officials at Langley Air Force Base in Virginia are looking at installing anti-drone nets to help protect F-22 Raptor stealth fighters on the flightline. This comes nearly a year after the base was subjected to waves of still-mysterious drone incursions, which The War Zone was first to report. It also underscores the U.S. military's continued lag when it comes to responding to the very real threats posed by uncrewed aerial systems, at home and aboard, and particular hurdles to doing so domestically. Langley's 633rd Contracting Squadron put out a notice on October 4 asking for information about potential counter-drone netting that could be installed around up to 42 existing open-ended sunshade-type shelters at the base. Langley, now technically part of Joint Base Langley-Eustis, is one of a select few bases to host F-22s and is a key component of the Air Force's posture to defend the U.S. homeland. A pair of F-22 Raptor stealth fighters turn on final approach to Langley Air Force Base in Virginia. USAF The 633rd 'is in the process of determining the acquisition strategy to obtain non-personal services for the Unmanned Ariel Services (UAS) Netting for East Ramp Metal Sunshades,' according to the contracting notice. 'The intention of the netting is to deter and ultimately prevent the intrusion of UAS’s near airmen and aircraft. This initial sunshade netting installation on the metal sunshade (bay Alpha 1) shall serve as a proof of concept for the remaining sunshades.' The 'netting should be capable of disabling a Group 1/ 'Small' Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS), such as the DJI Matrice 300 RTK, while remaining attached,' the notice explains. Per the U.S. military's definitions, drones in Group 1 can have weights of up to 20 pounds, fly up to 1,200 feet, and reach speeds of up to 100 knots. The 'netting shall be composed of a UV-resistant, moisture-resistant material capable of withstanding temperatures up to 400°F without damage. It shall also have a tensile strength of 200 lbs. or greater. Polyester or nylon are preferred materials, but any material with adequate properties is acceptable. Netting squares shall be no larger than 3' across,' the notice adds. 'Additional hardware and cabling should be strong enough to support the net and potential push or pull due to 40 mph winds when the netting is deployed and 120 mph (3-second gust) when netting is retracted/stowed. When retracted/stowed, the netting must be adequately secured. Lead core or other forms of weights installed along the bottom of the netting may be necessary to prevent the netting from blowing into aircraft or personnel; design may include recessed anchoring to existing concrete pad. Alternative means of anchoring the netting may also be acceptable.' However the nets are configured and installed, the 633rd says they need to be 'quickly and easily retractable' so F-22s can get in and out without issue. The installations also can't impede movement along the adjacent taxiways in any way. A graphic offering general details about the sunshade-type shelters at Langley that could now be in line to receive anti-drone nets. USAF In May, the 4th Contracting Squadron at Seymour Johnson Air Force Base in North Carolina put out a similar call for potential 'passive' drone defense options, which could also include nets, to help protect that base's F-15E Strike Eagle combat jets. As already noted, the possibility now of adding anti-drone nets to the sunshades at Langley comes after that base experienced a series of still-unexplained drone incursions over the course of several weeks last December. Though the Air Force said at the time that there did not appear to be any 'hostile intent' behind those incidents, they still prompted a major whole-of-government response that you can read more about in detail here. Langely had been subjected to unauthorized drone incursions before then that the Air Force acknowledged had both disrupted operations at the base and highlighted potential threats, as well. 'One day last week I had two small UASs that were interfering with operations… At one base [Langley], the gate guard watched one fly over the top of the gate check, tracked it while it flew over the flight line for a little while, and then flew back out and left,' now-retired Air Force Gen. James 'Mike' Holmes, then head of Air Combat Command (ACC), said back in 2017. 'Imagine a world where somebody flies a couple hundred of those and flies one down the intake of my F-22s with just a small weapon on it.' When that news emerged, The War Zone noted that it would be ever easier for a hostile actor to simply target aircraft exposed while parked on the flightline. Doing so would also offer adversaries a means to neutralize large numbers of planes before they could even into the fight. A F-22 exits a sunshade-type shelter at Langley Air Force Base. USAF Samuel King Jr. The War Zone has otherwise been sounding the alarm about threats posed on and off traditional battlefields by drones, including small commercial types like the DJI Matrice 300 RTK mentioned in the 633rd's contracting notice that can be readily weaponized, for many years now. Worrisome incidents around U.S. bases and other military assets domestically, including ships off the coast of Southern California and aircraft flying in restricted airspace, as well as critical non-military infrastructure within the United States have only continued to emerge in recent years. Just in August, we were the first to report on a series of mysterious drone incursions around the Air Force's Plant 42 in Palmdale, California, which ultimately led to the imposition of new temporary flight restrictions around the facility. Plant 42 is a top hub for advanced aerospace development work, including highly classified military programs like the B-21 Raider stealth bomber. The first pre-production B-21 Raider in a hangar at Plant 42. USAF The first B-21 in a hangar at Plant 42. USAF This is a concerning trend that has now also been steadily emerging globally. The ongoing fighting in Ukraine has now fully driven the reality of uncrewed aerial threats, especially when it comes to highly maneuverable first-person view (FPV) kamikaze drones and other smaller weaponized types, into the mainstream discourse. Both Ukrainian and Russian forces have actively been targeting each other's aircraft on the ground, including with drones and over great distances. Ukrainian drone operators located a concentration of Russian hardware inside a large warehouse somewhere in the south of Ukraine, preparing for an assault.The very skilled drone operators sent in several drones and eliminated several MBTs, IFVs, trucks and more.

The bar to entry, particularly when it comes to acquiring and employing FPV-type and other smaller weaponized drones, is already very low. This all, in turn, has also prompted a new explosion in demand for counter-drone capabilities, including within the U.S. military. It's interesting to note here that nets were among the first countermeasures to emerge on the battlefield in Ukraine. This morning there was a video with anti-drone nets hanging Wagner above the road near Bakhmut, and already in the evening a video testing their effectiveness pic.twitter.com/eGXVbfsrJ1&mdash; MilitaryNewsUA (@front_ukrainian) September 25, 2023 Installing nets at Langley certainly represents one option for helping to address threats posed by smaller drones, but also one that would be most useful as part of a larger layered array of active and passive defensive measures. As the 633rd's contracting notice makes clear, the immediate goal with the nets is only to shield against very localized intrusions by the lowest tier of drones. The fact that this initial contracting process has only begun now after the December drone incursions and the ones in 2017, which are just the incidents at Langley we know about, is also telling. This comes amid a larger debate inside the U.S. military and out about how best to protect American military bases and other assets domestically, as well as forces in the field, from drones. Members of Congress have been particularly vocal in recent months in their criticism of steps the U.S. military has taken to date, especially when it comes to hardening physical infrastructure against uncrewed aerial systems and other threats, as you can read more about in detail here. An F-22 taxis away from a hangar at Spangdahlem Air Base in Germany during a deployment there in 2015. The Air Force is currently engaged in a particularly vocal debate about whether it should be building more robust shelters to protect its aircraft from drones and other threats. USAF At the same time, the U.S. military also continues to be faced with a morass of often convoluted legal, regulatory, and other challenges when it comes to implementing counter-drone capabilities domestically. The previous contracting notice from Seymour Johnson explicitly highlighted the attractiveness of 'passive' defense options since they are not subject to Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) restrictions. Efforts have been made in the past to try to expand and otherwise streamline authorities available to U.S. military forces to take more active actions against drone threats, but issues clearly remain. These same factors also apply to other branches of the U.S. government. There have been legislative proposals from members of Congress just in the past few months to give new domestic counter-drone authorities to the Department of Homeland Security, Department of Justice, and the Central Intelligence Agency. The recent anti-drone net contracting notice Langley only further underscores the critical need now to address these issues and otherwise take steps to help defend bases and other key assets against uncrewed aerial threats with an array of capabilities.

Hurricane Milton Could Be Sum Of All Weather Fears For MacDill Ai...	Surrounded by more than seven miles of coastline and sitting just 14 feet above sea level at its highest elevation, MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa, Florida juts out into Hillsborough Bay like a uvula. Given its location, longstanding concerns exist that a major hurricane could swamp the headquarters of U.S. Central Command, U.S. Special Operations Command and dozens of other base tenant units. Now Hurricane Milton is storming its way toward Florida’s west coast, expected to make landfall south of Tampa as a Category 4 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of up to 160 miles per hour. Two weeks after suffering damage from Hurricane Helene, MacDill officials are preparing for what could be storm effects unlike anything this base has seen in its 83 years of operations. Google Earth view of MacDill AFB that sits in the heart of the bay in Tampa. (Google Earth) Google Earth image Even though Helene made landfall in Perry, Florida, about 160 miles north of MacDill, the base saw a record-breaking storm surge of seven feet, nine inches, a spokesperson for the 6th Air Refueling Wing (ARW), the base host unit, told The War Zone. The latest forecast as of Noon Eastern time Wednesday shows Milton, a massive hurricane, striking Sarasota, about 35 miles south of the base.

Laura Anderson told The War Zone Wednesday morning. BREAKING: The storm surge for Hurricane Milton is expected to be 15 feet.To give you an idea of how deadly this is, here's what 9 feet looks like:pic.twitter.com/0SxfrA9XK3 Financelot (@FinanceLancelot) October 8, 2024 The base, however, is still within the cone of uncertainty, meaning that Milton could still strike it directly or come very close. That would be devastating to the entire Tampa Bay region with a population of more than 3.3 million people and put most of MacDill under water. 'Approximately 93% of MacDill AFB is within the 100-year floodplain,' according to a 2022 base resource management plan. 'Tropical storms typically flood much of the southern and northwestern portions of MacDill, and all of the base proper would be flooded by a Category 3 or greater hurricane.' Anticipating MacDill could be hit hard, Col. Ed Szczepanik, the installation commander, ordered a mandatory evacuation of the base on Oct. 7, effective by Oct. 8. The base has 26 KC-135 Stratotankers flown by the 6th ARW and the 927 ARW. All that were able to fly left for McConnell Air Force Base in Wichita Kansas. There are also Black Hawk helicopters from an Army Reserve unit that have evacuated as well. The 20,000 people who work on MacDill as well as the residents of nearly 600 homes were ordered to leave the base.

Aircraft were relocated due to projected winds and are expected to return once flying conditions are favorable. (U.S. Air Force photo by Senior Airman Sterling Sutton) All this is taking place as turmoil roils CENTCOM’s area of responsibility. Israel has promised to launch a retaliation attack on Iran. It is also fighting Hamas, Hezbollah and the Houthis, who have waged a nearly year-long campaign attacking shipping in the Red Sea region. 'We are maintaining 24-7 operations working out of alternative sites,' CENTCOM spokesman Col. John Rigsbee told The War Zone. Opened in 2011, CENTCOM’s headquarters is one of the newest buildings on MacDill. It was constructed to withstand hurricane-force winds and rising water. 'We are preparing for the worst,' Rigsbee explained. 'We won’t know until we see the full extent of damage, but we are fully prepared to continue operations even if systems at headquarters are down. There are plans in place to maintain operations. We are not going down and it won’t take too much time to return.' The new CENTCOM headquarters, which opened in 2011, was built to withstand hurricanes. (Clark Construction) In the meantime, CENTCOM personnel are working out of several locations, including Raymond James Stadium and Homestead Air Reserve Base near Miami, where the Joint Operations Center will be set up, a U.S. defense official told The War Zone. SOCOM 'dispersed to three different locations,' Col. Alexandra Weiskopf, the command spokesperson, told The War Zone. 'With our Washington D.C. office, we will have comms up in four different locations and there will be no degradation to our continuity of operations.' MacDill being devastated by a hurricane is something 'we always thought was a possibility,' retired Army Gen. Joseph Votel, who ran both commands, told us. 'There was a plan to use Raymond James in the event of a serious issue at MacDill. I always thought SOCOM headquarters was very vulnerable - but CENTCOM headquarters was built with a hurricane in mind.' The SOCOM building 'was old and only two stories,' Votel explained. 'Power sources and data centers were largely at ground level.' An aerial view of McDill AFB. (Tatiraju.rishabh/wikicommons) As for concerns about the base being so badly damaged, that it would remain unusable, Votel said he didn’t 'recall any discussions about never coming back - we may have lacked imagination.' The 6th ARW will have a 185-member hurricane recovery team at Raymond James Stadium ready to assess any damage as soon as it is safe enough, Capt. Kaitlin Butler, a wing spokesperson, told us. Meanwhile, the base is still in the last throes of post-Helene cleanup. 'The biggest problems with Helene were storm surge and power outages,' Butler said. There was some flooding affecting the water treatment facility, she added, but for the most part, full base operations were quickly restored.

Kaitlin Butler and 2nd Lt. Laura Anderson) A direct or close hit could be a different story. The Defense Department is spending nearly $5 billion to rebuild Tyndall Air Force Base in the Florida Panhandle, which was directly in the path of Category 5 Hurricane Michael on Oct. 10, 2018. Most of that damage was caused by the winds blowing in at 160 miles per hour. Aircraft that were left behind faced damage or destruction.

(Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images) Scott Olson There are other military installations in Florida preparing to deal with Milton, including those on Florida's east coast, near where Milton could cross over. 'Space Launch Delta 45 is monitoring Hurricane Milton and will continue making preparations as weather dictates,' spokeswoman Maggie Nave told us. 'Patrick Space Force Base and Cape Canaveral Space Force Station have entered [hurricane preparation] HURCON status, which will be adjusted based on the anticipated timing of storm impacts. At this time, tenant units have moved aircraft assets out of the local area.' Naval Station Mayport has sent three Arleigh Burke class guided missile destroyers underway, while those vessels unable to leave are being placed on heavy moorings, spokesman David Holmes told us. The station has shut down operations and only essential mission personnel are allowed in. Naval Air Station Jacksonville is being closed for two days, with personnel slated to come back as early as Friday depending on what happens, spokesperson Kaylee Larocque told us. In addition '26 U.S. Navy MH-60R Seahawks and approximately 200 personnel from Naval Station Mayport and Naval Air Station Jacksonville, Florida relocated to Maxwell Air Force Base in preparation for Hurricane Milton,' according to officials there. The preparations being made for Hurricane Milton are another stark reminder of how climate is affecting the military, especially in locations like Florida prone to these natural disasters While there are no plans to shutter places like MacDill and Tyndall, the cost to keep them operational in the face of major hurricanes like Milton will only rise.

Signs Point To North Korea Building A Nuclear-Powered Submarine: ...	North Korea appears to have started building a new submarine, which may feature nuclear propulsion, according to a South Korean official. The development would be in line with previous reports and follows the launch, last September, of a reworked Cold War-era Romeo class diesel-electric submarine designed to carry ballistic missiles. You can read more about that ‘Frankensub’ project here. 'Partial signs that appear to be the start of the submarine’s construction have been detected,' South Korea’s Defense Intelligence Agency said in a report to Representative Kang Dae-sik of the ruling People Power Party. 'As construction is still in its early stages, further confirmation is needed on whether it is nuclear powered,' the report said. A satellite image of the Pongdae Submarine Factory on the northeast coast of North Korea, the center of its submarine development activities. Google Earth An unnamed South Korean military official told the country’s Yonhap News Agency that construction work on the submarine had been identified in the northeastern Sinpo area — presumably at the Pongdae Submarine Factory — and that the boat was bigger than previous ones fielded by North Korea. 'Its exact tonnage and other [details] can be accurately determined once progress is made,' the same official said. The South Korean military’s assessment that the new submarine could be nuclear-powered seems to be based on its size, with no publicly available evidence at this point that North Korea has developed a suitable nuclear reactor for such a boat. However, there have been statements from the leadership in Pyongyang that a nuclear-powered submarine is planned. At the Party Congress in January 2021, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un announced that 'the design of a new nuclear-powered submarine was researched and was in the stage of final examination.' Kim added that design work on various weapons and sensors for such a design had already been completed. A man watches a television screen showing news footage of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un attending the Party Congress in Pyongyang, on January 6, 2021. Photo by JUNG YEON-JE/AFP via Getty Images JUNG YEON-JE A future North Korean nuclear-powered submarine was mentioned by the country’s state media after Kim presided over the launch ceremony for the diesel-electric submarine named Hero Kim Kun Ok (hull number 841) that took place at Sinpo on September 6, 2023. The North Korean diesel-electric submarine Hero Kim Kun Ok (hull number 841). KCNA There were also reports from earlier this year that work on such a boat might already be underway. In January, Kim is said to have inspected a nuclear-powered submarine under construction, as well as watching a 'strategic cruise missile' test. These events were reported by Pyongyang’s state media, but no photos or further details of the new submarine were released. Again, Sinpo was identified as the likely location of the construction work. State media reports on Kim inspecting the nuclear submarine project for the first time, but doesn't show images of the sub. Also says cruise missiles were launched from underwater but doesn't show the sub involved (if it wasn't a submersible barge anyway) Colin Zwirko (@ColinZwirko) January 28, 2024 Kim was said to have received 'a detailed understanding of the nuclear submarine construction' as well as providing instructions about 'issues' related to it. It should be noted that, despite these reports, the choice of nuclear propulsion for North Korea’s next submarine remains unconfirmed and there has been skepticism in the past whether such ambitions are even realistic. Historically, submarine reactors have been particularly complex to master, given the demanding integration and power-generation requirements. The ability of North Korea to build a nuclear-powered submarine is certainly questionable, although the country’s increasingly close relations with Russia since the start of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine could well have provided Pyongyang with technologies and expertise that would help achieve this. Since the start of North Korea’s military support for Russia in the war in Ukraine, TWZ has raised the possibility of reciprocal assistance from Moscow, which could well focus on nuclear and advanced missile technologies. Help in building a new submarine might also be an option. If the Hero Kim Kun Ok reflects the current state of the art of North Korea’s submarine-building capabilities, then a nuclear-powered design does indeed look a long way off, although it’s not impossible. The Hero Kim Kun Ok is essentially a very deep rework of a Soviet-designed Romeo class diesel-electric submarine with a new capability for submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs), thanks to a grafted-on missile compartment behind the sail. As well as SLBMs, the submarine appears to be able to launch cruise missiles, or perhaps SLBMs of two different sizes (offering differing ranges and payloads). Hatches in the missile compartment of the Hero Kim Kun Ok. The forward four are larger than the rear six, indicating a mix of missile payloads. KCNA Despite its bizarre appearance, the non-nuclear Hero Kim Kun Ok reinforces the fact that North Korea is busy trying to build a second-strike nuclear deterrent in the form of SLBMs and submarine-launched cruise missiles (SLCMs). The ‘Frankensub’ is far from ideal, however, as we have discussed before. If it becomes operational, it will be very noisy and easily tracked once on patrol. Furthermore, with only one or two boats capable of nuclear deterrent patrols, the North Korean nuclear second-strike deterrent is not the most credible. A nuclear-powered boat would offer huge benefits here, including essentially unlimited underwear endurance and potentially reduced acoustic signature, among others. Pyongyang’s previous efforts to field SLBMs onboard operational submarines have achieved only limited success. The lone example of the Gorae class is also based on a significantly modified Romeo class attack sub. Kim Jong Un, in gray in the foreground, talks to other North Korean officials while inspecting a Gorae (modified Romeo) class submarine. North Korean State TV capture That being said, the development of these submarines is still significant for North Korea, and building a new and larger submarine design — nuclear-powered or otherwise — would be the logical next step. It’s worth noting that Pyongyang has also struggled with fielding a workable SLBM, hampered to a significant degree by the lack of a genuinely suitable submarine to launch it from. At the same time, North Korea has developed increasingly large SLBMs, without any obvious submarine hull big enough to accommodate them. That, too, points to the development of a new and larger submarine design. SLBMs identified as the Pukguksong-5 on parade in January 2021. These are the biggest North Korean SLBMs seen so far. KCNA Presuming the new submarine is nuclear-powered, it’s possible that it could also be intended as a hunter-killer attack submarine, although North Korea’s emphasis on offensive missile capabilities would seem to make this much less likely. On the other hand, it could also be a testbed for new technologies, which would be especially useful if North Korea has actually developed a suitable reactor, or plans to, perhaps with Russian assistance. Speaking to TWZ, Alex Luck, an analyst who closely follows submarine developments, especially in the Indo-Pacific region, said that a nuclear-powered design would not be unexpected, based on previous official statements. However, 'the technical challenges would still seem daunting, assuming North Korea isn’t receiving assistance from elsewhere.' Luck said he hasn’t seen any detailed reports assessing that North Korea has developed a suitable reactor design, but also raises the possibility that the new submarine isn’t a 'classic nuclear-powered' boat, but perhaps some sort of hybrid. This could be a conventionally powered submarine with an auxiliary or experimental nuclear reactor, similar to how some reports describe the mysterious new (and unrelated) Chinese Type 041, or Zhou class submarine.

REPRINTED BY PERMISSION PHOTO © 2024 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION Interestingly, Luck also identifies a new assembly hall at Sinpo adjacent to the one in which the modified Romeo design was completed last year, which could also point to the new submarine design being built here. Luck also notes that it’s possible the ‘new’ submarine is actually another modified Romeo, which would seem operationally logical considering last year’s launch, although wouldn’t really explain the apparent size discrepancy. Kim riding on a Romeo class years ago. The type dates back to the 1950s and still makes up the backbone of the North Korean Navy’s submarine fleet. KCNA That explanation would, however, fit with Kim’s statement at the launch of the Hero Kim Kun Ok, during which he spoke of a 'plan to remodel existing medium-sized submarines into offensive ones loaded with tactical nuclear weapons to play an important role in modern warfare,' as part of what he described as a 'low-cost ultra-modernization strategy.' Overall, North Korea’s submarine force still dominates that of the South in terms of numbers, with as many as 86 boats, although this total includes midget submarines. South Korea operates around 21 submarines, although it’s also notably developing an SLBM capability for its latest diesel-electric boats. For now, South Korea is busily working on conventionally armed SLBMs, but there are growing suggestions that it might also look to introduce a nuclear capability in the future. This comes against the backdrop of worsening relations on the peninsula overall and an expanding dialogue between South Korea and the United States in terms of joint nuclear-planning exercises. South Korea is working to add a conventional SLBM capability to its Dosan Ahn Changho class diesel-electric submarines. DAPA Until we see some imagery or other technical detail, it’s too early to make any definitive conclusions, although there’s little doubt that submarines — and especially ones able to provide a second-strike deterrent capability — are a priority for North Korea.

New Vision For Lift Fan Aircraft Family Grows From Special Operat...	Aurora Flight Sciences has released new renderings of an uncrewed fan-in-wing vertical take-off-and-landing capable demonstrator aircraft it is currently working on, as well as of a revised vision for a scaled-up cargo aircraft based on the same technology. The demonstrator is being developed under a U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) program centered on interest in a new high-speed, runway-independent special operations transport plane. Aurora's unveiling of the new renders also comes amid growing interest from the U.S. Air Force in similar capabilities to support more general distributed logistics missions, especially in contested environments during future high-end conflicts. Aurora, a subsidiary of Boeing, shared the new renders and provided more information about the work it is doing as part of DARPA's Speed and Runway Independent Technologies (SPRINT) program earlier today. DARPA awarded new SPRINT contracts to Aurora, as well as Bell, earlier this year. SPRINT, which kicked off last year, is directly tied U.S. Special Operations Command’s (SOCOM) High-Speed Vertical Takeoff and Landing (HSVTOL) project. A rendering showing Aurora's current SPRINT uncrewed demonstrator design, at right, and a scaled-up crewed cargo aircraft concept based on the same technology, at left. Aurora Flight Sciences 'Aurora and Boeing are collaborating on the development of key technologies that combine to deliver a revolutionary solution to mobility challenges in contested environments and across distributed military bases,' according to a press release from Aurora. 'Fan-in-wing (FIW) technology combines an embedded lift fan with a blended wing body design to enable vertical lift agility without sacrificing the payload capacity and aerodynamic efficiency associated with today’s fixed wing aircraft.' 'The team is currently designing an uncrewed demonstrator with a 45-ft wingspan and 1,000-pound payload capacity for the SPRINT program,' the release adds. 'The propulsion system includes off-the-shelf turbofan and turboshaft engines that would power the vehicle to a maximum of 450 knots true airspeed (KTAS).' The new rendering of the SPRINT demonstrator is broadly in line with one that Aurora put out in May. It has a blended-wing platform with a v-tail along with three lift fans in a triangular arrangement – one to either side of the central fuselage section and another in the nose end. The revised render shows more streamlined intakes for the main engines underneath the body. One of the new renderings of Aurora's SPRINT demonstrator design. Aurora Flight Sciences A rendering Aurora released of its SPRINT demonstrator concept back in May. Aurora Flight Sciences A rendering of Aurora Flight Sciences revised SPRINT design concept. Aurora Flight Sciences 'Earlier this year, the team completed the first of three major test events scheduled for the current phase of the SPRINT program to prove out the feasibility of the FIW technology,' according to Aurora. 'The ground effect test, conducted using a 4.6-ft wingspan model with three lift fans, showed that suck down effects created by the lift fans in hover were negligible and that the landing gear is set to the appropriate height to minimize adverse pitching moments from forming during ground operations. Wind tunnel tests planned for late 2024 and early 2025 include a stability and control test using a 9-ft full wingspan aircraft model and a 5¼-ft semi-span embedded lift fan test to model aerodynamic effects.' A picture of an actual test article Aurora has been using in the development of its SPRINT demonstrator. Aurora Flight Sciences 'Aurora’s concept is designed to meet or exceed the challenging program objectives that DARPA set for the program. For example, the blended wing body platform is capable of 450 knot cruise speed, and the embedded lift fans with integrated covers allow a smooth transition from vertical to horizontal flight,' the company has also said in the past. 'The design also leverages existing engine solutions, shortening development risk and timelines. In addition to VTOL, the aircraft is capable of short take-off and vertical landing (STOVL), super short take-off and landing (SSTOL), and conventional take-off and landing.' Aurora is currently aiming to reach first flight with the SPRINT demonstrator in 2027. However, the company is already looking to the future. 'The technology demonstrated in the SPRINT X-plane could be scaled to medium and heavy lift aircraft, creating a future family of systems. For example, Aurora envisions a manned, 130-ft wingspan aircraft with four lift fans and 40-ft payload bay,' today's press release explains. 'The FIW aircraft could meet or exceed the payloads, ranges, and speeds typical of fixed wing military transport aircraft while delivering the tactical advantage of true vertical takeoff and landing.' The rendering Aurora has now released of this larger fan-in-wing design concept shows significant changes from the one it put out back in 2023. The new design has a tailless modified cranked kite planform with lower profile air intakes on top of the rear end of the central body. Like the 2023 render, Aurora's revised vision for a larger crewed fin-in-wing aircraft still features four lift fans two on either side of the central body. One of the new renderings of Aurora's scaled-up design derived from the SPRINT demonstrator. Aurora Flight Sciences The design seen in the new rendering appears to reduce some stealthy features and magnify others, notably with the elimination with the vertical tails. What Aurora showed in 2023 did have sharper and narrower wing sections, as well as a more pronounced beak-like nose and chine line along the forward edge of the central body. A rendering of a larger fan-in-wing design concept that Aurora released in relation to the SPRINT program back in 2023. Aurora Flight Sciences A rendering of Aurora Flight Sciences' SPRINT design concept. Aurora Flight Sciences The new Aurora rendering also notably shows changes to the design of the lift fan covers. The design the company presented last year had split covers – different versions of the original concept showed circular and hexagonal cover shapes – while the new one has multi-sectioned covers. This is very reminiscent of how the lift fan in the nose of the 1960s-era Ryan Vertifan was covered. The Vertifan had a three-fan configuration that is otherwise similar in some very broad respects to Aurora's SPRINT demonstrator design. An artist’s conception of a fan-in-wing Special Operations Forces Transport Aircraft (SOFA) concept from Lockheed in the 1980s also shows similar sectional fan coverings.

Lockheed via Ebay It is worth noting here that 40 feet is also how long the payload bay is on standard-length variants of the venerable C-130 family, which has long been used as a baseline for mid-tier military airlifter development. Boeing used this same dimensional rubric when crafting a concept that it unveiled last year for a new stealthy aircraft that could be configured as a transport or an aerial refueling tanker. That design, which is intended to take off and land from traditional runways, also has a blended wing body planform that is similar in some broad strokes to Aurora's proposed SPRINT-derived cargo plane. A stealthy blended wing body design concept Boeing unveiled publicly in 2023. Boeing A model depicting the blended wing body concept Boeing unveiled in January 2023. Boeing The War Zone has also previously pointed out on multiple occasions how Aurora's work under SPRINT is broadly evocative of a host of vertical and short takeoff and landing-capable designs the U.S. military has at least explored since the 1980s. Supporting special operations missions was a central theme in many of those past development efforts, as you can read about more in this exhaustive two-part feature. SPRINT together with HSVTOL underscores significant continued interest, especially within the Air Force special operations community, in new, more capable and survivable runway-independent platforms, especially to help get personnel in and out of denied or otherwise sensitive locales. The significant speed and range capabilities that both of those efforts are targeting could be particularly attractive for future operations across the broad expanses of the Pacific region. 'I think the high speed/range, high-speed kind of lower profile ability to get in and out of places that don't require long runways, I think that would be attractive to any combatant commander,' Air Force Lt. Gen. Michael Conley, head of Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC), said in regards to SPRINT and HSVTOL at a media roundtable on the sidelines of the Air & Space Forces Association's (AFA) main annual conference last month. 'It's certainly a capability we need in the Indo-Pacific, just because of the geography, regardless of an [specific] adversary.' At the same time, it is not hard to see how the Air Force more broadly, as well as other branches of the U.S. military, might be interested in the kinds of capabilities that designs being developed under SPRINT and HSVTOL, or variants or derivatives thereof, might offer. The U.S. Marine Corps and the Air Force, especially, increasingly envision future operations, especially in the context of a high-end fight against a potential adversary like China, as dispersed affairs. Distributing forces across a large number of operating locations, including far-flung forward sites with limited infrastructure, is seen more and more as not only advantageous, but critical for reducing vulnerability. Large established bases will be prime targets in any future large-scale conflict.

James Deboer A Marine F-35B sitting on a stretch of highway in California during a recent exercise. James Deboer In line with this, diverse and distributed logistics chains are also increasingly seen as essential for supporting these operations, especially in contested environments. A high-speed, long-range, runway-independent, and highly survivable cargo aircraft, crewed or uncrewed, could easily be a part of that future ecosystem. In fact, the Air Force Research Laboratory just put out a request for information (RFI) about potential Runway Independent Mobility / Next Generation Intra-theater Airlift (NGIA) aircraft last month. NGIA builds on an earlier concept dubbed Last Tactical Leg, according to Aviation Week, which was first to report on this development. 'The Last Tactical Leg proposal envisions an autonomous, hybrid-electric short- or vertical-takeoff-and-landing aircraft,' Aviation Week's story explains. 'This proposed airlifter would deliver small, urgently needed supplies from logistics hubs to forward bases, even with battle-damaged runways on both ends.' 'The Department of the Air Force’s (DAF’s) goal [with NGIA] is to enhance existing airlift capability and capacity with an intra-theater platform that can fight through damaged infrastructure on responsive timelines,' according to the RFI for that effort. AFRL is now 'seeking information on advanced configurations, propulsion and power generation/regulation concepts and technologies for a contested logistics aircraft with attributes for agility in the objective area, airlift capacity, speed, range and survivability to sustain joint force operations within the contested environment.' All of this sounds very much in line with Aurora's vision for scaled-up designs based on the SPRINT demonstrator. Bell has also previously laid out a concept for a scalable family of advanced tilt-rotor aircraft that is tied in with its SPRINT and HSVTOL work, and that you can read more about here. Bell previously teamed with Boeing to develop the V-22 Osprey tilt-rotor, variants of which are in service with AFSOC, as well as with the Marines and U.S. Navy. A rendering Bell released in 2021 showing three tiers of HSVTOL concepts, including two crewed examples (at left and center) and a small uncrewed type (at right). Bell The Air Force and Marine Corps, as well as the U.S. Army, have already been exploring smaller uncrewed vertical takeoff and landing-capable drones to support logistics requirements and other mission sets. The Air Force has been experimenting with light fixed-wing aircraft converted into drones as small uncrewed airlifters, as well. It does still remains to be seen whether a working design of any kind emerges from SPRINT, HSVTOL, or NGIA. If one does, whether it actually enters operational service with the Air Force or any other branch of the U.S. military is also an open question. 'There's a lot of hard things,' AFOSC head Lt. Gen. Conley said at the AFA conference last month again while speaking about SPRINT and HSVTOL. 'Some of it's just the technological pieces of the engines and trying to get enough lift and enough size.' 'I think, conceptually as an Air Force, we struggle a little bit with how big is big enough &#8230; as you look at the developmental models, some of them are, you know, the size of a sedan. And then&#8230; another iteration would be the size of about a UH-60 [Black Hawk helicopter]. And then you get up to a little bigger &#8230; probably C-130 'lite,'' he continued. 'And I think as an Air Force that's used to move in a lot of big things, and a lot of people, and a lot of pallets, and big amounts of cargo, there's a little bit of a mental block there.' A C-130J Hercules, one of the main airlifters currently in U.S. military service. Lockheed Martin Conley's general sentiments here have been echoed by other Air Force officials in the past. 'There were … thousands, maybe, of C-47s, and they were all over the Pacific [during World War II],' Gen. Kenneth Wilsbach, then head of U.S. Pacific Air Forces (PACAF), said back in 2022. 'They weren’t fast, but they can carry a lot, and they tackled the logistics problem of the Pacific by having a lot of tails to … move equipment.' Although 'it got there at 120, maybe 150 knots … it worked,' he added. 'We could have something like that &#8230; where you don’t have to have it going 500 knots,' but the logistics effort wouldn’t 'eat a lot of tail numbers to be able to get the small bits of equipment and pieces to the various spots that we intend to deploy from.' 'Does it have to be manned? Can it be unmanned? Does it have to be 10,000 pounds or 5,000 pounds [payload capacity-wise]? Can I do vertical lift? Can I do it on an airship [or] a slow-moving low-altitude blimp?' now-retired Gen. Mike Minihan, then head of Air Mobility Command, asked rhetorically while speaking about future airlift requirements in an interview with Aviation Week last year. 'There’s a lot of opportunity when it comes to how you approach that.' It is worth remembering here that the Air Force did briefly operate a fleet of C-27J Spartan cargo aircraft between 2008 and 2013. Those aircraft had been acquired specifically to support intra-theater airlift requirements as part of what was originally a joint program with the Army. The Air Force ultimately curtailed those plans ostensibly due to budgetary limitations and divested all of its Spartans. Some of those C-27Js subsequently ended up in the Army's special operations aviation inventory. A C-27J Spartan assigned to US Army Special Operations Aviation Command. US Army SOCOM and AFSOC have clear interest currently in seeing SPRINT and HSVTOL through to the delivery of an operational capability. Aurora's latest renderings show how that work could further evolve into designs to support a wider array of mission sets.

Anduril’s Roadrunner Drone Hunting Drone Gets Expanded Order From...	Anduril's Roadrunner counter-drone interceptor drone just got a further stamp of approval from the Pentagon in the form of an order worth hundreds of millions of dollars to deliver additional units. This is a major win for Anduril, still a newcomer to the defense industry, whose rapidly growing product catalog largely aims at disrupting the existing marketplace. While some remain skeptical of the company's ambitious aspirations, continuing support from DoD is a signal that whatever they are doing is worth continued investment. You can read our deep dive on Roadrunner in our past feature linked here. Over 500 Roadrunner-Ms, as well as Pulsar electronic warfare systems, will be supplied as part of the nearly quarter-billion dollar deal, with deliveries beginning in 2024. Pulsar is a modular, AI-infused, networked, electronic warfare system that can be mounted on base stations, vehicles, and aircraft. The new order is roughly two and a half times the size of the DoD's past expenditures on both systems, which appears to have focused more on testing, demonstrations, and early integration work. The company's Lattice open architecture autonomy command and control software can be integrated with both systems. Anduril's AI-infused and networked Pulsar EW system comes in stationary, ground vehicle, and airborne offerings. This order shouldn't be too big of a surprise as the Pentagon continues to grapple with the rapidly expanding threat posed by lower-end drones and long-range one-way attack munitions. Roadrunner is vertically launched and recovered, and possesses a high degree of maneuverability thanks to its vectored thrust turbojets. It's optionally reusable. If one is launched and it is not needed to take down a threat, which could include drones, as well as cruise missiles and low-flying manned aircraft, it can be recovered and refueled for another mission. Depending on the configuration, it could also be used to surveil and strike targets on the ground or carry non-kinetic payloads. Roadrunners in 'Nest' launcher boxes can be distributed around a broad area to maximize response time and protection coverage. The idea is that Roadrunner can be launched on initial warning, or even preemptively, to get after a threat immediately without the possibility of wasting an effector in doing so if the intercept is not needed. Beyond defending troops and installations in forward locales, Roadrunner could be extremely useful aboard ships that have become top targets for drone attacks. We lay out this entire use case in great detail in this past feature. In a press release, Anduril says that 'Roadrunner has been operationally deployed for Combat Evaluation since January 2024 and Pulsar has been operationally deployed in multiple regions since August 2023.' In other words, Roadrunner and Pulsar have been used in the field, at least in an evaluative manner, which appears to have been a success. Similar kinetic counter-UAS systems, such as Raytheon's Coyote, as well as electronic warfare systems, have been put into operational use for years now, most notably at high-threat locations in the Middle East. Smaller past contracts related to Roadrunner and Pulsar likely involved more limited use case deployments that have subsequently led to this expanded buy. It is not chasing the same requirement as the Coyote Blk 2. There are two different programs, one that builds on the B-Blk2 on LIDS, and another that meets a SOCOM program need. Roadrunner has been shown as a SOCOM future need in DOD materials for several months now. pic.twitter.com/tkk0nP6YaA&mdash; AirPower 2.0 (MIL_STD) (@AirPowerNEW1) December 1, 2023 We reached out to Anduril regarding where their Roadrunner and Pulsar systems have been deployed and what type of action they have seen, but they could not provide any additional details at this time. What's clear is that the Pentagon thinks they are effective enough to want more of them. Considering how both of these capabilities would be critical to a future fight, especially a distributed one across the Pacific, if Roadrunner and Pulsar continue to prove their worth and evolve into even more potent weapons, these orders could quickly become exponentially larger.

Stealthy Uncrewed Combat Air Vehicle To Work Alongside Future Fre...	France has unveiled plans to develop a new uncrewed combat air vehicle (UCAV) that will complement the forthcoming Rafale F5 crewed fighter, as part of a new-look French Air and Space Force. The industrial side of the drone program will be headed up by Dassault Aviation, drawing upon its previous nEUROn UCAV demonstrator, which has already been used in trials with crewed combat aircraft. The program was announced today by France’s Minister of the Armed Forces Sébastien Lecornu, during a ceremony marking the 60th anniversary of the French Strategic Air Forces (FAS) at Saint-Dizier Air Base. Sur la base aérienne 113 de Saint-Dizier pour les 60 ans des Forces aériennes stratégiques, @SebLecornu annonce une évolution majeure pour la dissuasion nucléaire aéroportée française : le nouveau standard du Rafale, le F5, qui emportera le futur missile nucléaire ASN4G.Le… pic.twitter.com/WfuOi24PWO&mdash; Ministère des Armées et des Anciens combattants (@Armees_Gouv) October 8, 2024 'This stealth combat drone will contribute to the technological and operational superiority of the French Air Force by 2033,' explained Éric Trappier, chairman and CEO of Dassault, in a statement. 'It is significant that it is being initiated today, as we mark the 60th anniversary of the Strategic Air Forces and the 90th anniversary of the Air and Space Force: in aeronautics — a highly complex field — the future has deep roots, and innovation is built on experience. Dassault Aviation and its partners are proud to serve the French Armed Forces and the French Defense Procurement Agency (DGA).' France’s Minister of the Armed Forces Sébastien Lecornu, during the ceremony marking the 60th anniversary of the French Strategic Air Forces (FAS) at Saint-Dizier Air Base today. French Ministry of Defense Some details were provided about the capabilities of the new drone and the kinds of technologies it will incorporate. The drone — as yet unnamed — will be 'complementary to the Rafale and suited to collaborative combat.' It will also have stealth characteristics including an internal payload. The UCAV will feature autonomous control, with a human-in-the-loop (in this case, the pilot in the cockpit of the Rafale). A French Air and Space Force Rafale C. Dassault Aviation Dassault Aviation/Anthony Pecchi According to Dassault, the drone 'will be highly versatile and designed to evolve in line with future threats,' although no further information was provided about its expected performance or even the range of missions it will fly. It may or may not be relevant that a Dassault press release today refers to the new drone working alongside the Rafale F5 'like the Mirage IV … [to] ensure France’s independence and capability superiority in the coming decades.' A French Air Force Dassault Mirage IVA nuclear bomber emerges from its shelter in the mid-1960s. Photo by llstein bild/ullstein bild via Getty Images ullstein bild Dtl. This would appear to be a specific reference to France’s airborne nuclear deterrent, a role undertaken by FAS using the Rafale. In the past, the mission was carried out by the Mirage IV. It may be that this is a reference to the drone supporting the Rafale on nuclear penetration missions, clearing the way for strikes, for example. On the other hand, it may simply be a more general reference based on the announcement being made at an FAS air base. As for the F5 Standard of the Rafale that the new drone will be expected to support, this is planned to keep the multirole combat aircraft in frontline service until around 2060. Initial studies for the F5 Standard were initiated last year, with full-scale development to begin in the 2026-27 timeframe. This means that the aircraft can be closely tailored to enable crewed-uncrewed teaming with the new drone. In the past, it’s been stated that the Rafale F5 would have a focus on collaborative combat, as well as incorporating new-generation weapons. These weapons are planned to include the ASN4G, the next-generation standoff nuclear weapon for the French Armed Forces, replacing the current ASMPA. ASMPA on a Rafale. MBDA Other new weapons for the Rafale F5 are expected to include successors for the SCALP conventional cruise missile and Exocet anti-ship missile, with a hypersonic design being examined for the latter requirement. Air-to-air munitions should include an upgraded Meteor beyond-visual-range missile. Suppression and destruction of enemy air defenses (SEAD/DEAD) is also seen as a primary mission for the Rafale F5 and one that would benefit hugely from a loyal-wingman-type drone to operate alongside the crewed fighter. Other efforts to enhance the survivability of the Rafale F5 may include conformal fuel tanks and radar-cross-section reduction kits, although the fighter will certainly not be truly stealthy, making a drone wingman all the more valuable. Since the Rafale F5 is being developed with the Future Combat Air System (FCAS) in mind, it’s very likely that the new drone will also be designed to operate within this broader architecture. Not to be confused with the U.K.-led effort of the same name, the pan-European FCAS will include uncrewed air vehicles as well as uncrewed effectors and remote weapon carriers, some of which can be air-launched and which will increasingly blur the distinction between cruise missiles and drones. The centerpiece of FCAS will eventually be a crewed combat aircraft, the Next Generation Fighter (NGF), which should eventually replace the Rafale, among others. An infographic describing the various components of Airbus’ FCAS concept, including the 'new fighter,' which is now known as the Next Generation Fighter. Airbus The Rafale is also available in a two-seat version, which would appear to lend itself especially well to the 'drone controller' role, potentially with a dedicated rear cockpit for teaming up with UCAVs. Similar concepts are also being explored in China and the U.S. Air Force has also eyed its two-seat F-15EX as a possible candidate for working with loyal wingman drones. While we don’t know what the new drone announced today will look like, nor do we have an idea of its size, it seems likely that it will at least be informed by the Dassault nEUROn, a UCAV demonstrator that you can read more about here. The stealthy nEUROn is a flying-wing-type drone, launched in 2003 as a pan-European project, but headed up by Dassault of France. The nEUROn was first flown in December 2012 and has so far conducted more than 170 test flights. nEUROn under construction. Dassault Aviation Sebastien Rande Notably, some of these tests have included determining the UCAV’s ability to remain undetected and penetrate air defense networks. In 2016, the drone was reportedly able to successfully breach the air defense perimeter around the French aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle, a clear demonstration of its stealth characteristics. Today’s announcement might be bad news for Airbus, which unveiled its fighter-like stealthy Wingman uncrewed concept aircraft this summer. Also intended to fly collaborative missions alongside crewed fighters, the Wingman has been pitched as a low-cost solution — with a price tag equivalent to one-third that of a modern crewed fighter — that can be brought into production and fielded rapidly. The Airbus Wingman uncrewed concept aircraft, which broke cover earlier this year. Thomas Newdick Thomas Newdick In relation to Wingman, Airbus noted that the German Air Force had 'expressed a clear need' for a drone that would be able to operate in conjunction with crewed fighters before the arrival in service of the pan-European FCAS. With Airbus already playing a major role in FCAS, the company may have hoped that Wingman would also attract interest from other countries involved in that initiative: Belgium, France, and Spain. So far, there’s no sign that France is interested in Wingman, although it’s hard to envisage that Airbus could develop and build this UCAV solely to meet a German requirement for an uncrewed companion that can work alongside its forthcoming Eurofighter EK electronic warfare jets, which seem likely to be a major driver behind it. An artist’s concept of the Eurofighter EK electronic warfare aircraft for Germany. Like the Rafale F5, it’s intended to go to war accompanied by UCAVs. Airbus At the same time, Wingman is expected to enter service in the 2030s timeframe, at much the same time as the new Dassault UCAV. It’s certainly questionable whether the European defense industry can support two apparently overlapping if not competing, programs. Without any concept art or details of the design of the new Dassault UCAV, we can’t say for sure whether it will follow the pattern established by nEUROn, although that certainly seems possible if not probable. If this is indeed the case, the launch of this program again highlights an apparent gap in the U.S. combat aircraft space as well as the growing interest in stealthy UCAVs in other countries. For some time now, drones in this category have become attractive as a far more cost-effective and more capable alternative to crewed aircraft to satisfy a number of missions, especially the more hazardous ones. In particular, China has been pushing ahead with the development of UCAVs for exactly these reasons, with other programs being pursued in Russia and elsewhere. The news from France today suggests that the trend for UCAVs — flying wing or otherwise — is only likely to grow exponentially as time goes on.

Trophy Armored Vehicle Protection System Gains New Ability To Def...	Israeli defense contractor Rafael says it has developed a new version of its combat-proven Trophy active protection system (APS) that is better able to defeat top-down attacks. Increasing Trophy's ability to engage threats attacking from above could be particularly valuable for swatting down hostile drones, including highly maneuverable first-person view kamikaze (FPV) types and ones designed to drop small munitions straight down on their targets. The War Zone previously laid out a detailed case for how hard-kill APSs like Trophy could help give tanks and other armored vehicles a critical additional layer of protection against these threats, which the war in Ukraine has brought fully into the public view. Rafael publicly unveiled Trophy's new top-attack defense capability today, which can be seen demonstrated in the video below, including against a target drone. The video also includes multiple clips from the conflict in Ukraine, including one captured via the camera on an FPV drone right before it hits its mark, as well as various flash points in the Middle East. Trophy was first developed in the late 2000s and was originally primarily designed to defend against anti-tank guided missiles and other types of infantry anti-armor weapons like shoulder-fired rockets and rocket-propelled grenades. Trophy's existing core components are an array of small radars and launchers pre-loaded with ‘hard-kill’ projectiles. The radars detect incoming threats and cue the launchers, which then fire their projectiles. Though a small explosive charge is used to propel them, the projectiles themselves are kinetic, being designed to destroy, or at least disrupt, whatever they hit through sheer force of impact. 'Rafael officials unveiled the [top-attack defense] upgrade in a briefing here last week held ahead of the AUSA [Association of the U.S. Army] arms exhibition in Washington next week, where the company will exhibit its wares,' according to a report from Defense News. 'The company declined to specify how the upgrade works or when the capability was first introduced on Trophy, saying only the system had undergone numerous development cycles since first being fielded more than ten years ago.' The imagery Rafael has now released highlighting Trophy's new top-down defense capabilities does show pronounced explosive blasts. It is unclear whether this reflects the launch of additional kinetic interceptors, the use of an actual explosive charge to defeat incoming threats, and/or secondary explosions from successful interceptions. Regardless of how the improved system functions, it offers additional coverage against drones and other threats from above like anti-tank guided missiles with top-down attack capability. A screen capture from Rafael latest Trophy promotional video highlighting the new top-down defensive capability with a significant explosive blast visible.

Rafael capture The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) first began fielding Trophy on its Merkava tanks in 2009. The system, which is now in increasing service globally, including with the U.S. military, has since demonstrated its value in combat many times.

New Hamas clash footage from Khan Yunis, southern Gaza. pic.twitter.com/YPysrg4CmZ&mdash; Clash Report (@clashreport) December 13, 2023 However, it has long been known that Trophy has certain limitations against threats approaching from steep downward angles, something Rafael itself has made no secret of in the past. The system 'provides 360° protection in azimuth as well as extensive elevation coverage,' according to official marketing material. The potential vulnerabilities that the limits to Trophy's 'elevation coverage' present have come more into view since Hamas’ large-scale terrorist attacks on southern Israel on October 7, 2023. The Palestinian terrorist group used drones to drop small munitions on top of Israeli Merkava tanks and other vehicles, as well as static defenses. It is unclear whether or not the Trophys on the Merkavas were in operation at the time of those attacks, but they still prompted new discussions about the system's top-down defense deficiencies.

The Pentagon just recently announced that defeating drones, an area where the U.S. military continues to lag behind, will be the focus of a new Replicator 2 rapid fielding initiative. The original Replicator effort has been focused on getting uncrewed systems into the hands of American forces. The idea of using Trophy and other hard-kill APSs to provide an existing and relatively quick avenue for adding anti-drone defenses to tanks and other armored vehicles is also now new, as you can learn more about in detail in our past deep-drive on this exact topic. At the same time, it is important to note that APSs are not a silver bullet solution to drone threats, which look to be on the cusp of another major evolution, if not a revolution driven heavily by advances in artificial intelligence, the subject of another recent War Zone feature. Layered defenses, including other systems mounted on vehicles and ones otherwise deployed around the battlespace, will be key to meeting current and future counter-drone requirements. This will be especially true when it comes to defeating large-volume attacks, including ones involving networked swarms. A counter-drone ecosystem that includes high-power laser and microwave directed energy weapons, laser dazzlers, and electronic warfare jammers, as well as traditional guns and surface-to-air missiles, is already emerging. With all this in mind, Rafael's new top-down defense upgrade for Trophy is not only logical, but is likely a sign of things to come from other APS manufacturers as critical demand for new and improved ways to defend tanks and other armored vehicles against drones keeps growing.

France Confirms Upgraded Mirage 2000s Heading To Ukraine In Early...	France has announced details of its plans to put surplus Dassault Mirage 2000 fighters into Ukrainian hands, with these jets receiving new air-to-ground capabilities ahead of planned deliveries starting in the first quarter of 2025. The delta-winged jet is set to become the second Western-made fighter to be provided to Kyiv, following the F-16, the first of which arrived in Ukraine this summer. In a statement on X today, the French Minister of the Armed Forces Sébastien Lecornu added that the Mirage 2000s will first be outfitted with new electronic self-defense equipment as well as undisclosed modifications that will allow them to fly air-to-ground missions. That work will be conducted at Cazaux in southwest France. Meanwhile, the training of Ukrainian pilots and mechanics continues, Lecornu said. Mirage 2000 à destination de l’Ukraine : livraison toujours prévue au 1er trimestre 2025.À Cazaux, en Gironde, ils seront dotés de nouveaux équipements : combat air-sol et défense anti-guerre électronique.La formation des pilotes, et mécaniciens, ukrainiens se poursuit.&mdash; Sébastien Lecornu (@SebLecornu) October 8, 2024 As TWZ reported at the time, in June of this year French President Emmanuel Macron announced plans to transfer an undisclosed number of Mirage 2000-5 fighters to Ukraine, outlining 'a new cooperation' with manufacturer Dassault. When rumors of secondhand Mirage 2000s being provided to Ukraine first emerged, it was unclear if the aircraft in question were the more modern Mirage 2000-5F versions currently operated by that service, or the older Mirage 2000C variants, the last of which were retired in June 2022, as you can read about here. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky (left) is welcomed by French Minister of Defense Sebastien Lecornu (right) upon his arrival at the Paris Orly airport, on February 8, 2023. Photo by JULIEN DE ROSA/POOL/AFP via Getty Images JULIEN DE ROSA While converted from Mirage 2000Cs, the Mirage 2000-5Fs are more capable, albeit also almost entirely restricted to air-to-air operations, at least in their basic form. Most importantly, the Mirage 2000-5F introduced the RDY radar, a mechanically scanned pulse-Doppler type with look-down/shoot-down capability. Compared to the RDM and RDI radar in the Mirage 2000C, the newer system can track more targets simultaneously — up to eight — and also has some air-to-ground functionality — which is likely critical for the enhancements planned for Ukraine. The new radar is combined with a much-modernized cockpit, including three multifunction color displays. The standard weapons for the air defense Mirage 2000-5F are from the MICA family of beyond-visual-range air-to-air missiles, with either radar-homing or infrared seeker heads. It’s unclear what air-to-ground munitions will be added after the upgrade work, but there are two very obvious options. First is the stealthy SCALP-EG cruise missile, which has been integrated on other Mirage 2000 versions and which is already used by Ukrainian Su-24 Fencer strike aircraft. Another option is the Hammer rocket-assisted precision-guided bomb. While the Hammer is not known to have been integrated on the Mirage 2000 previously, the French-made weapon is also used by Ukraine, with France having promised to deliver significant numbers. A French-supplied AASM-250 Hammer rocket-assisted precision-guided bomb under the wing of a Ukrainian MiG-29 Fulcrum. via X via X The new electronic self-defense equipment promised to Ukraine may well consist of the ICMS Mk 2 system which, includes radar warning receivers, jammers, and chaff and flare dispensers, all of which are mounted internally. This is found on export Mirage 2000-5s, but French Air Force jets use an older and less-capable system. Meanwhile, the definitive Mirage 2000-9 for export has the ICMS Mk 3, which is fully digital, and might also be an option for Ukraine. Its capabilities include prioritizing and then displaying to the pilot the eight highest-priority threats. The F-16s that have been delivered to Ukraine also sport a robust electronic warfare suite, which you can learn more about here and in the video below. While former French Air Force Mirage 2000-5Fs seem the most likely candidates to be delivered to Ukraine, Lecornu today only mentioned 'Mirage 2000s,' while Macron spoke of 'Mirage 2000-5s.' It’s possible that France has attempted to acquire Mirage 2000-5s from Greece, Qatar, or even Taiwan, the export operators of this version. Afterburner takeoff for a Greek Mirage 2000-5. Hellenic Air Force Afterburner take-off for a Hellenic Air Force Mirage 2000-5EG. Hellenic Air Force Greece recently announced plans to retire at least some of its Mirage 2000-5s, while the Qatari Mirage 2000-5 fleet has been retired for some time now and has been repeatedly connected with different customers, including contractor red air providers, although no firm orders have been placed. With a Mirage upgrade program underway and a huge requirement for air defense fighters, Taiwan is unlikely to want to offload any of its jets. Bearing in mind the current timeline, however, it seems likely that the aircraft will be drawn from French Air Force stocks, which will leave the service short of air defense fighters, at least until more Dassault Rafales are delivered. Currently, around 30 Mirage 2000-5Fs are based at Luxeuil in France, with a detachment in Djibouti on the Horn of Africa. A Mirage 2000-5F takes off from Luxeuil Air Base, in Saint-Sauveur, eastern France, on March 13, 2022. Photo by SEBASTIEN BOZON/AFP via Getty Images SEBASTIEN BOZON France might also have some additional Mirage 2000-5Fs in storage that it could send to Ukraine, or which it could use to backfill its own inventory. In all, 37 Mirage 2000Cs were updated to 2000-5F standard, although the fleet has been depleted through attrition. As to how soon Ukraine might be able to employ the Mirage in combat, this will depend primarily upon the progress of the pilots and mechanics now being trained on the aircraft. Reports in the French media state that the country has agreed to train an initial 26 Ukrainian pilots. Last month, the French Armed Forces announced that the first cohort of pilots had completed Alpha Jet training in France. Although it’s not clear if these aviators will progress to the F-16 or the Mirage, the latter now makes a lot of sense.

That is now starting to yield more results, however, with the recent announcement that the first F-16s supplied by the Netherlands have begun to reach that country, joining the initial aircraft delivered by Denmark. Previously, the Netherlands had delivered F-16s to the training center in Romania, where they are used for converting Ukrainian pilots. For the first time, I can officially announce that the first Dutch F-16s have been delivered to Ukraine.This is urgently needed.

Demonstrating the ability to operate two different Western-made fighters may also help pave the way to additional, and other types of NATO-standard combat aircraft making their way to Ukraine, too.

Chinese Laser Anti-Drone System Spotted In Iran	Iran looks to have fielded a Chinese laser directed energy weapon intended for 'dazzling' drones or even destroying them in certain circumstances, as well as other new counter-drone capabilities. The Iranian government has been central in the global proliferation of uncrewed aerial systems, including kamikaze drones, but also faces many of the same kinds of threats, especially from Israel. Pictures said to show a laser counter-drone system in the Iranian capital Tehran first emerged online last Friday. The system was reportedly deployed as part of security measures around a rare public sermon by Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. In his remarks, Khamenei defended Iran's recent ballistic missile barrage against Israel, lauded Hamas' terrorist attacks last year that have precipitated a growing regional conflict, and said that Iranian-backed proxies would continue fighting despite a series of targeted assassinations. Readers can find more detailed reporting about the current state of crises across the Middle East here. #Israel #Lebanon #Hezbollah#Iran #Nasrallah #Hamas During yesterday's Friday prayers in Tehran, the Chinese-made Silent Hunter laser system to deal with drones was seen for the first time in Iran The range of this system is up to 4 km depending on the target and the output… pic.twitter.com/MiY3VNgKoe&mdash; Koba (@Roberto05246129) October 5, 2024 Many observers have identified the laser counter-drone system seen in the recently emerged pictures as an example of China's Silent Hunter, but this appears to be incorrect. Known images of Silent Hunter, and mockups thereof, including examples in service in Saudi Arabia, show it has a turret with a single large circular aperture (likely its beam director) on the right side of a central mast. Silent Hunter's turret also has smaller circular apertures, which should include electro-optical and/or infrared cameras for target detection, tracking, and engagement on the right and left of the main mast. A picture of a truck-mounted Silent Hunter system, or mock-up thereof, on display. Chinese internet While the system said to have deployed last week in Tehran has a similar overall design, it has a single large aperture on the left side. In addition, there is an aperture with a more squared-off shape on the right side. The central mast has a different design, as well. A similar, if not identical arrangement is visible in Chinese marketing literature for another counter-drone laser weapon called the Shen Nung (also transliterated Shennong). Containerized and 4&#215;4 Dongfeng Mengshi light tactical truck-mounted versions of the Shen Nung – the Shen Nung 5000 and 3000, respectively – have at least been pitched in the past. The pictures reportedly taken in Tehran last week show the system behind a blue tarp screen, but what is visible could point to a containerized variant. A side-by-side comparison of the turret on a Saudi Arabian Silent Hunter laser counter-drone system (at left) and the one in the recently emerged pictures said to have been taken in Tehran last Friday (at right). Saudi Arabia Ministry of Defense/via X A Shen Nung promotional image showing containerized (Shen Nung 5000) and Dongfeng Mengshi-based (Shen Nung 3000) variants. Chinese internet Another view of the laser counter-drone system reportedly deployed in Tehran last week showing what may be parts of a containerized base. via X It's worth noting here that both Silent Hunter and the Shen Nung feature small radars on top of their respective turrets to help detect and track targets, something that is also visible on the system in the recently emerged pictures. A machine translation of Chinese-language specifications for the Shen Nung, seen below, says that it is capable of detecting drones up to 3.1 miles (five kilometers) away using its radar. The system's laser, stated to be in the 10 to 20-kilowatt power range, is said to be capable of launching non-destructive blinding or 'dazzling' attacks out to a range of nearly 2 miles (three kilometers) and of actually destroying certain targets that get within a mile (one and a half kilometers). The translation of the specification sheet also indicates that the laser can run for up to 200 seconds (just over three minutes) at a time, and needs 'less than' five minutes to charge up for an initial engagement and between 'shots.' This highlights some of the core pros and cons of laser directed energy weapons, which offer benefits especially when it comes to functionally unlimited 'magazine depth,' but also can only engage one target at once and can require some amount of time to recharge or to cool between firings. Chinese internet It's important to make clear here that even dazzling can be very effective against drones, including armed types, by blinding seekers and other optics, and thus disrupting their ability to find targets and prosecute attacks. At the same time, this is less useful against drones with more automated and/or multi-mode targeting capabilities. The War Zone recently explored the counter-drone capabilities that laser dazzlers do offer in detail in the context of options for defending tanks and other armored vehicles from uncrewed aerial threats in a feature you can find here. There is the possibility that the laser counter-drone system said to have been deployed last Friday in Tehran is something else, such as a locally-produced clone/derivative of a Chinese type or an ostensibly domestically-developed design. Many laser directed energy weapons in service and/or development globally, including ones produced in the United States, have broadly similar turret designs. However, this seems very unlikely given the similarities between what is seen in the images and of the Shen Nung. From what can be seen in on the recently emerged images, the laser system also looks to have been one of a number of counter-drone capabilities emplaced together. A large planar array system in particular looks very much like what we have seen for high power microwave system concepts, with their advantage being their wide beams can rapidly disrupt or destroy more drones faster than that of a laser. What may have been an electronic warfare jammer or remotely operated gun system is also visible. Additional radars and other sensors are also a possibility. Layering different systems together would help provide a broader breadth of coverage against different tiers of uncrewed aerial systems. Other systems seen near the apparent Shen Nung deployed in Tehran last week, including what may be a high-power microwave at right and either an electronic warfare jammer or remotely operated gun system at left. via X Regardless, it makes sense that Iran's security services would deploy various kinds of counter-drone and other defensive measures around Khamenei's appearance last week. Help in acquiring these capabilities and doing so rapidly, especially to help protect the Supreme Leader, would also be a very likely top ask from the Iranian government to its Chinese counterparts, with which it has a close relationship. As the Iranian Supreme Leader highlighted himself, Israel has shown a willingness and ability to kill hostile leadership figures, as well as other senior officials and even more rank-and-file terrorists, using a wide variety of highly targeted means in the past. This includes the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh, then head of Hamas, in a guest house in Tehran, reportedly using a planted bomb, back in July, as you can read more about here. Israel has also long been a prolific user of various tiers of armed uncrewed aerial systems, including kamikaze types and ones capable of dropping small munitions, in targeted strikes.

This reality has now been fully thrust into the mainstream consciousness thanks to the war in Ukraine. In particular, highly maneuverable first-person view (FPV) kamikaze drones, which can be launched very close to their intended target or from miles away, and are very hard to defend against, are now readily accessible. Uncrewed aerial threats now look to be poised to rise to a new level with the proliferation of artificial intelligence-driven technologies, as you can read about more in this feature. This, in turn, has led to a new explosion of interest in counter-drone systems, including across the U.S. military, which has been working to develop and field various tiers of kinetic and non-kinetic capabilities. This includes laser and microwave directed energy weapons, as well as electronic warfare jammers, some of which have been deployed operationally in limited numbers in recent years. American officials have highlighted difficulties with laser systems specifically given their sensitivity to environmental factors, significant power requirements, thermal handling limitations, and other issues. There has also been a notable lag in the fielding of anti-drone capabilities by the U.S. armed forces and elsewhere within the U.S. government, despite the very real threats at play. This is now further underscored by Iran's apparent acquisition and deployment of a Chinese laser directed energy counter-drone system. The full extent of Tehran's current laser anti-drone capabilities are still unclear, but the emergence of a Shen Nung there makes good sense given the potential drone threats the country faces at a very tumultous time. It is also a sign of things to come and not just in Iran.

China’s Monster Amphibious Assault Ship Has Twin Island Superstru...	The first of China’s new class of big-deck amphibious assault ships is rapidly taking shape and we can now get a much better look at the vessel’s twin-island configuration. The design choice is typically made to simplify air operations and is very likely another indicator of this class of vessels being tailored, at least in part, for going to sea with enhanced air wings that include larger types of drones. A satellite view of the first of the Type 076 class vessels, with the twin island superstructures installed, on September 27, 2024. PHOTO © 2024 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION. Recent photos of the first of the Type 076 landing helicopter dock (LHD) ships — known in the West as the Yulan class — under construction at the yard on Changxing Island in Shanghai first reveal one island superstructure added to the deck, as of September 26, followed by another, installed as of September 28. According to these images, the first of the two island superstructures have been installed onboard the 076 LHD/LAH.

Previously, this kind of design has been chosen for the significantly larger British Queen Elizabeth class aircraft carriers, and there are suggestions that it might also be chosen for India’s future aircraft carrier Vishal. Closer in size to the Type 076 is the Italian Trieste, another LHD, which also has two islands. The Italian Navy's Trieste LPH moored at the fitting-out quay of Fincantieri's Castellammare di Stabia shipyard in 2020. Ivan Guida/Wikimedia Commons Notably, the twin-island configuration was chosen for these vessels since it makes aircraft operations more straightforward. With indications that the Type 076 will be heavily geared toward generating airpower — including in the form of heavier fixed-wing drones — this kind of design is especially relevant.

Crown Copyright The Royal Navy's new aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth will arrive in Gibraltar today for her first overseas port visit. Image by Dave Jenkins via Wikimedia Commons, CC-BY-2.0 Simply put, having two islands means that one can be dedicated to navigation and other primarily ship-related taskings, while the other is used exclusively for controlling flight operations. When it comes to drones, the additional demands in terms of moving them around the deck remotely may also have helped reach this design decision. As well as the twin islands, the Type 076 has other features that suggest the primacy of air operations in its mission spectrum. Already obvious in previous imagery is the very large open flight deck, substantially wider than on other amphibious assault ships. There is also all but certain that a catapult is installed on the ship's bow, which will likely be complemented by arresting gear to accommodate, in particular, stealthy uncrewed combat air vehicles (UCAV) and other larger fixed-wing drones. Latest update on the first Type 076 LHD and now it is clear there is indeed only a single EMALS catapult. (Image via Ricky Un on Facebook) pic.twitter.com/TV4E8udqCn&mdash; @Rupprecht_A (@RupprechtDeino) June 9, 2024 Also speaking to the increased emphasis on air operations is the apparent space for an aircraft elevator on the port side of the stern end. This would be in addition to another large elevator at the center of the stern, as found on the Type 075. One of China’s Type 075 amphibious assault ships. via Chinese internet www.twz.com So far, there is no sign of a ‘ski jump’ takeoff ramp, though this could be potentially added in the future. However, it may be the case that the catapult — expected to be an electromagnetic aircraft launch system (EMALS) — would be sufficient for launching fixed-wing aircraft at higher operating weights. Using EMALS also has particular benefits for drone operations, these systems being better suited to launching smaller and lighter aircraft. As expected, the Type 076 is therefore shaping up to be much more than a traditional amphibious assault ship, which also makes sense given its overall size: falling roughly between China’s current largest amphibious warship, the Type 075, and the country’s newest and largest aircraft carrier, the Fujian. Based on previous TWZ analysis of satellite imagery, the Type 076 is roughly 864 feet long and 141 feet wide (263 and nearly 43 meters, respectively). By comparison, again based on satellite imagery, the Type 075 is 784 feet long and 105 feet wide (almost 239 and 32 meters), while the Fujian is 1,036 feet in length and 275 feet in width (close to 316 and almost 84 meters).

PHOTO © 2024 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION While it's still the case that the Type 076 appears to be primarily intended to operate rotary-winged aircraft, like a more traditional amphibious assault ship, all signs currently point to drones being a major part of its air wing, too. Once again, the twin-island configuration should help make the integration of both crewed and uncrewed aircraft simpler. There are other signs pointing to this, as well. As we explored back in June, apparent mockups of China’s stealthy GJ-11 Sharp Sword UCAV have emerged at a test and/or training site on Changxing Island, a little over a mile from where the first Type 076 is being built. The facility includes a large apron and structures that may be intended to reflect the island or islands on a carrier or assault ship. Apparent mockups of China’s stealthy GJ-11 UCAV on Changxing Island in Shanghai. Google Earth This adds to the weight of evidence suggesting that the GJ-11, or a related development, is set to be part of future air wings for the People’s Liberation Army Navy’s carriers and its more modern big-deck amphibious assault ships. Provided the Type 076 class does eventually embark GJ-11s or similar drones, these might be used primarily for maritime strike and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR). But as we have discussed in the past, there are many other potential mission sets, including electronic warfare systems, carrying directed-energy weapons, launching decoys, as well as more generally extending the targeting capabilities of friendly forces. Providing targeting data to anti-ship ballistic missiles, long-range anti-ship cruise missiles, as well as crewed strike aircraft, would be particularly relevant for the PLAN.

We likely won’t have to wait long before more details of this fascinating — and very impressive — design begin to emerge, including a better idea of what kinds of aircraft, crewed or otherwise, it might operate.

Russia’s S-70 Hunter Drone Was Armed When Shot Down By Friendly F...	Photos of the wreckage of the Russian S-70 Okhotnik-B (Hunter-B) flying wing unmanned combat air vehicle (UCAV) that was shot down by a Russian fighter in a mysterious incident over Ukraine last weekend reveal that it was carrying at least one precision-guided glide bomb. This would appear to confirm that the drone was engaged in some kind of operational trials, including prosecuting Ukrainian targets, perhaps also specifically to establish how the S-70 performs in a contested environment. You can read our original reporting of the drone shootdown here, suffice it to say that the S-70 — possibly the fourth prototype — was brought down by a Russian fighter of unconfirmed type, which fired a short-range air-to-air missile. Video posted to social media showed the burning drone spiraling to the ground. The engagement occurred near Konstantynivka, in Donetsk, reportedly around 10 miles behind Ukrainian lines.

Not included in the above series of photos, taken by a Getty Images photographer, is the fairly intact portion of one of the wings of the drone, which was seen soon after it came down. It was likely rapidly transported elsewhere for further analysis. via X Russian S-70 UAV, which was shot down today - Ai upscaled 150% + dehalo + compression reverse + 30 to 60 FPS + Stabilization pic.twitter.com/JaVAITto5C&mdash; Dariusz Zawadzki (@Military_oO) October 5, 2024 Among the twisted and burnt remains of the drone, the nose cone from at least one example of the UMPB D-30SN winged precision-guided bomb can be clearly made out. This is a weapon we have examined in depth in the past, but it wasn’t previously known to be part of the S-70’s armory. The weapon is a much more refined glide bomb compared to the previous UMPK, a fairly crude type of weapon that nonetheless has caused considerable difficulties for Ukrainian air defenses since its introduction in around early 2023. One of the first examples of the UMPB D-30SN to be seen in detail, in a photo that emerged in March of this year. via X First appearing in the spring of this year, the UMPB D-30SN is closer in concept to the U.S.-made GBU-39 Small Diameter Bomb, reportedly using inertial and satellite navigation, although it’s unclear if the weapon can be programmed with a target’s coordinates after the aircraft has taken off, which would be required for the most time-sensitive targets. The range of the weapon is unknown, but it’s likely greater than that of the UMPK. That earlier weapon has been unofficially attributed with a range of 44 miles, although there are several reports that assert that the actual range is much smaller. The S-70 is designed with some low observable (stealthy) features, including internal weapons carriage. Russia has developed a number of compressed-carriage missiles that are suitable for the internal weapons bays of the S-70, as well as the crewed Su-57 Felon fighter. Few details have been released so far concerning the particular types of weapons that the S-70 can or will carry, although there have been official statements in the past describing trials involving air-to-air missiles. On the other hand, for a drone of this class, air-to-ground munitions (as well as reconnaissance payloads) would seem more operationally realistic, at least at this stage of its development. A front view of an S-70 taxiing after landing. Russian Ministry of Defense The UMPB D-30SN is a comparatively new weapon, likely developed in response to the demands of the war in Ukraine — specifically, the need for lower-cost standoff weapons with precision guidance. The fact that the S-70 was loaded with at least one of these weapons also points to the likelihood that it was being used for some kind of operational trials. The S-70 should have enough range to operate from its home base in the vicinity of the Ukrainian border, after which it could have strayed across unintentionally. But running non-combat trials of a drone loaded with weapons on Russian territory so close to the Ukrainian border seems highly unlikely. If an armed Russian drone was operating over the Ukrainian front lines, it was almost certainly intentional. An S-70 drone flies accompanied by a Su-57. Russian Ministry of Defense www.twz.com There remains a small possibility that the glide bomb could have been lobbed at the location where the drone came down to ensure that the remains of the S-70 were destroyed, although there are no reports of such airstrikes in the vicinity. Russia’s slow targeting cycles would also seem to rule that out, especially bearing in mind the question of whether the UMPB D-30SN can even have target coordinates uploaded while in flight. Meanwhile, there have been unconfirmed reports that Russia targeted the crash site with an Iskander short-range ballistic missile, which seems much more likely — and is something TWZ predicted. We still don’t know why the drone was shot down by another Russian aircraft, but the fact that it was operating in close proximity to a crewed jet suggests it may also have been conducting some kind of trials in which it was paired with a crewed platform. The S-70 has been involved in previous non-combat ‘loyal wingman’ trials alongside the Su-57. This may also have led to the claims that it was a Su-57 that shot down the example over Ukraine. On the other hand, the S-70 may have been exploring independent strike operations, with a fighter on hand to observe or even specifically to shoot it down in the case of a serious malfunction, including a terminal command loss. Above all, the need to potentially shoot it down may have been driven by the requirement to keep sensitive technology out of Ukrainian (and, by proxy, Western) hands. We go over these possibilities and their historical precedent in detail in our past report on the incident. CONFIRMED: Russian 'Hunter' Sukhoi S-70 Okhotnik-B UCAV was shot down by Russian Su-57 fighter jet with AA missile.Why?No answer, for now. pic.twitter.com/foCGeO5igZ&mdash; Clash Report (@clashreport) October 5, 2024 Whatever the operational status of the S-70 shot down over the weekend, the capabilities that the drone offers in the strike role would be of great interest to the Russian Aerospace Forces (VKS). Throughout the war, the VKS crewed aircraft fleet has taken heavy losses, while Ukraine’s expanding air defense capabilities have pushed tactical aircraft further away from the front lines. This situation has spurred the development and fielding of weapons like the UMPB D-30SN. Adding these munitions to an uncrewed platform with a useful range that also offers at least some low-observable characteristics is certainly one way of mitigating those threats. Photos of new Russian UMPB D-30SN guided bombs installed under the wing of a Sukhoi Su-34 bomber. pic.twitter.com/sTskwkh1hF&mdash; Status-6 (Military & Conflict News) (@Archer83Able) May 23, 2024 However, it’s unclear how many S-70s are actually available to Russia. It seems that around four of the basic versions were completed, one of these being the victim of the shootdown, while a more refined S-70, with stealthier engine exhaust and other enhancements, has also been rolled out. Its current status is unclear. Whatever the case, the use of the S-70 in the war in Ukraine is likely to be tokenistic at best although — at least until the shootdown — its deployment there may have provided some useful test data for further development of the drone and related tactics. At the same time, the VKS needs all the strike assets it can get, which may also have prompted combat trials of the S-70, something that Russia has done before in the past, notably with the Su-57 in Syria and, according to Western intelligence assessments, in Ukraine. While an operational test of the S-70 and its strike capabilities in a combat environment now looks like the most likely explanation for the drone’s presence over Ukraine, it does remain somewhat surprising. Exposing the low-observable drone to such a high-threat environment is one thing, but putting a crewed fighter in the same area is another, all the more so if it was one of the relatively small number of Su-57s available to the VKS. Both platforms are among the most advanced and most sensitive in terms of technology, so risking them both is unusual. Perhaps the S-70 went astray, and the decision was taken to send a fighter to bring it down, with a short-range missile being used from within visual range to ensure that it was destroyed. Whatever happened, it’s certainly highly intriguing that an armed S-70 drone was underway over Ukraine. As well as being a very notable development in terms of the air war there, it may very well be the first known instance of an armed flying wing UCAV operating in an active conflict zone.

Israel Expands Ground Operation In Lebanon As World Braces For Re...	Israeli forces look to have conducted yet another targeted strike against Hezbollah in Lebanon's capital Beirut and have expanded their ground incursions in the southern end of that country. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) also say they shot down a ballistic missile headed toward the center of the country today, which Houthi militants in Yemen had fired. This all comes as Israel marks the first anniversary of Hamas' large-scale terrorist attacks last year, which touched off what the country's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has now described as a 'war of resurrection' (or 'rebirth' or 'revival' depending on the translation). There continue to be fears of an even broader regional conflict depending on how Israel responds to Iran's ballistic missile barrage last week. What specific type of missile the Houthis fired at Israel today is unclear, but it was reportedly downed outside the atmosphere by an Arrow-3 interceptor. Concerns about debris from the engagement posing a risk to bystanders on the ground caused air raid sirens to blare across a broad area of central Israel. The incoming missile also looks to have temporarily disrupted commercial air traffic at Ben Gurion International Airport in Tel Aviv, though it is unknown currently if that was the intended target. The Yemeni militants targeted Tel Aviv for the first time in September. The missile was shot down with the Arrow long-range missile defense system, which is designed to take out ballistic missiles while they are still outside the atmosphere.&mdash; Emanuel (Mannie) Fabian (@manniefabian) October 7, 2024 Sirens sounding all over central Israel as a result of a missile from Yemen pic.twitter.com/suvOJmzNta&mdash; Israel Defense Forces (@IDF) October 7, 2024 Arriving and Departing Flights at Ben Gurion International Airport in Tel Aviv have been Suspended, following the launch of a Ballistic Missile from Yemen towards Central Israel.

The IDF often issues public warnings for civilians to evacuate certain areas ahead of more general strikes and other operations. Reports also say that the particular area of Beirut that was hit was where Hashem Safieddine, second-in-command of Hezbollah, was targeted and possibly killed last week. Israel has been very actively targeting the leadership of the Lebanese terrorist group, as well as its weapons stockpiles and communications networks, for weeks now. A particularly huge Israeli strike on Beirut on September 27 killed Hassan Nasrallah, Hezbollah's long-time leader, among others. Hezbollah's number two Safieddine was widely seen as Nasrallah's likely successor. Just this past weekend, Israel launched additional strikes on the Lebanese capital said to target Hezbollah weapon storage facilities, which caused an especially massive blast with numerous secondary explosions.

Elements of three brigades assigned to the 91st 'Galilee' Division – the 3rd 'Alexandroni,' the 8th 'Hativa Shmoneh,' and the 228th 'Alon' – have now moved into Lebanon. The 91st Division has long been tasked with guarding Israel's northern border with Lebanon and its 769th 'Hiram' Brigade' remains in Israel to continue that mission. The 91st is the third Israeli division to send forces into Lebanese territory since ground operations as part of the current campaign began on September 30-October 1.

Last week, the IDF issued new evacuation warnings to Lebanese civilians in communities north of an existing United Nations-monitored buffer zone that pointed to a widening operations area. As already noted, all of these developments come as Israel has now marked the one-year anniversary of Hamas' unprecedented attacks on October 7, 2023, which have precipitated the current regional conflagration. Hamas launched a new round of rocket attacks on Israel today that coincided with the exact time it launched its operation a year ago.

The Houthis in Yemen have also been targeting Israel for months now, including with the ballistic missile launched today. All of these groups are backed by Iran, which has itself launched two barrages against Israeli sites. Israel continues to conduct operations targeting Hamas and other Palestinian militants in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, and has also launched its own strikes on targets in Yemen and Iran.

The War Zone and others have noted in the past that escalating Iranian strikes could lead Israel to target the former's oil or nuclear infrastructure, which in turn could provoke even stronger reactions from Tehran. Satellite imagery and ship tracking data have shown a recent exodus of Iranian tanker ships from Kharg Island, which handles the bulk of the country's oil exports, ahead of potential Israeli strikes there. Satellite imagery also points to the departure of a significant number of Iranian warships from the port of Bandar Abbas.

Just yesterday, Major General Abdolrahim Mousavi, head of Iran's Army, warned of 'stronger and more destructive' attacks if Israel responded in kind to the latest volley of Iranian missiles. Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu had said that 'Iran made a big mistake tonight – and it will pay for it' after the missile barrage last week. There continue to be concerns about how further fighting directly between Israel and Iran might draw in other actors, especially the United States. The U.S. military has already been actively engaged in defending Israel against attacks from Iran. U.S. Army Gen. Michael 'Erik' Kurilla, head of U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM), notably met with his Israeli counterparts in person yesterday.

Israeli media has reported today that the Biden administration has offered its Israeli counterparts a 'compensation package' that includes additional military aid to abstain from major retaliation against Iran. 'Far too many civilians have suffered far too much during this year of conflict — and tens of thousands have been killed, a human toll made far worse by terrorists hiding and operating among innocent people. We will not stop working to achieve a ceasefire deal in Gaza that brings the hostages home, allows for a surge in humanitarian aid to ease the suffering on the ground, assures Israel’s security, and ends this war,' Biden said in a statement marking the October 7 attacks. 'Israelis and Palestinians alike deserve to live in security, dignity, and peace. We also continue to believe that a diplomatic solution across the Israel-Lebanon border region is the only path to restore lasting calm and allow residents on both sides to return safely to their homes.' 'Israel will respond to the unprecedented Iranian attack in the manner of our choosing, and at the time and place of our choosing' and 'everything is on the table,' Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant also said on Sunday. '[But] we are powerful when we are aligned, and I want to make sure of it.' If nothing else, after more than a year of expanding fighting between Israeli forces and various militant groups around the region, as well as Iran itself, what Prime Minister Netanyahu has now dubbed the 'war of resurrection' shows no signs of slowing down.

Why Did Russia Just Shoot Down Its Own Fighter-Sized S-70 Hunter ...	A bizarre situation emerged out of Eastern Ukraine this morning, one in which a Russian fighter fired a short-range air-to-air missile and shot down one of its own aircraft while flying over highly-defended Ukrainian territory. And this wasn't just any aircraft, it was one of a tiny handful of Russian Air Force S-70 Okhotnik-B (Hunter-B) flying wing unmanned combat air vehicle (UCAV). Russian S-70 UAV, which was shot down today [The photos has been cleaned by artificial intelligence] pic.twitter.com/banwvy8oLy&mdash; Dariusz Zawadzki (@Military_oO) October 5, 2024 I can confirm, based on footage from @PEnssle, that Ukrainian forces have already recovered and removed large, relatively intact pieces of the advanced Russian S-70 Okhotnik UCAV that crashed in Donetsk Oblast.Notably including the wing segment seen in this video. pic.twitter.com/7Z9yDgKfab&mdash; OSINTtechnical (@Osinttechnical) October 5, 2024 It's S-70-4 pic.twitter.com/9qVD3gUOGl&mdash; Fighterman_FFRC (@Fighterman_FFRC) October 5, 2024 CONFIRMED: Russian 'Hunter' Sukhoi S-70 Okhotnik-B UCAV was shot down by Russian Su-57 fighter jet with AA missile.Why?No answer, for now. pic.twitter.com/foCGeO5igZ&mdash; Clash Report (@clashreport) October 5, 2024 The S-70 is a heavy-weight strike and reconnaissance tactical drone with some low observable (stealthy) features. It was also envisioned to be able to partake in air-to-air combat. Independent operations and those paired with other aircraft, both manned and unmanned, are envisioned for the type. The S-70 is a very large UCAV design. Here we see the first generation example with its exposed exhaust, of which only around four were said to have been built. A more advanced type was subsequently rolled out with a more refined airframe and enhanced stealthy features, but the status of this variant is unknown. The engagement occurred near Konstantynivka, in Donetsk, supposedly around 10 miles behind Ukrainian lines. Video shot from the ground shows one jet firing on another at close range, then a shattered flying wing aircraft falling to the ground. Images and video of the wreckage make it undeniable, it was indeed an S-70. Although we cannot say conclusively at this time, it appears to be one of the earlier demonstrator aircraft, which first emerged in early 2019, or one built to a similar specification and is significantly lower in sophistication than a more refined variant with enhanced low-observable (stealth) features rolled out in 2021. A more refined S-70 was rolled out in 2021, including a low-observable exhaust. (UAC) Some claim an Su-57 Felon shot the aircraft down. We cannot confirm that at this time, but that would make sense as the two programs have been directly linked and 'loyal wingmen' cooperative testing — even if rudimentary — between the two was underway long before the full-on invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Prior to the invasion, Russia claimed it was targeting the Hunter-B to be operational by 2024. What exactly the definition of operational was isn't known. While it isn't perfectly clear what transpired to cause one Russian aircraft to shoot down another, the most likely answer is that the S-70 was being used operationally as part of its ongoing development — which likely has slowed considerably since the war began — and especially to provide support for the war effort. Russia often sends its new gear into combat areas for testing and to drum-up support for potential export opportunities. The Russian Air Force has taken heavy losses and is under threat from long-range air defenses while in the air and from marauding Ukrainian drones while on the ground. Even if the S-70 program has slowed, pushing existing examples into combat use would make sense as one thing it offers above all else is range and the lack of a pilot onboard certainly makes it less risky when operating near the front. Its low-observable features could make it less susceptible to air defenses, but to what degree is highly debatable. It's also possible that it was never supposed to get near Ukrainian airspace along the front at all. So, why shoot it down? The best answer is that operators lost command over the aircraft and it had strayed into airspace over hostile territory. Systems failures can occur and we are talking about a very dense electronic warfare combat environment here. This is not an uncommon reality for testing new advanced aerial unmanned technologies or even for operations of existing types in both hostile and benign areas. Self-destruct devices or more often fighter aircraft prepared to shoot the drone down in case it poses a danger to others or a security risk is a normal contingency. The U.S. had to do this multiple times when its drones went astray during the Global War On Terror, for instance. A very sensitive drone like the S-70 lost deep inside Ukrainian territory, coming down possibly in a semi-intact state, would be a huge problem for Russia, both technologically and optics-wise, so it seems the decision was made to destroy it. We can all remember when the U.S. lost its far more secretive RQ-170 to Iran in 2011, for example. The approximate area where the S-70 went down. (Google Earth) The fact that this occurred over Ukrainian-held territory is also surprising. First off, the air defense overlay over this region is extremely robust and a huge threat to anything that flies close to the front, especially at altitude. It's somewhat bewildering that the S-70 and the fighter survived long enough to execute the shootdown in this area. Maybe it's a testament to their designs and Russia's electronic warfare capabilities or maybe they just got very lucky, we just don't know. The risk was clearly worth taking in Russia's eyes though. Working closer to the front with an Su-57 would make some sense as they are more capable of doing it than anything in Russia's inventory, but it also speaks to some stunning risk Russia is able to absorb in order to put these aircraft into action. Beyond kinetic actions, considering Russia's limited advanced reconnaissance capabilities in contested areas, the ability to collect airborne intelligence that close to the front using advanced sensors alone could have been seen as worth the gamble. Once again, it's also possible they were never meant to be close to the front lines and the decision to take the S-70 down came late or the Su-57 raced in to do it and was operating well behind the S-70 to begin with. Regardless, it was very risky. Having large parts of an Su-57 fall into the hands of Western intelligence would be a big deal. But still, the S-70's wreckage may represent the most enticing foreign material exploitation (FME) opportunity of the conflict, and there have been many of them so far. It also makes sense why large parts would be spirted away as fast as possible as because if Russia could geolocate the wreckage, they would surely try to strike it, likely with an Islander-M ballistic missile in order to eliminate it as fast as possible. But unless a lower-end drone spots it and minus a few other caveats, Russia's targeting cycles are notoriously slow. Notably not present in this footage, filmed just a few hours after the crash. OSINTtechnical (@Osinttechnical) October 5, 2024 Since not long after the invasion began, there has been chatter about the Su-57 and the S-70 — both of which exist in small numbers — being used on a limited basis. It's hard to parse which of these reports are accurate and which are not, but some of them have been backed up by Western intelligence. This incident clearly shows Russia's willingness to thrust these prized assets into the war effort, or at least close enough to these activities where contingencies like this one would be put in place and executed upon demand. The S-70 aircraft largely call Akhtubinsk Air Base home. This is Russia's key tactical jet flight test facility and an airfield that has been on the receiving end of Ukrainian drone strikes. It isn't clear if the S-70 flew from this location or was forward-based for Ukraine operations, but the base being about 365 miles from the fighting would put it well inside the drone's presumed combat radius. Still, it's worth noting that high-resolution satellite imagery taken of the installation multiple times in the second half of September does not show the S-70 aircraft on the ramp. This could be because they are hangared or they are forward deployed. A pair of S-70s sit on the ramp at Russia's 929th Chkalov State Flight Test Center in 2022. (Google Earth) As for what the Russian milbloggers are saying about this incident, many are fuming that these aircraft were in such a densely defended area. Others confirm that the S-70 was shot down due to a failure in its command and control architecture while on a combat evaluation. Fighterbomber, which is well connected to the Russian Air Force, states: 'It is clear that the GLIC will now be spanked in all its cracks. They basically fucked up a serial Okhotnik. (This is indicated by its coloring, only standard UAVs are painted like this) At the same time, it is difficult to understand what happened to the UAV, because it fell on territory controlled by the hohols. That is, they will disassemble it down to the last screw and, of course, familiarize themselves with its rich internal contents. Secondly, in fact, both the Okhotnik and the escort fighter were flying over enemy territory. At a high altitude, shot through and accessible to all air defense systems, including MANPADS. That is, we could have fucked up not only the Okhotnik, but also the Su-57 escort, and this is a completely different scenario. I understand that even the loss of a pair of A-50s did not entail any serious organizational conclusions, maybe we would have bounced back here, but it would be more difficult. And I really want to hope that it was a loss of control due to something failing, or they didn't resolve the situation with the Rabbits, or the UAV's brains went crazy for their own reasons, and not the drone being intercepted by the enemy. But the event, of course, requires the most thorough investigation.' Above all else, it is quite ironic that the first known instance that a flying wing multi-role unmanned combat air vehicle was shot down in an active conflict zone was not at the hands of the enemy, but by those belonging to its own air force. We will update this post with new information throughout the day if new info comes to light.

Ukraine Now Using Dragon Drones To Burn Russian Bunkers, Tanks	Ukraine is finding new ways to use its thermite-spewing dragon drones to burn Russian forces. They are now attacking their bunkers and tanks. The first use of these weapons, as we previously reported, became public back in early September. That's when video emerged showing one dispersing the molten mixture into trellises that concealed Russian troops and equipment. Additional videos soon popped up on social media showing more Ukrainian units using the weapon that way. Russia is also trying to use similar systems, but to what extent remains unclear. Primarily used in grenades and artillery shells, among other applications, thermite is a combination of oxidized iron and aluminum that burns at about 4,440 degrees Fahrenheit. The compound can be dropped or sprayed in a manner similar to a flamethrower. The combination of the searing heat of the thermite and the maneuverability and speed of a drone makes this a very lethal and versatile weapon. We are now seeing it applied elsewhere on the battlefield Ukrainian thermite dropping drones continue to rapidly proliferate through various drone units. Seen here, a Ukrainian drone from the 60th Mechanized Brigade drops a stream of molten thermite on a Russian-held treeline. pic.twitter.com/o20diLuN1L&mdash; OSINTtechnical (@Osinttechnical) September 4, 2024 At first, the drones were being deployed to burn away the areas where Russians sought cover under the dense growth. Now Ukraine has expanded its target list. In the video below, one of those drones sprayed the incendiary compound into a Russian bunker. It quickly spread, causing the bunker to erupt in flames, likely incinerating anyone inside. The AFU has started using the 'Dracarys' thermite drones to take out Russian bunkers.

Burning alive in a bunker filled with the horrific compound is also one heck of a psychological deterrent as well as being brutally effective. The Latest On the battlefield, Donetsk Oblast in eastern Ukraine continues to see the bulk of the fighting, but clashes continue across much of the 600-mile front lines as well as inside Russia’s Kursk Oblast. Kursk Oblast: Ukrainian forces continued ground assaults in Glushkovsky Raion west of the main Ukrainian salient there on October 4 but did not make confirmed advances, according to the latest assessment from the Institute for the Study of War (ISW). Kharkiv Oblast: Russian forces recently marginally advanced in Vovchansk amid continued offensive operations north and northeast of Kharkiv City on October 4, ISW reported. Luhansk: Russian forces recently made a confirmed advance near Kreminna, according to ISW, amid continued offensive operations along the Kupyansk-Svatove-Kreminna line on October 4. Donetsk: Russian forces continued offensive operations east of Siversk near Verkhnokamyanske, southeast of Siversk near Spirne, near Chasiv Yar, Pokrovsk and southwest of Donetsk City with no confirmed gains, according to ISW. They recently advanced south of Toretsk and west of Donetsk City. Zaporizhzhia Oblast: Positional fighting 'continued in western Zaporizhia Oblast near Robotyne, Mali Shcherbaky (northwest of Robotyne), Kamyanske (south of Stepnohirsk), and Novodanylivka (north of Robotyne) on October 3 and 4, but there were no confirmed changes to the frontline,' the ISW assessment explained.

One soldier from Ukraine’s 72nd Brigade that defended the city explained why it couldn’t be held despite its elevation. 'And what is a dominant height now, if the enemy’s reconnaissance drones are hovering over you around the clock?' a soldier named Viktor told the Ukrainian Slidstvo news outlet. 'And they have an advantage in artillery, we had practically no artillery, it’s not like it was in the winter of 2023, when we defeated the 155th Brigade.' At that time, 'We had a lot of artillery, shoot if you want, but now we don’t, they have parity in the air due to the larger number of FPV drones,' he added. 'The Russians also started remotely mining all the access roads to the front line. Yes, their infantry are bums, but they have an advantage in means and numbers. We simply had no one and nothing to fight with.’' '‘Before the brigade was redeployed to the Donetsk region, we had a fully operational unit and staff. But over two years of fighting without rotations and rest, we turned into an incapacitated unit, the brigade was wiped out,’ says Viktor, who holds a position at the headquarters… pic.twitter.com/Y3w64BXlfj&mdash; Rob Lee (@RALee85) October 3, 2024 Now that Russia has the town, the question remains how much will it hurt Ukraine's defense. In addition to sitting on high ground, Vuhledar is also located on a highway and near the juncture of two fronts - Donetsk and Zaporizhzhia. Behind it lay open fields with little cover for Ukrainian troops to hide, making it easier for Russians to maneuver. In addition, it is located about 30 miles south of the embattled city of Pokrovsk, which as we have previously reported is a key logistical hub for Ukraine. The Russians however have been making few major territorial gains in the region. Adding to their challenges is that the mud season is not far away, which will make further gains even tougher to achieve. Overall, as ISW and other military analysts note, Russia's offensive momentum in Donbas is extremely slow and its unclear how much it can gain beyond VuhledarBut the picture in Donetsk is clearly much more dim than Ukraine would like to see&mdash; Samuel Ramani (@SamRamani2) October 4, 2024 Ukrainian drones struck the Borisoglebsk Air Base in Russia's Voronezh region, about 180 miles northeast of the border on Thursday. Satellite imagery obtained by The War Zone indicates the attack caused no significant damage. It is primarily a training base, specialized in preparing aircrews to operate tactical strike aircraft and ground-attack aircraft. It’s home to a pilot school that operates Su-25 Frogfoot attack aircraft and Yak-130 Mitten jet trainers. The airfield has also hosted detachments of Su-34s and Su-35S Flanker multirole fighters involved in operations against Ukraine.

Those officers 'came to the front as part of an exchange of experience,' the Kremlin Snuffbox Telegram channel claimed. 'They showed friendly military how our fighters prepare for assault actions, for defense, how we resist American weapons,' Kremlin Snuffbox explained, citing sources in the Russian Defense Ministry. 'Unfortunately, there was a missile strike on the training ground. In total, more than 20 people died, six of them are our friends - officers from North Korea.' Another three North Korean officers were wounded and sent to Moscow for treatment, the Telegram channel noted. As we wrote about in June, a mutual aid pact between Pyongyang and Moscow called for North Korea to send construction and engineering forces to Russia-occupied territories of Ukraine for rebuilding work. Kremlin Snuff Box said it asked if the presence of those North Koreans in Donetsk meant that its troops were taking part in the war. 'The sources did not give a clear answer to this question,' the Telegram channel stated.

Clearer Picture Of Damage To Israeli Airbase From Iranian Ballist...	Satellite images of Israel’s Nevatim Air Base reveal details of the level of destruction Iran achieved in its ballistic missile barrage on October 1 but also fail to provide any evidence to back up claims from Tehran about the destruction of Israeli Air Force F-35I Adir stealth fighters. You can read our initial report of the Iranian attacks here, as well as an account of how the U.S. Navy helped defeat some of the incoming missiles here. Of the around 180 ballistic missiles — including ones of notably advanced design — launched by Iran earlier this week, a significant number landed in Israel, succeeding in overwhelming the country’s extensive anti-ballistic missile umbrella. This is in contrast to the Iranian attacks in April, during which only very few missiles — mainly of older design — managed to leak through. In that attack, long-range one-way attack drones were also layered into the attack. This time it was strictly a ballistic missile affair, which makes sense considering the poor performance of the drones. Iran claimed that the missiles in the latest attack were directed at key Israeli military facilities including the Mossad headquarters, air defense radars, and two key air bases: Nevatim and Tel Nof. This is exactly the target set we posited would be chosen for such an attack. Geolocation confirms that Iranian hits pounded the Nevatim airbase.Reviewing the footage, you can see slower projectiles mixed in with the supersonic ones, with the supersonic projectiles hitting the important targets.@warcabinet_ pic.twitter.com/aRmomVtijb&mdash; Theurgy (@eTheurgy) October 2, 2024 Nevatim Air Base has been very prominent in terms of Iranian claims of success, while subsequent satellite imagery sheds light on what actually happened there. So far, equivalent imagery from Tel Nof Air Base has not become available. Partial cloud cover has limited the output of high-resolution imagery since the strike. Israel has claimed that its air operations were not impacted by the strikes. In the meantime, open-source intelligence and imagery analysts have been poring over the satellite images of Nevatim, which houses the IAF prized F-35 fleet and electronic support aircraft, as well as airlifters and other aircraft. According to Decker Eveleth, a strategic forces analyst at the Center for Naval Analyses (CAN), a U.S. nonprofit research and analysis organization, these reveal 'at least 33 likely impact craters, with likely more impacts currently obscured by clouds.' The total number of impacts is therefore probably closer to 40, Eveleth contends. Make sure to read Everett's full analysis here. We counted! 32 impact points at Nevatim, with a small degree of clustering. They landed multiple hits in the area of F-35 hangers, with one possible direct hit, but not a lot of damage. Takeaway: some F-35s got really lucky. Decker Eveleth (@dex_eve) October 3, 2024 This is a significant number and especially notable when compared with Iran’s attacks in April, which succeeded in only five confirmed missile impacts at Nevatim. What’s not entirely clear is what exactly Iran was targeting at Nevatim Air Base and whether the warheads that impacted there were intended to hit specific hangars, buildings, or other particular points and failed to do so. Eveleth does note some impact ‘clustering’ around areas including revetments and fighter hangars, though this isn’t conclusive. Still, one hangar was clearly destroyed. Good analysis by @dex_eve on the Nevatim Airbase strike:-At least 33 craters-Limited damage, but one apparent hit and two near misses at F-35 shelters-Iran has proven its missiles are effective and can defeat Israeli air defense Evan Hill (@evanhill) October 4, 2024 A view of the open flightline for the base's larger residents on a normal day: İsrail askeri-güvenlik uzmanı Yossi Melman, Navatim üssünden alınan uydu görüntülerine yanıt olarak: Bu üssün uğradığı hasarın Hava Kuvvetleri'nin açıkladığından çok daha fazla olduğu açık. pic.twitter.com/jOdgXgrYKc&mdash; Kadim Yaşar (@Ka_Ya14) October 4, 2024 Iran has ballistic missiles with maneuvering warheads and past attacks by shorter-ranged types have shown some surprising accuracy, so efforts to target specific points around the base were certainly made. Striking precisely over much greater distances with more complex missiles is certainly a tougher proposition though. In his analysis of what the latest missile barrage against Nevatim Air Base actually achieved, Eveleth concludes that the answer is 'not much.' 'Most of the impact zones either missed entirely or simply hit the taxiways around the base, most of which has now been repaired. They did score some hits on one refueling aircraft hangar and a couple buildings,' he continues. A support building at the southern end of the base certainly was hit, destroying a part of it, while another building on the eastern side of the base was also hit, and shows signs of likely heavy damage. There is also a closely grouped number of impacts around an aircraft storage area, although these aircraft are parked in the open, suggesting they may be no longer active. As for the highly prized F-35s — 20 of which were destroyed, according to some Iranian reports — the damage here seems to be largely limited to some craters adjacent to a row of shelters that house the aircraft, although its possible limited damage to concealed airframes did occur. Israeli Air Force F-35I Adir stealth fighters. IAF Israeli F-35I Adirs. Israeli Air Force One of the shelters seems to have received some damage, perhaps due to a direct hit, with suggestions of a small hole in the roof. It’s unclear what happened here, but Eveleth suggests it may have been a warhead that failed to explode. Even if more warheads had hit the shelters and detonated, there’s a high probability the majority of the F-35s would have survived anyway, since they were almost certainly airborne in advance of the missile attack. On the evening of the strikes, almost all Israeli Air Force tankers were airborne off the coast, suggesting they were involved in topping up combat aircraft that had scrambled from their bases. F-35s would have been prioritized assets for tanker support in order to save them from potential destruction on the ground. Of all the aircraft Iran would target, they would be at the top of the list as they pose the most threat to the regime and are highly prized by the IAF. ISRAEL - Almost the whole israeli tanker fleet is in the sky. pic.twitter.com/8OGsl0GDD1&mdash; kim høvik (@kimhvik2) October 1, 2024 How much of the IAF did they get airborne before the ballistic missiles arrived? We likely saw a plan put into action here based on lessons learned from the last barrage.&mdash; Tyler Rogoway (@Aviation_Intel) October 1, 2024 Still, some are claiming that all of the F-35s would have vacated the base before the missiles arrived. This is nearly an impossible notion. All fighter aircraft, and especially highly complex 5th generation types, take a vast amount of constant maintenance. A portion of the fleet would be down for deep servicing, waiting on parts, and other issues at any given time, making it impossible for them to fly out. You can read our in-depth article on this reality here. Still, some grounded jets could still be moved to unlikely locations around the base in many instances to help protect them if there was time to do so. Looking at Nevatim Air Base overall, there is good news and bad, as far as Israel is concerned. The base took a lot of hits, which suggests that Israel’s ballistic missile defenses were, at least to some degree, overwhelmed. This is not all that surprising. As we pointed out repeatedly after the first attack in April, the next one would use new tactics, with oversaturating missile defenses and focusing on a small number of large area military targets in remote locations —airbases especially — being likely the foundations for a future attack plan. The lack of damage may be due to the inherent difficulties in targeting an air base at such a long distance or may point to a high level of failures and low level of accuracy of Iran’s longer-ranged ballistic missiles. It's always possible Iran could intentionally have chosen target areas, not specific structures or objects, to go after in order to decrease the likelihood of a major counter-attack while still accomplishing their propaganda goals at home and throughout the Middle East. Still, this seems like a less likely possibility. We also need to factor in Israeli efforts to defend against Iranian missile strikes beyond using its ballistic missile defenses — and those of allies. Israel will almost certainly have also employed electronic warfare, such as GPS disruption and 'left of launch' tactics to degrade Iran’s ballistic missile capabilities via non-kinetic means. It could also simply be that, on this occasion, Nevatim Air Base — and Israel — did indeed get lucky. New video showing Iran's preparations for the October 1 strike inside an underground facility. The footage includes both Ghadr missiles and what appear to be either Kheybarshekan or Fattah 1 missiles. pic.twitter.com/PvblZ6ihU0&mdash; Fabian Hinz (@fab_hinz) October 4, 2024 The main takeaway, however, is that Iran has demonstrated that it can strike Israel with numerous ballistic missiles. Were the same missiles to have targeted civilian areas, the loss of life could have been very severe. If they were turned against broad area infrastructure targets, the damage could also be very problematic. The worry, now, for Israel is not only that Iran can strike its territory, but also that it’s increasing the number of missiles in its inventory, enhancing their accuracy and hardening them to countermeasures, making them an even greater threat. Also, such a large real-world use like this latest attack provides critical data to Iran on how to improve these already rapidly developing long-range strike systems. With Israel poised to retaliate at any time and Iran threatening to wipe out Israel's critical infrastructure if they do, another barrage could come in the near future.

Watch Turkey’s ‘Solo Turk’ F-16 Demo Jet’s Close Call During A Re...	One of the best-known military jet demonstrations currently active, the Turkish Air Force’s 'Solo Turk' F-16 team, appears to have had an extremely close call at a recent airshow. Footage of the incident has appeared widely on social media, as well as unconfirmed reports of an investigation into what happened. Based on what we can see from the available videos, the pilot seems to have had a very lucky escape with the jet intact.

The incident appears to have taken place yesterday, with the festival running from October 2-6. At the end of the airshow display, the pilot waggles the wings and then performs a roll above the runway, but the nose of the F-16 drops alarmingly, leaving the jet inverted and pointing toward the ground — and seemingly also near the crowd line. Based on where the available videos are shot from, it’s not easy to tell exactly how close to the ground the aircraft got, but it certainly appears alarming, especially considering the fighter jet speeds involved. An F-16C of the Solo Turk demo team performing during the Royal International Air Tattoo at RAF Fairford in Gloucestershire, England, on July 20, 2024. Photo by MI News/NurPhoto via Getty Images MI News TWZ spoke to one former fast jet pilot who gave their opinion on the footage, observing that the distance between the F-16 and the ground at the lowest point appears to be 'a small number of wingspans.' 'It might have been that the pilot wanted to do some form of hesitation roll and actually paused at 180 degrees — but even so that requires you to really hawk your velocity vector,' the same pilot added. A previous display routine seen from the cockpit of the Solo Turk F-16: Whatever the case, it seems almost certain that the airshow organizers would have called for the display sequence to be terminated, were it not that the pilot was already on their final pass. The fighter pilot we spoke to also considered it 'highly likely that the display director would have red-carded the pilot.' Rolling maneuvers of any kind in close proximity to the ground require great skill and precision on the part of the pilot, and the jet’s nose placement has to be very closely monitored at all times. It may be the case that the pilot was not at fault here, though. There are unconfirmed reports that the F-16 may have had some kind of flight-control system malfunction, leading to an uncontrolled dive, which the pilot then reacted to, climbing out. 01 Ekim 2024 Teknofest Adana uçuş saatlerimiz… pic.twitter.com/Lt4IckpMTv&mdash; SOLOTÜRK (@soloturk) September 30, 2024 Reports from Turkey state that an investigation has now been launched into exactly what happened. In the meantime, the Solo Turk F-16 display remains one of the best-regarded on the European airshow circuit and one that has an excellent safety record. The Solo Turk team — which operates out of Konya Air Base — has around a dozen personnel, including two pilots, plus a CN235 support aircraft and has received several awards for its airshow performances. For now, the dramatic footage is a reminder of the very line between a breathtaking airshow routine and disaster. The fact that such close calls are a relatively rare occurrence speaks to the preparation and close cooperation between air forces and airshow organizers to ensure that these displays remain safe — and spectacular.

First Plutonium Pit For Nuclear Warhead Produced In The U.S. In 3...	The Department of Energy’s National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) has announced the completion of the first weapon-ready example of a vital component for the W87-1 warhead. The component, called a 'plutonium pit,' is the radioactive component that acts as a first stage 'trigger' apparatus used to initiate the detonation of the thermonuclear device. Plans call for the W87-1s to be used in the future LGM-35A Sentinel nuclear-armed intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM), a program that is massively over budget and faces numerous issues. The NNSA calls this 'an important milestone for the United States’ nuclear weapon stockpile modernization' as it phases out the aging W78 warheads, one of two types that are placed atop LGM-30G Minuteman III ICBMs currently stationed in silos. The other is the W87-0. A Minuteman III missile in its silo. USAF 'The W87-1 nuclear warhead will replace the W78 nuclear warhead, which was first introduced in 1979 and represents the oldest weapon in the U.S. nuclear stockpile that has not undergone a major life extension or replacement,' the Government Accountability Office noted. 'The W87-1 will be carried on the Air Force’s Sentinel intercontinental ballistic missile and is slated for deployment in the early 2030s.' The W87-0s will initially be installed on Sentinels, but those will eventually be phased out as well. To make any of this happen, however, NNSA needs new plutonium pits. A good description of how the pits play a critical role in a nuclear warhead can be found at the Bulletin Of The Atomic Scientists, stating: 'Pits are the hollow plutonium cores of the fission 'primaries' (triggers) of two-stage modern warheads. A warhead explosion would begin with the implosion of the pit to supercriticality, which would enable an exponentially growing fission chain reaction in the plutonium. That fission explosion—'boosted' by neutrons from a fusion reaction in tritium-deuterium gas injected into the middle of the hollow pit just before implosion—would ignite a much more powerful 'secondary' nuclear fission-fusion explosion.' Inside this pit of plutonium-239 is a chamber of hydrogen gas. The high temperatures and pressures created by the plutonium-239 fission cause the hydrogen atoms to fuse. This fusion process releases neutrons, which feed back into the plutonium-239, splitting more atoms and boosting the fission chain reaction, making a more powerful bomb. How a thermonuclear warhead works. (Union of Concerned Scientists) The W78 warhead is said to have a yield of 335 kilotons. It is unclear what the W87-1’s exact will be, but the original W87 warhead has a reported baseline yield of 300 kilotons. The follow-on variant is understood to be modifiable to increase the weapon’s yield to 475 kilotons. By way of comparison, the bomb dropped on Hiroshima was vastly less powerful, producing a yield of 16 kilotons. At issue is that the U.S. hasn’t produced these pits in more than three decades. During the Cold War, the U.S. could manufacture hundreds of these pits every year, but production ceased in 1989, NNSA explained. The goal is to rebuild 'the capability to manufacture plutonium pits, at the rate of no fewer than 80 pits per year…and recapitalize production capabilities that atrophied in the post-Cold War era across the Nuclear Security Enterprise,' NNSA states. Los Alamos National Laboratory’s Plutonium Facility-4 produced the first weapon-ready W87-1 pit. A prototype of the nose cone 'shroud' that will go on top of each LGM-35A goes flying during a test. (Northrop Grumman) However, the Sentinel missile program is troubled, faced with massive cost overruns and delays, including the development of sufficient plutonium pits. As we noted previously, the U.S. Air Force is pushing ahead with Sentinel despite a new projected price tag of nearly $141 billion, close to twice the original estimate, and now years of expected delays. The main factor driving costs up is largely the result of required upgrades to existing missile silos and other launch and command and control infrastructure rather than the missile itself. A rendering of a future Sentinel silo, which also highlights that much of the facility is expected to be entirely new. (Northrop Grumman) The plan to develop new plutonium pits is also facing budget and scheduling headwinds as new production facilities are needed to meet the demands. 'One of the production lines is in an advanced state of installation at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico, the home of US pit-production expertise,' the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists (BAS) explained in a 2023 report. 'The other is to be installed at the Department of Energy’s Savannah River Site (SRS) in South Carolina, where there is no pit-production expertise.' NNSA’S plutonium pit announcement 'is significant because Los Alamos has to demonstrate that the new W87-1 (which is already in development) can actually be supplied with the new pit in time for them to be able to deliver the warhead to the military on time (when the Sentinel ICBM is ready),' nuclear weapons expert Hans M. Kristensen told The War Zone. The Los Alamos Laboratory's Plutonium Facility-4 produced the first weapon-ready W87-1 plutonium pit. (Photo by Joe Raedle) Joe Raedle However, 'there is considerable doubt that the pit production program and therefore the W87-1 program will be able to deliver as planned,' added Kristensen, Director of the Nuclear Information Project at the Federation of American Scientists and Associate Senior Fellow to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. The planned factories 'are delayed and a new lawsuit has just ruled that DOE/NNSA violated the law by shortcutting regulations,' he noted. 'That will almost certainly cause further delays.' 'The timelines and cost projections are not realistic,' he posited. After eight years of development, the first fully certified plutonium pit for the future W87-1 warhead has been produced. will replace W78 and be one of two warheads (with W87-0; image), on the future Sentinel ICBM. pic.twitter.com/H8bhxWB3zM&mdash; Hans Kristensen (@nukestrat) October 2, 2024 The production of the first weapon-ready plutonium pit is just a first step in a long journey, Dylan Spaulding, senior scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists, told The War Zone. 'It is important to note that this doesn’t mean production will take off exponentially. It’s likely that not every pit produced will meet standards and the congressionally mandated goal of 80 pits per year by 2030 is still very much out of reach,' he said. 'We feel that that goal is both unnecessary and dangerous.' We asked NNSA to respond to the comments, made Thursday afternoon, by Kristensen and Spaulding. We will update this story with any pertinent details it provides. The challenges faced by the Sentinel come as China continues to dramatically expand its nuclear stockpile and ICBM arsenal= and Russia has reemerged as a glaring strategic threat. Meanwhile, the U.S. hasn't made a new nuclear weapon since the end of the Cold War more than three decades ago. The Sentinel program, while controversial and massively expensive, aims to keep America's ICBM edge for decades to come, but realizing that is proving much harder than originally envisioned. So any progress, including the production of plutonium pits, is likely welcome news for the program.

Navy Making Final Selection For F/A-XX Stealth Fighter, Plans For...	The U.S. Navy expects its sixth-generation fighter to enter service in the 2030s, bringing with it the ability to operate alongside drones and fly missions at long ranges — capabilities seen as essential for future conflict with China. The Navy’s ambitions, if realized, mean that the service may introduce its next-generation crewed fighter before the U.S. Air Force, which is now re-examining requirements for its new stealth combat jet, with the program on temporary hold. As it sits now, the Navy is late in the source selection process on who will build its next generation fighter and that decision could come soon. Like the Air Force, the Navy is working on its sixth-generation fighter as part of a program named Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD). The Navy crewed fighter is often referred to as the F/A-XX. The Navy is involved in direct cooperation with the Air Force’s program and both initiatives put crewed fighters at the center of a broader ‘system of systems’ that will also include advanced Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) drones.

Boeing But increasingly the programs seem that they might be headed in differing directions, certainly as far as current timelines are concerned. The Navy’s sixth-generation fighter will have 'advanced sensors, advanced lethality, advanced range, and being able to integrate with manned and unmanned capabilities together,' according to Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Lisa Franchetti, quoted in an article by Air & Space Forces Magazine. This matches what we previously knew about the initiative. Based on what we know about the two services sharing some technology and even control capabilities for CCA drones, it’s not a surprise that Franchetti mentions the manned/unmanned integration. 'That’s one of the things, as we learn from the Air Force and the work they’re doing, to integrate that with what we know that we need to be able to do,' she added. Chief of Naval Operations Adm.

Faced with the prospect of a potential future war in the Pacific with China and facing ever more advanced and further-reaching air defenses, as well as the vast distances involved in such a theater, long range was always seen as being one of the core capabilities of the Air Force’s NGAD fighter. That requirement is likely now being reassessed, although the Navy remains committed to it, according to Franchetti. Allowing for the carrier air wing to be able to reach relevant target sets and a a significant frequency while keeping the carrier itself at a safe distance from anti-ship and other anti-access capabilities is a glaring issue for the USN. Dramatically increasing the unrefueled combat radius of at least some of its fighters, which would be paired with CCAs with similar endurance, would go a long way to solving this problem. The Chief of Naval Operations added that the service plans to place a contract in time for the new fighter to enter service in the 2030s. This is the same kind of timeline that was anticipated for the Air Force’s equivalent new stealth fighter, but the current situation could push that date further to the right. Exactly how the Air Force’s NGAD fighter might be rescoped is unclear at this point and elements of the design have always been a tightly guarded secret anyway. As it stands, however, the Air Force’s NGAD program is under deep review, and it’s possible that there will be significant revisions to better reflect what the service wants — or can afford — out of its next fighter. Above all, this situation has been driven by the realization that the highly advanced aircraft might cost three times as much as a new F-35 — upwards of $300 million per copy. The Air Force is now eying pursuing a far less expensive aircraft, coming in at roughly the same price as an F-35 or F-15EX does, at around $90 million to $100 million each.

As we reported back in the summer, the program’s budget, which was already set to be truncated, could be cut even more severely in the next fiscal year. Members of the Senate are proposing to give the service nearly 90 percent less funding than it asked for to support continued work on the new carrier-based fighter. 'Black budgets' also play a role in a program like this too. Franchetti didn’t appear to mention those fiscal concerns, but the fact that she still said the service expects the aircraft to enter service in the 2030s makes it clear that the program remains a top priority. Still, it's questionable just how achievable that goal is and '2030s' is a broad window to begin with. Whether realistic or not, the Navy will first have to choose between Boeing, Lockheed Martin, and Northrop Grumman, which are currently in competition to provide the F/A-XX. Franchetti said that the service is now in the process of selecting which design to pursue. Meanwhile, it is understood that just Boeing and Lockheed Martin are perusing the USAF's manned NGAD fighter tender, with Northrop Grumman dropping out of the competition in part to focus on the Navy's program. It was always considered likely that the F/A-XX would share a powerplant with the NGAD, with technology for this being developed under the Next Generation Adaptive Propulsion (NGAP) program. With that in mind, it’s possible that the Air Force reducing the goals of the NGAP program — in line with reductions in performance targets — could have a knock-on effect on the capabilities of the Navy’s NGAD fighter. Whether the Navy would be willing to take a performance hit on its fighter if it meant saving a lot of money, both in development costs and eventual production expenditures, is unclear.

GE Aviation Aside from the cost factor now impacting decisions on the future of the Air Force NGAD program, there are increasing signs that the service is also reconsidering whether the crewed fighter concept, as understood up to now, is actually the best to meet emerging threats. As far as we know, however, the Navy still expects its F/A-XX and its accompanying drones to replace its F/A-18E/F Super Hornet multirole fighters as well as its EA-18G Growler electronic attack jet, all part of reshaping a carrier air wing that could eventually feature as much as two-thirds uncrewed aircraft. Intriguingly, however, Franchetti said that, while it’s important that the Navy and Air Force NGAD programs are aligned to some degree, this wasn’t the most critical factor in the Navy’s F/A-XX efforts. Making an effort to distance F/A-XX from the current uncertainties around the Air Force’s NGAD is perhaps understandable, considering the pause on the latter program. The Navy should have a much better idea of how the Air Force’s potential overhaul of its NGAD affects its program of the same name once the flying branch makes a decision on the path it wants to take for its sixth-generation fighter initiative. Such a decision is due to be made in the next few months. An artist’s illustration depicts a sixth-generation air dominance fighter of the kind being developed under NGAD. Boeing The Air Force has reiterated that it is committed to having a crewed stealth fighter at the heart of the wider NGAD initiative and that it will have a human pilot to start with, although an optionally crewed version might ultimately be developed too. 'I’m absolutely confident we’re still going to do a sixth-generation crewed aircraft,' Secretary of the Air Force Frank Kendall said in July of this year. Even if the Air Force NGAD effort ends up taking a radically different approach to meeting the service’s future air combat requirements, that also doesn’t mean that the Navy will not be able to benefit from technologies and concepts spun off from that program or run collaboratively. 'I think more broadly, as all the services work together to make sure that they have complementary capability, ‘Where can we learn from each other?'' Franchetti asked. 'Where can we leverage that learning so you can be more common in the future?' While the Air Force NGAD initiative has been characterized by its secrecy, the equivalent Navy sixth-generation fighter program has been proceeding, if anything, even more in the shadows. It remains to be seen to what degree the pause on the Air Force program will affect the F/A-XX, but the release of any new details about the programs at this critical stage is of great interest, to say the least.

How The AIM-174 Could Pop China’s Anti-Access Bubble In The Pacif...	The Navy has officially acknowledged the existence of a weapon we had posited it was developing for years, an air-launched version of the hugely versatile, far reaching, and hard hitting ship-launched SM-6. Designated the AIM-174, this massive, F/A-18 Super Hornet-carried air-to-air weapon is by default longer-ranged than any other the U.S. has ever fielded. While it isn’t clear if the AIM-174 will also retain the SM-6’s secondary anti-ship and land attack capabilities, just what it could provide in the anti-air and possibly anti-ballistic missile roles could be truly revolutionary. Clearly built to take full advantage of the Pentagon’s emerging ‘kill webs,’ this is especially true when it comes to popping China’s vaunted anti-access bubble by going after its most prized force-multiplier assets. So, how exactly could this work and what does it bring to the table? We break it all down for you in detail in the video posted at the top of this troy.
