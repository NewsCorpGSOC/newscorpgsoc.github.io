Uniqlo's chief says fast fashion must change with the times	TOKYO (AP) — Forty years after its founding, Japanese clothing retailer Uniqlo has more than 2,500 stores worldwide. Sales at its parent company, Fast Retailing Co., recently topped 3 trillion yen ($20 billion) annually for the first time. The name Uniqlo comes from joining the words for 'unique' and 'clothing.' The chain’s basic concept is 'LifeWear,' or everyday clothing. Uniqlo parent Fast Retailing Co. Chief Executive Tadashi Yanai, ranked by Forbes as Japan’s richest man and estimated to be worth $48 billion, spoke recently to The Associated Press at the company’s Tokyo headquarters. The interview has been edited for length and clarity. Q: What were the biggest challenges over the past 40 years? A: Actually 40 years, upon reflection, went by so fast they feel more like three years. You know what they say in Japan: Time flies like an arrow. I started a regional business, then expanded nationwide. When we became No. 2 or No. 3 in Japan’s casual wear, and being No. 1 was right within reach, we became a listed company in 1994. That was followed by our fleece boom, which doubled our revenue in one year to 400 billion yen ($2.6 billion). I’d been thinking about going global when our revenue reached 300 billion yen ($2 billion) so we opened 50 stores in Great Britain, hoping to be a winner there just like we had conquered Japan. Instead, we got totally knocked out. We opened 21 outlets in a year and a half, but had to close 16 of them, leaving just five. We didn’t succeed as we had hoped. This is not an easy job. It’s very tough. But these days, our sales are strongest in London, and also Paris. We made progress gradually. Q: What are some of the sustainability and other key issues you have faced over the years? A: We make clothes that last a long time. Not just clothes that last for one season. The cashmere sweater I’m wearing today is $99. But please don’t say 'cheap.' Please call it 'reasonable.' We sell quality products at reasonable prices. We’ve done various sustainability efforts, and we talk only about what we have really achieved. Sustainability is crucial to our operations. And we’ve done just about everything — recycling, employing the disabled, support for refugees. The prices may be cheaper at Wal-Mart, but our products offer real quality for the price. We take the greatest care and time, and involve a lot of people. Our rivals are more careless. Q: What is behind Uniqlo’s success and what resonated with global buyers? A: When we say Uniqlo is 'made for all,' one might imagine products for the masses, like what’s at a Wal-Mart or a Target. But what we mean is a high-quality product that appeals to all people, including the extremely rich, not only those with sophisticated taste and intelligence, but also people who don’t know that much about clothes, and the design is fine-tuned, the material fine quality, and sustainability concerns have been addressed. We were first a retailer, then a manufacturer-cum-retailer. Now we are a digital consumer retailer. That is why we are successful. If we had stayed the same, then we can’t hope to succeed. Being a digital consumer retail company means we utilize information at a high level to shape the way we do our work. We gain information about our customers, the workers at the store, the market, all that information. Changing daily is the only way we can hope for stable growth. The world is changing every day. Q: Are you confident you can keep it up another 40 years? A: Of course. We’ve been preparing to reach 3 trillion yen ($20 billion) revenue all these years. And we are finally starting to be known. But we still have a long way to go. We are just getting started, and we are going to keep growing. There is more potential for growth in Europe and the U.S., as well as China and India, given the 1.4 billion population in each country. Clothing is a necessity, so population size is key. ___ Yuri Kageyama is on X: https://x.com/yurikageyama	https://apnews.com/article/uniqlo-clothing-japan-affordable-a37ecb0c4539dde266573ef76b2afc3c	2024-11-18T02:01:14-08:00	
Tanzanian government says rescue efforts will continue at collapsed building where 13 died	DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania (AP) — Rescue efforts at a building that collapsed, killing at least 13 people, in Tanzania’s commercial capital entered a third day Monday with the government saying they will continue until all those trapped inside are saved. The number of people trapped was unclear, but several people have told local media that they have lost contact with relatives who they believe were inside the building. More than 80 people have been rescued from the four-story building, which housed dozens of shops and collapsed Saturday morning. Tanzanian President Samia Suluhu said on Sunday that more than 20 people were receiving medical treatment and the government would cover the costs. She ordered an audit of all buildings in Dar Es Salaam's Kariakoo area, which is popular among traders, and asked police to obtain the ownership and construction permits for the collapsed building. Some of those who died were being buried on Monday. It is currently the rainy season, when building collapses are common in the east African country. Buildings that collapse are often found to have violated construction regulations.	https://apnews.com/article/tanzania-building-collapse-rescue-8c0813965bc06cfb6b27b7ff69bb5265	2024-11-18T01:25:48-08:00	
A Russian ballistic missile with cluster munitions kills 11 people and injures 84 in Ukraine's north	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — A Russian ballistic missile with cluster munitions struck a residential area of a northern Ukraine city, killing 11 people including two children and injuring 84 others, officials said Monday. The two children killed in the strike on Sumy late Sunday were a 9-year-old boy and a 14-year-old girl, the regional prosecutor’s office said. Six injured children are in critical condition, it said. The attack damaged 15 buildings, including two educational facilities, the prosecutor’s office said. A search and rescue operation continued Monday, on the eve of the war’s 1,000-day milestone. Sumy lies 40 kilometers (24 miles) from the Russian border. Also Sunday, U.S. President Joe Biden authorized for the first time the use of U.S.-supplied longer-range missiles by Ukraine to strike inside Russia, after extensive lobbying by Ukrainian officials. The weapons are likely to be used in response to North Korea’s decision to send thousands of troops to support Russia in the Kursk region where Ukraine mounted a military incursion over the summer. It is the second time the U.S. has permitted the use of Western weapons inside Russian territory within limits after permitting the use of HIMARS systems, a shorter-range weapon, to stem Russia’s advance in Ukraine’s Kharkiv region in May. The first reaction from Ukraine to the long-awaited decision from the U.S. was notably restrained. 'Today, much is being said in the media about us receiving permission for the relevant actions. But strikes are not made with words. Such things are not announced. The missiles will speak for themselves,' Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in his nightly video address. Earlier, Zelenskyy said that Russia had launched a total of 120 missiles and 90 drones in a large-scale attack across Ukraine, including Sumy. Russia deployed various types of drones, he said, including Iranian-made Shaheds, as well as cruise, ballistic and aircraft-launched ballistic missiles. The attack, which targeted Ukraine’s energy infrastructure, came as fears are mounting about Moscow’s intentions to devastate Ukraine’s power generation capacity ahead of the winter. Ukrainian defenses shot down 144 out of a total of 210 air targets, Ukraine’s air force reported. 'The enemy’s target was our energy infrastructure throughout Ukraine. Unfortunately, there is damage to objects from hits and falling debris. In Mykolaiv, as a result of a drone attack, two people were killed and six others were injured, including two children,' Zelenskyy said. Two more people were killed in the Odesa region, where the attack damaged energy infrastructure and disrupted power and water supplies, said local Gov. Oleh Kiper. Both victims were employees of Ukraine’s state-owned power grid operator, Ukrenergo, the company said hours later. The combined drone and missile attack was the most powerful in three months, according to the head of Kyiv’s City Military Administration, Serhii Popko. One person was injured after the roof of a five-story residential building caught fire in Kyiv’s historic center, according to Popko. A thermal power plant operated by private energy company DTEK was 'seriously damaged,' the company said. Russian strikes have hammered Ukraine’s power infrastructure since Moscow’s all-out invasion of its neighbor in February 2022, prompting repeated emergency power shutdowns and nationwide rolling blackouts. Ukrainian officials have routinely urged Western allies to bolster the country’s air defenses to counter assaults and allow for repairs. Russia’s Defense Ministry on Sunday acknowledged carrying out a 'mass' missile and drone attack on 'critical energy infrastructure' in Ukraine, but claimed all targeted facilities were tied to Kyiv’s military industry. Although Ukraine’s nuclear plants were not directly impacted, several electrical substations on which they depend suffered further damage, the U.N.’s nuclear energy watchdog said in a statement Sunday. According to the International Atomic Energy Agency, only two of Ukraine’s nine operational reactors continue to generate power at full capacity. The Russian military said Monday it intercepted and destroyed 59 Ukrainian drones overnight over several Russian regions. Two were downed over the Moscow region that surrounds the Russian capital, and three others over the neighboring Tula region. A total of 54 drones were destroyed over the Bryansk, Kursk and Belgorod regions on the border with Ukraine, according to a statement by the Russian Defense Ministry. Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said the drones shot down outside of Moscow were heading toward the capital. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-missile-attack-sumy-5cd4f9fe2cee1ae8aed67d63c22b0703	2024-11-18T00:39:19-08:00	
New Zealand's founding treaty is at a flashpoint. Why are thousands protesting for Māori rights?	WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — A proposed law that would redefine New Zealand’s founding treaty between the British Crown and Māori chiefs has triggered political turmoil and a march by thousands of people the length of the country to Parliament to protest it. The bill is never expected to become law. But it has become a flashpoint on race relations and a critical moment in the fraught 180-year-old conversation about how New Zealand should honor its promises to Indigenous people when the country was colonized -– and what those promises are. Tens of thousands are expected to throng the capital, Wellington, for the final stretch of the weeklong protest march on Tuesday. It follows a Māori tradition of hīkoi, or walking, to bring attention to breaches of the 1840 Treaty of Waitangi. Why is a 180-year-old treaty being debated? Considered New Zealand’s founding document, the treaty was signed between representatives of the British Crown and 500 Māori chiefs during colonization. It laid out principles guiding the relationship between the Crown and Māori, in two versions -– one in English and the other in Māori. It promised Māori the rights and privileges of British citizens, but the English and Māori versions differed on what power the chiefs were ceding over their affairs, lands and autonomy. Over decades, the Crown breached both versions. By the mid-20th century, Māori language and culture had dwindled -– Indigenous people were often barred from practicing it -- tribal land was confiscated and Māori were disadvantaged in many metrics. How were treaty rights revived? Prompted by a surging Māori protest movement, for the past 50 years the courts of New Zealand, lawmakers and the Waitangi Tribunal -– a permanent body set up to adjudicate treaty matters -– have navigated the differences in the treaty’s versions and tried to redress breaches by constructing the meaning of the treaty's principles in their decisions. Those principles are intended to be flexible but are commonly described as partnership with the Crown, protection of Māori interests and participation in decision-making. While Māori remain disenfranchised in many ways, the weaving of treaty recognition through law and attempts at redress have changed the fabric of society since then. Māori language has experienced a renaissance, and everyday words are now commonplace -– even among non-Māori. Policies have been enacted to target disparities Māori commonly face. Billions of dollars in settlements have been negotiated between the Crown and tribes for breaches of the treaty, particularly the widespread expropriation of Māori land and natural resources. Why is there fresh debate? Some New Zealanders, however, are unhappy with redress. They have found a champion in lawmaker David Seymour, the leader of a minor libertarian political party which won less than 9% of the vote in last year’s election -– but scored outsized influence for its agenda as part of a governing agreement. Seymour‘s proposed law would set specific definitions of the treaty’s principles, and would apply them to all New Zealanders, not only to Māori. He says piecemeal construction of the treaty’s meaning has left a vacuum and has given Māori special treatment. His bill is widely opposed — by left- and right-wing former prime ministers, 40 of the country’s most senior lawyers, and thousands of Māori and non-Māori New Zealanders who are walking the length of the country in protest. Seymour’s bill is not expected to pass its final reading. It cleared a first vote on Thursday due to a political deal, but most of those who endorsed it are not expected to do so again. Detractors say the bill threatens constitutional upheaval and would remove rights promised in the treaty that are now enshrined in law. Critics have also lambasted Seymour -– who is Māori -– for provoking backlash against Indigenous people. Why are protesters marching? Peaceful walking protests are a Māori tradition and have occurred before at crucial times during the national conversation about treaty rights. Police in the country of 5 million people say they expect 30,000 to march across Wellington to Parliament on Tuesday. Crowds of up to 10,000 people have joined the march in cities en route to Wellington. Many are marching to oppose Seymour’s bill. But others are protesting a range of policies from the center-right government on Māori affairs -– including an order, prompted by Seymour, that public agencies should no longer target policies to specifically redress Māori inequities.	https://apnews.com/article/treaty-waitangi-zealand-protest-principles-parliament-623dbb403ca78ad35cd96d9392e12778	2024-11-18T00:22:58-08:00	
Middle East latest: 2 young children and parents killed in an Israeli strike in Gaza, officials say	An Israeli strike hit a tent sheltering displaced people in the Gaza Strip, killing two children aged 7 and 9 and their parents, Palestinian officials said Monday. A third child, 10 years old, was wounded in the strike overnight in the southern city of Khan Younis, according to the Civil Defense, first responders who operate under the Hamas-run government. An Associated Press reporter saw the bodies at the nearby Nasser Hospital. The two children were beheaded by the blast and their remains were placed in one body bag. The Israeli military blames civilian deaths on Hamas, accusing militants of hiding among civilians and fighting from residential areas. It rarely comments on individual strikes, which often kill women and children. The war began when Hamas stormed into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250. Some 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, a third of whom are believed to be dead. Israel’s retaliatory offensive has killed over 43,800 Palestinians, according to local health authorities. They do not distinguish between militants and civilians but say most of those killed are women and children. The fighting has left some 76 people dead in Israel, including 31 soldiers. ___ Here's the Latest: 2 young children and their parents killed in an Israeli strike in Gaza, officials say KHAN YOUNIS, Gaza Strip — An Israeli strike hit a tent sheltering displaced people in the Gaza Strip, killing two children aged 7 and 9 and their parents, Palestinian officials said.

US and Philippines sign a pact to secure shared military intelligence and weapons technology	MANILA, Philippines (AP) — The United States and the Philippines signed an agreement on Monday to secure the exchange of highly confidential military intelligence and technology in key weapons the U.S. would provide to Manila. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and his Philippine counterpart, Gilberto Teodoro, signed the legally binding General Security of Military Information Agreement in Manila at a time when the longtime treaty allies have boosted their defense and military engagements, including large-scale joint combat drills, largely in response to China’s increasingly aggressive actions in Asia. The outgoing Biden administration has taken steps to strengthen an arc of military alliances across the Indo-Pacific region to better counter China, including in any future confrontation over Taiwan or in the disputed South China Sea, which Beijing has claimed almost in its entirety. That has dovetailed with Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.’s thrust to strengthen his country’s external defenses given an alarming escalation of territorial confrontations between Chinese and Filipinos forces in the South China Sea. The Department of National Defense in Manila said the agreement aims to ensure the security of classified military information that would be exchanged between the U.S. and the Philippines. It will 'allow the Philippines access to higher capabilities and big-ticket items from the United States,' the Philippine defense department said. Neither side provided more details or released a copy of the agreement. Two Philippine security officials, however, have told The Associated Press that such an agreement, similar to ones Washington has signed with other allied countries, would allow the U.S. to provide the Philippines with higher-level intelligence and more sophisticated weapons, including missile systems. It would also provide the Philippine military access to U.S. satellite and drone surveillance systems with an assurance that such intelligence and details about sophisticated weapons would be kept highly secure to prevent possible leaks, the two Philippine officials said on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the sensitive issue publicly. Philippine efforts to obtain sophisticated weapons from the U.S. military in the past have been hampered by a lack of such an intelligence deal, including when Filipino forces were scrambling to fight a 2017 siege by Filipino and foreign militants aligned with the Islamic State group in southern Marawi city. Philippine forces, backed by U.S. and Australian spy planes, quelled the uprising after five months. Austin and Teodoro also attended a groundbreaking ceremony for a center where the U.S. and Philippine militaries would coordinate future joint operations, including the exchange of information. Austin said the center 'will be a place where our forces can work side-by-side to respond to regional challenges.' Austin renewed the U.S. commitment to the Philippines as an ally and told Teodoro that 'we are more than allies. We are family.' The coordinating center, Teodoro said, would provide 'a unified picture of the shared areas of responsibility and common approaches to threats against both our securities.' 'I’m sure it will benefit future generations of both our peoples to come because although we may change people, the values don’t change,' Teodoro said. The Philippine defense chief reiterated the crucial need for the U.S. security presence in the region, citing Marcos’s repeated statements that such a presence 'is essential for maintaining peace and stability in this region.' ___ Associated Press journalist Aaron Favila contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/philippines-us-general-security-of-military-information-agreement-4622f461bde4599a08be8c51d5f4db09	2024-11-17T23:38:51-08:00	
Climate talks in Azerbaijan head into their second week, coinciding with G20 in Rio	BAKU, Azerbaijan (AP) — United Nations talks on getting money to curb and adapt to climate change resumed Monday with tempered hope that negotiators and ministers can work through disagreements and hammer out a deal after slow progress last week. That hope comes from the arrival of the climate and environment ministers from around the world this week in Baku, Azerbaijan, for the COP29 talks. They’ll give their teams instructions on ways forward. 'We are in a difficult place,' said Melanie Robinson, economics and finance program director of global climate at the World Resources Institute. 'The discussion has not yet moved to the political level — when it does I think ministers will do what they can to make a deal.' Talks in Baku are focused on getting more climate cash for developing countries to transition away from fossil fuels, adapt to climate change and pay for damages caused by extreme weather. But countries are far apart on how much money that will require. Several experts put the sum needed at around $1 trillion. 'One trillion is going to look like a bargain five, 10 years from now,' said Rachel Cleetus from the Union of Concerned Scientists, citing a multitude of costly recent extreme weather events from flooding in Spain to hurricanes Helene and Milton in the United States. 'We’re going to wonder why we didn’t take that and run with it.' Also on Monday, the Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has been mulling a proposal to cut public spending for foreign fossil fuel projects. The OECD — made up of 38 member countries including the United States, the United Kingdom, South Korea, Japan and Germany — are discussing a deal that could prevent up to $40 billion worth of carbon-polluting projects. At COP29, activists are protesting the U.S., South Korea, Japan, and Turkey who they say are the key holdouts preventing the agreement in Paris from being finalized. 'It’s of critical importance that President Biden comes out in support. We know it’s really important that he lands a deal that Trump cannot undo. This can be really important for Biden’s legacy,' said Lauri van der Burg, Global Public Finance Lead at Oil Change international. 'If he comes around, this will help mount pressure on other laggards including Korea, Turkey and Japan.' Meanwhile, the world’s biggest decision makers are halfway around the world as another major summit convenes. Brazil is hosting the Group of 20 summit, which runs Nov. 18-19, bringing together many of the world's largest economies. Climate change — among other major topics like rising global tensions and poverty — will be on the agenda. Harjeet Singh, global engagement director for the Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty Initiative, said G20 nations 'cannot turn their backs on the reality of their historical emissions and the responsibility that comes with it.' 'They must commit to trillions in public finance,' he said. In a written statement on Friday, United Nations Climate Change's executive secretary Simon Stiell said 'the global climate crisis should be order of business Number One' at the G20 meetings. Stiell noted that progress on stopping more warming should happen both in and out of climate talks, calling the G20's role 'mission-critical.' ___ Associated Press journalist Ahmed Hatem in Baku contributed to this report. ___ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Young people, whose futures are at stake in UN climate talks, push through anger to fight for hope	BAKU, Azerbaijan (AP) — Young people who attend the United Nations climate talks have a lot to be angry about. They've lost loved ones and months of school. They've lost homes and family farms and connections to their families' native lands. They haven't lost hope, though. Not yet. 'It has become so tiring for me to be just a poster child,' said Marinel Ubaldo, who by age 16 had watched two back-to-back supersized typhoons destroy entire communities in her native Philippines. Missing a chunk of high school in the aftermath, because there was no school to go back to, was a wake-up call. Now 27, COP29 will be her sixth time attending the summit where leaders negotiate the future she will inherit. 'I guess I'm very pessimistic, but I’m going to be positive that this COP could actually bring more clarity,' she said. Her pessimism isn't unwarranted. Fewer leaders were in attendance this year, with a backdrop of uncertainty as political will on climate unravels in major countries like the U.S. and Germany. While many passionate youth want to protest, this will be the third straight COP in an authoritarian country with tighter controls on protests and speech. And for many of the young people hardest hit by climate extremes, it's simply difficult and expensive to get to the conference. 'We have this constant challenge of having sometimes the youth forums with spaces at the margins of the decision maker spaces,' said Felipe Paullier, assistant secretary general for youth affairs in the United Nations youth office. That's why the U.N. has been working to institutionalize the role of youth in the climate talks, he said. And climate change has a disproportionate impact on children around the world. Their growing bodies have a harder time handling extreme heat, which also causes an uptick in premature births and childhood malnutrition, said UNICEF assistant secretary-general Kitty van der Heijden. 'We are simply not doing good enough for children in this world. We are failing children,' she said. All of that means young people are feeling the burden of speaking up about climate change more than ever. And many of those who come to COP, and even some of the ones who don't, said they feel tired — weighed down by the knowledge that year after year, they show up to speak and don't have a lot to show for it. This was the third year in a row that Earth's projected warming hasn't improved. 'I think for a lot of young people from extremely climate vulnerable nations, it actually it doesn’t feel like much of a choice' to speak out about climate change, said 20-year-old Fathimath Raaia Shareef, from the Maldives. Shareef's grandmother migrated south to the small island nation's capital, so she has never had the opportunity to see what her family's home island was like. Growing up, after she found out about sea level rise, she had recurring nightmares about her island sinking. She would wake up crying. 'How am I supposed to focus on anything else when when my island, when my home country is at risk?' she asked. It's that focus that brings many young people to the table even as they question their faith in the possibility that international negotiations can achieve real change. Here at his fourth COP, 15-year-old Francisco Vera Manzanares of Colombia called the U.N. summit a necessary but 'very difficult space' to be in. He thinks slow pace of change from countries around the world creates a 'credibility crisis' in the institutions that are most needed to keep the goals that require global cooperation within reach. 'People listen to children. But, let's say, it’s different (to) listen than hear,' he said. That's why he hopes more adults will help children meaningfully advocate for themselves in a crisis where they have the most to lose — and the most to save. 'It's our rights. It's our future. It's our present,' he said. ___ Follow Melina Walling on X, formerly Twitter, @MelinaWalling. ___ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Typhoon Man-yi leaves 7 dead in landslide in Philippines and worsens crisis from back-to-back storms	MANILA, Philippines (AP) — Typhoon Man-yi left at least seven people dead in a landslide, destroyed scores of houses and displaced large numbers of villagers before blowing away from the northern Philippines, worsening the crisis wreaked by multiple back-to-back storms, officials said Monday. Man-yi was one of the strongest of the six major storms to hit the northern Philippines in less than a month and had sustained winds of up to 195 kilometers (125 miles) per hour when it slammed into the eastern island province of Catanduanes on Saturday night. U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin met President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. In Manila and offered his prayers, announcing an additional $1 million in humanitarian aid for typhoon victims. He told Marcos he has authorized U.S. troops to help Filipino forces provide lifesaving aid. Torrential rains and fierce wind unleashed by Man-yi set off a landslide early Monday in the northern town of Ambaguio in Nueva Vizcaya province that buried a house and killed seven people, including children, and injured three others inside, regional police chief Brig. Gen. Antonio P. Marallag Jr. said. Army troops, police and villagers were scrambling to search for three other people who were believed to have been entombed in the avalanche of mud, boulders and uprooted trees, Marallag said. Disaster response officials said they were checking if the deaths of two villagers in a motorcycle accident and an electrocution were directly related to Man-yi’s onslaught so they could be added to the overall death toll. They said a separate search was underway for a couple and their child after their shanty was swept away in rampaging rivers in northern Nueva Ecija province. More than a million people were affected by the typhoon and two previous storms, including nearly 700,000 who fled their homes and moved to emergency shelters or relatives' homes, according to the Official of Civil Defense. Nearly 8,000 houses were damaged or destroyed and more than 100 cities and towns were hit by power outages due to toppled electric posts, it said. In the worst-hit province of Camarines, officials pleaded for additional help after fierce winds and rain damaged more houses and cut off electricity and water supplies in the entire province, along with cellphone connections in many areas, provincial information officer Camille Gianan said. Welfare officials transported food aid, drinking water and other help but more is needed over the coming months, Gianan said. Many villagers will need construction materials to rebuild their houses, she said. 'They have not recovered from the previous storms when the super typhoon hit,' Gianan told The Associated Press. 'It’s been one calamity after another.' The rare number of back-to-back storms and typhoons that lashed Luzon — the country's largest and most populous island — in just three weeks left more than 160 people dead, affected 9 million people and caused such extensive damage to communities, infrastructure and farmlands that the Philippines may have to import more rice, a staple food. In an emergency meeting as Man-yi approached, Marcos asked his Cabinet and provincial officials to brace for 'the worst-case scenario.' At least 26 domestic airports and two international airports were briefly shut and inter-island ferry and cargo services were suspended due to rough seas, stranding thousands of passengers and commuters. Most transport services have now resumed, according to the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippine and the coast guard. The U.S., Manila’s treaty ally, along with Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia and Brunei provided cargo aircraft and other storm aid to help the government’s overwhelmed disaster-response agencies. Last month, the first major storm, Trami, left scores of people dead after dumping one to two months’ worth of rain in just 24 hours in several towns. The Philippines is battered by about 20 typhoons and storms each year. It’s often hit by earthquakes and has more than a dozen active volcanoes, making it one of the world’s most disaster-prone countries.	https://apnews.com/article/philippines-typhoon-manyi-04db73a5ee97fed4fbf12c342c4e7bb8	2024-11-17T20:48:47-08:00	
New Delhi closes schools, bans construction as air pollution shoots up to worst level this season	NEW DELHI (AP) — Authorities in India’s capital shut schools, halted construction and banned non-essential trucks from entering the city on Monday after air pollution shot up to its worst level this season. Residents of New Delhi woke up to thick, toxic smog enveloping the city of some 33 million as the air quality became increasingly hazardous. It rose further into the severe category, according to SAFAR, the country’s main environmental agency, which measures tiny particulate matter in the air that can enter deep into the lungs. The deadly haze covered monuments and high-rise buildings in the capital, with visibility so low that airlines warned of delays. In several areas of the city, pollution levels were more than 50 times higher than the World Health Organization’s recommended safe limit. Forecasts say the poor air quality will continue into the week. Air pollution in northern India rises every year, particularly in winter, as farmers burn crop residue in agricultural areas. The burning coincides with colder temperatures, which trap the smoke in the air. The smoke is then blown into cities, where auto emissions add to the pollution. Emissions from industries and the burning of coal to produce electricity are also linked to the pollution, which has been steadily ticking up in recent weeks. Starting Monday, authorities began enforcing stage 4 of a graded response action plan, or GRAP 4, based on the severity of the air pollution. Earlier stages of the plan were already in place, and stage 4 includes stricter curbs. Classes for all grades except 10 and 12 will be held online and no trucks will be allowed to enter the city except for those carrying essential items. Some older, diesel guzzling vehicles have been banned inside the city, and all construction activities have been halted. Authorities also urged children, the elderly and others with chronic diseases or respiratory issues to avoid going outside as much as possible. Over the weekend, farmers in neighboring Uttar Pradesh state burned their fields, releasing plumes of gray smoke that winds likely carried into New Delhi and other nearby areas. Despite the poisonous air, many in the capital continued their usual routines, including morning walks in the city’s beloved Lodhi Garden. 'Everyone has a sore throat,' said Sanjay Goel, a 51-year-old shopkeeper in New Delhi. 'They should ban crop residue burning ... it's just smoke everywhere.' The worsening air quality in the capital also sparked outrage from residents on social media. Many complained of headaches and hacking coughs, describing the city as 'apocalyptic' and a 'gas chamber.' Others urged officials to solve the public health crisis once and for all. Several studies have estimated more than a million Indians die each year from pollution-related diseases. Authorities have invoked similar measures in the past and have at times deployed water sprinklers and anti-smog guns in an attempt to control the haze. But critics say there needs to be a long-term solution that drastically reduces pollution itself, instead of actions that aim to mitigate the effects after it has already plagued the region.	https://apnews.com/article/new-delhi-air-pollution-india-ae1ec1e6292009db198f18b113047cd5	2024-11-17T20:32:16-08:00	
As China cracks down on bookstores at home, Chinese-language booksellers are flourishing overseas	WASHINGTON (AP) — Yu Miao smiles as he stands among the 10,000 books crowded on rows of bamboo shelves in his newly reopened bookstore. It’s in Washington’s vibrant Dupont Circle neighborhood, far from its last location in Shanghai, where the Chinese government forced him out of business six years ago. 'There is no pressure from the authorities here,' said Yu, the owner of JF Books, Washington’s only Chinese bookseller. 'I want to live without fear.' Independent bookstores have become a new battleground in China, swept up in the ruling Communist Party’s crackdown on dissent and free expression. The Associated Press found that at least a dozen bookstores in the world’s second-largest economy have been shuttered or targeted for closure in the last few months alone, squeezing the already tight space for press freedom. One bookstore owner was arrested over four months ago. The crackdown has had a chilling effect on China’s publishing industry. Bookstores are common in China, but many are state-owned. Independent bookstores are governed by an intricate set of rules with strict controls now being more aggressively policed, according to bookstore owners. Printing shops and street vendors are also facing more rigorous government inspections by the National Office Against Pornography and Illegal Publication. The office did not respond to interview requests from The Associated Press. China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in a statement to AP, said it was not aware of a crackdown on bookstores. Yu isn't alone in taking his business out of the country. Chinese bookstores have popped up in Japan, France, Netherlands and elsewhere in the U.S. in recent years, as a result of both stricter controls in China and growing Chinese communities abroad. It’s not just the books' contents that are making Chinese authorities wary. In many communities, bookstores are cultural centers where critical thinking is encouraged, and conversations can veer into politics and other topics not welcomed by the authorities. The bookstore owner who was arrested was Yuan Di, also called Yanyou, the founder of Jiazazhi, an artistic bookstore in Shanghai and Ningbo on China’s eastern coast. He was taken away by police in June, according to Zhou Youlieguo, who closed his own bookstore in Shanghai in September. Yuan's arrest was also confirmed by two other people who declined to be named for fear of retribution. The charge against Yuan is unclear. An official in Ningbo's Bureau of Culture, Radio Television and Tourism, which oversees bookstores, declined comment, noting the case is under investigation. The Ningbo police didn’t respond to an interview request. Michael Berry, director of UCLA's Center for Chinese Studies, said a sluggish Chinese economy may be driving the government to exert greater control. 'The government might be feeling that this is a time to be more cautious and control this kind of discourse in terms of what people are consuming and reading to try to put a damper on any potential unrest and kind of nip it in the bud,' Berry said. These bookstore owners face dual pressures, Berry added. One is the political clampdown; the other is the global movement, especially among young people, toward digital media and away from print publications. Wang Yingxing sold secondhand books in Ningbo for almost two decades before being ordered to close in August. Local officials informed Wang he lacked a publication business license even though he wasn’t eligible to obtain one as a second-hand seller. Faded outlines marked the spot where a sign for Fatty Wang’s Bookstore once hung. Spray-painted black letters on the bookstore’s window read: 'Temporarily closed'. 'We’re promoting culture, I’m not doing anything wrong, right? I’m just selling some books and promoting culture,' Wang said, tying a bundle of books together with brown wrapper and white nylon string. 'Then why won’t you leave me alone?' Wang added. Half a dozen other people heaved boxes of books into the back of a van. The books, Wang said, were being sold to cafe and bar owners who wanted to burnish little libraries for their patrons. Some would be sent to a warehouse in Anhui. The rest, he said, were to be sent to a recycling station to be pulped and destroyed. Bookstores are not the only target. Central authorities have also cracked down on other places such as printing shops, internet bars, gaming rooms and street vendors. Strict inspections have taken place all over the country, according to Chinese authorities. Authorities in Shanghai inspected printing places and bookstores, looking for 'printing, copying or selling illegal publications,' according to a government document. This shows the authorities are not just barring the sale of some publications, but tracing them back to the printing process. They found some printing stores did not 'register the copy content as required' and demanded they fix the problem quickly. In Shaoyang, a city in China’s south, authorities said they will be 'cracking down on harmful publications in accordance with the law.' The Communist Party has various powers to control which books are available. Any publication without a China Standard Book Number is considered illegal, including self-published books and those imported without special licenses. Books can be banned even after they are published if restrictions are later tightened — often for unclear reasons — or if the writers say something upsetting to the Chinese authorities. Yet despite these restrictions and the crackdown on existing booksellers, more bookstores are opening. Recent figures are unavailable, but a survey by Bookdao, a media company that focuses on the book industry, shows more than twice as many bookstores opened than closed in China in 2020. Liu Suli, who has been running All Sages Books in Beijing for over three decades, says there are many idealists in the industry. 'Everyone who reads has a dream of having a bookstore,' Liu says, despite the challenges. In many cases, those dreams are being fulfilled outside China. Yu and other Chinese booksellers around the world stock their shelves with books from Hong Kong, Taiwan and mainland China, as well as books published locally. Zhang Jieping, founder of Nowhere, a bookstore in Taiwan and Thailand, said there's a growing demand for books from migrants who left China after the COVID-19 pandemic. 'They don’t just want to speak fluent English or Japanese to fit in, they want cultural autonomy,' Zhang said. 'They want more community spaces. Not necessarily a bookstore, but in any format — a gallery, or a restaurant.' Li Yijia is a 22-year-old student who arrived in Washington from Beijing in August. One Sunday morning, she wandered through JF Books where she found titles in Chinese and English. She said a Chinese bookstore feels like 'another world in a bubble' which helps her critical thinking by allowing her to read books in both languages. 'It also relieves homesickness, like a Chinese restaurant,' Li added. The closure of the bookstores leads the owners to different paths. Some ended up in jail, some went looking for jobs to feed their families. Some started a journey to leave censorship behind. Since he closed his Shanghai bookstore, Zhou, 39, has moved to Los Angeles, but hasn't decided what his next step will be. He said his fully licensed independent bookstore, which sold art books and self-published works by artists and translators, was fined thousands of dollars and he was interrogated over a dozen times during the past four years. He's seen colleagues jailed for selling 'illegal publications.' All the self-published book artists and editors he worked with asked him to take down their work after warnings by local authorities. Zhou said he could not handle further harassment He said it was as if he were 'smuggling drugs instead of selling books.' The existence of his bookstore, Zhou said, was 'a rebellion and a resistance,' which is not there anymore. ___ Associated Press writer Dake Kang in Ningbo, China, contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/china-bookstores-crackdown-shanghai-ba54f48c08c2ed4352534e2183a07ad1	2024-11-17T20:09:11-08:00	
Stock market today: Asian shares are mixed after Wall Street suffers worst loss since Election Day	BANGKOK (AP) — Shares started out the week mixed in Asia after U.S. stocks fell to their worst loss since Election Day. U.S. futures were higher, with the S&amp;P 500 contract up 0.3% and that for the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 0.1% as speculation mounted over who President-elect Donald Trump might nominate to be his Treasury secretary. Japan's Nikkei 225 index dropped 1.1% to 38,220.85 as the yen initially regained some strength against the U.S. dollar after the central bank governor, Kazuo Ueda, indicated that the Bank of Japan will continue to raise interest rates as conditions permit. The dollar inched up to 154.58 Japanese yen from 154.54 yen late Friday. It had been trading above 156 yen last week. South Korea's Kospi jumped 2.2% to 2,469.07 after Samsung Electronics, the country's biggest company, announced a share buyback plan. Samsung's shares jumped 6%. Chinese markets were mixed. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong added 0.8% to 19,572.34, while the Shanghai Composite index shed early gains to close down 0.2% at 3,323.55. Elsewhere in Asia, Australia's S&amp;P/ASX 200 edged 0.2% higher, to 8,300.20. Taiwan's Taiex lost 0.9% and the SET in Bangkok picked up 0.8% as the government announced that Thailand's economy grew more than expected in the last quarter. On Friday, U.S. stocks tumbled Friday with the waning of the 'Trump bump' that Wall Street got from last week’s presidential election, along with a cut to interest rates by the Federal Reserve. The S&amp;P 500 dropped 1.3% to 5,870.62, for its worst day since before Election Day to close out a losing week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.7% to 43,444.99, and the Nasdaq composite sank 2.2% to 18,680.12. Vaccine manufacturers helped drag the market down after President-elect Donald Trump said he wants Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a prominent anti-vaccine activist, to lead the Department of Health and Human Services. Moderna tumbled 7.3%, and Pfizer fell 4.7% amid concerns about a possible hit to profits. Kennedy still needs confirmation from the Senate to get the job, and some analysts are skeptical about his chances. Biotech stocks broadly sank to some of the market’s worst losses, but the sharpest drop in the S&amp;P 500 came from Applied Materials. It fell 9.2% as it forecast a range of future revenue below analysts' expectations, even though it reported a stronger-than-anticipated profit for the latest quarter. Companies face pressure to deliver big growth since their stock prices have been rising so much faster than their earnings. That’s made the stock market look pricey by a range of measures. The S&amp;P 500 is still up 23% for the year and not far from its all-time high set on Monday, despite last week’s weakness. Stocks had been broadly roaring since Election Day, when Trump’s victory sent a jolt through financial markets worldwide. Investors immediately began sending up stocks of banks, smaller U.S. companies and cryptocurrencies as they laid bets on the winners coming out of Trump’s preference for higher tariffs, lower tax rates and lighter regulation. But investors are also taking into account some of the potential downsides from Trump’s return to the White House, including worries that his policies could spur bigger U.S. government deficits and faster inflation. That’s forced traders to rethink how much relief the Federal Reserve could give the economy next year through cuts to interest rates. The Fed earlier this month lowered its main interest rate for the second time this year, and past forecasts indicated Fed officials saw more cuts as likely through 2025. On Thursday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell suggested the U.S. central bank may be cautious about future decisions on interest rates. 'The economy is not sending any signals that we need to be in a hurry to lower rates,' Powell said, though he declined to discuss how Trump’s potential policies could alter things. A report Friday showed shoppers spent more at U.S. retailers last month than expected, suggesting consumer spending, the most influential force on the economy, remains solid. In other dealings early Monday, U.S. benchmark crude oil added 13 cents to $67.15 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude climbed 27 cents to $71.31 per barrel. The euro bought $1.0543, up from $1.0534 late Friday.	https://apnews.com/article/stocks-markets-trump-fed-samsung-b80ab78cee5382e0d17ea058f123ace7	2024-11-17T20:08:18-08:00	
Brazil hosts a G20 summit overshadowed by wars and Trump's return, aiming for a deal to fight hunger	RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) — With Brazil preparing to host the Group of 20 summit, it appears unlikely the leading rich and developing nations will sign on to a meaningful declaration regarding geopolitics: The meeting Monday and Tuesday in Rio de Janeiro is overshadowed by two major wars and Donald Trump's recent election victory. Heightened global tensions and uncertainty about an incoming Trump administration have tempered any expectations for a strongly worded statement addressing the conflicts in the Middle East and between Russia and Ukraine. Experts instead anticipate a final document focused on social issues like the eradication of hunger — one of Brazil's priorities — even if it aims to include at least a mention of the ongoing wars. 'Brazilian diplomacy has been strongly engaged in this task, but to expect a substantively strong and consensual declaration in a year like 2024 with two serious international conflicts is to set the bar very high,' said Cristiane Lucena Carneiro, an international relations professor at the University of Sao Paulo. After Brazil's President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silvathwarted far-right former President Jair Bolsonaro 's reelection bid in 2022, there was some excitement in the international community at the prospect of the leftist leader and savvy diplomat — who Barack Obama once called 'the most popular politician on Earth' — hosting the G20. Bolsonaro had little personal interest in international summits, let foreign policy be guided by ideology and clashed with several leaders, including France’s Emmanuel Macron. Lula took office and often quoted a catchphrase: 'Brazil is back.' Brazil under Lula has reverted to its decades-old principle of non-alignment to carve out a policy that best safeguards its interests in an increasingly multipolar world. That involves talking to all parties, which experts say gave Brazil a privileged position to host a summit such as the G20. But his administration's foreign policy has at times raised eyebrows. A Brazil-China peace plan for Russia and Ukraine doesn't call for Russia's withdrawal from Ukraine and has been slammed by Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskyy. And Lula sparked a diplomatic incident with Israel after comparing its actions in Gaza to the Holocaust. Donald Trump’s win in the U.S. presidential election earlier this month and the imminent return of an America First doctrine may also hamper the diplomatic spirit needed for broad agreement on divisive issues. 'If we have one certainty, it is regarding Donald Trump’s skepticism towards multilateralism,' Carneiro said. Two officials from Brazil and one from another G20 nation say Argentine negotiators are standing in the way of a joint declaration. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. Two of them said Argentina’s negotiators have raised several objections to the draft. They most vehemently oppose a clause calling for a global tax on the super-rich — which they had previously accepted, in July — and another promoting gender equality. Ambassador Mauricio Lyrio, Brazil’s key negotiator at G20, told journalists on Nov. 8 that the leaders’ final declaration should address the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East, but that diplomats were still discussing how to reach universally acceptable language. 'The main message, naturally, is that we need to achieve peace not only regarding these conflicts but all conflicts,' he said in the capital Brasilia, adding that Lula's launch of a global alliance against hunger and poverty on Monday is just as important as the final statement. 'The leaders’ declaration will be the crowning achievement. But, at the same time, as instructed by the president himself, we have a G20 focused on concrete actions, such as the launch of a Global Alliance Against Hunger, with a package of very concrete social programs and innovative mechanisms to meet the resources needed for implementing them.' Lula, a former trade unionist who hails from a humble background, made the fight against hunger a priority during his first two terms as president (2003-2010) both at home and abroad. The number of undernourished Brazilians fell by more than 80% in 10 years, according to a 2014 U.N. report. Lula's hunger alliance is the only one of Brazil’s primary aims for a G20 declaration that will be obtained, according to Thomas Traumann, a former government minister and a political consultant based in Rio. 'Brazil wanted a global deal to fight poverty, a project to finance green transition and some consensus over a global tax for the super rich. Only the first one has survived,' Traumann said. President Joe Biden will attend the summit after a stop in Lima for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum and then travel on to Manaus, a city in Brazil's Amazon rainforest. It will be the first time a sitting American president sets foot in the Amazon, and the trip’s objective is to highlight 'commitment to environmental protection and respect for local cultures,' according to a Nov. 12 statement from the U.S. Embassy in Brazil. White House officials insist that Biden’s visits to APEC and the G20 will be substantive, with talks on climate issues, global infrastructure, counternarcotic efforts and one-on-one meetings with global leaders, including Chinese President Xi Jinping. Those officials say Biden also will use the summits to press allies to keep up support for Ukraine as it tries to fend off Russia’s invasion and not lose sight of finding an end to the wars in Lebanon and Gaza. Any commitments Biden makes may be overturned by the next White House administration, according to Danielle Ayres, an international relations professor at the Federal University of Santa Catarina. 'It would mean Trump would have to be proactive and say the U.S. is not going to do something to which it signed up for internationally,' Ayres said. 'That has a cost. It generates insecurity, a bad perception on behalf of the international community towards Trump.' Trump’s election may also cause other countries to look toward China as a more reliable partner. Xi Jinping's inauguration of the Chancay megaport in Peru on Thursday was perhaps the clearest sign of Latin America’s reorientation. A notable absentee at the G20 will be Russia’s President Vladimir Putin, against whom the International Criminal Court has issued a warrant that obliges member states to arrest him, and Russia’s delegation will be led by Sergey Lavrov. Israel is not a G20 member. 'The latest G20 meetings were somewhat depleted and became just another moment for bilateral meetings of heads of government. As Putin is out, Lula managed Ukraine not to be a topic, just as much as Israel. But Trump’s election takes from Lula the chance of being the star on the stage,' Traumann said. ___ Associated Press writer Gabriela Sá Pessoa contributed from Sao Paulo.	https://apnews.com/article/brazil-g20-rio-de-janeiro-wars-trump-12f7a09b8f79229509de52c92c0a074c	2024-11-17T20:05:14-08:00	
45 pro-democracy activists face sentencing in Hong Kong. Here's who some of them are	HONG KONG (AP) — Dozens of prominent Hong Kong pro-democracy activists are scheduled to be sentenced Tuesday in the largest case under a national security law that critics say crushed political activism in the semi-autonomous Chinese city. The convictions of the 45 activists under the Beijing-imposed law are widely seen as part of a crackdown by China that destroyed hopes for a more democratic Hong Kong. They face sentences of up to life imprisonment. The activists were among 47 people charged with conspiracy to commit subversion in 2021 for their involvement in an unofficial primary election to pick opposition candidates. They were accused of agreeing to veto government-proposed budgets indiscriminately after securing a legislative majority to force a dissolution of the legislature and then the ouster of the city's leader. Three government-approved judges ruled that the plan to achieve political change through the unofficial primary in 2020 would have undermined the government’s authority and created a constitutional crisis. Thirty-one of the activists pleaded guilty and 14 others were found guilty in May following a trial. Two were acquitted. Those who entered guilty pleas have a better chance of shorter prison terms. Some of the convicted activists have sought lesser sentences by expressing remorse and apologizing. Others have remained defiant. Here are profiles of some of the leading activists. Benny Tai Riding on a wave of anti-government protests in 2019, Benny Tai, a former law professor at the University of Hong Kong, co-organized the primary election that drew 610,000 voters — over 13% of the city’s registered electorate. The primary was aimed at selecting pro-democracy candidates who would then run in the official election. The judges said Tai stated that acquiring a legislative majority was a 'constitutional weapon of mass destruction' that would allow the pro-democracy camp to veto government budgets. Under the city’s Basic Law, or mini-constitution, the city leader can dissolve the legislature if a budget cannot be passed. But the leader must step down if the budget is again blocked by the next legislature. The judges said Tai aimed to 'undermine, destroy or overthrow the existing political system and structure' of Hong Kong. Tai pleaded guilty to the charge. In seeking a shorter sentence, his lawyer said Tai always supported non-violence and believed his actions were legal. Tai was not always viewed as a threat by authorities. He was a member of a consultative committee that helped collect views on the drafting of the Basic Law before the former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997. In 2001, the government awarded him a medal of honor for promoting civic education, though it was withdrawn in 2022. Tai is perhaps best known as a co-founder of the city’s 2014 Occupy Movement, during which demonstrators occupied streets and brought traffic to a standstill in some areas for nearly 80 days, demanding direct elections for the city’s leader. Joshua Wong Joshua Wong rose to fame in Hong Kong in 2012 as a high school student leading protests against the introduction of national education in the city’s schools. Two years later, he became world famous as a leader of the Occupy Movement. In 2016, Wong co-founded a political party named 'Demosisto' with fellow young activists Nathan Law and Agnes Chow. In the 2019 pro-democracy movement, Wong helped seek overseas support for the protests. His activism led Beijing to label him an advocate of Hong Kong's independence who 'begged for interference' by foreign forces. Demosisto disbanded when Beijing imposed the security law in 2020. Wong won in the primary election, but the government postponed the official election, citing public health risks during the COVID-19 pandemic. Wong has pleaded guilty and asked for a lesser sentence. His lawyer said he hoped 'he could part with his history and would be able to reform himself' after completing it. Wu Chi-wai Wu Chi-wai is the former chair of Hong Kong's biggest pro-democracy party, the Democratic Party, which some activists saw as too moderate. In 2006, the government awarded Wu a medal of honor for community service. Wu entered a guilty plea, with his lawyer saying he has been in public service for over 30 years and that he and his party did not seek indiscriminate vetoing of budgets. Three former government officials wrote letters seeking a reduced sentence for him. Wu's parents passed away during his detention and he could only briefly attend their funerals. Gordon Ng Gordon Ng, a dual citizen of Australia and Hong Kong, was initially named an organizer of the primary by prosecutors, an accusation Ng denied. He pleaded not guilty. The judges acknowledged in their verdict that Ng did not organize the plan and was not a candidate. However, they pointed to his campaign urging voters to support primary winners through social media posts and a front-page advertisement in the now-shuttered pro-democracy Apple Daily newspaper, founded by Jimmy Lai. In seeking a lesser sentence, Ng said his support for the primary was linked to his belief that it could address the differences within the pro-democracy camp, which had long been plagued by infighting. He said he never asked candidates to promise to veto budgets.	https://apnews.com/article/hong-kong-prodemocracy-activists-sentencing-f2c36e5da3e974f54595447050280eee	2024-11-17T18:51:16-08:00	
Suspected attack by Yemen's Houthi rebels targets ship in the Red Sea	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — A suspected attack by Yemen's Houthi rebels targeted a commercial ship late Sunday night traveling through the southern reaches of the Red Sea, though it caused no damage nor injuries, authorities said. The attack comes as the rebels continue their monthslong assault targeting shipping through a waterway that typically sees $1 trillion in goods pass through it a year over the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza and Israel’s ground offensive in Lebanon. A ship's captain saw that 'a missile splashed in close proximity to the vessel' as it traveled near the Bab el-Mandeb Strait connecting the Red Sea to the Gulf of Aden, the British military's United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations center said in an alert. The attack happened some 30 miles (48 kilometers) west of Yemen port city of Mocha. 'The vessel and crew are safe and proceeding to its next port of call,' the UKMTO added. The Houthis did not immediately claim the attack. However, it can take the rebels hours or even days to acknowledge their assaults. The Houthis have targeted more than 90 merchant vessels with missiles and drones since the war in Gaza started in October 2023. They seized one vessel and sank two in the campaign, which also killed four sailors. Other missiles and drones have either been intercepted by a U.S.-led coalition in the Red Sea or failed to reach their targets, which have included Western military vessels as well. The rebels maintain that they target ships linked to Israel, the U.S. or the U.K. to force an end to Israel’s campaign against Hamas in Gaza. However, many of the ships attacked have little or no connection to the conflict, including some bound for Iran. The Houthis have shot down multiple American MQ-9 Reaper drones as well. In the rebels' last attack on Nov. 11, two U.S. Navy warships targeted with multiple drones and missiles as they were traveling through the Bab el-Mandeb Strait, but the attacks were not successful.	https://apnews.com/article/yemen-red-sea-attack-houthis-mideast-wars-8c86509962cbb3d41fa1ceb2e200c7b8	2024-11-17T16:43:04-08:00	
Poultry infected with bird flu found on commercial farm in England	Poultry on a commercial farm in England have been infected with the bird flu virus, the U.K. government said Sunday. The H5N1 virus was found in kept birds in St. Ives, a seaside town in Cornwall. All the poultry in the infected area will be humanely culled, according to the Department for Environment, Food &amp; Rural Affairs. It was England's first confirmation of H5N1 in kept birds this season. The virus was also recently found in wild birds in the southwest of England and in continental Europe, the department said. The H5N1 bird flu has been spreading in the U.S. among wild birds, poultry, cows and other animals. Recently, health officials in Canada confirmed that a British Columbia teen had contracted bird flu and said the virus was related to a poultry outbreak in the province.	https://apnews.com/article/bird-flu-outbreak-farm-england-dce7600e0dba5de59b68bf379307ef9c	2024-11-17T14:17:40-08:00	
Gabon votes yes on new constitution a year after the military seized power	LIBREVILLE, Gabon (AP) — Voters in Gabon overwhelmingly approved a new constitution, authorities said Sunday, more than one year after mutinous soldiers overthrew the country’s longtime president and seized power in the oil-rich Central African nation. Over 91% of voters approved the new constitution in a referendum held on Saturday, Gabon's Interior Minister Hermann Immongault said in a statement read on state television. Turnout was an estimated 53.5%, he added. The final results will be announced by the Constitutional Court, the interior minister said. The draft constitution, which proposes sweeping changes that could prevent dynastic rule and transfer of power, needed more than 50% of the votes cast to be adopted. In 2023, soldiers toppled President Ali Bongo Ondimba and put him under house arrest, accusing him of irresponsible governance and massive embezzlement that risked leading the country into chaos. The junta released Ondimba a week later on humanitarian grounds, allowing him travel abroad for medical treatment. The soldiers proclaimed their Republican Guard chief, Gen. Brice Clotaire Oligui Nguema, as president of a transitional committee to lead the country. Oligui is a cousin of Bongo. Bongo had served two terms since coming to power in 2009 after the death of his father, who ruled the country for 41 years. His rule was marked by widespread discontent with his reign. A coup attempt in 2019 failed. The draft constitution imposes a seven-year term, renewable only once, instead of the current charter that allows for five-year terms renewable without limit. It also says family members cannot succeed a president and abolishes the position of prime minister. The former French colony is a member of OPEC but its oil wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few — and nearly 40% of Gabonese aged 15 to 24 were out of work in 2020, according to the World Bank. Its oil export revenue was $6 billion in 2022, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.	https://apnews.com/article/gabon-referendum-constitution-approved-ee9724fb660ca97efd82946a88c4545d	2024-11-17T13:57:19-08:00	
Biden authorizes Ukraine to use US-supplied longer range missiles for deeper strikes inside Russia	MANAUS, Brazil (AP) — President Joe Biden has authorized Ukraine to use U.S.-supplied missiles to strike deeper inside Russia, easing limitations on the longer range weapons as Russia deploys thousands of North Korean troops to reinforce its war, according to a U.S. official and three other people familiar with the matter. The decision allowing Kyiv to use the Army Tactical Missile System, or ATACMs, for attacks farther inside Russia comes as President Vladimir Putin positions North Korean troops along Ukraine's northern border to try to reclaim hundreds of miles of territory seized by Ukrainian forces. Biden's move also follows the presidential election victory of Donald Trump, who has said he would bring about a swift end to the war and raised uncertainty about whether his administration would continue the United States' vital military support for Ukraine. The official and the others knowledgeable about the matter were not authorized to discuss the U.S. decision publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's reaction Sunday was notably restrained. 'Strikes are not made with words,' he said during his nightly video address. 'Such things are not announced. The missiles will speak for themselves.' Zelenskyy and many of his Western supporters have been pressing Biden for months to allow Ukraine to strike military targets deeper inside Russia with Western-supplied missiles, saying the U.S. ban had made it impossible for Ukraine to try to stop Russian attacks on its cities and electrical grids. Zelenskyy's statement came shortly after he posted a message of condolence on Telegram following a Russian attack on a nine-story building that killed at least eight people in the northern city of Sumy, 40 kilometers (24 miles) from the border with Russia. Russia also launched a massive drone and missile attack, described by officials as the largest in recent months, targeting energy infrastructure and killing civilians. The attack came as fears are mounting about Moscow’s intentions to devastate Ukraine’s power generation capacity before the winter. 'And this is the answer to everyone who tried to achieve something with Putin through talks, phone calls, hugs and appeasement,' Zelenskyy said. The comment appeared to be a dig at German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who spoke Friday with Putin in the first such call with a sitting head of a major Western power in nearly two years. Some supporters have argued that the limitation and other U.S. constraints could cost Ukraine the war. The debate has become a source of disagreement among Ukraine’s NATO allies. Biden had remained opposed, determined to hold the line against any escalation that he felt could draw the U.S. and other NATO members into direct conflict with nuclear-armed Russia. Putin has warned that Moscow could provide long-range weapons to others to strike Western targets if NATO allies allow Ukraine to use their arms to attack Russian territory. News of Biden's decision followed meetings over the last two days with the leaders of South Korea, Japan and China. The addition of North Korean troops was central to the talks, which took place on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Peru. Biden did not mention the decision during a speech at a stop in the Amazon rainforest in Brazil on his way to the Group of 20 summit. Asked about the decision, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told reporters that the U.N. position is 'to avoid a permanent deterioration of the war in Ukraine.' 'We want peace, we want fair peace,' Guterres said Sunday before the summit in Rio de Janeiro. He didn't elaborate. The longer-range missiles are likely to be used in response to North Korea’s decision to support Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, according to one of the people familiar with the development. The overall supply of ATACMS missiles is short, so U.S. officials in the past have questioned whether they could give Ukraine enough to make a difference. Some supporters of Ukraine say that even a few strikes deeper inside Russia would force its military to change deployments and expend more of its resources. North Korea has provided thousands of troops to Russia to help Moscow try to claw back land in the Kursk border region that Ukraine seized this year. The introduction of North Korean troops to the conflict comes as Moscow has seen a favorable shift in momentum. Trump has signaled that he could push Ukraine to agree to give up some land seized by Russia to find an end to the conflict. As many as 12,000 North Korean troops have been sent to Russia, according to U.S., South Korean and Ukrainian assessments. U.S. and South Korean intelligence officials say North Korea also has provided Russia with significant amounts of munitions to replenish its dwindling weapons stockpiles. Trump, who takes office in January, spoke for months as a candidate about wanting Russia’s war in Ukraine to be over, but he mostly ducked questions about whether he wanted U.S. ally Ukraine to win. He also repeatedly slammed the Biden administration for giving Kyiv tens of billions of dollars in aid. His victory has Ukraine’s international backers worrying that any rushed settlement would mostly benefit Putin. America is Ukraine’s most valuable ally in the war, providing more than $56.2 billion in security assistance since Russian forces invaded in February 2022. Worried about Russia’s response, however, the Biden administration repeatedly has delayed providing some specific advanced weapons sought by Ukraine, agreeing only under pressure from Kyiv, its supporters and in consultation with allies. That includes initially refusing Zelenskyy’s pleas for advanced tanks, Patriot air defense systems and F-16 fighter jets, among other systems. The White House agreed in May to allow Ukraine to use U.S.-provided weaponry for limited strikes just across the border with Russia. ___ Long, Miller, Knickmeyer and Lee reported from Washington.

Protesters in separatist Georgian region occupy government buildings, calling for leader's ouster	TBILISI, Georgia (AP) — Opposition protesters in Georgia’s breakaway province of Abkhazia on Sunday refused to cede control of key government buildings seized during rallies earlier in the week during which at least 14 people were injured in clashes with police. Demonstrators stormed the buildings Friday to protest new measures allowing Russians to buy property in the seaside region. Protesters on Sunday continued to demand the ouster of self-styled Abkhazian President Aslan Bzhania, and one prominent politician vowed that the opposition would form a rival government if he refuses to step down. 'If our demands for the president’s resignation are not met, we will have to form a temporary government to ensure the normal functioning of state bodies,' Temur Gulia told his supporters, according to local agencies. Bzhania, who is backed by Russia, signaled Sunday that he was prepared to step aside temporarily and hold early elections, even as he continued to slam the demonstrations as 'an attempted coup d’etat.' Opponents of the property agreement say it will drive up prices of apartments and boost Moscow’s dominance in the region. On Saturday, Bzhania announced that he would only agree to a snap election if demonstrators vacated the region’s parliament building. But crowds that gathered in the Abkhazian capital, Sukhumi, rejected the deal and opposition leaders said they would only accept Bzhania’s unconditional resignation. Meanwhile, protesters on Sunday began dismantling the security barriers around the government complex in Sukhumi. One prominent opposition figure called the metal barriers a symbol of the authorities being out of touch. 'This barrier shows that the government has decided to fence itself off from its people,' Adgur Ardzinba said, according to local media. Most of Abkhazia broke away from Georgia in fighting that ended in 1993, and Georgia lost control of the rest of the territory in the short war with Russia in 2008. Russia recognizes Abkhazia as an independent country, but many Abkhazians are concerned that the region of about 245,000 people is a client state of Moscow. Abkhazia’s mountains and Black Sea beaches make it a popular destination for Russian tourists and the demand for holiday homes could be strong. At least 14 people were injured Friday when opposition protesters clashed with police, Russian state agencies reported. Lawmakers had gathered at the region’s parliament building to discuss ratifying measures allowing Russian citizens to buy property in the breakaway state. However, the session was postponed as demonstrators broke down the gate to the building’s grounds with a truck and streamed inside. Some threw rocks at police, who responded with tear gas. The arrest of five opposition figures at a similar demonstration Monday set off widespread protests the next day in which bridges leading to Sukhumi were blocked.	https://apnews.com/article/georgia-abkhazia-unrest-protests-parliament-russia-bzhania-668d5b04d44cf59547b3d93e674b304a	2024-11-17T08:34:53-08:00	
Small plane crashes in Slovenia, killing 3 people	LJUBLJANA, Slovenia (AP) — A small plane crashed on Sunday in foggy weather in northeast Slovenia, killing three people on board, police said. Police said they were informed about the accident around noon on Sunday. The Cessna Skyhawk plane was on a panoramic flight in the area of Prekmurje when it fell, police told Slovenia's public broadcaster RTV Slovenia. The report said the plane was initially set to carry four people but one person stayed behind.	https://apnews.com/article/slovenia-small-plane-crash-cessna-prekmurje-f11cebca2e9f871786c0076b6b22e786	2024-11-17T07:43:57-08:00	
Bangladesh will seek extradition of ex-premier Sheikh Hasina from India	DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) — Bangladesh’s interim leader and Nobel Peace laureate Muhammad Yunus said Sunday that his administration will seek the extradition of ousted Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina from India, where has been in exile since fleeing a mass uprising in August. In a televised address to the nation on his first 100 days in office, Yunus said that the interim government will try those responsible including Hasina for hundreds of deaths during the student-led uprising that ended her 15-year rule. Yunus took the helm on Aug. 8, three days after Hasina fled the country. He said that not only the deaths in the uprising but all other violations of human rights, including alleged enforced disappearances while Hasina was in power, would be investigated. Bangladesh has sought help from the global police organization Interpol in issuing a red notice for the arrest of Hasina and her associates. 'We will seek the return of the fallen autocrat Sheikh Hasina from India,' Yunus said. 'I have already discussed the issue with chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court Karim Khan.' While Hasina and her close associates are facing numerous criminal charges at home, the Yunus-led government is also pushing for the ICC to take up the case. Seeking Hasina's extradition could also pose a challenge for India, which has treated her as a trusted friend. Yunus said his government's most important task was to hold a new election to hand over power to an elected government, but he did not spell out any timeframe. He said his administration would first bring about reforms in various sectors including in the electoral system. He promised that once the electoral reforms are completed, a roadmap for the new election would be unveiled. Yunus has been talking to political parties including the Bangladesh Nationalist Party headed by former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, Hasina's main rival, which has sought an election in two to three months. The party believes it will form the next government as Hasina's Awami League party and its allies face a political debacle following her ouster. Yunus said the Election Commission will be reconstituted soon. 'But as we move forward, we need to complete a lot of work. The train will reach its final station depending on how quickly we can lay down the railway tracks, and this will happen through consensus among the political parties,' he said. Yunus also downplayed as 'exaggerated' reports of attacks on minorities, especially Hindus, many of whom complained that hard-line Islamists are becoming increasingly influential since Hasina’s ouster.	https://apnews.com/article/bangladesh-sheikh-hasina-extradition-india-4265a19fe3144af5f7347072e8c64a14	2024-11-17T05:49:29-08:00	
Tropical Storm Sara makes landfall in Belize after drenching Honduras	SAN PEDRO SULA, Honduras (AP) — Tropical Storm Sara on Sunday made landfall in Belize, where forecasters expect heavy rain to cause life-threatening flash flooding and mudslides. The storm moved inland in Belize after drenching the northern coast of Honduras, where it stalled since Friday, swelling rivers and trapping some people at home. The U.S. National Hurricane Center’s tropical storm warning as of Sunday included the Caribbean coast of Guatemala; the coast of Belize; and northward into the coast of Mexico’s state of Quintana Roo, from Chetumal to Puerto Costa Maya. Those areas, along with portions of El Salvador and western Nicaragua, could see up to 5 inches (13 cm), with localized totals reaching 15 inches (38 cm). The conditions 'will result in areas of flash flooding, perhaps significant, along with the potential of mudslides,' according to the Hurricane Center. 'A storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 1 to 3 feet above ground level near and to the north of where the center of Sara crosses the coast of Belize,' the center said Sunday. 'Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by large and destructive waves.' Meanwhile, northern Honduras is not in the clear yet. The center expects Sara to drop up to 3 inches (8 cm) of rain there, but some areas could see totals hit 40 inches (1 meter), with 'catastrophic and life-threatening flooding' still possible.	https://apnews.com/article/tropical-storm-sara-belize-honduras-rain-flooding-f107d30b264401bbcc4bd48d240cc86b	2024-11-17T05:21:21-08:00	
Putin critics lead a march in Berlin calling for democracy in Russia and an end to war in Ukraine	BERLIN (AP) — Prominent Russian opposition figures led a march of at least 1,000 people in central Berlin Sunday, criticizing Russian President Vladimir Putin and his war in Ukraine and calling for democracy in Russia. Behind a banner that read 'No Putin. No War,' the protesters were led by Yulia Navalnaya, the widow of top Putin critic Alexei Navalny, as well as Ilya Yashin and Vladimir Kara-Murza, who were freed from Russian detention in a high-profile prisoner exchange this summer. Shouting 'Russia without Putin' and other chants in Russian, the demonstrators held up signs with a wide array of messages on a red background, including 'Putin = War' and 'Putin is a murderer' in German. Some marched with the flags of Russia or Ukraine, as well as a white-blue-white flag used by some Russian opposition groups. Organizers said the march began near Potsdamer Platz and went through the Brandenburg Gate and Checkpoint Charlie and was expected to end outside the Russian Embassy. 'The march demands the immediate withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukraine, the trial of Vladimir Putin as a war criminal, and the release of all political prisoners in Russia,' the protesters said in a statement. Yashin, in a statement before the demonstration, said demonstrators were 'using the freedom we have here in Berlin to show the world: A peaceful, free, and civilized Russia exists.' Navalnaya, Yashin and Kara-Murza have all billed Sunday’s rally as a show of unity at a time when recent rounds of acrimony have roiled the anti-war camp. Russia’s exiled anti-war opposition has so far largely failed to speak with one voice and present a clear plan of action. The landmark East-West prisoner swap in August freed key dissidents and promised to reinvigorate a movement unmoored by the death in prison of Navalny, a charismatic anti-corruption campaigner and arch-Kremlin foe. Instead, tensions have spiked in recent months, as Navalny’s allies and other prominent dissidents swapped accusations that appeared to dash any hopes of a united anti-Kremlin front. Many opposition-minded Russians have voiced deep frustration with the infighting, and with what some view as efforts by rivaling groups to discredit and wrest influence from one another. ___ Associated Press writer Joanna Kozlowska in London contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/karamurza-yashin-russia-berlin-putin-ukraine-1b0da07d13ed9bc7d9df2ffe282b9527	2024-11-17T05:14:22-08:00	
Rhodes scholarship recipients for 2025 include 32 US students	A group of 32 students from the United States have been selected to attend the University of Oxford as part of the prestigious Rhodes scholar program in the coming year among an international class representing more than 70 nations, scholarship officials announced. Nearly 3,000 U.S. students began the application process for the scholarship covering all expenses at the storied university in Oxford, England, to pursue graduate degrees beginning in October 2025, the Office of the American Secretary of the Rhodes Trust in McLean, Virginia, said in a statement early Sunday. The 32 recipients include students from 19 states and the District of Columbia attending 20 U.S. colleges and universities. During the application process, 865 students were endorsed by 243 colleges and universities. Committees in 16 U.S. districts then selected 238 finalists for interviews. Four of the recipients are from the U.S. Military Academy in West Point, New York, the most selected from the service academy in one year since 1959. Others include the first Rhodes scholars chosen from Eastern Mennonite University in Virginia and California's Pepperdine University. Returning students to the program for the first time in decades, Coe College in Iowa had its first scholarship winner in more than 53 years and North Carolina's Davidson College placed a scholar after 25 years without the recognition. The trust touted the wide-ranging interests of the scholarship winners: a DJ who uses AI in music and medicine, a religious studies major proficient in six languages, an amateur boxer and the youngest elected official in Missouri. Ramona L. Doyle, American secretary of the Rhodes Trust, said in the statement that in addition to academic excellence, 'a Rhodes Scholar should also have great ambition for social impact, and an uncommon ability to work with others to achieve one’s goals.' 'They should be committed to make a strong difference for good in the world, be concerned for the welfare of others, and be acutely conscious of inequities,' Doyle said. The sponsorships were created in 1902 by the will of Cecil Rhodes, a founder of the diamond mining and manufacturing company De Beers. The inaugural class entered Oxford in 1903 and the first U.S. Rhodes scholars arrived the next year. Scholars pursue advanced degrees in subjects ranging from social sciences and humanities to biological and physical sciences, according to the trust. The Rhodes scholarship is 'the oldest and best-known award for international study, and arguably the most famous academic award available to American college graduates,' Doyle said. Sunday's announcement brings the total number of Americans selected for Rhodes scholarships to 3,674 representing 329 colleges and universities, the trust said, noting 675 U.S. women have won the scholarship despite only having been eligbile to apply since 1976. The U.S. scholars chosen for the 2024 class were the first to take part in a screening process in person following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. During the previous three years, the selection process was conducted online. The scholarships are typically for two to three years but may extend to four. The award covers all fees, a living expense stipend and transportion between England and the recipient’s location. The scholarship is valued at about $75,000 annually, reaching to about $250,000 for scholars who remain in their departments for four years.	https://apnews.com/article/rhodes-scholars-united-states-oxford-university-fcb74fb00691e5dda500e1a1c885ff71	2024-11-17T00:20:39-08:00	
Senegal votes in election that will decide if president can carry out the reforms he promised	DAKAR, Senegal (AP) — Polls opened in Senegal on Sunday for a parliamentary election that is set to determine whether the country’s newly elected president can carry out ambitious reforms. More than 7 million registered voters in the West African country are choosing 165 lawmakers in the national assembly, where the party of President Bassirou Diomaye Faye currently does not hold a majority. Faye, who was elected in March on an anti-establishment platform, says that has blocked him from executing the reforms he pledged during his campaign, including fighting corruption, reviewing fishing permits for foreign companies and securing a bigger share from the country’s natural resources for the population. In September, he dissolved the opposition-led parliament, paving the way for a snap legislative election. His party is facing the Takku Wallu opposition platform led by former President Macky Sall, alongside 39 other registered parties and coalitions. Polls will close at 6 p.m (1800 GMT). The first provisional results are expected to be known by Monday morning, but the final count will only be published later in the week. Faye’s political party, PASTEF, needs at least 83 seats in order to gain a majority in the assembly. Analysts say it has a high chance of securing that, given its popularity and Faye's margin of victory in the March presidential election. Faye, 44, was elected with 54% in the first round, becoming Africa’s youngest elected leader, less than two weeks after he was released from prison. His rise has reflected widespread frustration among Senegal’s youth with the country’s direction — a common sentiment across Africa, which has the world’s youngest population and a number of leaders accused of clinging to power for decades. Over 60% of Senegalese are under 25 and 90% work in informal jobs. Senegal has been hit by skyrocketing inflation in recent years, making it difficult for them to get by. The country is also a major source of irregular migration to Europe, with thousands leaving every year on rickety, artisanal fishing boats in search of economic opportunities. The campaign for the legislative election was marked by sporadic clashes between supporters of different parties. The headquarters of an opposition party were set on fire in the capital, Dakar, and clashes have erupted between supporters in central Senegal in recent weeks, the interior ministry said Monday, On Tuesday, Ousmane Sonko, the country’s prime minister who helped catapult Faye to victory, denounced attacks against supporters of PASTEF in Dakar and other cities. 'May each patriot they have attacked and injured be proportionally avenged. We will exercise our legitimate right to respond,' he wrote on X, before back-pedalling and asking his supporters to remain peaceful in a speech later that day. Last month, Sonko’s vehicle was attacked with stones as clashes broke out between his supporters and unidentified attackers while he was campaigning in Koungueul, in the center of the country. The leader of an allied party, former minister Malick Gackou, had his arm broken in the incident, according to local media. Faye called for peace and urged his supporters to respect the results of the election regardless of the outcome. 'There will be winners and losers but in the end, it is the people that win,' Faye said after casting his vote in his native town of Ndiaganiao, more than 100 kilometers (60 miles) east of Dakar. 'We have an obligation to preserve the international community’s view of our democracy. We are an exception and we must continue to protect that,' he added, referring to Senegal’s reputation as a stable democracy in West Africa, a region rocked in recent years by coups and attempted coups. The presidential election in March had tested this reputation. Both Faye and Sonko had been imprisoned on charges that were largely seen as political, leading to months of protests that were unprecedented in Senegal. Rights groups said dozens of people were killed and about 1,000 people were jailed. Opposition supporters also had been concerned that Sall would seek a third term in office despite being prevented from doing so by the constitution. After a bid to delay the election was blocked by the courts, the government released hundreds of political prisoners, including Faye and Sonko, less than two weeks before the vote. Faye was catapulted into the presidency when Sonko — who was barred from running due to a previous conviction — put his backing behind the political novice and Faye easily beat the candidate backed by Sall. —— Associated Press writer Babacar Dione in Dakar contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/senegal-election-bassirou-diomaye-faye-pastef-52d97319ade0efc750ea3bc5f50877f6	2024-11-16T23:45:02-08:00	
Russia launches one of the fiercest missile and drone attacks at Ukraine's infrastructure	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Russia on Sunday launched a massive drone and missile attack on Ukraine, described by officials as the largest over the past months, targeting energy infrastructure and killing civilians. The attack came as fears are mounting about Moscow’s intentions to devastate Ukraine's power generation capacity ahead of the cold winter. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that Russia had launched a total of 120 missiles and 90 drones in a large-scale attack across Ukraine. Various types of drones were deployed, he said, including Iranian-made Shaheds as well as cruise, ballistic and aircraft-launched ballistic missiles. Ukrainian defenses shot down 140 air targets, Zelenskyy said in a statement on the Telegram messaging app. 'The enemy’s target was our energy infrastructure throughout Ukraine. Unfortunately, there is damage to objects from hits and falling debris. In Mykolaiv, as a result of a drone attack, two people were killed and six others were injured, including two children,' Zelenskyy said. Two others were killed in the Odesa region, where the attack damaged energy infrastructure and disrupted power and water supplies, said local Gov. Oleh Kiper. The combined drone and missile attack was the most powerful in three months, according to the head of Kyiv’s City Military Administration Serhii Popko. Russian strikes have hammered Ukraine’s power infrastructure since Moscow’s all-out invasion of its neighbor in February 2022, prompting repeated emergency power shutdowns and nationwide rolling blackouts. Ukrainian officials have routinely urged Western allies to bolster the country’s air defenses to counter assaults and allow for repairs. Explosions were heard across Ukraine on Sunday, including in capital Kyiv, the key southern port of Odesa, as well as the country’s west and central regions, according to local reports. The operational command of Poland’s armed forces wrote on X that Polish and allied aircraft, including fighter jets, have been mobilized in Polish airspace because of the 'massive' Russian attack on neighboring Ukraine. The steps were aimed to provide safety in Poland's border areas, it said. One person was injured after the roof of a five-story residential building caught fire in Kyiv’s historic center, according to Popko. A thermal power plant operated by private energy company DTEK was 'seriously damaged,' the company said. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine	https://apnews.com/article/zelenskyy-russia-missiles-drones-ukraine-infrastructure-6af214839d9436731e9b960f0d3a7a8a	2024-11-16T23:31:14-08:00	
Israeli police make arrests after flares fired at prime minister's private residence	TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Israeli police said Sunday that they have arrested three suspects after flares were fired at the private residence of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the coastal city of Caesarea. Authorities said the prime minister and his family were not at the residence when two flares were fired at it overnight, and there were no injuries. The police did not provide details about the suspects, but officials pointed to domestic political critics of Netanyahu. Israeli President Isaac Herzog condemned the incident and warned against 'an escalation of the violence in the public sphere.' Netanyahu has faced months of mass protests over his handling of the hostage crisis unleashed by Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023 attack into Israel, which ignited the ongoing war in the Gaza Strip. Critics blame Netanyahu for the security and intelligence failures that allowed the attack to happen and for not reaching a deal with Hamas to release scores of hostages still held inside Gaza. A drone launched by Lebanon’s Hezbollah militant group struck Netanyahu's Caesarea residence last month, also when he and his family were away. ___ Find more of AP’s war coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war	https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-lebanon-hezbollah-iran-060c45c86b937d255270d272590884a6	2024-11-16T22:05:05-08:00	
Russia grinds deeper into Ukraine after 1,000 days of grueling war	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — When Russian tanks rolled into Ukraine in February 2022, the conventional wisdom was that the capital, Kyiv, would soon fall and the rest of the country wouldn’t last long against a much larger enemy. Instead, it was that narrative that quickly collapsed. The Ukrainian army proved it could slow the advance of Russia’s forces and, if not drive them out completely, then – with enough support from the West – at least forestall defeat. But nearly three years later, the outlook is again grim. Russia is expending huge amounts of weaponry and human life to make small-but-steady territorial gains to the nearly one-fifth of Ukraine it already controls. Ukraine, meanwhile, is struggling to minimize losses, maintain morale and convince allies that, with more military aid, it can turn the tide. As this brutal war of attrition grinds toward its 1,000th day, neither side seems eager to negotiate. President-elect Donald Trump has said he could quickly end the war, though it is unclear how or in whose favor he might tip the scales. This backdrop appears to be driving Russia’s strategy in eastern Ukraine, according to Phillips O’Brien, a professor of strategic studies at the University of St. Andrews, Scotland. Trump could try to force an end to the war by halting the supply of weapons to Ukraine, he said. 'If Trump cuts aid to Ukraine and a cease-fire leads to a frozen conflict, Russia wants to secure as much territory as it can now,' O’Brien said. For Ukraine, the key to any cease-fire would be guarantees from the West that it won't allow Russia to re-invade in the future. Otherwise, O'Brien said, 'a cease-fire is a recipe for constant instability in Europe.' Russia is advancing slowly but steadily in eastern Ukraine In the war's first year, Ukraine lost huge amounts of territory — but it also achieved notable victories. It resisted a much larger adversary with superior air power to survive as an independent country, and it reclaimed some land through gutsy counteroffensives, giving the underdog — and its wealthy allies — the confidence to stay in the fight. In the second year, which was punctuated by Ukraine's devastating loss of Bakhmut and its failed counteroffensive, the armies essentially fought to a standstill along a 1,000 kilometer (620 mile) front line. Toward the end of that year, the U.S. Congress delayed the approval of a $61 billion package of aid for weapons, and economic and humanitarian assistance. With Ukraine's ammunition dwindling, its outlook deteriorated significantly as the war’s third year began. In February 2024, the town of Avdiivka fell after months of airstrikes by Russia, which used highly destructive Soviet-era bombs retrofitted with navigation systems. The fall of Avdiivka created a major breach in Ukraine’s defenses. When Russia later mounted an assault on the northeastern city of Kharkiv, Ukrainian troops were stretched further. A bright spot for Ukraine came in August, when it launched a surprise incursion into Russia. It took — and still holds — hundreds of square kilometers in the Kursk region. While this could be an important chip in any cease-fire negotiations, it hasn't stopped Russian forces from taking more land in Ukraine's east. 'The Russians have paid a very high price to keep advancing, but they’re willing to pay that price in lives to gain a few more meters of territory each day,' said Justin Crump, head of the British strategic advisory firm Sibylline. Tens of thousands of soldiers from both countries have been killed since the start of the war in 2022, according to estimates, and the U.N. says at least 11,700 Ukrainian civilians have been killed. While the amount of land Russia has gained in 2024 — about 2,455 square kilometers (948 square miles)— is equal to less than 1% of Ukraine’s pre-war territory, it is having a psychological impact. With Ukraine in retreat, 'we’ve now returned to a period reminiscent of the (war's) first months,' said Mykola Bielieskov, an analyst at CBA Initiatives Center in Kyiv. 'This strengthens Russia’s position — not so much militarily, but in terms of morale.' A war of attrition requires both sides to seek outside resources To keep its war machine going, Russia — like Ukraine — has turned to allies for help. Iran supplies Russia with drones and possibly missiles, and North Korea has sent ammunition — and even troops, who have been deployed to Russia's Kursk region. Russian President Vladimir Putin claimed this year that 700,000 of his troops are fighting in Ukraine. Analysts say Putin would need a much larger force to accelerate Russia’s advance, but that he is unlikely to mobilize more troops because it could stoke internal discontent. Ukraine’s foothold in Kursk is another complicating factor for Putin, and it could be used as a bargaining chip in any future cease-fire negotiations. Captain Yevhen Karas, a Ukrainian commander in Kursk, said the fighting inside Russia is highly dynamic, but he believes it will prove effective in diverting Russia's attention and resources. 'Even a creeping, retreating front exhausts the enemy significantly,' Karas said. Ukraine has asked the West for longer range missiles and its blessing to fire at air bases deep inside Russia. But its allies have so far resisted, wary of escalating tensions with a nuclear-armed Russia. The U.S. has provided more than $64 billion in military aid to Ukraine since the war began 1,000 days ago. Soldiers worry about what would happen without sustained American support. 'Bravery, heroism, and spirit alone are not enough,' said a Ukrainian soldier in the eastern Donetsk region who spoke on condition of anonymity, in line with military rules. The soldier estimated that where he is stationed Russian infantry outnumber Ukrainian troops 10 to 1. As the war drags on and the death toll rises, it has become increasingly difficult for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to keep replacing troops. The US will play a vital role in determining the war's next direction What direction the war takes next will depend in large part on how the incoming Trump administration plays its hand. Trump, who has touted his good relationship with President Vladimir Putin and called the Russian leader 'pretty smart' for invading Ukraine, has repeatedly criticized American backing of Ukraine. During his only campaign debate with Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump twice refused to directly answer a question about whether he wanted Ukraine to win — raising concerns that Kyiv could be forced to accept unfavorable terms in any negotiations. Without security guarantees from the West, Ukraine could find itself vulnerable to future Russian aggression. Analysts say a cease-fire based on the current state of the battlefield would set a dangerous precedent, implying that Europe's borders are up for grabs through military action — something that hasn’t happened since World War II. 'This would also have a lot of traction in countries like China, India, and elsewhere,' said Richard Connolly, a Russia expert at the Royal United Services Institute in London. 'They could present that as a strategic defeat not only for Ukraine, but also for the West.' As another winter of war approaches, Ukrainian soldiers say they remain resolute. 'We are standing strong, giving it our all, and we won’t surrender,' said a battalion chief of staff in the southern region of Zaporizhzhia. 'The most important thing now is not to lose more land.' ___ Associated Press journalist Volodymyr Yurchuk contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/ukraine-russia-war-f7f56e494df1dbbcdec1853001796c45	2024-11-16T20:50:39-08:00	
Tea is a way of life in Azerbaijan and center stage at COP29. But it's not immune to climate change	BAKU, Azerbaijan (AP) — Agreements might not yet be brewing amongst negotiators at United Nations climate talks, but tea certainly is. It's one of the clearest reminders that the climate summit — COP29 — is hosted by Azerbaijan. Attendees who roam for miles within the indoor venue have ample options to take a pit stop for sugar and caffeine: shops stack high mountains of pastries with sugary, nutty pakhlava and cardamom-tinged, crescent-shaped shekerbura. At Azerbaijan's country pavilion, women in Baku's traditional dress pour the warm drink for visitors. All of it, like daily life in the city outside, revolves around tea — which climate change threatens around the globe. As world leaders descend on the capital city of Baku for climate talks, researchers who study tea report that in some regions around the world, tea cultivation could decrease by over half as rising temperatures, drought, heavy precipitation and erosion batter tea plants and the land they grow on. Scientists are studying ways to improve tea varieties and preparing for a future where some tea production moves north, along with many other crops hard hit by climate change. Tea 'is a source of livelihood for our region; especially for the local people, for tea producers,' said Keziban Yazici, a professor who has been studying the effects of climate change on tea, speaking in Turkish. 'We need to take the necessary precautions against climate change to make this product sustainable.' Her team has been working on developing drought-resistant tea varieties at their university in Rize, Turkey, one of the major tea-producing areas in the Caucasus region. Yazici traveled to Azerbaijan this spring to initiate further cooperation between the countries — which have many similarities in tea culture and growing — on preparing tea crops for the threat of climate change. The perilous future of this beloved drink serves as a reminder that if the world fails to meet the global warming goals set in the Paris Agreement, many places around the world stand to grieve not just lives and livelihoods, but also treasured elements of cultural heritage. 'Culture and the future has to be aligned,' said Fatima Fataliyeva, the senior sustainability manager for the COP29 operation company, who was responsible for the design of the Azerbaijan pavilion at the venue. 'My mom taught me this, so I will (teach) my kids, so it doesn't disappear.' Fataliyeva described the importance for her team of including Azerbaijani culture at the venue. The first thing that comes to your attention, she said, is tea. From an early age, she learned that drinking tea symbolized hospitality and respect. Tea is for drinking with family and friends, in the home and out on dates. It's central in gossiping and matchmaking, for grandpas playing chess, on festivals and in times of mourning. People drink it from pear-shaped glasses called armudu that keep the bottom of the tea warm while cooling the top, sometimes served with a wedge of orange or lemon and a lump of boiled sugar. 'When you are happy, you drink tea. When you are sad, you drink tea,' said Levent Kurnaz, a professor who studies climate change and ways of combatting invasive pests that are likely to cause increasing harm to tea plants. Kurnaz attended COP29 in part because he saw it as an important way to communicate about climate change — a topic he says isn't talked about as widely in Turkey and Azerbaijan but that is already slamming the few subject-matter experts in the region with a vast array of problems, present and future, in fields ranging from agriculture to immigration. 'Climate change will affect this region seriously,' Kurnaz said, especially for farmers, many of them women, who have grown tea all their lives. 'They don’t have a clue what to do when tea production goes sour. But at some point it will.' Azerbaijan is 25th on the list of top crude oil exporting countries and one of the birthplaces of the oil industry, one of leading sources of planet-warming carbon dioxide emissions. The country is planning to hike its fossil fuel production over the next decade to meet demand from Europe, and their oil production has been a point of controversy since the beginning of this COP. But President Ilham Aliyev said earlier this year that the country is an phase of transition toward clean energy, while maintaining the world continues to need fossil fuels to develop in the foreseeable future. For ordinary people as well as producers, climate change and choices about food and drink are intertwined. That's evident to Rauf Shikhaliyev, who owns a vegetarian and vegan restaurant in Baku called De Rama, also included in the COP29 venue food court. He felt it was 'very important to participate' at the climate talks because his project of creating a vegetarian restaurant was 'highly linked to climate change,' he said. He added that after years in the restaurant business, he's seen the tea culture firsthand: before they order food, many locals will first order tea. It's fitting for the U.N.: 'Tea drinking makes people get kind of united,' he said. ___ Frazer reported from Ankara, Turkey. ___ Follow Melina Walling on X, formerly known as Twitter, @MelinaWalling. ___ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Indigenous peoples, impacted by climate change, raise alarm about the planet at COP29	BAKU, Azerbaijan (AP) — They share stories of rising seas, burning trees, contaminated water and disease. But they also come ready to discuss solutions, sharing work their communities are doing to help confront a major threat to life on Earth: climate change. For the many Indigenous peoples who attend the annual U.N. climate talks, this year being held in Azerbaijan, it's a chance to make their voices heard. Their communities are often hard hit by weather extremes that are made worse by climate change. At the same time, traditional practices make many such communities vital in efforts to combat global warming. After all, for thousands of years Indigenous peoples around the world have successfully cared for lands, finding a balance with nature. The Associated Press asked 12 Indigenous people attending this year’s negotiations to say one thing about how climate change is impacting their community, or how their community is helping to combat climate change. Here are their reflections: Saina Ekaterina Savvinova, 53 Indigenous community: Yakut Location: Yakutsk, Russia 'When I was a child, we had a lot of snow. We played in it. We made labyrinths with it. Now we don’t have much snow.' Antumalen Ayelen Antillanca Urrutia, 26 Indigenous community: Mapuche Huilliche Location: Huapi Island, Chile 'As a young Mapuche, I denounce the contamination of my home of Ranco Lake in southern Chile. I live on the third largest lake, on an island in the middle of it, and we do not have drinking water.' Sydney Males, 27 Indigenous community: Kichwa Otavalo Location: Otavalo, Ecuador 'We have a connection, like an energy, with the lakes, with the water in general. We have a connection with fire, we have a connection with the the air and other things that you in the Occident don't have a connection with. So, we have solutions for climate change.' Big Wind Carpenter, 31 Indigenous community: Northern Arapaho Location: Wind River Reservation, United States 'We have been in a drought since I was born. We have been in extreme drought the last 30 years and completely surrounded by wildfires.' Flora Vano, 39 Indigenous community: Melenasian Location: Port Vila, Vanuatu 'Sea level rise is eating us up. It threatens our food security, contaminates our water source, infrastructure is destroyed and the increase in gender-based violence goes sky high.' Puyr dos Santos Tembé, 47 Indigenous community: Tembé Location: Belem, Brazil 'Think about the Amazon. You have trees and rivers, and then you see the rivers, which are the mode of transport for many people, drying up.' Mingma Chhiri, 40 Indigenous community: Sherpa Location: Khumbu Pasanglhamu Municipality District, Nepal 'As ethnic people in the area, we don’t destroy any natural beauty. We don’t cut trees. We plant them.' Hindou Oumarou Ibrahim, 41 Indigenous community: Mbororo Location: N’Djamena, Chad 'Right now we are experiencing the biggest floods we have ever had. Two million people have been displaced and thousands are dead.' Ninawa Inu Pereira Nunes, 50 Indigenous community: Huni Kui Location: Feijo, Brazil 'The main work we do is to raise awareness among people to stop deforestation. But we are also restoring degraded areas by planting trees. And we are working very hard to strengthen the spirituality of our people by restoring the sources of the rivers and repopulating the streams and rivers.' Marynne Rimbao, 42 Indigenous community: Tombekin Location: Unda village, Papua New Guinea 'My place is located in one of the remotest places in Papua New Guinea, where there are mining activities. Especially when mining activities are involved, my area is being impacted by climate change when it comes to the environment — the land, the water, the resources, the food and forests — that sustains our livelihood.' Didja Tchari Djibrillah, 30 Indigenous community: Peul Mbororo Location: Mayo-Kebbi East, Chad 'The community (of pastoralists) contributes to combatting the effects of climate change. When moving from one place to another, we leave cow dung that allows the soil to be fertilized and the ecosystem to regenerate.' Jackson Michael, 40 Indigenous community: Iban Location: Borneo, Malaysia 'Heavy rainfall is affecting wildlife. Now the government is making a lot of effort to protect and preserve wildlife.' __ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

As talks in Baku cross the halfway point, nations are no closer to a goal on cash for climate action	BAKU, Azerbaijan (AP) — Distractions were bigger than deals in the first week of United Nations climate talks, leaving a lot to be done, especially on the main issue of money. In week one, not a lot of progress was made on the issue of how much money rich countries should pay to developed ones to move away from dirty fuels and how to cope with rising seas and temperatures and pay for damage already caused by climate-driven extreme weather. But more is expected when government ministers fly in for week two to handle the hard political deal-making at the negotiations — known as COP29 — in Baku, Azerbaijan. Countries remain about a trillion dollars a year apart in the big number to be settled. 'All the developing countries look very united behind $1.3 trillion. That’s not a ceiling. That’s what they want. That’s what they think they need,' said Debbie Hillier, policy lead at Mercy Corps. 'The U.S. and Canada are constantly talking about a floor of $100 billion.... So you've got $100 billion at one end and $1.3 trillion' on the other end. While poor countries have come up with a number for the total final package, the rich donor nations have assiduously avoided giving a total, choosing to pick a figure late in the bargaining game, Hillier said. 'The intention of developed countries to really come clean and show commitment is missing,' said Harjeet Singh, global engagement director for the Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty Initiative. 'They have not uttered a single word on what the (final total) is going to be which is very disturbing.' Especially when it comes to this total, United Nations Climate Secretary Simon Stiell said, 'negotiations on key issues need to be moving much faster.' 'What’s at stake here in Baku,' Stiell said, is 'nothing less than the capacity to halve emissions this decade and protect lives and livelihoods from spiraling climate impacts.' Climate talks run on ‘brinkmanship’ At the moment, the sides are far away, which is sort of normal for this stage. The technical details that are worked out by negotiators now have to give way to the bigger, harder number decisions made by climate and finance ministers to make more political decisions, said Ani Dasgupta, president of World Resources Institute. 'Member states have not moved and parties have not moved as expeditiously as they need to do,' said United Nations Environment Programme Executive Director Inger Andersen. 'This is causing frustration. I understand that. So the answer is to push and push more and ensure that we land where we need to land.' Andersen said it’s not smart to judge where countries will end up after just one week. Things change. It’s the nature of how negotiations are designed, experts said. That’s how it usually goes. 'COP works on brinkmanship,' said Avinash Persaud, a special climate adviser at the Inter-American Development Bank. 'COP works on the fear of us not reaching agreement in the end, which makes the process appear chaotic from the outside.' Ministers will also be consulting with their bosses half a world away and seven hours behind at the Group of 20 countries — the G20 — in Brazil from Monday. The G20 is comprised of the world’s richest nations, who are also responsible for 77% of planet-heating gases being spewed. Eyes are on the COP president Usually, the second week is when the COP president takes over and pushes sides together for a deal. Different negotiations' presidents have different styles. Last year's president used sharp elbows to get things done, upsetting some people. That's not the style of this year's COP29 President Mukhtar Babayev. 'What I see with Mukhtar is that he uses a gentle presence, a degree of humility in his very presence,' Andersen said. But Mohamed Adow, of the think tank Power Shift Africa said 'the presidency is not giving any hope for how he will help the world strike the right compromises.' Babayev struck an optimistic tone in a statement to The Associated Press on how things are looking at the halfway point. 'We have made good progress in the first week. We’re feeling positive but there is still much work to do,' Babayev said. 'Success does not depend on one country or party alone – it requires all of us.' At the talks' first week, there were many distractions Much of the news from the talks' first weeks came from outside the negotiation rooms. Host country president Ilham Aliyev triggered a few distractions himself. His combative welcome speech not only blasted neighbor Armenia and western mainstream media, but he called oil and gas — chief causes of climate change a 'gift from the Gods.' And then he got into a verbal spat with France, prompting the environment minister to pull out from the talks. Argentina called its delegation home in what may be a preview for the right-wing ruled country pulling out of the Paris climate agreement. At the same time, a letter signed by a former United Nations secretary-general and ex-top climate negotiators called for dramatic reform of the talks. But several authors said the letter was being misinterpreted. Activists blasted the talks as being too wedded to fossil fuels, citing Aliyev's comments, the fact that Azerbaijan is a big oil producer and that more than 1,700 people connected to the fossil fuel industry were part of the negotiations. A sense of optimism, but not urgency Some top leaders already at the climate talks expressed 'cautious optimism' but added that the larger goal of climate talks should be front and center next week. 'We need to keep 1.5 alive,' said Alliance of Small Island States Chair Cedric Schuster referring to the climate goal set nine years ago at the Paris climate talks to keep global heating to less than 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times. Schuster, who is also the environment minister of Samoa, a Pacific island impacted by rising seas, added that 'discussions are progressing, and we hope to get there.' Sehr Raheja from New Delhi-based Centre for Science and Environment said countries have gone for the 'lowest hanging fruit so far' and said developed nations 'will have to engage in good faith on the issues of total money needed' if there's a chance of getting a strong outcome. Climate Analytics CEO Bill Hare called for more urgency from the talks. 'Despite the recent devastation the world has experienced and the soaring rise in temperatures, the urgency really hasn’t yet been felt here in Baku,' he said. ___ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

The 'super year' of elections has been super bad for incumbents as voters punish them in droves	BANGKOK (AP) — Whether on the left or the right, regardless of how long they’ve been in power, sitting governments around the world have been drubbed this year by disgruntled voters in what has been called the 'super year' for elections. Donald Trump's victory in the U.S. presidential election was just the latest in a long line of losses for incumbent parties in 2024, with people in some 70 countries accounting for about half the world's population going to the polls. Issues driving voter discontent have varied widely, though there has been almost universal malaise since the COVID-19 pandemic as people and businesses struggle to get back on their feet while facing stubbornly high prices, cash-strapped governments and a surge in migration. 'There’s an overall sense of frustration with political elites, viewing them as out of touch, that cuts across ideological lines,' said Richard Wike, director of global attitudes research at the Pew Research Center. He noted that a Pew poll of 24 countries found that the appeal of democracy itself was slipping as voters reported increasing economic distress and a sense that no political faction truly represents them. 'Lots of factors are driving this,' Wike said, 'but certainly feelings about the economy and inflation are a big factor.' Since the pandemic hit in 2020, incumbents have been removed from office in 40 of 54 elections in Western democracies, said Steven Levitsky, a political scientist at Harvard University, revealing 'a huge incumbent disadvantage.' In Britain, the right-of-center Conservatives suffered their worst result since 1832 in July’s election, which returned the center-left Labour Party to power after 14 years. But just across the English Channel, the far right rocked the governing parties of France and Germany, the European Union's biggest and most powerful members, in June elections for the parliament of the 27-nation bloc. The results pushed French President Emmanuel Macron to call a parliamentary election in hope of stemming a far-right surge at home. The anti-immigration National Rally party won the first round, but alliances and tactical voting knocked it down to third place in the second round, producing a fragile government atop a divided legislature. In Asia, a group of South Korean liberal opposition parties, led by the Democratic Party, defeated the ruling conservative People Power Party in April’s parliamentary elections. India’s Narendra Modi, meanwhile, had been widely expected to easily sweep to a third straight term in June but instead voters turned away from his Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party in droves, costing it its majority in parliament, though it was able to remain in power with the help of allies. Likewise, Japanese voters in October punished the Liberal Democratic Party, which has governed the country nearly without interruption since 1955. Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba will stay in power, but the greater-than-expected loss ended the LDP’s one-sided rule, giving the opposition a chance to achieve policy changes long opposed by the conservatives. 'If you were to ask me to explain Japan in a vacuum, that’s not too difficult,' said Paul Nadeau, an adjunct assistant professor at Temple University’s Japan campus in Tokyo. 'Voters were punishing an incumbent party for a corruption scandal, and this gave them a chance to express a lot more frustrations that they already had.' Globally, however, it's harder to draw conclusions. 'This is pretty consistent across different situations, different countries, different elections — incumbents are getting a crack on the shins,' he said. 'And I don’t have any good big picture explanations for why that is.' Rob Ford, professor of political science at the University of Manchester, said inflation has been a major driver of 'the greatest wave of anti-incumbent voting ever seen' — though the reasons behind the backlash may also be 'broader and more diffuse.' 'It could be something directly to do with the long-term effects of the COVID pandemic — a big wave of ill health, disrupted education, disrupted workplace experiences and so forth making people less happy everywhere, and they are taking it out on governments,' he said. 'A kind of electoral long COVID.' In South Africa, high unemployment and inequality helped drive a dramatic loss of support for the African National Congress, which had governed for three decades since the end of the apartheid system of white minority rule. The party once led by Nelson Mandela lost its parliamentary majority in May’s election and was forced to go into coalition with opposition parties. Other elections in Africa presented a mixed picture, said Alex Vines, director of the African Program at the international affairs think tank Chatham House, partially clouded by countries with authoritarian leaders whose reelections were not in doubt, like Rwanda’s long-serving President Paul Kagame who got 99% of the vote. In African countries with strong democratic institutions, however, the pattern of incumbents being punished holds, Vines said. 'The countries with stronger institutions — South Africa, Senegal, Botswana — have witnessed either a government of national unity or change of party of government,' he said. In Botswana, voters unexpectedly ejected a party that had ruled for 58 years since independence from Britain in an October election. Vines said that across the continent, 'you’ve got this electorate now who have no memory of decolonization or the end of apartheid and so have different priorities, who are also feeling the cost-of-living pressures.' In Latin America, one major country stands out for bucking the anti-incumbent wave – Mexico. Andrés Manuel López Obrador, limited to a single term, selected Claudia Sheinbaum, a member of his party, to succeed him. Sheinbaum easily won the presidency in June’s election. Wike noted that Mexico is one of the few countries in Pew’s survey where voters reported satisfaction with economic conditions. Some newcomers to office have already found that the honeymoon following their victories has been short, as people have rapidly turned on them. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has seen his approval ratings plummet from a jaded electorate that wants lower prices and better public services — but is deeply skeptical of politicians’ intention and ability to deliver change. Ford, of the University of Manchester, said it's a problem for democracy when voters, whose task is to hold governments to account, are so quick to pass judgment. 'If voters are the electoral equivalent of a hanging judge, putting politicians to the gallows whether they be guilty or innocent, then what incentive is there for governments to try?' he asked. 'The angels and the devils get chucked out alike, but being an angel is harder.' Trump first came to power as a challenger in the 2016 election, and then lost as an incumbent in the 2020 election to Joe Biden. This year, he defeated Biden's vice president, Kamala Harris, who stepped in late in the race when the president unexpectedly dropped out. Trump's win is one of the conservative populist movement's highest-profile triumphs. But another icon of the cause, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, saw his own party suffer its worst showing in decades in this year's European Union election, demonstrating that no movement is safe from backlash. Nadeau, of Temple University, suggested that perhaps analysts had previously misunderstood global electoral trends — parsing them as ideological shifts — 'when all along it was actually an anti-incumbent mood.' 'Maybe it has always been anti-incumbent, and we were just misdiagnosing it,' he said. ___ Lawless reported from London and Riccardi from Denver, Colorado.	https://apnews.com/article/global-elections-2024-incumbents-defeated-c80fbd4e667de86fe08aac025b333f95	2024-11-16T20:08:10-08:00	
Biden will become the first sitting US president to visit the Amazon rainforest	SAO PAULO (AP) — Joe Biden will become the first sitting U.S. president to set foot in the Amazon rainforest during a brief stop Sunday in the Brazilian city of Manaus, coming as the U.S. is expected to scale back its commitment to combating climate change under the incoming administration of Donald Trump. The massive Amazon — it’s about the size of Australia — stores huge amounts of the world’s carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas driving climate change, even as it's rapidly deforested. Biden is expected to take an aerial tour over part of the world's largest tropical rainforest, meet local and indigenous leaders and visit an Amazonian museum as he looks to highlight his commitment to the preservation of the region. The Biden administration announced plans last year for a $500 million contribution to the Amazon Fund, the most significant international cooperation effort to preserve the rainforest, primarily financed by Norway. So far, the U.S. government said it has provided $50 million, according to a July statement from its embassy in Brazil, adding it would 'continue to work with Congress to secure the remaining funding for the Amazon Fund and related activities through 2028.' 'It’s significant for a sitting president to visit the Amazon. ... This shows a personal commitment from the president,' said Suely Araújo, former head of the Brazilian environmental protection agency and public policy coordinator with the nonprofit Climate Observatory. 'That said, we can’t expect concrete results from this visit.' She doubts that a 'single penny' will go to the Amazon Fund come January. The Trump administration is highly unlikely to prioritize the Amazon — or anything related to climate change. The Republican president-elect already said he'd again pull out of the Paris agreement, a global pact forged to avert the threat of catastrophic climate change, after Biden recommitted to the agreement. Trump has cast climate change as a 'hoax' and said he will eliminate energy efficiency regulations by the Biden administration. The Amazon is the world’s largest tropical rainforest, home to Indigenous communities and 10% of Earth’s biodiversity. It also regulates moisture across South America. About two-thirds of the Amazon lies within Brazil, and scientists say its devastation poses a catastrophic threat to the planet. The forest has been suffering two years of historic drought that have dried up waterways, isolated thousands of riverine communities and hindered riverine dwellers’ ability to fish. It's also made way for wildfires that have burned an area larger than Switzerland and choked cities near and far with smoke. When Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva took office last year, he signaled a shift in environmental policy from his predecessor — far-right Jair Bolsonaro. Bolsonaro prioritized agribusiness expansion over forest protection and weakened environmental agencies, prompting deforestation to surge to a 15-year-high. Lula has pledged 'zero deforestation' by 2030, though his term runs through the end of 2026. Forest loss in Brazil’s Amazon dropped by 30.6% in the 12 months through July from a year earlier, bringing deforestation to its lowest level in nine years, according to official data released last week. In that 12-month span, the Amazon lost 6,288 square kilometers (2,428 square miles), roughly the size of the U.S. state of Delaware. However, that data fails to capture the surge of destruction this year, which will only be included in next year’s reading. Despite the success in curbing Amazon deforestation, Lula’s government has been criticized by environmentalists for backing projects that could harm the region, such as paving a highway that cuts from an old-growth area and could encourage logging, oil drilling near the mouth of the Amazon River and building a railway to transport soy to Amazonian ports. Biden is making the Amazon visit as part of a six-day trip to South America, the first to the continent of his presidency. On Sunday morning, he's wrapping a visit to Lima, Peru, where he took part in the annual Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit and met with Chinese President Xi Jinping. After his brief stop in Manaus, he's headed to Rio de Janeiro for this year's Group of 20 leaders summit. ___ Madhani reported from Lima, Peru, and Long from Washington.	https://apnews.com/article/biden-amazon-peru-g20-3cc827382d1e3c32865a14616ddfe467	2024-11-16T20:03:57-08:00

Latest typhoon lashes the Philippines, causing tidal surges and displacing massive numbers of people	MANILA, Philippines (AP) — A powerful typhoon wrecked houses, caused towering tidal surges and forced hundreds of thousands of people to flee to emergency shelters as it cut across the northern Philippines on Sunday in the sixth major storm to hit the country in less than a month. Typhoon Man-yi slammed into the eastern island province of Catanduanes on Saturday night with sustained winds of up to 195 kilometers (125 miles) per hour and gusts of up to 240 kph (149 mph). The country’s weather agency warned of a 'potentially catastrophic and life-threatening situation' in provinces along its path. There were no immediate reports of casualties from the typhoon, which was forecast to blow northwestward on Sunday across northern Luzon, the archipelago's most populous region. The capital region of metropolitan Manila would likely be spared from a direct hit but was placed, along with outlying regions, under storm alerts and warned of dangerous coastal storm surges. 'The rain was minimal, but the wind was very strong and had this eerie howling sound,' Roberto Monterola, a disaster-mitigation officer in Catanduanes, told The Associated Press by telephone. 'Along a main boulevard here, the tidal surges went up to more than 7 meters (23 feet) near the seaside houses. It looked really scary.' The entire province of Catanduanes had no power after the typhoon knocked down trees and electricity posts, and disaster-response teams were checking how many more houses were damaged in addition to those impacted by previous storms, he said. 'We need tin roofs and other construction materials, aside from food. Villagers tell us here that they still haven’t gotten up from the past storm and were pinned down again by this typhoon,' Monterola said. Nearly half of the island province’s 80,000 people were sheltering in evacuation centers. Catanduanes officials were so concerned as the typhoon approached that they threatened vulnerable villagers with arrest if they did not follow orders to evacuate to safer grounds. More than 750,000 people took refuge in emergency shelters, including churches and a shopping mall, due to Man-yi and two previous storms mostly in the northern Philippines, Assistant Secretary Cesar Idio of the Official of Civil Defense and other provincial officials said. The rare number of back-to-back storms and typhoons that lashed Luzon in just three weeks left more than 160 people dead, affected 9 million people and caused such extensive damage to residential communities, infrastructure and farmlands that the Philippines may have to import more rice, a staple food for most Filipinos. In an emergency meeting as Man-yi approached, President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. asked his Cabinet and provincial officials to brace for 'the worst-case scenario.' At least 26 domestic airports and two international airports were briefly shut and inter-island ferry and cargo services were suspended due to rough seas, stranding thousands of passengers and commuters, according to the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippine and the coast guard. The United States, Manila’s treaty ally, along with Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia and Brunei provided cargo aircraft and other storm aid to augment the government’s overwhelmed disaster-response agencies. Last month, the first major storm, Trami, left scores of people dead after dumping one to two months’ worth of rain in just 24 hours in several towns. The Philippines is battered by about 20 typhoons and storms each year. It’s often hit by earthquakes and has more than a dozen active volcanoes, making it one of the world’s most disaster-prone countries.	https://apnews.com/article/philippines-typhoon-manyi-520b17b3c2b0ccfd33c7421f65ba177d	2024-11-16T19:00:27-08:00	
Bela Karolyi, who trained Olympic champion gymnasts and was affected by Nassar scandal, dies at 82	Bela Karolyi, the charismatic if polarizing gymnastics coach who turned young women into champions and the United States into an international power in the sport, has died. He was 82. USA Gymnastics said Karolyi died Friday. No cause of death was given. Karolyi and wife Martha trained multiple Olympic gold medalists and world champions in the U.S. and Romania, including Nadia Comaneci and Mary Lou Retton. 'A big impact and influence on my life,' Comaneci, who was just 14 when Karolyi coached her to gold for Romania at the 1976 Montreal Olympics, posted on Instagram. Yet Karolyi's strident methods sometimes came under fire, most pointedly during the height of the Larry Nassar scandal. When the disgraced former USA Gymnastics team doctor was effectively given a life sentence after pleading guilty to sexually assaulting gymnasts and other athletes with his hands under the guise of medical treatment, over a dozen former gymnasts came forward saying the Karolyis were part of a system that created an oppressive culture that allowed Nassar’s behavior to run unchecked for years. While the Karolyis denied responsibility — telling CNN in 2018 they were unaware of Nassar's behavior — the revelations led to them receding from the spotlight. USA Gymnastics eventually exited an agreement to continue to train at the Karolyi Ranch north of Houston, though only after American star Simone Biles took the organization to task for having them train at a site where many experienced sexual abuse. The Karolyis receded from the spotlight in the aftermath after spending 30-plus years as a guiding force in American gymnastics, often basking in success while brushing with controversy in equal measure. The Karolyis defected from Romania to the United States in 1981. Three years later Bela helped guide Retton — all of 16 — to the Olympic all-around title at the 1984 Games in Los Angeles. At the 1996 Games in Atlanta, he memorably helped an injured Kerri Strug off the floor after Strug's vault secured the team gold for the Americans. Karolyi briefly became the national team coordinator for USA Gymnastics women's elite program in 1999 and incorporated a semi-centralized system that eventually turned the Americans into the sport's gold standard. It did not come without a cost. He was removed from the position after the 2000 Olympics when it became apparent his leadership style simply would not work, though he remained around the sport after Martha took over for her husband in 2001. While the Karolyis approach helped the U.S. become a superpower — an American woman has won each of the last six Olympic titles and the U.S. women earned the team gold at the 2012 and 2016 games under Martha Karolyi's leadership — their methods came under fire. Dominique Moceanu, part of the 'Magnificent 7' team that won gold in Atlanta, talked extensively about her corrosive relationship with the Karolyis following her retirement. In her 2012 memoir, Moceanu wrote Bela Karolyi verbally abused her in front of her teammates on multiple occasions. 'His harsh words and critical demeanor often weighed heavily on me,' Moceanu posted on X Saturday. 'While our relationship was fraught with difficulty, some of these moments of hardship helped me forge and define my own path.' Some of Karolyi's most famous students were always among his staunchest defenders. When Strug got married, she and Karolyi took a photo recreating their famous scene from the 1996 Olympics, when he carried her onto the medals podium after she vaulted on a badly sprained ankle. Being a gymnastics pied-piper was never Karolyi’s intent. Born in Clug, Hungary (now Romania) on Sept. 13, 1942, he wanted to be a teacher, getting into coaching in college simply so he could spend more time with Martha. After graduating, the couple moved to a small coal-mining town in Transylvania. Looking for a way to keep their students warm and entertained during the long, harsh winters, Karolyi dragged out some old mats and he and his wife taught the children gymnastics. The students showed off their skills to their parents, and the exhibitions soon caught the eye of the Romanian government, which hired the Karolyis to coach the women’s national team at a time when the sport was done almost exclusively by adult women, not young girls. Karolyi changed all that, though, bringing a team to the Montreal Olympics with only one gymnast older than 14. It was in Montreal, of course, where the world got its first real glimpse of Karolyi. When a solemn, dark-haired sprite named Nadia Comaneci enchanted the world with the first perfect 10 in Olympic history, a feat she would duplicate six times, Karolyi was there to wrap her in one of his trademark bear hugs. Romania, which had won only three bronzes in Olympic gymnastics before 1976, left Montreal with seven medals, including Comaneci’s golds in the all-around, balance beam and uneven bars, and the team silver. Comaneci became an international sensation, the first person to appear on the covers of Sports Illustrated, Time and Newsweek in the same week. Four years later, however, Karolyi was in disgrace. He was incensed by the judging at the Moscow Olympics, which he thought cost Comaneci a second all-around gold, and the Romanian government was horrified that he had embarrassed the Soviet hosts. 'Suddenly, from a position where we’ve been praised and considered the foremost athletes in the country, I was stigmatized,' he once said. 'I thought they could put me away for political misconduct.' When he and Martha took the Romanian team to New York for an exhibition in March 1981, they were tipped off that they were going to be punished upon their return. Despite not speaking any English and with their then-6-year-old daughter, Andrea, still in Romania, they decided to defect. 'We knew what kind of risks we were taking, because nobody was guaranteeing us anything,' Martha Karolyi once said. 'We started out with a suitcase and a little motel room. From there, it’s gradually improved.' The couple made their way to California, where they learned English by watching television and Bela did odd jobs. A chance encounter with Olympic gold medalist Bart Conner — who would later marry Comaneci — at the Los Angeles airport a few months later led to the Karolyis’ first coaching job in the United States. Within a year, their daughter had arrived in the U.S. and the Karolyis had their own gym in Houston. It soon became the center of American gymnastics, turning out eight national champions in 13 years. Three years after the Karolyis left Romania, Retton became the first American to win the Olympic all-around title, scoring a perfect 10 on vault to claim gold at the 1984 Games in Los Angeles. Retton also posted the highest score in the team competition as the Americans won the silver, their first team medal since 1948. Four years later, Phoebe Mills, another Karolyi gymnast, won a bronze on balance beam. It was the first individual medal for an American woman at a non-boycotted games. And in 1991, Kim Zmeskal — 'the little Kimbo,' as Bela Karolyi called her — became the first American to win the world all-around title. 'My biggest contribution was giving the kids the faith that they can be the best among the best,' Karolyi once said. 'I knew that if the Americans could understand they were not inferior ... then they can be groomed like international, highly visible athletes.' But as Karolyi’s resume grew, so did the criticism. Other coaches were irritated by his brash personality and ability to always find his way into the spotlight. When Retton won gold, Karolyi leaped a barrier — he had an equipment manager’s credential, not a coach’s — so he could scoop Retton up in a hug — right in front of the TV cameras, of course. He could be a harsh taskmaster, calling his gymnasts names, taunting them for their weight and pushing them to their limits. Even those warm embraces weren’t always quite what they seemed. 'A lot of those big bear hugs came with the whisper of `Not so good,’ in our ears,' Retton wrote. Yet Retton and Comaneci remained close with Karolyi, making appearances with him at gymnastics events or sitting with him at competitions. Zmeskal had her wedding at the Karolyi ranch. Karolyi briefly retired after the 1992 Games in Barcelona, where he led the Americans to their first team medal, a bronze, at a non-boycotted Olympics in 44 years. But he kept his gym and summer camps, and by 1994 was again coaching elite-level gymnasts after Zmeskal asked him to help in her attempt to make the Atlanta Games. Zmeskal didn’t make the Atlanta squad. But two of Karolyi’s other gymnasts, Strug and Moceanu, did, and it was Strug who provided one of the signature moments of the Olympics. The Americans went into their final event in team finals, vault, trying to hold off Russia for their first-ever title at an Olympics or world championships. Despite injuring her left ankle when she fell on her first vault attempt, Strug went ahead with her second attempt, believing — wrongly — the Americans needed her score to clinch the gold. With Karolyi shouting, 'You can do it!' Strug sprinted down the runway, soared high above the vault and landed on both feet — ensuring it was a clean vault — before pulling her left leg up. After saluting the judges, she fell to her knees and had to be carried off the podium. Tests would later show she had two torn ligaments in her ankle. As the rest of the Americans gathered on the podium to receive their gold medals, Karolyi carried Strug back into the arena, cradling her in his arms. But even that drew criticism. Many said Karolyi never should have encouraged Strug to vault on her injured ankle in the first place, and then should have stayed out of the spotlight rather than carrying her to the podium. 'Bela is a very tough coach and he gets criticism for that,' Strug said at the time. 'But that’s what it takes to become a champion. I don’t think it’s really right that everyone tries to find the faults of Bela. Anything in life, to be successful, you’ve got to work really hard.' The Karolyis retired again after the Atlanta Olympics. But after the U.S. women finished last in the medal round at the 1997 world championships, USA Gymnastics asked Bela Karolyi to come back. He agreed — but only if he could implement a semi-centralized training system. Rather than a patchwork system of individual coaches who had their own philosophies, Karolyi would oversee the entire U.S. program. Gymnasts could still train with their own coaches, but there would be regular national team camps to ensure they were meeting established training and performance standards. Though the idea was sound, Karolyi was not the right person to be in charge. Coaches who had been his equal chafed at his heavy-handedness, and were annoyed by his grandstanding. Gymnasts resented his bluster and demands. By the time the Americans left the Sydney Olympics, about the only thing everyone agreed on was that Karolyi needed to step away. He stepped aside and was replaced by his wife. Martha Karolyi’s standards were just as high — if not higher — than her husband’s, but on the surface, she was more willing to listen to other opinions. 'She’s more diplomatic. Absolutely,' Bela Karolyi said before the 2012 Olympics. 'I’m wild. The opposite.' ___ AP sports: https://apnews.com/sports	https://apnews.com/article/bela-karolyi-gymnastics-olympics-obituary-751cc725b57045bd9125132f1cbc1982	2024-11-16T16:03:12-08:00	
APEC closes in Peru with China's President Xi front and center as Trump whiplash looms	LIMA, Peru (AP) — After two days of meetings in Lima that rarely ventured beyond platitudes in discussing the strategies of robust economic engagement, the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum wrapped up Saturday with a spirit of detente that many fear the annual summit may not see again for the next four years. The 21 leaders from economies bordering the Pacific, including U.S. President Joe Biden, Chinese President Xi Jinping and Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, descended on Peru this week at a time when America’s incoming president, Donald Trump, has vowed to withdraw the U.S. from its leadership of a global free trade agenda. Few could help noting that Biden's late entrance to the traditional APEC family photo Saturday lent itself to political metaphor, as the rest of the leaders took their place on the risers before looking around to find Biden missing. They tittered for five awkward minutes before a seemingly dazed Biden arrived and took the stage in the far back corner. Chinese President Xi, who draped himself in the banner of globalization this week inaugurating a massive $1.3 billion megaport in Peru and using his speeches to reject protectionism, scored the best spot onstage for the photo, front and center. The leaders all wore bark-hued wool scarves from Peru — in the APEC tradition of posing in some garb representative of the host country. Biden left the stage as reporters shouted questions, asking for a response to this being his last APEC summit, and one of his last major global events as U.S. president. Much of the conversation about APEC this year centers on the heightened trade and security rivalry between the U.S. and China. Biden and Xi will sit down later Saturday for their third and final meeting of Biden's tenure. They last met a year ago, at APEC in California.	https://apnews.com/article/peru-apec-biden-xi-china-trump-trade-c9883061b53ab82f5630a3bd6fcf87fa	2024-11-16T11:41:08-08:00	
At least 13 people killed and more kidnapped by extremist rebels in eastern Congo	KINSHASA, Congo (AP) — At least 13 people were killed and others kidnapped in eastern Congo by extremist rebels linked to the Islamic State group, local authorities said Saturday. Rebels with the Allied Democratic Forces, which has ties to IS, killed civilians in Mabisio village in North Kivu province, said the area's administrator, Col. Alain Kiwewa, on state television. Women were among those killed in the attack late Friday evening, and houses were burned and looted, he said. Eastern Congo has struggled with armed violence for decades as more than 120 groups fight for power, land and valuable mineral resources, while others try to defend their communities. Some armed groups have been accused of mass killings. In recent years, ADF attacks have intensified and spread towards Goma, eastern Congo’s main city, as well as neighboring Ituri province. Rights groups and the United Nations have accused the ADF of killing hundreds of people and abducting even more, including a significant number of children. In August, the ADF killed at least 12 people in several villages in North Kivu.	https://apnews.com/article/islamic-stage-congo-killings-kivu-adf-goma-d054dc1c3a0b43d1439ba83b4075a127	2024-11-16T10:12:45-08:00	
Venezuela releases from prison some of the thousands detained after presidential election	CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) — Non-governmental organizations in Venezuela on Saturday announced the release from prison of some of the thousands of people who were detained during and after the deadly anti-government protests that followed the July presidential election, whose results remain under dispute. Their release happened a day after the attorney general, who is loyal to the ruling party, announced the review of 225 cases linked to the aftermath of the election, which President Nicolás Maduro and opposition candidate Edmundo González both claim to have won. The Venezuelan-based organizations Penal Forum and Venezuelan Prison Observatory announced the prison releases on X, but it was not immediately clear the exact number of people who were freed. The latter organization said the release came with certain conditions, which it did not explain further. Images shared on social media by the Observatory show women tearfully hugging loved ones outside a prison in the South American country. The organization described the releases as a 'victory' and demanded that all who remain in prison for their roles in the election and activities in its aftermath be freed. Maduro’s government has come under heavy criticism for the election’s lack of transparency and the repression unleashed in its aftermath, including the arrests of political leaders, lawyers, poll workers, election volunteers and protesters, both minors and adults. The protests erupted after Venezuela’s electoral authorities declared Maduro had won the July 28 contest and alleged they could not publish precinct-level results because their website had been hacked. At the same time, the main opposition coalition announced it had secured vote tally sheets from more than 80% of the electronic voting machines used across the country, published them online and declared that its candidate, González, had defeated Maduro by a landslide. The government’s arrest tally included about 2,400 people. Government officials, including Attorney General Tarek William Saab, have strongly defended the detentions, but earlier this week, Maduro called on Saab and judges to ensure 'justice' in the event that a case 'needs to be rectified and reviewed.'	https://apnews.com/article/venezuela-election-maduro-gonzalez-arrests-protests-release-815e8b91cb1ec76268c8b1da81f90b2f	2024-11-16T09:47:43-08:00	
Eight killed and 17 injured after knife attack at a vocational school in China	BEIJING (AP) — Eight people were killed and 17 others injured after a stabbing attack at a vocational school in the eastern Chinese city of Wuxi on Saturday night, local police said. The attack occurred at the Wuxi Vocational Institute of Arts and Technology in Yixing, a smaller city within Wuxi, at around 18:30 local time on Saturday, the Yixing police said in a statement. The suspect, a 21-year old male student surnamed Xu, was detained on site. Police said Wu had failed his examinations and could not graduate, and that he was dissatisfied about his pay at an internship. He decided to vent his frustrations via the attack, the statement said. Videos circulating on social media showed injured people lying on the street after the attack while others rushed to help. This is the second deadly attack within a week after a man drove his car into people at a sports facility in the southern city of Zhuhai, leaving 35 people dead and injured 43 others. China has seen a number of attacks in which suspects appear to target members of the public at random. In October, a man was detained after he allegedly attacked children with a knife at a school in Beijing. Five people were wounded. In September, three people were killed in a knife attack in a Shanghai supermarket, and 15 others were injured. Police said at the time that the suspect had personal financial disputes and came to Shanghai to 'vent his anger.' The same month, a Japanese schoolboy died after being stabbed on his way to school in the southern city of Shenzhen.	https://apnews.com/article/china-knife-attack-yixing-stabbing-school-xu-1cb98b756a2d638f68c1a04bb477e192	2024-11-16T09:36:31-08:00	
Former Greek premier Samaras is expelled from the ruling conservative party	ATHENS, GREECE (AP) — Former Greek Prime Minister and lawmaker Antonis Samaras was expelled from the ruling New Democracy party over his persistent criticism of government policies. Samaras, 73, a hard-line nationalist, has criticized Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis’ approach to negotiations with Turkey, which he has likened to appeasement. He also strongly disapproved of government policy that he considered too 'centrist' or 'woke,' especially the decision to legislate in favor of same-sex marriage earlier this year. The government appeared particularly irked by a Samaras interview to be published in Sunday newspaper To Vima in which he called for the ouster of Foreign Minister George Gerapetritis over his conduct of negotiations with Turkey. 'Mr. Samaras ... did not just express opinions. He expressed his complete disagreement with all governing policies. Moreover, he adopted extreme lies (about the foreign minister) in an unbecoming and provocative manner,' said government spokesman Pavlos Marinakis in announcing Samaras’ expulsion Saturday afternoon. Samaras responded in a lengthy statement, saying, 'Arrogance and loss of nerve explain Mitsotakis' move. Cut off from the party base, he is leading a party that scarcely resembles New Democracy.' It is not the first time that Samaras has clashed with a Mitsotakis. In 1992, then-Prime Minister Constantine Mitsotakis, father of the current premier, dismissed Samaras as foreign minister over policy differences regarding the name dispute with what was then the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, the present North Macedonia. In 1993, Samaras and a few like-minded lawmakers left New Democracy, bringing down the Mitsotakis government and ushering in more than 10 years of socialist rule. Samaras founded his own short-lived party, Political Spring. Samaras succeeded former Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis as head of the conservatives in 2009, but left the post after an electoral defeat in 2015. 'This time, history will not repeat itself. The government majority continues its course, without Mr. Samaras,' said the governent spokesman. 'No one has the right to mess with the country’s stability in these troubled times,' said Marinakis. The ruling conservatives have a slight majority in Parliament, with 155 lawmakers out of 300. But Samaras has a number of supporters among that group, as does the now retired Karamanlis. In the interview, Samaras proposed Karamanlis should replace President Katerina Sakellaropoulou, a left-of-center former judge whose five-year term ends in early 2025. She had been elected by Parliament with Mitsotakis' backing.	https://apnews.com/article/greece-samaras-mitsotakis-new-democracy-a134c64c80a7aa8f5e0c0e9b13c0e35f	2024-11-16T08:03:36-08:00	
Tropical Storm Sara drenches Honduras’ northern coast with flash flooding and mudslides in forecast	SAN PEDRO SULA, Honduras (AP) — Tropical Storm Sara stalled over Honduras on Saturday, drenching the northern coast of the Central American nation, swelling rivers and trapping some people at home. Sustained rain fell overnight and continued into the morning in the city of San Pedro Sula, where the storm cut off access to an entire community when a river crossing washed away. And through the weekend, the region could see life-threatening flash flooding and mudslides, according to the Miami-based National Hurricane Center. The weather system made landfall late Thursday about 105 miles (165 kilometers) west-northwest of Cabo Gracias a Dios, on the Honduras-Nicaragua border. The Hurricane Center expects the storm will move near the Bay Islands of Honduras on Saturday before approaching Belize. Sara is then expected to turn northwesterly toward Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula, though forecasters said it probably will not reemerge into the Gulf after crossing the Yucatan. Rain-soaked residents were on edge Saturday as the conditions brought back memories of the disastrous November 2020 hurricane season, when two powerful storms passed through the region, displacing hundreds of thousands of people and causing widespread damage. Standing on a riverbank, Carlos Canelas, 48, acknowledged many residents like his mother had ignored official warnings to evacuate the Flor de Cuba neighborhood of San Pedro Sula. By Saturday morning, the 77-year-old woman was cut off from the rest of the city because the river crossing collapsed and remained home with her 35-year-old special-needs son. 'That is why I did not go to work, but there is little or nothing I can do,' he said. 'I can cross the river swimming, but how do I get my mother out? The storm, however, did not stop a CONCACAF Nations League soccer match Friday in San Pedro Sula. Under heavy rain, Mexico lost 2-0 to Honduras. In November 2020, Eta and Iota passed through Honduras after initially making landfall in Nicaragua as powerful Category 4 hurricanes. Northern Honduras caught the worst of the storms with torrential rains that set off flooding that displaced hundreds of thousands. Eta alone was responsible for as much as 30 inches (76 cm) of rain along the northern coast. ___ Associated Press writer Regina Garcia Cano contributed to this report from Mexico City.	https://apnews.com/article/tropical-storm-sara-honduras-flooding-hurricane-belize-39901b2082d735751607cdd186afdf01	2024-11-16T06:45:08-08:00	
Israeli troops reach deepest point in Lebanon since Oct. 1 invasion, Lebanese media say	BEIRUT (AP) — Israeli ground forces reached their deepest point in Lebanon since they invaded six weeks ago, before pulling back early Saturday after fierce battles with Hezbollah militants, Lebanese state media reported. Israeli troops captured a strategic hill in the southern Lebanese village of Chamaa, about 5 kilometers (3 miles) from the Israeli border early Saturday, the state-run National News Agency reported. It said Israeli troops were later pushed back from the hill. It added that Israeli troops detonated the Shrine of Shimon the Prophet in Chamaa as well as several homes before they withdrew, but the claim could not be immediately verified. Israel's military said in a statement that its troops 'continue their limited, localized, and targeted operational activity in southern Lebanon.' The military did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the Lebanese media reports. The push on the ground came as Israeli warplanes pounded Beirut’s southern suburbs as well as several other areas in southern Lebanon including the port city of Tyre. The morning strike in Beirut hit an area known as Dahiyeh, which the Israeli military called a Hezbollah stronghold, saying its planes had hit multiple sites used by the militant group. Residents were given advance warning by Israel, and it was not immediately clear whether there were any casualties. The increase of violence came as Lebanese and Hezbollah officials are studying a draft proposal presented by the U.S. earlier this week on ending the war. Since late September, Israel dramatically escalated its bombardment of Lebanon, vowing to cripple Hezbollah and end its barrages in Israel. More than 3,400 people have been killed in Lebanon by Israeli fire — 80% of them in the eight weeks — according to Lebanon’s Health Ministry. On Friday, Lebanon’s caretaker prime minister apparently urged Iran to try and convince Hezbollah to agree to a cease-fire deal with Israel, which would require the group to pull back from the Israel-Lebanon border. The proposal is based on U.N. Security Council resolution 1701, which ended the last Israel-Hezbollah war in the summer of 2006. A copy of the draft proposal was handed over earlier this week by the U.S. ambassador to Lebanon to Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri, who has been negotiating on behalf of Hezbollah, according to a Lebanese official. The official who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak about the secret talks said Berri is expected to give Lebanon’s response on Monday. Another Lebanese politician said Hezbollah officials had received the draft, were studying it and would express their opinion on it to Berri. The politician also spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media about the ongoing talks. Berri told the pan-Arab Asharq Al-Awsat daily newspaper that the draft does not include any item that allows Israel to act in Lebanon if the deal is violated. 'We will not accept any infringement of our sovereignty,' Berri was quoted as saying. He added that one of the items mentioned in the draft that Lebanon does not accept is the proposal to form a committee to supervise the agreement that includes members from Western countries. Berri added that talks are ongoing regarding this point as well as other details in the draft, adding that 'the atmosphere is positive but all relies on how things will end.' There is also a push to end the war between Israel and Hamas, which began after Palestinian militants stormed into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing about 1,200 people — mostly civilians — and abducting 250 others. The U.N. Security Council’s 10 elected members on Thursday circulated a draft resolution demanding 'an immediate, unconditional and permanent cease-fire' in Gaza. The U.S., Israel’s closest ally, holds the key to whether the U.N. Security Council adopts the resolution. The four other permanent members — Russia, China, Britain and France — are expected to support it or abstain. The Health Ministry in Gaza said Saturday that in the past 24 hours another 35 people had been killed in Israeli strikes, bringing the overall death total to 43,799. The ministry does not distinguish between civilians and combatants but it has said more than half of those killed have been women and children. _____ Associated Press writer David Rising in Bangkok contributed to this report. ___ Follow AP’s war coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hezbollah-lebanon-iran-ceasefire-beirut-41d19e05cebf73a66dc320ccad047d4d	2024-11-16T03:06:32-08:00	
Georgia election chief doused in paint as protests continue after divisive parliamentary vote	TBILISI, Georgia (AP) — The head of Georgia’s Central Electoral Commission was doused with black paint Saturday at a meeting to confirm the results of the country’s divisive Oct. 26 parliamentary elections. Protesters gathered outside the commission's building in Tbilisi, where officials announced that the ruling Georgian Dream party had won 53.93% of the vote. Opposition supporters have rejected the results amid allegations that the vote was rigged, an accusation that Georgian Dream denies. The Saturday session was interrupted when David Kirtadze, a commission member from the opposition United National Movement party, threw black paint at commission chairman Giorgi Kalandarishvili. Before the incident, Kirtadze told Kalandarishvili that the official results of the vote did not reflect voters’ 'true choice.' Kalandarishvili responded by saying that the use of 'pressure, bullying and personal insults' proved that there was no evidence of vote rigging. When the meeting resumed, Kalandarishvili was seen with a bandaged eye. 'It once again becomes evident that there is no tangible proof indicating that the elections were manipulated,' he told the audience. European election observers have described the Georgian parliamentary elections as taking place in a 'divisive' atmosphere marked by instances of bribery, double voting and physical violence. Many Georgians viewed the vote as a pivotal referendum on the country’s effort to join the European Union. The bloc suspended Georgia’s membership application process indefinitely in June after the country’s parliament passed a 'foreign influence law' that critics say mimics Moscow’s crackdown on civil society. Critics have accused the ruling Georgian Dream, established by Bidzina Ivanishvili, a shadowy billionaire who made his fortune in Russia, of becoming increasingly authoritarian and tilted toward Moscow. It has recently adopted laws similar to those used by the Kremlin to crack down on freedom of speech and LGBTQ+ rights. President Salome Zourabichvili, who has rejected the official results, says Georgia has fallen victim to pressure from Moscow against joining the European Union. Zourabichvili, who holds a mostly ceremonial position, has urged the United States and EU to support the demonstrations. Officials in Washington and Brussels have urged a full investigation of the election, while the Kremlin has rejected the accusations of interference.	https://apnews.com/article/georgia-parlimentary-elections-protest-central-electoral-committee-paint-732670469f47bf9c541ca6bf3c9b7bf1	2024-11-16T02:36:14-08:00	
Some exult, others worry: Reactions to Trump's victory are mixed on NATO's eastern flank	WARSAW, Poland (AP) — Conservative lawmakers in the Polish parliament exulted at Donald Trump's victory, standing and applauding while they chanted his name. The prospect of a second Trump term has excited people on the populist right across Central Europe who share his anti-immigrant views and contempt for international organizations. But many others in a region near the war in Ukraine are afraid. They worry Trump could abandon Ukraine and force Kyiv into a deal that ends up emboldening Russia further, or unwind the U.S. military presence in Europe. The change in Washington means Europe will have to invest more in its security and defense rather than relying on the American protective shield as it has done for decades, argues Michał Baranowski, managing director of Warsaw-based GMF East, part of the German Marshall Fund think tank. 'We Europeans — Poles and French and Brits and preferably Germany as well — need to step up,' Baranowski said. 'Only by stepping up do we have a chance to keep the worst case scenarios from happening, both a bad deal in Ukraine and perhaps a lowering of U.S. engagement in Europe.' Poland, the Baltic states and other nations across Central and Eastern Europe were under Moscow's control during the Cold War. When that era ended in 1989, it freed them to turn to the West. They never want to return to being satellites of Moscow. NATO members now, they worry that Trump in his second term could end a decades-long commitment to securing the peace in Europe. Just this week, a missile defense base in northern Poland was inaugurated — the fruit of years of planning by Republican and Democratic administrations. Polish officials expressed hopes that it was a sign that a bipartisan U.S. commitment to the region would endure. 'The whole world will see clearly that this is not Russia’s sphere of interest anymore,' Polish President Andrzej Duda declared. Trump has a long history of denigrating NATO, and former administration officials say he repeatedly threatened to withdraw the U.S. from the alliance. His allies have described that as bluster or tough negotiating tactics that have pushed other European allies to take more responsibility, and argue that Trump didn't abandon NATO. The change in Washington has in just a few days changed the dynamic of Poland’s presidential campaign before an election next spring. Foreign Minister Radek Sikorski, a former defense minister with ties in Washington, entered the running to be the candidate for centrist Prime Minister Donald Tusk’s party, challenging the longtime favorite, Warsaw Mayor Rafał Trzaskowski. Sikorski argues that his experience makes him the better choice for the times. His opponents argue that the anti-Trump views of his wife, the American writer Anne Applebaum, could create complications with Trump’s upcoming administration. The region is now holding its collective breath to see what a second Trump presidency will bring. Officials in Poland and the Baltic states have been stressing their high defense spending — relative to their overall economic output — in their congratulatory messages to Trump. Kersti Kaljulaid, who was Estonia's president during Trump's first term, told the Estonian public broadcaster ERR that Estonians, Poles and others in Eastern Europe found ways to reach Trump before, 'and I think that this skill is something that we still have today.' All are now watching to see if Trump will make a deal with Russia to end the war in Ukraine, as he has promised. It is a cause of existential importance, because any deal is expected to shape security in the region in profound ways in the years and decades to come. The biggest fear would be a deal that gives Russia significant Ukrainian territory, rewarding President Vladimir Putin's violation of international law and allowing Moscow to rebuild its military strength. Poland's Tusk has stressed that no deal should be made over the heads of Ukraine and countries in the region that will be affected. 'There is no doubt that the new political landscape is a serious challenge for everyone,' Tusk said last week. Tusk congratulated Trump last week and is striking a conciliatory tone after having been critical in the past of a position seen by most Poles as overly friendly to Putin. Duda, a conservative who has long admired Trump, said Wednesday that he doesn't believe that Trump would abandon Ukraine after U.S. taxpayers have already invested huge amounts in Ukraine's defense. Trump is a 'winner,' Duda said. 'I cannot imagine that he would allow Russia to destroy Ukraine.' Trump's win energized Poles at an Independence Day march on Monday organized by nationalist groups that drew tens of thousands of participants. Some there believed Trump's friendly stance toward Russia could help end the war in Ukraine. 'If he’s pro-Russian and that means peace in the world, I think it’s OK,' said Adrian Golik, a 23-year-old university student who joined the march with his brother and parents. All have dual Polish-U.S. citizenship and cast their votes for Trump in Illinois. The leaders of Hungary and Slovakia — both seen as friendly to Trump and Putin — believe Ukraine has already lost the fight and shouldn't keep getting Western military aid. Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico, who although a leftist is known for his pro-Russian and anti-American views, welcomed Trump’s victory as 'a defeat of liberal and progressivist ideas.' Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán has called Trump 'the man of peace,' and last week predicted that the incoming administration would cease U.S. support for Ukraine as it fights Russia’s full-scale invasion. 'One of the key messages of this election is that Europe needs to grow up geopolitically and do it quickly, and that the era of security outsourcing is over,' said Baranowski, the analyst. 'The stakes are very high — Europe can have influence if we pull it together and if we step up.' ___ Justin Spike in Budapest, Hungary, Jari Tanner in Helsinki, Finland, and Karel Janicek in Prague contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/us-trump-poland-russia-b39772e4ca42d84878dbf717b830e11b	2024-11-16T01:14:08-08:00	
Japan's minister visits Ukraine to stress mutual concern over North Korean troops	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Japan's foreign minister arrived in Kyiv on Saturday to discuss North Korea’s deepening military alliance with Russia, including the deployment of thousands of troops to support Moscow's war in Ukraine. Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya will meet his Ukrainian counterpart, Andrii Sybiha, to reaffirm Japan’s 'strong support' for Ukraine against Russia’s invasion and to discuss further sanctions against Moscow, Japan's Foreign Ministry said. High on the agenda was Tokyo’s 'grave concern' over growing military cooperation between North Korea and Russia, the ministry said. According to U.S., South Korean and Ukrainian intelligence assessments, up to 12,000 North Korean troops have been sent to Russia as part of a major defense treaty between the countries. Last week, Ukrainian officials said Ukraine and North Korean troops engaged in small-scale fighting while Ukraine’s army fired artillery at North Korean soldiers in Russia’s Kursk border region, where Ukraine launched a surprise push on Aug. 6. The agreement requires both countries to use all available means to provide immediate military assistance if either is attacked. Russia strikes Kyiv in a wave of drone attacks Iwaya’s visit comes after the Ukrainian capital was attacked overnight by Russian drones, damaging residential buildings and infrastructure in Kyiv’s Obolon district. No casualties were reported. Ukrainian air defenses neutralized up to a dozen drones, said the head of Kyiv’s military administration, Serhii Popko. Russia attacked Ukraine with 83 Shahed drones in the early hours of Saturday morning, the Ukrainian air force reported. Of those, 55 were shot down, while another 30 veered off course or were lost after electronic jamming, it said. Meanwhile, Russia’s Ministry of Defense said that it had destroyed 35 Ukrainian drones, including 20 over the western Kursk region and 11 over the Bryansk region. ___ Associated Press writers Mari Yamaguchi in Tokyo and Katie Marie Davies in Manchester, England, contributed to this report. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-japan-drones-cc0940413955683f3ba5d80eaf4431fa	2024-11-16T01:04:45-08:00	
Protesters gather at UN climate talks in global day of action as progress on a deal slows	BAKU, Azerbaijan (AP) — Hundreds of activists formed a human chain outside one of the main plenary halls at the United Nations climate summit on what is traditionally their biggest protest day during the two-week talks. The demonstration in Baku, Azerbaijan will be echoed at sites around the world in a global 'day of action' for climate justice that's become an annual event. Activists waved flags, snapped their fingers, and hummed and mumbled chants in a silent protest, with many covering their mouths with the word 'Silenced.' Demonstrators held up signs calling for more money to be pledged for climate finance, which involves cash for transitioning to clean energy and adapting to climate change. It comes as negotiators at the venue try to hammer out a deal for exactly that — but progress has been slow and observers say the direction of any agreement is still unclear. Tired but inspired, activists vow to ‘keep fighting’ Lidy Nacpil said protestors like her are 'not surprised' about how negotiations are going. But past wins — like a loss and damage fund that gives developing nations cash after extreme weather events exacerbated by climate change — keep organizers going, said Nacpil, a coordinator with the Asian Peoples’ Movement on Debt and Development. 'The role we play is to increase the pressure,' she said of the action. 'We know we’re not going to get the results that the world needs in this round of negotiations, but at least to bring us many steps closer is our hope, is our aim.' She added: 'I think we have no option but to keep fighting ... It’s the instinctive response that anyone, any living being, living creatures will have, which is to fight for life and fight for survival.' Tasneem Essop said she was inspired by the action, which was challenging to organize. 'To be able to pull off something where people feel their own power, exercise their own power and get inspired in this creative way, I’m super excited about this,' she said. Essop says she’s 'not very' optimistic about an outcome on finance, but knows next week will be pivotal. 'We can’t end up with a bad deal for the peoples of the world, those who are already suffering the impacts of climate change, those who need to adapt to an increasing and escalating crisis,' she said. 'We fight until the end.' On a deal for climate cash, there's not much progress Negotiators at COP29, as the talks are known, are working on a deal that might be worth hundreds of billions of dollars to poorer nations. Many are in the Global South and already suffering the costly impacts of weather disasters fueled by climate change. Several experts have said $1 trillion a year or more is needed both to compensate for such damages and to pay for a clean-energy transition that most countries can't afford on their own. Samir Bejanov, deputy lead negotiator of this year's climate talks said in a press conference that the climate finance talks were moving too slowly. 'I want to repeat our strong encouragement to all parties to make as much progress as possible,' he said. 'We need everyone to approach the task with urgency and determination.' Observers were also disappointed at the pace of progress. 'This has been the worst first week of a COP in my 15 years of attending this summit,' said Mohamed Adow, of climate think tank Power Shift Africa. 'There’s no clarity on the climate finance goal, the quality of the finance or how it’s going to be made accessible to vulnerable countries.' 'I sense a lot of frustration, especially among the developing country blocks here,' he said. Panama environment minister Juan Carlos Navarro agreed, telling The Associated Press he is 'not encouraged' by what he’s seeing at COP29 so far. 'What I see is a lot of talk and very little action,' he said, noting that Panama is among the group of countries least responsible for warming emissions but most vulnerable to the damage caused by climate change-fueled disasters. 'We must face these challenges with a true sense of urgency and sincerity,' he said. 'We are dragging our feet as a planet.' ___ Associated Press writer Dorany Pineda in Los Angeles contributed. ___ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

The family of Israeli-American hostage pleads with Biden and Trump to bring hostages home	TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Over the past two weeks, the political landscape around the negotiations for a cease-fire in Gaza have undergone a dramatic transformation. The American elections, the firing of Israel’s popular defense minister, Qatar’s decision to suspend its mediation, and the ongoing war in Lebanon all seem to have pushed the possibility for a cease-fire in Gaza further away than it has been in more than a year of conflict. Still, some families of the dozens of hostages who remain captive in Gaza are desperately hoping the changes will reignite momentum to bring their loved ones home — though the impact of Donald Trump returning to the White House and a hard-line new defense minister in Israel remains unknown. 'I think maybe there is new hope,' said Varda Ben Baruch, the grandmother of Israeli-American hostage Edan Alexander, 20, a soldier kidnapped from his base on the Gaza border during the Hamas attack on Oct. 7, 2023. Alexander’s parents, Adi and Yael Alexander, who live in New Jersey, met this week with Trump and President Joe Biden in Washington and pleaded with them to work together to bring all the hostages home in a single deal. 'As a grandmother, I say, cooperate — Trump wants peace in this region, Biden has always said he wants to release the hostages, so work together and do something important for the lives of human beings,' Ben Baruch said. She said neither leader offered specific details or plans for releasing the hostages or restarting negotiations for a Gaza cease-fire. Talks have hit a wall in recent months, largely over Hamas' demands for guarantees that a full hostage release will bring an end to Israel’s campaign in Gaza and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s vows to continue fighting until Hamas is crushed and unable to rearm. 'We’re not involved in politics, not American and not Israeli, the families are above politics, we just want our loved ones home,' she said. 'Edan was kidnapped because he was Jewish, not because he voted for a certain party.' More than 250 people were kidnapped and 1,200 killed when Hamas militants burst across the border and carried out a bloody attack on southern Israeli communities. Israel’s campaign of retaliation since has killed more than 43,000 Palestinians, according to local health officials, and some 90% of its 2.3 million people have been displaced. As militants attacked on the morning of Oct. 7, Edan Alexander, then 19, was able to send a quick message to his mother amid the intense fighting around his base. He told her that despite having shrapnel embedded in his helmet from the explosions, he had managed to get to a protected area. After 7 a.m., his family lost contact. Alexander was considered missing as the family desperately searched hospitals for him. After five days, friends recognized him in a video of Hamas militants capturing soldiers. The family was happy: He was alive, Ben Baruch said. 'But we didn’t understand what we were entering into, what is still happening now.' When a week-long cease-fire last November brought the release of 105 hostages in exchange for 240 Palestinian prisoners, some of the freed hostages said they had seen Alexander in captivity. Ben Baruch said they told her Alexander kept his cool, encouraging them that everyone would be released soon. Ben Baruch said she was disheartened when Netanyahu last week fired Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, who she said had consistently reassured the families that the hostages were at the top of his agenda. 'I felt he was a partner,' she said. Gallant was replaced by a Netanyahu loyalist who has urged a tough line against Hamas. A mass protest movement urging the government to reach a hostage deal has shown signs of weariness, and hostage families have struggled to keep their campaign in the headlines. A delegation of former hostages and their relatives met with the pope on Thursday and expressed hope the incoming and outgoing American administrations would bring their loved ones home. In Tel Aviv’s Hostage Square, the headquarters of the protest movement, opinions were mixed on the effect of Trump’s election on hostages. 'I don’t think this is good for Israel or the hostages, I’m really scared of him,' said David Danino, a 45-year-old hi-tech worker from Tel Aviv. He was at Hostages Square with his family, visiting from France, who wanted to pay their respects. Danino noted that Israel had already achieved many of its war goals, including killing Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar and Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah. 'They are building us a photo of what is ‘victory,’ but how is there victory without the hostages?' he asked. Others thought Trump’s reputation might help the situation. 'When he decides to do something, he does it, without blinking, and he can create ultimatums,' said Orly Vitman, a 54-year-old former special education teacher from the Tel Aviv suburb of Holon. She comes every few months to the square with her daughter to light candles in honor of the hostages. While she was opposed to the firing of Gallant in the middle of the war, she was heartened by Trump’s election. 'We will have the legitimacy and ability to use the full force of what we know how to do,' she said. Ben Baruch, a philanthropist and accomplished artist whose modernist sculptures dot the Tel Aviv home where she has lived for 52 years, said she has pushed everything aside in her life to focus on the struggle to bring her grandson home. Her days are filled with meetings, interviews, rallies, protests and communal prayer sessions uniting different groups of Israelis from across the religious spectrum. 'It’s like people’s lives went back to their routine, but ours did not,' she said. 'There’s nothing left to say. All the words have been said. We have heard everything. We have met with everyone. But they are still there.'	https://apnews.com/article/israel-gaza-hamas-war-hostages-trump-biden-7e3cd6a6f0b9cd70cced92225a31e66c	2024-11-15T20:45:40-08:00

Colombia’s government is eager for a post-fossil fuels economy. But costs are a barrier	BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) — Colombia's fiery left-wing President Gustavo Petro is one of the biggest opponents of fossil fuels on the world stage today, with speeches that lump oil and coal with cocaine as his country's 'three poisons.' He's set a goal of weaning Colombia off those fossil fuels, putting the green energy transition and environmental protection at the center of his agenda. His opposition is long-held, but it's also practical. Colombia's oil reserves are projected to last only about seven years, and without new discoveries, the country will eventually have to find a way forward without the oil and coal that make up more than half its exports. But doing so will require overcoming the same challenges that many smaller nations face with the energy transition: higher borrowing costs that more developed nations face, Environment Minister Susana Muhamad said. Muhamad has been highlighting Colombia's challenge at the United Nations climate talks in Azerbaijan, where the major goal of this year's talks known as COP29 is establishing just how much wealthy nations will contribute to the developing world to cope with climate change and transform their energy systems. At a press conference on the sidelines of the climate talks Saturday, Muhamad said the world 'cannot continue to play with the same financial rules that leave developing countries behind.' Muhamad also touted her country's support for a non-proliferation treaty for fossil fuels. The treaty, modeled on others like a non-nuclear proliferation treaty, is aimed at ending the expansion of new coal, oil and gas projects, and manage a global transition away from fossil fuels. 'Oil is not a gift from god,' Muhamad told The Associated Press on the sidelines of COP29, referring to a comment made by Azerbaijan’s president Ilham Aliyev earlier in the talks. 'It’s a trap. We need to untangle ourselves from that.' 'We’re trying to look for a path that actually helps us to be more resilient, be more competitive in a new era of economics where climate and people are at the center, so we can create a different economy,' she said. 'But we are not finding a positive response towards this path.' Developing economies face higher costs for renewable energy and sustainable projects due in part to perceived risks for investors, according to the World Economic Forum, which says significant international investment is necessary for the energy transition. Muhamad said, like many developing nations, Colombia faces 'unfair conditions' in accessing capital. Petro, a former guerrilla with the M-19 Marxist group in his youth, is a longstanding critic of what he calls the 'greedy' extractive sector. He has stopped approval of new oil drilling contracts, has banned fracking and pushed through some of the first offshore wind power projects in Latin America since taking office in 2022. But his mission to leave fossil fuels behind has faced criticism. Tomas Gonzalez, a former Colombia energy minister from the Conservative Party who now directs the Bogota-based Regional Center for Energy Studies, called Petro's approach 'very radical'. 'As long as there is demand someone will meet it, so restricting Colombian production doesn’t reduce emissions globally,' Gonzalez said. 'But for Colombia, it means major sacrifices in fiscal revenue and funding for public spending.' Oil and coal are key to Colombia’s national revenue, according to government data, accounting for about 8% of GDP and over 50% of its exports. It's the world's sixth-largest exporter of coal, according to the national mining agency, and a top-20 exporter of crude. But its oil reserves are considered small, at around seven years, according to the country’s oil regulator, ANH. 'We don't have huge reserves,' Muhamad said. 'We are not like other countries which could have 200 years of oil under the soil. So as the world decarbonizes, our markets will be closing and we need a replacement.' Colombia may have more oil and gas, but Petro’s administration has stopped issuing new oil and gas exploration contracts. Gonzalez called that 'the opposite direction of what we need.' Colombia launched a new investment portfolio at the end of September for its climate adaptation plans, which it hopes will attract around $40 billion to help fund ecotourism, a fair energy transition and conservation and restoration of ecosystems. 'Colombia is doing the right thing in a way by saying we need to move away from fossil fuels,' said Bill Hare, a climate scientist and chief executive of Climate Analytics, a science and policy group that supports action on climate change. 'They’re doing it for a combination of different reasons, some of them economic, some basically completely moral and oriented around the climate crisis. What is really bad that’s happening is that they’re not being backed up by the international financial community.' Hare said the whole ecosystem of the international financial community is not backing Colombia up. 'They’re going with the fossil fuel industry. So Colombia is facing a downgrade economically because of that,' he said. 'It will need backing. It may not be hard cash, but it could be debt guarantees. It can be all sorts of things like that that ultimately don’t cost a lot that make all the difference.' For Gonzalez, when it comes to the energy transition, there are serious gaps between the ambitions Petro has set and the policies in place. 'Colombia needs to expand its clean energy supply and improve energy efficiency at a scale and speed far greater than what we’re currently achieving,' he said. 'When you want to be a global leader the disconnect between goals and policy actions in this area remains a major challenge.' ___ Arasu reported from Baku, Azerbaijan.

They fled war in Sudan. Now, women in refugee camps say they’re being forced to have sex to survive	ADRE, Chad (AP) — Crossing into Chad, the 27-year-old thought she'd left the horrors of Sudan's war behind: the bodies she ran over while fleeing, the screams of girls being raped, the disappearance of her husband when gunmen attacked. But now she says she has faced more suffering — being forced as a refugee to have sex to get by. She cradled her 7-week-old son, who she asserted was the child of an aid worker who promised her money in exchange for sex. 'The children were crying. We ran out of food,' she said of her four other children. 'He abused my situation.' She and other women who spoke to The Associated Press requested anonymity because they feared retribution. Some Sudanese women and girls assert that men, including those meant to protect them such as humanitarian workers and local security forces, have sexually exploited them in Chad's displacement sites, offering money, easier access to assistance and jobs. Such sexual exploitation in Chad is a crime. Hundreds of thousands of people, most of them women, have streamed into Chad to escape Sudan's civil war, which has killed over 20,000 people. Aid groups struggle to support them in growing displacement sites. Three women spoke with the AP in the town of Adre near the Sudanese border. A Sudanese psychologist shared the accounts of seven other women and girls who either refused to speak directly with a reporter or were no longer in touch with her. The AP could not confirm their accounts. Daral-Salam Omar, the psychologist, said all the seven told her they went along with the offers of benefits in exchange for sex out of necessity. Some sought her help because they became pregnant and couldn't seek an abortion at a clinic for fear of being shunned by their community, she said. 'They were psychologically destroyed. Imagine a woman getting pregnant without a husband amid this situation,' Omar said. Sexual exploitation during large humanitarian crises is not uncommon, especially in displacement sites. Aid groups have long struggled to combat the issue. They cite a lack of reporting by women, not enough funds to respond and a focus on first providing basic necessities. The U.N. refugee agency said it doesn't publish data on cases, citing the confidentiality and safety of victims. People seeking protection should never have to make choices driven by survival, experts said. Nidhi Kapur, who works on preventing sexual exploitation and abuse in emergency contexts, said exploitation represents a deep failure by the aid community. Yewande Odia, the United Nations Population’s Fund representative in Chad, said sexual exploitation is a serious violation. U.N. agencies said displacement camps have 'safe spaces' where women can gather, along with awareness sessions, a free hotline and feedback boxes to report abuse anonymously. Yet many of the Sudanese women said they weren’t aware of the hotline, and some said using the boxes would draw unwanted attention. The Sudanese woman with the newborn said she was afraid to report the aid worker for fear he'd turn her in to police. She said she approached the aid worker, a Sudanese man, after searching for jobs to buy basic necessities like soap. She asked him for money. He said he'd give her cash but only in exchange for sex. They slept together for months, she said, and he paid the equivalent of about $12 each time. After she had the baby, he gave her a one-time payment of approximately $65 but denied it was his, she said. The man was a Sudanese laborer for Doctors Without Borders, known by its French acronym MSF, she said. Two other Sudanese women said Chadian men working at MSF sites— one wearing MSF clothing — solicited them after they applied for work with the organization. The men took their phone numbers and repeatedly called, saying they'd give them jobs for sex. Both women said they refused. Christopher Lockyear, MSF's secretary general, said the organization was not aware of the allegations and wanted to investigate. 'Asking for money or sex in exchange for access to care or a job is a clear violation of our behavioral commitments,' he said. MSF would not say how many such cases had been reported among Sudanese refugees in Chad. Last year, out of 714 complaints made about MSF staff behavior where it works globally, 264 were confirmed to be cases of abuse or inappropriate behavior including sexual exploitation, abuse of power and bullying, Lockyear said. Lockyear said MSF is creating a pool of investigators at the global level to enhance its ability to pursue allegations. One woman told the AP that a man with another aid group also exploited her, but she was unable to identify the organization. Omar, the psychologist, said several of the women told her they were exploited by aid workers, local and international. She gave no evidence to back up the claims. Another woman, one of the two who alleged they were approached after seeking work with MSF, said she also refused a local policeman who approached her and promised an extra food ration card if she went to his house. Ali Mahamat Sebey, the head official for Adre, said police are not allowed inside the camps and asserted that allegations against them of exploitation were false. With the growing influx of people, however, it's hard to protect everyone, he said. The women said they just want to feel safe, adding that access to jobs would lessen their vulnerability. After most of her family was killed or abducted in Sudan's Darfur region last year, one 19-year-old sought refuge in Chad. She didn't have enough money to support the nieces and nephews in her care. She got a job at a restaurant in the camp but when she asked her Sudanese boss for a raise, he agreed on the condition of sex. The money he paid was more than six times her salary. But when she got pregnant with his child, the man fled, she asserted. She rubbed her growing belly. 'If we had enough, we wouldn’t have to go out and lose our dignity,' she said. ___ The Associated Press receives financial support for global health and development coverage in Africa from the Gates Foundation.

In the polar bear capital of the world, a community lives with the predator next door and loves it	CHURCHILL, Manitoba (AP) — Sgt. Ian Van Nest rolls slowly through the streets of Churchill, his truck outfitted with a rifle and a barred back seat to hold anyone he has to arrest. His eyes dart back and forth, then settle on a crowd of people standing outside a van. He scans the area for safety and then quietly addresses the group's leader, unsure of the man's weapons. 'How are you today?' Van Nest asks. The leader responds with a wary, 'We OK for you here?' 'You’re good. You got a lot of distance there. When you have people disembarking from the vehicle you should have a bear monitor,' Van Nest, a conservation officer for the province of Manitoba, cautions as the tourists gaze at a polar bear on the rocks. 'So, if that’s you, just have your shotgun with you, right? Slugs and cracker shells if you have or a scare pistol.' It's the beginning of polar bear season in Churchill, a tiny town on a spit of land jutting into Hudson Bay, and keeping tourists safe from hungry and sometimes fierce bears is an essential job for Van Nest and many others. And it's become harder as climate change shrinks the Arctic sea ice the bears depend on to hunt, forcing them to prowl inland earlier and more often in search of food, according to the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, a group of scientists that tracks how endangered species are. 'You're seeing more bears because there are more bears on the land for longer periods of time to be seen' and they are willing to take more risks, getting closer to people, said Polar Bears International research and policy director Geoff York. There are about 600 polar bears in this Western Hudson Bay population, about half what it was 40 years ago, but that's still close to one bear for every resident of Churchill. Yet this remote town not only lives with the predator next door, but depends upon and even loves it. Visitors eager to see polar bears saved the town from shrinking out of existence when a military base closed in the 1970s, dropping the population from a few thousand to about 870. A 2011 government study calculated that the average polar bear tourist spends about $5,000 a visit, pumping more than $7 million into a tiny town that boasts fancy restaurants and more than two dozen small places to stay amid dirt roads and no stoplights. 'We’re obviously used to bears so (when you see one) you don’t start to tremble,' Mayor Mike Spence said. 'It’s their area too. It’s important how the community coexists with bears and wildlife in general to really get along. We’re all connected.' It's been more than a decade since a bear mauled two people in an alley late on Halloween night before a third person scared off the animal. 'It was the scariest thing that's ever happened in my life,' said Erin Greene, who along with a 72-year-old man who tried to fight off the bear with a shovel survived their injuries. Greene, who had come to Churchill the year before for a job in the tourist trade, said it was the other animals of Churchill — the beluga whales that she sings to as she runs paddleboat tours and her dozen rescued retired sled dogs — that helped her recover from the trauma. There have been no attacks since then, but the town is watchful. At Halloween, trick-or-treating occurs when bears are hungriest, and dozens of volunteers line the streets to keep trouble at bay. Any time of year, troublesome bears that wander into town too often may be put into the polar bear jail — a big Quonset hut-style structure with 28 concrete-and-steel cells — before being returned to the wild. The building doesn't fill up, but it can get busy enough to be noisy from banging and growling inside, Van Nest said. Residents show polar bear pride in a way that mixes terror and fun, kind of like a rollercoaster. 'You know we're the polar bear capital of the world, right? We have the product, it's just about getting out there to see the bears safely,' said Dave Daley, who owns a gift shop, runs dog sleds and talks up the city like the former Chamber of Commerce president he is. 'I always tell tourists or whatever ‘You know what, they’re the T. rex like, of the dinosaur era. They're the Lords of the Arctic. They'll eat you.' Usually they don't. The military base's rocket launch site seemed to keep bears away, and when it closed in the 1970s, they came around more, longtime residents said. So Churchill and province officials 'put together a polar bear alert program to make sure the community members were looked after, protected,' said Spence, mayor since 1995. The town's old curfew siren blares nightly at 10 p.m., suggesting to people that it's time to go home for safety from bears. But on this Saturday night, three different bonfire parties are going on at the town beach — a spot next to the school, library and hospital that is a particular hot spot for bears coming inland. Yet no one is leaving. Then a truck shows up, and a lone figure — one of government's paid guards — gets out, armed with a shotgun. He walks out on the dunes about 100 yards from the parties and scans the horizon for polar bears. The guards are expected to scare any bears away with warning shots, flares, bear spray or noise — not kill them. 'It's just everybody watches out for everybody,' Spence said. 'So it's just, it's just normal. It kicks into gear as a community that lives alongside polar bears, you're always accustomed to coming out of your house and you look like this and you look ahead. And that's just in your DNA now.' Georgina Berg recalls growing up in the 1970s outside of Churchill, where many First Nations people lived, and how differently her father and mother reacted to a bear sighting. Her father, she said, would see a bear poking in garbage and just walk on by. 'He said, ‘If you don’t bother them, then they won’t bother you’,' she recalled. When a bear came near in later years, after her father had died, her mom was scared. 'Everything was like pandemonium. Everybody was yelling, and all the kids had to come in and everybody had to go home. And then we stayed silent in the house for a long time until we knew for sure that bear was gone, ' Berg recalled. For Van Nest, the provincial officer, the group he came upon that day was plenty safe from a bear about 300 yards (meters) away. He said the bear was 'putting on a bit of a show' for the tourists. 'This is a great situation to be in,' he said. 'The tourists are a safe distance away and the bear’s doing his natural thing and not being harassed by anybody.' ___ Read more of AP’s climate coverage at http://www.apnews.com/climate-and-environment ___ Follow Seth Borenstein on X at @borenbears ______ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Investigation reveals a Russian factory's plan to mix decoys with a new deadly weapon in Ukraine	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — A high-tech factory in central Russia has created a new, deadly force to attack Ukraine: a small number of highly destructive thermobaric drones surrounded by huge swarms of cheap foam decoys. The plan, which Russia dubbed Operation False Target, is intended to force Ukraine to expend scarce resources to save lives and preserve critical infrastructure, including by using expensive air defense munitions, according to a person familiar with Russia’s production and a Ukrainian electronics expert who hunts them from his specially outfitted van. Neither radar, sharpshooters nor even electronics experts can tell which drones are deadly in the skies. Here's what to know from AP's investigation: A deadly mix Unarmed decoys now make up more than half the drones targeting Ukraine and as much as 75% of the new drones coming out of the factory in Russia’s Alabuga Special Economic Zone, according to the person familiar with Russia’s production, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the industry is highly sensitive, and the Ukrainian electronics expert. The same factory produces a particularly deadly variant of the Shahed unmanned aircraft armed with thermobaric warheads, the person said. During the first weekend of November, the Kyiv region spent 20 hours under air alert, and the sound of buzzing drones mingled with the boom of air defenses and rifle shots. In October, Moscow attacked with at least 1,889 drones – 80% more than in August, according to an AP analysis tracking the drones for months. On Saturday, Russia launched 145 drones across Ukraine, just days after the re-election of Donald Trump threw into doubt U.S. support for the country. Since summer, most drones crash, are shot down or are diverted by electronic jamming, according to an AP analysis of the Ukrainian military briefings. Less than 6% hit a discernible target, according to the data analyzed by AP since the end of July. But the sheer numbers mean a handful can slip through every day – and that is enough to be deadly. The drone lab Tatarstan’s Alabuga zone, an industrial complex about 1,000 kilometers (600 miles) east of Moscow, is a laboratory for Russian drone production. Originally set up in 2006 to attract businesses and investment to Tatarstan, it expanded after the 2022 invasion of Ukraine and some sectors switched to military production, adding new buildings and renovating existing sites, according to satellite images analyzed by The Associated Press. In social media videos, the factory promoted itself as an innovation hub. But David Albright of the Washington-based Institute for Science and International Security said Alabuga’s current purpose is purely to produce and sell drones to Russia‘s Ministry of Defense. The videos and other promotional media were taken down after an AP investigation found that many of the African women recruited to fill labor shortages there complained they were duped into taking jobs at the plant. Russia and Iran signed a $1.7 billion deal for the Shaheds in 2022, after President Vladimir Putin invaded neighboring Ukraine, and Moscow began using Iranian imports of the unmanned aerial vehicles, or UAVs, in battle later that year. Soon after the deal was signed, production started in Alabuga. The most fearsome Shahed adaptation so far designed at the plant is armed with thermobarics, also known as vacuum bombs, the person with knowledge of Russian drone production said. The plan to develop unarmed decoy drones at Alabuga was developed in late 2022, according to the person with knowledge of Russian drone production. Production of the decoys started earlier this year, said the person, who agreed to speak only on condition of anonymity. Now the plant turns out about 40 of the unarmed drones a day and around 10 armed ones, which are more expensive and take longer to produce. The vacuum bomb From a military point of view, thermobarics are ideal for going after targets that are either inside fortified buildings or deep underground. They create a vortex of high pressure and heat that penetrates the thickest walls and, at the same time, sucks out all the oxygen in their path. Alabuga’s thermobaric drones are particularly destructive when they strike buildings, because they are also loaded with ball bearings to cause maximum damage even beyond the superheated blast. Serhii Beskrestnov, a Ukrainian electronics expert and more widely known as Flash whose black military van is kitted out with electronic jammers to down drones, said the thermobarics were first used over the summer and estimated they now make up between 3% and 5% of all drones. They have a fearsome reputation because of the physical effects even on people caught outside the initial blast site: Collapsed lungs, crushed eyeballs, brain damage, according to Arthur van Coller, an expert in international humanitarian law at South Africa’s University of Fort Hare. For Russia, the benefits are huge. An unarmed drone costs considerably less than the estimated $50,000 for an armed Shahed drone and a tiny fraction of the cost of even a relatively inexpensive air defense missile. One decoy with a live-feed camera allows the aircraft to geolocate Ukraine’s air defenses and relay the information to Russia in the final moments of its mechanical life. And the swarms have become a demoralizing fact of life for Ukrainians. ___ Burrows reported from Washington D.C.	https://apnews.com/article/russian-ukraine-war-drones-factory-279cce33ab035de6c18635c5159f91cf	2024-11-15T20:12:13-08:00	
Operation False Target: How Russia plotted to mix a deadly new weapon among decoy drones in Ukraine	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — At a secretive factory in Russia's central grasslands, engineers are manufacturing hundreds of decoy drones meant to overwhelm Ukrainian defenses as they try to protect against a horrific new weapon, an Associated Press investigation has found. The plant at Russia’s Alabuga Special Economic Zone recently started churning out thermobaric drones alongside the decoys, the investigation found. The thermobaric warheads create a vortex of high pressure and heat that can penetrate thick walls. They suck out all the oxygen in their path, and have a fearsome reputation because of the injuries inflicted even outside the initial blast site: Collapsed lungs, crushed eyeballs, brain damage. Russia came up with the plan for decoys in late 2022 and codenamed it Operation False Target, according to a person familiar with Russia’s drone production who spoke on condition of anonymity because the industry is highly sensitive. The idea was to launch armed drones along with dozens of decoys, sometimes stuffed with rags or foam, and indistinguishable on radar from those carrying real bombs. Ukrainian forces must make split-second decisions about how to expend scarce resources to save lives and preserve critical infrastructure. 'The idea was to make a drone which would create a feeling of complete uncertainty for the enemy. So he doesn’t know whether it’s really a deadly weapon ... or essentially a foam toy,' the person said. With the thermobarics, there is now a 'huge risk' an armed drone could deviate from its course and end up in a residential area where the 'damage will be simply terrifying,' he said. Russia's drone factory In recent weeks, decoys have filled Ukraine’s skies by the dozens, each one appearing as an indistinguishable blip on military radar screens. During the first weekend of November, the Kyiv region spent 20 hours under air alert, and the sound of buzzing drones mingled with the boom of air defenses and rifle shots. Unarmed decoys now make up more than half the drones targeting Ukraine, according to the person and Serhii Beskrestnov, a Ukrainian electronics expert whose black military van is kitted out with electronic jammers to down drones. Both the unarmed decoys and the armed Iranian-designed Shahed drones are being built at a factory in Russia’s Alabuga Special Economic Zone, an industrial complex set up in 2006 about 1,000 kilometers (600 miles) east of Moscow to attract businesses and investment to Tatarstan. It expanded after the 2022 invasion of Ukraine and some sectors switched to military production, adding new buildings and renovating existing sites, according to satellite images analyzed by The Associated Press. In social media videos, the factory promotes itself as an innovation hub. But David Albright of the Washington-based Institute for Science and International Security said Alabuga’s current purpose is purely to produce and sell drones to Russia‘s Ministry of Defense. The videos and other promotional media were taken down after an AP investigation found that many of the African women recruited to fill labor shortages there complained they were duped into taking jobs at the plant. Russia and Iran signed a $1.7 billion deal for the Shaheds in 2022, after President Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine, and Moscow began using Iranian imports of the unmanned aerial vehicles, or UAVs, in battle later that year.

Since summer, most drones crash, are shot down or are diverted by electronic jamming, according to an AP analysis of Ukrainian military briefings. Less than 6% hit a discernible target, according to the data analyzed by AP since the end of July. But the sheer numbers mean a handful can slip through every day – and that is enough to be deadly. Daily drone swarms The swarms have become a demoralizing fact of life for Ukrainians. Russian drone tactics continue to evolve. Now, more powerful missiles often follow close behind as air defenses are exhausted by the drones. The most destructive are the ballistic and cruise missiles that fly many times faster than the drones, which buzz loudly and can be tracked by the naked eye. Even the decoys can be useful to Russia. One decoy with a live-feed camera allows the aircraft to geolocate Ukraine’s air defenses and relay the information to Russia in the final moments of its mechanical life. Night after night, Ukrainian sharpshooters spring into action to down the drones with portable surface-to-air missiles. One sharpshooter, who like most Ukrainian soldiers asked to be identified by his call-sign Rosmaryn, said he’s shot down perhaps a dozen drones in all over nearly two years and saw one that was stuffed with rags and foam. Rosmaryn sees his adversary in almost human terms, describing the aircraft’s quest to outwit his small unit. 'It was part of a swarm, flying as one of the last ones,' he said. 'When it’s in the sky, we can’t tell what kind it is, because everything is inside the drone. We only find out after it’s shot down.' Many fly at 2,000 to 3,000 meters (6,500 feet to around 10,000 feet) before dropping to lower altitudes on their final approach, Rosmaryn said. Leaked videos suggest Ukraine is now using helicopters to shoot down the high-altitude drones. Three decoys of Russian origin have crashed in Moldova in the past week, authorities there said. Thanks to optical trickery, radar can’t distinguish a drone armed with a Shahed’s usual 50-kilogram payload of explosives or with a thermobaric weapon – also known as a vacuum bomb – from those without a warhead or topped with live-feed surveillance cameras. There are also other even rougher-quality drones, armed and unarmed, but in fewer quantities than the Shahed-style unmanned aircraft. That’s why, even knowing that decoys now make up most of an incoming swarm, Ukraine can’t afford to let anything through. 'For us, it’s just a point on the radar … It has speed, direction, and altitude,' said Col. Yurii Ihnat, an Air Force spokesman. 'We have no way of identifying the exact target during flight, so we have to either jam them with electronic warfare or use firepower to neutralize them. The enemy uses these to scatter our attention.' The engines and electronics for the armed Shaheds and decoys are a mix of Chinese and Western imports, according to fragments seen by The Associated Press at a Ukrainian military lab. Without them, the drones can’t fly. Despite nearly three years of sanctions, Moscow can still source the parts – largely from China and via third countries in Central Asia and the Middle East. Halfway through the series of air alerts on Nov. 2, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the swarms of Shaheds, which he put at 2,000 for the month of October alone, were made possible by Western technology slipping through sanctions. 'Included in this many Shaheds are more than 170,000 components that should have been blocked for delivery to Russia. Microcircuits, microcontrollers, processors, many different parts, without which this terror would simply be impossible,' Zelenskyy said. The joint manufacturing of the drones — some to carry bombs, others to divert attention — is saving Russia's military money. Production of the decoys started earlier this year and now the plant turns out about 40 of the cheaper unarmed drones a day and around 10 armed ones, which cost an estimated $50,000 and take longer to produce, according to the person with knowledge of Russian drone production. The Russian news outlet Izvestia in late October said the aim of the decoy is to 'weaken' the enemy by forcing it to waste ammunition before sending in armed Shaheds. Both Beskrestnov and the person familiar with Russian drone production said engineers at Alabuga are also constantly experimenting, putting Moscow at the cutting edge of drone production. To make electronic interference harder, they add Ukrainian SIM cards, roaming SIMS, Starlinks, fiberoptics – and can sometimes receive real-time feedback before the drones are jammed, downed or run out of fuel. Sometimes they attach a silver-painted foam ball to make the drone seem larger on a radar. But the latest thermobaric variant is causing new anguish in Ukraine. Thermobaric fears From a military point of view, thermobarics are ideal for going after targets that are either inside fortified buildings or deep underground. Alabuga’s thermobaric drones are particularly destructive when they strike buildings, because they are also loaded with ball bearings to cause maximum damage even beyond the superheated blast, said Albright. Beskrestnov, who is more widely known as Flash and whose black military van is kitted out with electronic jammers to down drones, said the thermobarics were first used over the summer and estimated they now make up between 3% and 5% of all drones. 'This type of warhead has the possibility to destroy a huge building, especially block flats. And it’s very effective if the Russian Federation tries to attack our power plants,' he said. They have a fearsome reputation because of the physical effects even on people caught outside the initial blast site, said Arthur van Coller, an expert in international humanitarian law at South Africa’s University of Fort Hare. 'With a thermobaric explosion, because of the cloud it would create, everything in its radius would be affected,' he said. 'It creates massive fear in the civilian population. Thermobaric weapons have created this idea that they are really horrible weapons and that creates fear.' ___ Burrows reported from Washington D.C.

In final talks, Biden to press China's Xi on North Korea's ties with Russia	LIMA, Peru (AP) — President Joe Biden is expected to use his final meeting with China's leader, Xi Jinping, to urge him to dissuade North Korea from further deepening its support for Russia's war on Ukraine. Saturday's talks on the sidelines of the annual Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Peru come just over two months before Biden leaves office and makes way for Republican President-elect Donald Trump. It will be Biden's last check-in with Xi — someone the Democrat saw as his most consequential peer on the world stage. With the final meeting, officials say Biden will be looking for Xi to step up Chinese engagement to prevent an already dangerous moment with North Korea from further escalating. Biden on Friday, along with South Korean President Yoon Seok Yul and Japan's Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, condemned North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's decision to send thousands of troops to help Moscow repel Ukrainian forces who have seized territory in Russia's Kursk border region. Biden called it 'dangerous and destabilizing cooperation.' White House officials also have expressed frustration with Beijing, which accounts for the vast majority of North Korea's trade, for not doing more to rein in Pyongyang. Biden, Yoon and Ishiba spent most of their 50-minute discussion focused on the issue, agreeing it 'should not be in Beijing’s interest to have this destabilizing cooperation in the region,' according to a senior administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss their private conversations. The North Koreans also have provided Russia with artillery and other munitions, according to U.S. and South Korean intelligence officials. And the U.S., Japan and South Korea have expressed alarm over Pyongyang’s stepped-up cadence of ballistic missile tests. Kim ordered testing exercises in the lead-up to this month’s U.S. election and is claiming progress on efforts to build capability to strike the U.S. mainland. Biden and Xi have much beyond North Korea to discuss, including China's indirect support for Russia, human rights issues, technology and Taiwan, the self-ruled democracy that Beijing claims as its own. There's also much uncertainty about what lies ahead in the U.S.-China relationship under Trump, who campaigned promising to levy 60% tariffs on Chinese imports. Already, many American companies, including Nike and eyewear retailer Warby Parker, have been diversifying their sourcing away from China. Shoe brand Steve Madden says it plans to cut imports from China by as much as 45% next year. 'When Xi meets with Biden, part of his audience is not solely the White House or the U.S. government,' said Victor Cha, an analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. 'It’s about American CEOs and continued U.S. investment or trying to renew U.S. investment in China and get rid of the perception that there’s a hostile business environment in China.' White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said Biden administration officials will advise the Trump team that managing the intense competition with Beijing will likely be the most significant foreign policy challenge they will face. Administration officials are concerned that tensions between China and Taiwan could devolve into all-out war if there is a miscalculation by either side, with catastrophic consequences for the world. Sullivan said the Trump administration will have to deal with the Chinese military's frequent harassment of its regional neighbors. Skirmishes between the Philippine and Chinese coast guards in the disputed South China Sea have become a persistent problem. Chinese coast guard ships also regularly approach disputed Japanese-controlled East China Sea islands near Taiwan. Ishiba met with Xi on Friday. Afterward, the Japanese prime minister said he told Xi he was 'extremely concerned about the situation in the East China Sea and escalating activity of the People’s Liberation Army.' The White House worked for months to arrange Saturday's meeting between Xi and Biden, something the Democrat badly wanted to do before leaving office in January. Sullivan traveled to Beijing in late August to meet with his Chinese counterpart and also sat down with Xi. Beijing agreed to the meeting earlier this week. It's a big moment for Biden as he wraps up more than 50 years in politics. He saw his relationship with Xi as among the most consequential on the international stage and put much effort into cultivating that relationship. Biden and Xi first got to know each other on travels across the U.S. and China when both were vice presidents, interactions that both have said left a lasting impression. But the last four years have presented a steady stream of difficult moments. The FBI this week offered new details of a federal investigation into Chinese government efforts to hack into U.S. telecommunications networks. The initial findings have revealed a 'broad and significant' cyberespionage campaign aimed at stealing information from Americans who work in government and politics. U.S. intelligence officials also have assessed China has surged sales to Russia of machine tools, microelectronics and other technology that Moscow is using to produce missiles, tanks, aircraft and other weaponry for use in its war against Ukraine. And tensions flared last year after Biden ordered the shooting down of a Chinese spy balloon that traversed the United States. ___ Associated Press writer Mari Yamaguchi in Tokyo contributed.	https://apnews.com/article/biden-xi-china-north-korea-russia-88725252ce926384aaf36004b9f863b3	2024-11-15T20:01:52-08:00	
Fire engulfs hospital ward in northern India, killing 10 newborn babies	LUCKNOW, India (AP) — A fire tore through a neonatal intensive care unit in a hospital in northern India, killing 10 newborn babies and injuring 16 others, authorities said. The fire occurred late Friday at a hospital in Jhansi city in India's Uttar Pradesh state. Officials said the blaze spread quickly through the ward, where 55 infants were being treated. Forty-five babies were rescued and are receiving medical care, said Bimal Kumar Dubey, a local official. It was not immediately clear what sparked the blaze. Brajesh Pathak, the deputy chief minister of the state, visited the hospital and met with families on Saturday. He pledged government support for the victims’ families and promised a thorough investigation. 'We will identify those responsible for this tragedy and take strict action. The government stands with families during this difficult time,' he said. When the firefighters arrived, the ward was engulfed in flames and plumes of smoke. Rescuers had to break through windows to reach the newborn babies. Eyewitnesses said the rescue operation began about 30 minutes after the fire erupted, delaying evacuation efforts. The accident has raised questions over the hospital’s safety measures. While fire alarms had been installed in the intensive care unit, parents and witnesses said they did not activate during the blaze. Hospital staff acted only after they saw signs of smoke and fire. 'If the safety alarm had worked, we could have acted sooner and saved more lives,' said Naresh Kumar, a parent who lost his baby. Akhtar Hussain, whose son was rescued and is receiving treatment in an adjacent ward, agreed that the tragedy could have been prevented if the hospital had better safety protocols. Fires are common in India, where building laws and safety norms are often flouted by builders and residents. Poor maintenance and lack of proper firefighting equipment in the country also leads to deaths.	https://apnews.com/article/india-jhansi-hospital-fire-newborns-c2236ba37d12e4f5353df5ebb68171e2	2024-11-15T19:13:50-08:00	
Iranian official met with Musk in a possible step to ease tensions with Trump	WASHINGTON (AP) — Iran successfully sought a meeting with Elon Musk, according to a U.S. official, one in a series of steps that appeared aimed at easing tensions with President-elect Donald Trump. Iran's U.N. Ambassador Amir Saeid Iravani met with Musk — a Trump ally named this week to advise his administration on ways to cut the federal government — on Monday in New York, according to a U.S. official briefed on the meeting by a foreign colleague. The official said he had been informed that the discussion covered a variety of topics, most notably Iran’s nuclear program, its support for anti-Israel groups throughout the Middle East and prospects for improved relations with the United States. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss a non-U.S. governmental meeting, said no immediate decisions were taken by either side. The official said the Iranians sought the meeting with Musk, the world's richest man, and that it did not take place at the Iranian mission to the U.N. The Trump transition team would not confirm or deny the meeting, which was first reported by The New York Times. 'The American people re-elected President Trump because they trust him to lead our country and restore peace through strength around the world. When he returns to the White House, he will take the necessary action to do just that,' Karoline Leavitt, a spokesperson for the Trump transition, said in a statement. Iran’s U.N. mission declined to comment. Iran's outreach comes as Trump has been announcing picks for key foreign policy posts — including Sen. Marco Rubio for secretary of state and Rep. Mike Waltz for national security adviser — who are expected to be tough on Iran. Intelligence officials have said Iran opposed Trump's second term, seeing him as more likely to increase tension between Washington and Tehran. Trump’s administration ended a nuclear deal with Iran, reimposed sanctions and ordered the killing of Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani, an act that prompted Iran’s leaders to vow revenge. The Justice Department this month revealed an Iranian murder-for-hire plot to kill Trump, charging a man who said he had been tasked by an Iranian government official in September with planning Trump's assassination. The Iranian foreign ministry rejected the report. The plot was part of what federal officials have described as ongoing efforts by Iran to target U.S. government officials, including Trump, on U.S. soil. Last summer, for instance, the Justice Department charged a Pakistani man with ties to Iran in a murder-for-hire plot targeting American officials. Meanwhile, The Wall Street Journal reported, citing unnamed U.S. officials, that Iran told the Biden administration in a written message delivered on Oct. 14 that it would not try to kill Trump. It was a response to an earlier warning from the U.S. that an attempt on Trump's life would be considered an act of war, the Journal reported. In response to inquiries about reports in the Journal and other outlets, Iran's U.N. mission said it does not issue public statements about 'official messages exchanged between the two countries.' 'The Islamic Republic of Iran has long declared its commitment to pursuing Martyr Soleimani’s assassination through legal and judicial avenues, while adhering fully to the recognized principles of international law,' its statement said. While Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has final say on all matters of state, has repeatedly expressed his own disgust with Trump, Iran’s new reformist president has kept the door open to talks with Trump to seek relief from international sanctions. The Trump transition team did not respond to messages seeking comment on the Iranian mission's statement Friday. ___ Lederer reported from the United Nations. AP reporter Michelle L.

In Milei's latest drastic move, Argentina is sole UN holdout voting 'no' to ending gender violence	BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) — The usual suspects abstained from voting on a seemingly uncontroversial United Nations resolution that denounced violence against women and girls on Thursday — Iran, Russia, North Korea. But the country casting the sole vote against the nonbinding resolution, drafted by France and the Netherlands, took the world by surprise. It was Argentina, long considered one of Latin America’s most socially progressive countries. Unleashing an avalanche of criticism across the political spectrum on Friday, the ‘no’ vote by Buenos Aires marked the latest in a series of dramatic foreign policy shifts under President Javier Milei, the most right-wing leader in Argentina's 41 years of democracy. It comes just days after Milei, an outspoken climate change skeptic, abruptly called Argentina's negotiators home from the U.N. climate summit in Baku, Azerbaijan, stirring concerns that the radical economist might seek to emulate former U.S. President Donald Trump in withdrawing Argentina entirely from the 2015 Paris climate agreement. Not only has Milei transformed Argentine foreign policy in line with the United States and Israel, his government has also taken fringe positions on the global stage that fly in the face of the liberal, rules-based international order. 'It's a big break with standard Argentine foreign policy, which has long been oriented toward making Argentina an integrated part of the Global South,' said Richard Sanders, a global fellow at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars and former State Department official in the region. 'It’s a definitely a significant change in how Argentina relates internationally.' Argentina's vote at the U.N. Thursday recalled a similar clash last month when Argentina became the only member of all the Group of 20 nations to sign onto a statement adopting language about gender equality. 'Argentina votes alone, against the rest of humanity,' the conservative party of former President Mauricio Macri, an ally of Milei’s government, wrote on social media platform X Friday. Another centrist party, the Unión Cívica Radical, joined the chorus of local condemnation. 'By fighting imaginary cultural battles we end up isolated from the world,' said Senator Martín Lousteau, president of the centrist party. Lousteau denounced Argentina’s U.N. vote opposing an end to gender violence as a 'disgrace.' Top official Guillermo Francos defended the decision, saying 'neither commitments nor treaties will solve the issue of gender violence.' Nearly a year into his presidency, the former Argentine TV pundit remains erratic and idiosyncratic in the global spotlight, in striking similarity to Trump. Milei became the first foreign leader since the U.S. election to meet Trump, albeit informally, late Thursday at the president-elect's private Mar-a-Lago club in Florida. In a congratulatory phone call with Trump earlier this week, Miei's spokesperson reported that Trump told the Argentine leader: 'You're my favorite president.' Trump has not confirmed the claim. The Argentine presidency on Friday proudly released a stream of photos from Mar-a-Lago featuring Milei in a sharp suit beaming alongside Trump and tech billionaire Elon Musk, with whom Milei has also publicly cultivated a bromance over their shared contempt for 'wokeness,' gender issues and socialism. In November 2023, an angry Argentine electorate fed up with sky-high inflation, debt defaults and bank runs handed the outsider a sweeping mandate to carry out an overhaul of Argentina's crisis-stricken economy. But along with Milei's libertarian crusade has come a series of cultural battles — both at home, where the president eliminated Argentina's women’s and environment ministries and scrapped the national anti-discrimination institute, as well as abroad, where Milei has sought to fashion himself as a far-right icon, raising the hackles of key allies like Braziland Spain. 'Milei got into the presidency on the basis of his clearly stated libertarian views, it was all about the economy,' Sanders said. 'But these other views are nothing he kept hidden.' Tensions over Milei's culture war escalated this month. When Argentina voted at the U.N. in favor of ending the American economic embargo against Cuba on Oct. 30, Milei fired then-Foreign Minister Diana Mondino over what he called her 'unforgivable mistake' and swiftly replaced her with Gerardo Werthein, a wealthy businessman who had been Buenos Aires’ ambassador to the U.S. This weekend, Milei and Werthein plan to meet Trump again at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Orlando, Florida. Experts say that Milei hopes to cash in on his friendship with Trump to help crisis-stricken Argentina secure a much-needed infusion cash infusion from the International Monetary Fund, to which Argentina owes over $44 billion. The U.S. is the fund’s largest shareholder. In recent weeks, Milei's shock dismissal of Argentina's top diplomat — a polished political performer who frequently worked to mend diplomatic relations strained by Milei’s profanity-laden fights with traditional allies — has sent shivers through Argentina's diplomatic ranks. Milei has vowed to purge his foreign ministry of so-called 'traitors to the country' who have strayed from his stance, which includes rejecting the 'Pact for the Future' adopted by the U.N. in September that promotes climate action, female empowerment and the regulation of artificial intelligence. Local media has reported the forced resignations of at least seven diplomats in recent weeks who were perceived as critical of the president's Trump-like attacks on the collective philosophy of the U.N. Milei accuses such multilateral forums of restricting members’ freedom. Argentina's left-leaning Peronist movement — which has dominated the country's politics for decades — was seething Friday, with lawmakers aghast at what they saw as the unraveling of hard-won social gains like Argentina's breakthrough legalization of abortion in 2020 and recent efforts to curb fossil fuels. 'For you, freedom is violence,' said Mayra Mendoza, a prominent Peronist politician on Friday, addressing Milei. The libertarian has called abortion 'murder,' climate change a 'socialist lie' and the U.N. a 'leviathan with multiple tentacles.'	https://apnews.com/article/argentina-milei-united-nations-gender-b55668acab6e97b5ebbb97abe2dda996	2024-11-15T15:46:51-08:00

Virgin Mary statue, a symbol of resilience, returns to Notre Dame Cathedral 5 years after fire	PARIS (AP) — A medieval statue of the Virgin Mary and Child, known as 'The Virgin of Paris,' returned to Notre Dame cathedral Friday evening, five years after surviving the devastating 2019 fire that engulfed the landmark. The nearly six-foot-tall stone sculpture, a symbol of hope and faith for Catholics in Paris and beyond, was relocated after the blaze on April 15, 2019. Miraculously intact, it earned the nickname 'Stabat Mater' — the standing Virgin — as a sign of resilience amid the destruction. The statue’s return began with a torchlit procession from the forecourt of Saint-Germain-l’Auxerrois Church. Hundreds of faithful and residents accompanied the statue along the Seine river to the cathedral’s square, where Archbishop Laurent Ulrich of Paris led a blessing ceremony. 'Tonight, as we accompany the Virgin Mary to her cathedral, before she takes her place at the pillar where so many generations have come to pray, we know she is joining the house of Christ,' Ulrich said, bowing before the statue and blessing it with incense. The statue, originally from the Saint-Aignan Chapel on the Île de la Cité, dates to the mid-14th century. Moved to Notre Dame cathedral in 1818, it was relocated several times before finding a permanent home in 1855 against the southeast pillar of the cathedral, under the guidance of architect Eugène Viollet-le-Duc, according to a news release from the cathedral. A vigil followed, concluding a nine-day prayer cycle that began Nov. 7. The ceremony is part of the lead-up to the cathedral’s grand reopening, scheduled for Dec. 8. Last Thursday, the cathedral took delivery of three new bells, including one used in the Stade de France during the Paris Olympics earlier this year. The Olympic bell, a gift from the Paris 2024 organizing committee, will join two smaller bells, Chiara and Carlos, above the altar. 'We’ll be together again in a few days to open the door to Christ,' Ulrich said during the ceremony.	https://apnews.com/article/paris-notre-dame-cathedral-virgin-mary-statue-c7161cc1d283ffd183e667d7b59d2f98	2024-11-15T11:26:31-08:00	
Spanish regional leader admits mistakes made in flood response, but refuses to step down	MADRID (AP) — The Spanish regional leader facing immense pressure for his handling of the catastrophic Valencia floods last month defied calls to step down Friday, but conceded that authorities made mistakes in their response to the disaster. More than 220 people were killed from the powerful Oct. 29 storms that brought tsunami-like waves to parts of eastern and central Spain, wrecking countless homes and leaving entire towns caked in mud. Carlos Mazón of the conservative Popular Party addressed regional lawmakers in Valencia more than two weeks later, saying he would 'not deny failings' as anger has continued to grow at what people perceive was a slow and chaotic response. The storm, he said, 'showed that our detection and warning systems have cracks in them.' His remarks Friday were the first detailed public comments he has made about his government's disaster response, coming six days after tens of thousands of people took to the streets in Valencia city calling for his resignation. Criticism mounted after local authorities failed to send emergency alerts sooner to cell phones on Oct. 29, in spite of Spain’s national weather forecaster having issued the highest level of warning as early as 7:30 a.m. that day. Spaniards, particularly in Valencia, have been critical of other aspects of the regional and national government’s initial response to the disaster. In hard-hit Paiporta, survivors pelted mud at Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez, King Felipe VI, and Mazón when the three leaders visited the town days after the floods. Mazón’s reputation took another beating this week when local media reported that he had a three-hour lunch with a journalist on the day of the storm, while some towns and villages had already started to fill with water. On Friday, Mazón repeated a previous assertion that a national body responsible for measuring river flows had provided insufficient warnings, and said the magnitude of the deluge was hard to foresee. 'It is legitimate to question in general whether the (emergency) system responded how we believed it should,' Mazón said, adding that it had not. Spain’s decentralized government tasks regional authorities with handling civil protection. Regional governments can ask the national government in Madrid, now led by the Socialists, for extra resources, and use information from the national weather forecaster and other agencies. Science minister Diana Morant who belongs to the Socialist party called Mazon’s speech an 'act of political cowardice.' She said the Popular Party should dismiss him. Most of the victims of last month's floods died in small towns just outside Valencia. Official data released on Thursday showed that almost half were 70 years or older.	https://apnews.com/article/valencia-floods-spain-mazon-3b0cfbb67f5a8d8a9ba3696766c26d04	2024-11-15T11:19:19-08:00

Pope asks Church of Rome to help address housing crisis ahead of Holy Year in 2025	ROME (AP) — Pope Francis on Friday called on the diocese of Rome to respond to a growing housing crisis in the Eternal City, wading into the debate about rising rental prices that has only grown more acute with Holy Year celebrations in 2025. Francis has written to the city's church leaders and religious order priests for any available church properties to be used for the homeless or residents facing possible eviction because of rising rents. The letter reflected something of the paradox facing the Vatican: Francis’ yearlong jubilee is expected to bring more than 30 million pilgrims to Rome to celebrate the Holy Year. That has had the predictable effect of driving up demand for short-term apartment rentals, particularly near the Vatican. That demand, in turn, has only accelerated the trend of local residents moving out or being priced out as owners turn their properties over to short-term property agents, such as Airbnb and other platforms that cater to tourists. It's a trend that is happening in other Italian cities, including Florence and Venice, and across Europe, leading to protests by local residents. In his letter, Francis noted that Rome’s Catholic institutions were preparing to provide shelter to millions of pilgrims for the jubilee. But he asked them to also 'make a courageous gesture of love' to Romans by offering up any unused housing or apartments. 'I want all diocesan realities that own real estate to offer their contribution to stem the housing emergency with signs of charity and solidarity to generate hope in the thousands of people in the city of Rome who are in a condition of precarious housing,' Francis wrote. The Catholic Church is a major property owner in Rome, with a portfolio including commercial and residential real estate as well as church-owned convents and monasteries. ___ Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

Winston Churchill portrait returns to Ottawa after international art caper	OTTAWA, Ontario (AP) — A stolen portrait of Winston Churchill that was swapped with a forgery during the pandemic has returned to its rightful place, after two Ottawa police detectives traveled to Rome to retrieve it. Police said 'The Roaring Lion' was stolen from the Fairmont Chateau Laurier hotel in Ottawa, sometime between Christmas Day 2021 and Jan. 6, 2022, and replaced with a forgery. The swap was only uncovered months later, in August, when a hotel worker noticed the frame wasn't hung properly and looked different than the others. Genevieve Dumas, the hotel’s general manager, unveiled the portrait in a ceremony on Friday. 'I can tell you that it is armed, locked, secured,' Dumas said. 'It’s not moving,' she said, adding that staff accidentally triggered the alarm on Thursday, while they hung it up, 'and I’m sure they heard it on Parliament Hill.' The most famous depiction of Churchill, known as 'The Roaring Lion,' appears on the U.K.’s five-pound banknote and shows a glowering wartime prime minister staring into the camera. Renowned photographer Yousuf Karsh snapped the iconic portrait in 1941 in the Speaker’s office just after Churchill delivered a rousing wartime address to Canadian lawmakers. Toward the end of his life, Karsh signed and gifted the portrait to the hotel, where he had lived and worked. The portrait had been sold through an auction house in London to a private buyer, and both seller and buyer were unaware that it had been stolen, police said. Police have now charged a man from the town of Powassan, Ontario, with forgery, theft and trafficking. That case is before the courts. The portrait’s return was a widely anticipated event, with a ceremony held in a room packed with attendees including Ottawa's mayor. Nicola Cassinelli, a lawyer in Genoa who bought the stolen artwork, sent a message. 'The magnificent photograph by Yousuf Karsh captures in the eyes of Sir Winston Churchill the pride, the anger and the strength of the free world. And it represents, better than any other, the desire for the triumph of good over evil.' And despite the 'extraordinary privilege' of having the portrait hang in his home, 'The Roaring Lion,' he said, belongs to the public.	https://apnews.com/article/stolen-winston-churchill-portrait-returned-b230594156879725968ab0bd1f276846	2024-11-15T09:35:28-08:00	
Austria says Russia's Gazprom will cut off natural gas supply this weekend	VIENNA (AP) — Russia’s state-owned natural gas company Gazrom will cut off supplies to Austria’s OMV utility early Saturday, Austria’s chancellor said, adding that his country’s underground gas storage was full and that it had alternative, non-Russia supplies. The cutoff follows OMV’s announcement that it would stop paying for Gazprom gas to its Austrian arm to offset a 230 million-euro ($242 million) arbitration award it won over an earlier cutoff of gas to its German subsidiary. Chancellor Karl Nehammer said Friday that Austria has a secure supply of alternative fuel and that 'no one will freeze this winter, no home will be cold.' 'Our gas storage facilities are full and we have sufficient capacity to obtain gas from other regions,' Nehammer said in a hastily called appearance at the chancellery. 'We cannot be blackmailed.' OMV gave notice of the cutoff in a trading statement on the Central European Gas Hub website. An OMV spokesperson couldn't be reached for comment. Gazprom had no immediate comment. The cutoff will cost Gazprom around $2.5 billion a year in annual revenue, said Janis Kluge, an expert on the Russian economy at German Institute for International and Security Affairs. Oil and gas exports, and the associated tax revenues are the most important single source of cash for the Kremlin. Russia cut off most natural gas supplies to Europe in 2022, citing disputes over payment in rubles, a move European leaders described as energy blackmail over their support for Ukraine against Russia's invasion. The cutoff sent gas prices soaring and contributed to a sharp burst of inflation that went into double digits in October 2022, but has since subsided. European governments had to scramble to line up alternative supplies at higher prices, much of it liquefied natural gas brought by ship from the U.S. and Qatar. Still, three European countries — Austria, Slovakia and Hungary — have been getting supplies of Russian gas through a pipeline through Ukraine despite the fighting there. Ukraine has said it won't continue gas transit past Jan. 1, leaving those countries looking for other supplies. Austria gets the bulk of its natural gas from Russia, as much as 98% in December 2023, according to Energy Minister Lenore Gewessler. The European Union has ended most supplies of Russian oil, but hasn't directly sanctioned Russian gas. Instead, it has set a nonbinding goal of 2027 for member countries to stop importing Russian gas. In 1968, Austria became the first Western European country to import gas from the Soviet Union, and its dependence on Russian energy increased in the following decades. During a visit by Russia’s President Vladimir Putin to Austria in 2018, an agreement for the extension of natural gas supplies to Austria until 2040 was signed by Gazprom head Alexey Miller and Rainer Seele, then chairman of the OMV Executive Board. The contract obligates the Austrian side to pay for the gas whether it takes delivery or not. Gewessler convened a commission to look into the circumstances under which it was signed and legal possibilities to get out of it. ___ David McHugh reported from Frankfurt, Germany.	https://apnews.com/article/austria-russia-gazprom-gas-supplies-8851d55ac8bb8621a1ee11ae9e476d68	2024-11-15T09:13:49-08:00	
Rauw Alejandro on Puerto Rico, salsa and working with Pharrell on his new album	MIAMI (AP) — Last year, Puerto Rican superstar Rauw Alejandro was in outer space. 'Playa Saturno,' the 2023 surprise spinoff to his 2022 record 'Saturno,' brought his R&amp;B-informed reggaeton to new heights on an extraterrestrial concept album. A year later, and he's completely shifted gears, finding inspiration in classic sounds and imagery, pulling from a '60s and '70s Nuyorican cool — while still doing what he’s always done best: contorting familiar genres into something novel. Alejandro is releasing his fifth studio album 'Cosa Nuestra,' a title borrowed from Willie Colón and Héctor Lavoe's 1969 album, on Friday. (There's a sample of Colón and Lavoe's 'Qué Lío' in the opening title track.) It marries classic Puerto Rican instruments and genres, like salsa and merengue, with more modern sounds like reggaeton. And it is amplified by a number of inventive samples — like Frankie Ruiz's 'Tú Con Él' — and all-star collaborators: Pharrell Williams, Bad Bunny and Feid among them. Alejandro's created a kind of character for the release, whom he calls 'Raúl Alejandro,' a nod to his father and the early migration of Puerto Ricans to New York, which he explored in an interview conducted in Spanish and English ahead of the 2024 Latin Grammys. It has been translated and edited for clarity and brevity. AP: You've really challenged yourself on this album. How does it feel to get to the next level? ALEJANDRO: I'm really happy. I think it's a different stage of my career. More elevated as a music producer, writer, artist in general. I've also grown a lot as a person. I feel more mature in every part of my life. This feels like the whole experience of my career in one whole project. AP: If New York is homebase for hip-hop, Carolina, Puerto Rico, is a home for reggaeton. How would you describe its influence? ALEJANDRO: Puerto Rico is in every part of the books, in history. We're in every part of the world. You mentioned hip-hop, Puerto Ricans were involved in that as well. But before that, you see a salsa world — the Fania All-Stars. New York in the '70s was a lot of jazz, soul. It's just a lot of music from New York and Puerto Ricans have always been there. Reggaeton comes from Carolina, Puerto Rico. It's the birthplace. It's special. I feel really proud to be a Puerto Rican. In this new era, I went to New York and found great inspiration for my music but kept my essence. I keep the island at the forefront of everything that I do. I'm thinking about what it means to be Puerto Rican, our culture. AP: Is it that pride that made you want to go back to your roots on this album? ALEJANDRO: Of course, definitely. Salsa was a world that I had yet to explore. When I'm doing new projects, I try to look back at what I've accomplished and what I have yet to do. I try to analyze my whole career and see what's going to be next with Rauw, what's going to be new; I take my time at the studio, at home, studying, analyzing. This project has a lot of salsa influence, a lot of African influence. I'm using the live instruments (for) the first time. Instruments traditional to Puerto Rico like the cuatro, puertorriqueño guitar, maraca, el guiro, la conga, all mixed with the digital sounds. And, you know, it sounds fresh. It sounds rich and perfect for dancing. AP: Pharrell Williams is a producer on this album, and he's featured on 'Committed.' What was it like working with him? ALEJANDRO: We started working in New York and we finished in Paris. We have a few other records at the studio, but 'Committed,' this song is really special. He was the one that wrote that, the hook. And he was like, 'Rauw, you have to sing it in English.' And I was like, 'I've never done this before. It's new.' It was challenge for me, you know, singing a whole hook in English. I told him, 'OK, but I’ll do the verse in Spanish.' I like to write my own verses and wanted to make it my own. We fused our ideas together. He understood the whole concept of the project. He's a legend, a mentor. You're going to hear more music from Pharrell and Rauw. AP: How much of you is in the character you created for this album? ALEJANDRO: I always liked the classic stuff, and being really elegant, since I was a kid. I always like to be in a suit and tie. I found excuses to be really dressed up. And I think this character borrows that from Rauw Alejandro. I'm 31. I feel like a young spirt with an old soul, living in New York, the city's vibes, the musical influence of the '60s, the long coats ... the swag of Puerto Rico. I can't deny it. I think the way that you dress is the way you express yourself and your art. AP: You, Bad Bunny,Residente and other Puerto Rican artists have been vocal about issues facing the island. Why is it important to talk about? ALEJANDRO: I'm from Puerto Rico, that's my island. As a civilian, I'm always going to fight for my rights and give my opinion, share a positive message, be an example for the next generation and try to find the best solutions for my island. I think Benito (Bad Bunny) and Rene (Residente) have always done the same. I think everyone expresses themselves in different ways, but as an artist, the people can always count on me to share a message. ___ Associated Press Music Writer Maria Sherman contributed to this report from New York.	https://apnews.com/article/rauw-alejandro-interview-cosa-nuestra-puerto-rico-602c9804346dfd487b13d81dac330977	2024-11-15T07:53:12-08:00	
Man and four teenagers convicted of murdering two boys in mistaken identity case	LONDON (AP) — Four teenagers and an adult male were convicted in a British court on Friday of stabbing two boys to death in a case of mistaken identity -- killings that shocked a country already anxious about knife crime. Mason Rist, aged 15, and Max Dixon, 16, were chased down and attacked by four youths as they went to get pizza near their homes in Bristol, southwest England, on Jan. 27 this year. During the five-week trial at Bristol Crown Court, prosecutor Ray Tully said Rist and Dixon were the victims of a rivalry between their Knowle West neighborhood and the nearby Hartcliffe district. He said they were wrongly identified by their attackers as being responsible for throwing bricks at a house in Hartcliffe earlier on the day of the attack. The pair were set upon with machetes, a bat and a sword in an attack that lasted just half a minute. They died hours later in a hospital. On Friday, the jury found all five defendants guilty of the murders of both boys. Three defendants aged 15, 16 and 17 — who cannot be identified because of their ages — were convicted along with Riley Tolliver, 18, and getaway driver Antony Snook, 45. All five will be sentenced at a later date. Vicky Cook, chief crown prosecutor for southwest England, said the deaths of Rist and Dixon had 'sent shockwaves through their community and the city of Bristol.' She added: 'Regardless of which individuals caused any of the fatal injuries, the evidence shows that all five (defendants) were working together and share joint responsibility for this terrible crime.' Dixon’s mother, Leanne Ekland, said: 'Today’s outcome doesn’t change the fact that two families go home without their boys. We can now hopefully begin to process that and remember them both and the happy memories that both families have of Max and Mason. 'I wish we didn’t have to be here today, but we’ve got some sort of justice for our boys.'	https://apnews.com/article/uk-teenagers-killed-knife-crime-79b3a833485e0dd5c9ab4314a112d01f	2024-11-15T07:51:49-08:00	
Jake Paul beats 58-year-old Mike Tyson as the hits don't match the hype	ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) — The boos from a crowd wanting more action were growing again when Jake Paul dropped his gloves before the final bell, and bowed toward 58-year-old Mike Tyson. Paying homage to one of the biggest names in boxing history didn't do much for the fans that filled the home of the NFL's Dallas Cowboys on Friday night. Paul won an eight-round unanimous decision over Tyson as the hits didn't match the hype in a fight between the 27-year-old YouTuber-turned-boxer and the former heavyweight champion in his first sanctioned pro bout in almost 20 years. All the hate from the pre-fight buildup was gone, replaced by boos from bewildered fans hoping for more from a fight that drew plenty of questions about its legitimacy long beforehand. The fight wasn't close on the judge's cards, with one giving Paul an 80-72 edge and the other two calling it 79-73. 'Let’s give it up for Mike,' Paul said in the ring, not getting much response from a crowd that started filing out before the decision was announced. 'He’s the greatest to ever do it. I look up to him. I’m inspired by him.' Tyson came after Paul immediately after the opening bell and landed a couple of quick punches but didn't try much else the rest of the way. Even fewer rounds than the normal 10 or 12 and two-minute rounds instead of three, along with heavier gloves designed to lessen the power of punches, couldn't do much to generate action. Paul was more aggressive after the quick burst from Tyson in the opening seconds, but the punching wasn't very efficient. There were quite a few wild swings and misses. 'I was trying to hurt him a little bit,' said Paul, who improved to 11-1. 'I was scared he was going to hurt me. I was trying to hurt him. I did my best. I did my best.' Tyson mostly sat back and waited for Paul to come to him, with a few exceptions. It was quite the contrast to the co-main event, another slugfest between Katie Taylor and Amanda Serrano in which Taylor kept her undisputed super lightweight championship with another disputed decision. Paul said he eased up starting about the third round because he thought Tyson was tired and vulnerable. 'I wanted to give the fans a show, but I didn't want to hurt somebody that didn't need to be hurt,' Paul said. It was the first sanctioned fight since 2005 for Tyson, who fought Roy Jones Jr. in a much more entertaining exhibition in 2020. Paul started fighting a little more than four years ago. 'I didn’t prove nothing to anybody, only to myself,' Tyson said when asked what it meant to complete the fight. 'I'm not one of those guys that looks to please the world. I'm just happy with what I can do.' The fight was originally scheduled for July 20 but had to be postponed when Tyson was treated for a stomach ulcer after falling ill on a flight. His record is now 50-7 with 44 knockouts. Tyson slapped Paul on the face during the weigh-in a night before the fight, and they traded insults in several of the hype events, before and after the postponement. The hate was long gone by the end of the anticlimactic fight. 'I have so much respect for him,' Paul said. 'That violence, war thing between us, like after he slapped me, I wanted to be aggressive and take him down and knock him out and all that stuff. That kind of went away as the rounds went on.' The fight set a Texas record for combat sports with a gate of nearly $18 million, according to organizers, and Netflix had problems with the feed in the streaming platform's first live combat sports event. Netflix has more than 280 million subscribers globally. 'This is the biggest event,' Paul said. 'Over 120 million people on Netflix. We crashed the site.' Among the celebrities were basketball Hall of Famer Shaquille O'Neal and former NFL star Rob Gronkowski, along with Cowboys owner Jerry Jones. Evander Holyfield and Lennox Lewis, two foes with Tyson's heyday, greeted him in his locker room before the fight. Tyson infamously bit Holyfield on the ear in a 1997 bout, and appeared to have one of his gloves in his mouth several times during the Paul bout. He was asked if he had problem with his mouthpiece. 'I have a habit of biting my gloves,' Tyson said. 'I have a biting fixation.' 'I've heard about that,' the interview responded. Mario Barrios retained the WBC welterweight title in a draw with Abel Ramos on the undercard. Barrios was in control early before Ramos dominated the middle rounds. Each had a knockdown in the 12-round bout. It was the first fight for the 29-year-old Barrios since he was appointed the WBC welterweight champ when Terence Crawford started the process of moving up from the 147-pound class. Barrios, who is 29-2-1, won the interim WBC title with a unanimous decision over Yordenis Ugás last year. The 33-year-old Ramos is 28-6-3. ___ AP sports: https://apnews.com/sports	https://apnews.com/article/mike-tyson-jake-paul-fight-0e1597caaae41254df029eb9fe62cc39	2024-11-15T07:50:08-08:00	
AP PHOTOS: An AP photographer captures a bomb falling on a building in his childhood neighborhood	BEIRUT (AP) — As a bomb descended on a multi-story apartment building in Beirut's Tayouneh area Friday, hundreds of onlookers gathered in the street at a traffic roundabout several hundred meters (yards) away. Among them was an Associated Press photographer. Hassan Ammar had donned his flak jacket and helmet and rushed to the scene — taking up his position at a safe distance using a long lens — after the Israeli military issued an evacuation warning with a map marking the targeted building. The Israeli army said the building contained facilities belonging to the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah. However, Ammar had different associations with the building. He had grown up less than a kilometer (less than 0.6 miles) from it, and he had been there on multiple occasions. When he was a child during the 15-year Lebanese civil war that ended in 1990, 'this building was on the front line between Muslim and Christian neighborhoods,' the so-called Green Line, he recalled. But in later years, Ammar said, he visited the building 'many times.' There was a notary public on the first floor, and next door was a sports supply store where he used to shop. Next to the building was a cemetery where his family had loved ones buried. 'I know it very well,' he said. Ammar said he even once considered renting an apartment in the building that was struck, or in the building next door — now he can't remember which — because it had a beautiful view of the pine trees in Horsh Beirut, a large public park nearby. When he heard the sound of the projectile overhead, Ammar had his camera already trained on the building set to a high shutter speed, and he began snapping photos immediately, capturing the bomb in mid-air and as it descended, ending with a massive explosion. There were no immediate reports of casualties, but much of the building was reduced to rubble. Richard Weir, a senior crisis, conflict and arms researcher at Human Rights Watch, reviewed close-up photos of Friday's bomb to determine what type of weapon was used. 'The bomb and components visible in the photographs, including the strake, wire harness cover, and tail fin section, are consistent with a Mk-84 series 2,000-pound class general purpose bomb equipped with Boeing’s Joint Directed Attack Munition (JDAM) tail kit,' he said. Weir added that 'the use of large, air-dropped bombs, like these, that produce wide-area effects in populated areas carries significant risks to civilians and civilian objects.' A few weeks earlier, another AP photographer, Bilal Hussein, had captured a nearly identical scene as a similar powerful bomb hit a nearby building in Beirut. The Israeli military has maintained that it takes measures to reduce civilian casualties by issuing warnings before many of its strikes in Lebanon. More than 3,200 people have been killed in Lebanon during 13 months of fighting between Israel and Hezbollah — most of them since mid-September — of whom about 27% were women and children, according to Lebanon’s Health Ministry.	https://apnews.com/article/lebanon-beirut-israel-hezbollah-strike-bomb-photos-a9fd45ca7c75171e1e6983e2b389d595	2024-11-15T07:39:45-08:00	
Dutch coalition parties gather in crisis talks after last week's soccer violence	THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — The leaders of coalition parties in the Dutch government dominated by hard-right leader Geert Wilders gathered Friday for crisis talks following reports that the finance state secretary was resigning over what she saw as denigrating comments on immigrants after Israeli fans were assaulted after a soccer game in Amsterdam. Wilders last Wednesday blamed Moroccans for attacks on Israeli soccer fans, claiming that 'we saw Muslims hunting Jews' and added it was fueled by 'Moroccans who want to destroy Jews.' He said those convicted of involvement should be deported if they have dual nationality. Dutch media said that Morocco-born Nora Achahbar of centrist New Social Contract party would announce her resignation as finance secretary later Friday. The news couldn't immediately be independently confirmed. While lawmakers condemned antisemitism and agreed that perpetrators of the violence should be prosecuted and handed harsh punishments, opposition legislators accused Wilders of pouring oil on the fire. Wilders, whose party became the biggest in last year's election, also sowed some dissent within the four-party coalition with his comments. Late Friday, video and photos appeared of party leaders arriving at the Catshuis residence of Prime Minister Dick Schoof. The leader of the Green-left-Socialist opposition, Frans Timmermans, lauded Achahbar even before any move was announced. 'In this government, racist remarks are the order of the day. This government is not for all Dutch people,' he said. Violence erupted in the Dutch capital before and after last week’s soccer match between Ajax Amsterdam and Maccabi Tel Aviv. Fans from both sides were involved in unrest. A number of Maccabi fans chanted anti-Arab slogans and ripped a Palestinian flag off a building, while some men carried out 'hit-and-run' attacks on Maccabi fans and people they thought were Jews, according to a 12-page report on the violence issued by Amsterdam authorities.	https://apnews.com/article/netherlands-government-crisis-wilders-far-right-riots-fd4f44c8bf944dbd60c9fdd52663b1f9	2024-11-15T07:37:57-08:00	
Police clash with students in Turin as anti-government rallies draw support across Italy	ROME (AP) — At least 15 police officers were taken to hospital on Friday following clashes in Turin with students protesting against Italy's far-right government of Giorgia Meloni. The demonstration in the northern Italian city was one of several held across the country, including in Rome and Milan, on what the organizers dubbed 'No Meloni Day.' The officers in Turin were injured when they were exposed to fumes from a rudimentary explosive device used during the scuffles, local authorities reported. The protests across Italy were organized by students opposed to the policies of the Meloni government, particular in education. Some protests were coupled with demonstrations against arms sales to Israel and in support of the people of Gaza. Clashes broke out in Turin when police blocked students trying to break through a security cordon and reach the door of the prefecture building in the central Piazza Castello. Demonstrators used flagpoles to attack police vehicles outside the offices of public broadcaster RAI, while an effigy of education minister Giuseppe Valditara was set on fire. At the city's popular museum of cinema, protesters stripped the Italian tricolor from the entrance and replaced it with a Palestinian flag. In Milan, a photo of Meloni was splashed with blood-red paint during a rally, while protesters in Rome chanted slogans including 'Every day is a No-Meloni day.' Responding to the violent scenes in Turin, Meloni said: 'Today too we witnessed unacceptable scenes of violence and chaos in some squares by the usual troublemakers.' Expressing solidarity with the injured officers in a social media post, she wrote: 'I hope that certain politicians stop protecting or justifying this violence and unambiguously join in condemning such serious and unworthy episodes.'	https://apnews.com/article/italy-students-government-protests-education-d26606c68b6a066ba74f56180cf20f18	2024-11-15T07:08:43-08:00	
The Latest: Trump tests Congress with his controversial Cabinet picks	President-elect Donald Trump and Republicans say they have a mandate to govern. But an uneasy question is emerging: Will there be any room for dissent in the U.S. Congress? Even before taking office, Trump is challenging the Senate, in particular, to dare defy him over the nominations of Matt Gaetz, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and other controversial choices for his Cabinet and administration positions. Follow the AP’s Election 2024 coverage at: https://apnews.com/hub/election-2024. Here’s the latest: Hakeem Jeffries says transparency is always best when it comes to high-ranking officials But he’s not ready to declare whether the House Ethics Committee should give its investigative report of former Rep. Matt Gaetz to senators weighing his nomination for attorney general. Jeffries says he needs to speak with the lead Democrat on the panel and he doesn’t want to get ahead of that discussion. Jeffries also says he won’t respond to every Trump nomination or statement, calling it a 'distraction.' He encouraged the Senate to fulfill its constitutional responsibilities. 'Advice and consent should mean something. It certainly doesn’t mean rolling over and giving any administration, Democratic or Republican, what they want,' Jeffries said. House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries questions Trump's Cabinet picks House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries says Donald Trump promised on the campaign trail that America would have the best administration possible, but his nominees so far raise the question of whether the president-elect is fulfilling that promise. Speaking to reporters Friday, Jeffries particularly singled out Trump’s choice of anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to lead the Department of Health and Human Services. 'Is Robert F. Kennedy Jr., by way of example, the best America has to offer? Will he and others give us the best opportunity to make a difference in the lives of the American people?' He says the answer is clear. Transgender-rights advocates say the election of Trump and his allies marks a major setback Election victories for Donald Trump and other candidates whose campaigns demeaned transgender people reinforced a widespread backlash against trans rights. For America’s LGBTQ+-rights movement, it adds up to one of the most sustained setbacks in its history. For transgender Americans, it’s personal: There is palpable fear of potential Trump administration steps to further marginalize them. But there's also a spirit of resilience — a determination to persevere in seeking acceptance and understanding. 'I just went through an election where I couldn’t watch a sports event on TV without seeing a commercial where trans people were portrayed as monsters,' said Jennifer Finney Boylan, a transgender author who teaches at Barnard College in New York. Anti-trans momentum has been growing for several years, with Republican-governed states enacting dozens of laws restricting trans people’s options for medical care, sports participation and public restroom access. Voters held divided views on Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. That's according to AP VoteCast, a survey of more than 120,000 voters nationwide. About 4 in 10 voters had a very or somewhat favorable opinion of Kennedy, and roughly 4 in 10 had a very or somewhat unfavorable view. Slightly more than 1 in 10 did not know enough about Kennedy to have an opinion. Kennedy’s anti-vaccine stance may be at odds with many voters’ interests, if he’s confirmed to lead the Health and Human Services Department. About half of voters said they wanted the government to be 'more involved' in ensuring children are vaccinated for childhood diseases. About one-quarter said the government’s current involvement is 'about right,' and only about 2 in 10 wanted the government less involved. Roughly 3 in 10 parents of children under 18 years old want the government less involved, compared to about 2 in 10 voters without children under 18. About 6 in 10 voters said they wanted the government more involved in ensuring that Americans have health care coverage, and a similar share said they wanted the government to take a bigger role in forgiving medical debt. About three-quarters wanted the government more involved in lowering the cost of prescription drugs. In an election where pocketbook concerns were a primary focus, more than half of voters said they were 'very concerned' about their health care costs. WHO says global vaccine efforts have saved an estimated 154 million lives In a report released in April, the U.N.’s World Health Organization said global immunization efforts have saved an estimated 154 million lives over the past half-century, roughly equivalent to six lives every minute of every year. More than 101 million lives were those of children. Asked in Geneva on Friday about the nomination of anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, WHO spokesperson Dr. Margaret Harris told reporters it’s up to member countries — the U.S. is one of the biggest funders and sources of technical support to the U.N. agency — to decide who they appoint. She also said vaccines were 'absolutely critical' to good health outcomes. 'Vaccines are the reason so many more of us have survived to adulthood than we ever did before,' said Harris. 'Vaccine-preventable diseases have disappeared in the communities … where vaccination has been widely available and has been widely taken up.' Trump is already testing Congress and daring Republicans to oppose him After a resounding election victory, delivering what President-elect Donald Trump and Republicans said is a mandate to govern, an uneasy political question is emerging: Will there be any room for dissent in the U.S. Congress? Trump is laying down a gauntlet even before taking office challenging the Senate, in particular, to dare defy him over the nominations of Matt Gaetz, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and other controversial choices for his Cabinet and administration positions. The promise of unified government, with the Republican Party’s sweep of the White House and GOP majorities in the House and Senate, is making way for a more complicated political reality as congressional leaders confront anew what it means to line up with Trump’s agenda.	https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-election-kamala-harris-bcc2651d77e1a79ecf3bd1e33c038956	2024-11-15T06:51:21-08:00	
Moody's downgrades Mexican government's outlook to 'negative' over weakening of judiciary and debt	MEXICO CITY (AP) — Mexico’s president lashed out Friday at Moody’s ratings service, after it downgraded the Mexican government’s debt outlook to 'negative.' Moody’s said it had downgraded the government's debt outlook from 'stable' to 'negative' because newly approved laws in Mexico could weaken the judiciary branch and checks and balances. It reaffirmed Mexico’s Baa2 overall credit rating, but said increased government debt represented a risk for Mexico. It also mentioned the possibility that the government will have to transfer more money to shore up the highly indebted state-owned oil company, Pemex. 'Deteriorating debt affordability and further government spending rigidity make fiscal consolidation challenging, following this year’s widening in the government deficit,' Moody’s wrote, 'a deviation from a longstanding track record of low deficits regardless of economic pressures.' President Claudia Sheinbaum said that ratings agencies often have a 'bias of origin' against the economic policies her party adopted under former President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, who took office on Dec. 1, 2018. 'Many times these ratings agencies are aimed at issuing evaluations starting from an economic model,' Sheinbaum said. 'Starting in 2018, the economic model in our country changed. Many times these ratings have this bias of origin.' Under López Obrador, who was Sheinbaum's political mentor, the government began transferring large amounts of money to the state-run oil company, started large building projects and implemented cash handout programs. That led to federal budget deficits of about 6% of Mexico's gross domestic product in 2024. Sheinbaum ruled out enacting new taxes next year and said she would rely on increasing tax collection from existing sources. But in the 2025 federal budget submitted by her administration to Congress on Friday, it was clear that sizable budget deficits would continue for some time. Mexico's treasury department said it would aim to reduce the deficit to 3.9% of GDP in 2025, but it was unclear if it could achieve that: López Obrador left behind a lot of unfinished train and oil refinery projects, and Sheinbaum has expanded benefit programs for the elderly. 'The government will only gradually narrow the deficit in coming years,' Moody's wrote. The 2025 budget says Mexico's outstanding federal debts would finish 2025 at around 51.4% of GDP. But that doesn't include a lot of government oil company and pensions debts. It also predicted the economy would grow by between 2 and 3% in 2025, something analysts say is optimistic, given that Mexico's GDP grew by only 1.5% in the third quarter of 2024. The government is also expecting the exchange rate to improve to 18.70 pesos to $1 and inflation to fall to 3.5%, both of which also seem highly optimistic. The Mexican peso has dropped in value to about 20.40 to $1 in recent days. The election of Donald Trump in the United States may also weigh on Mexico's economy, given his past threats to close the border and impose tariffs. Moody's said Mexico has been benefitting from 'nearshoring' investments by companies seeking to move production closer to the U.S. market. But it noted 'additional downside risks to investment dynamics could emerge ahead of the revision of United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) in 2026, particularly if modifications to the agreement’s rule of origins, labor specifications and other US trade policies towards Mexico changed in a way that durably limit the country’s exports.' 'Lower economic growth and, consequently, government revenue would undermine fiscal consolidation efforts,' it continued. Perhaps most importantly, Sheinbaum has continued López Obrador's push to implement changes to the judiciary that will make all federal judges stand for election in 2025 and 2026. The U.S. government and business groups worry that could weaken the independence of the courts, and make them vulnerable to political pressure. Critics say that could also allow drug cartels to fund judges' election campaigns and get their own candidates elected. 'The constitutional overhaul risks eroding checks and balances of the country’s judiciary system, with potential negative impact to Mexico’s economic and fiscal strength,' it continued, adding the changes 'have the potential to materially alter the checks and balances and the business operating environment in the country.' ____ Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america	https://apnews.com/article/mexico-economy-credit-rating-moodys-outlook-negative-78eb3e4f9d45af051c9378dae26eee4c	2024-11-15T06:27:17-08:00	
Aid groups say Italy-Albania migration deal violates medical ethics	ROME (AP) — More than a dozen humanitarian organizations that provide health care to migrants denounced Italy’s migration deal with Albania on Friday as a violation of the code of medical ethics, and urged health workers not to cooperate with it. The deal, the centerpiece of Premier Giorgia Meloni’s crackdown on human trafficking, calls for some male migrants rescued at sea to have their asylum cases processed while they are detained at two holding centers in Albania, a non-EU nation. Italy, which has long demanded Europe shoulder more of the continent’s migration problem, has held up the deal with Albania as a model for the continent and a strong deterrent to would-be refugees setting out on smugglers’ boats from North Africa for a better life. But the five-year deal, which is budgeted to cost Italy 670 million euros ($730 million), has run into a series of obstacles and legal challenges that have prevented even a single migrant from being processed in Albania. First, construction delays prevented the opening of the centers for several months. Then, after the first two batches of 20 men were brought to Albania this month, Italian courts issued rulings that resulted in them being taken to Italy anyway. The matter is now before the European Union’s Court of Justice in Luxembourg, which has been asked to rule on whether the men come from countries deemed safe for return. All 20 hail from Bangladesh and Egypt. On Friday, the non-governmental organizations released a detailed analysis of the procedures to screen migrants first on Italian naval ships, and then in the Albanian centers, to determine if they are 'vulnerable.' Only men deemed to be not 'vulnerable' are to be sent to Albania. The aid groups said there were no proper facilities or instruments to make such a determination. And regardless, practically everyone who has set off on the dangerous Mediterranean crossing has endured the type of physical, psychological or sexual abuse that should disqualify them from Albanian detention, they said. The migrants should be considered at risk of post-traumatic stress disorder or other serious physical and mental health consequences, they said. The groups criticized the international organizations that are apparently cooperating with the project, identifying the International Organization of Migration and the Knights of Malta’s Italian rescue corps as being 'complicit' in human rights violations. 'The Italy-Albania Protocol violates the code of medical ethics and human rights and puts the physical and psychological health of migrants at risk,' the statement said. There was no immediate reply to emails sent to the IOM or the Knights' press offices seeking comment. The Italian government has said the rights of the migrants would be fully guaranteed in the Albanian centers and the deal has been blessed by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen as an example of 'out-of-box thinking' to tackle the migration issue. But human rights groups say it sets a dangerous precedent and represents a violation of Italy's obligations under international law. The U.N. refugee agency has agreed to supervise the first three months of the agreement and one of its teams is conducting an 'independent mission' on board the transfer ship to monitor the screening process. The legal challenges have come despite the small number of people impacted so far. Even though the centers were built to house as many as 3,000 migrants a month, just 20 were transferred in the first two separate ship passages, only to be sent to Italy after the Rome courts intervened. The statement was signed by Doctors’ Without Borders, Emergency, Sea-Watch, SOS Mediterranee and other aid groups.	https://apnews.com/article/italy-albania-migration-ba37f514ca4cefab40047722006a2978	2024-11-15T05:59:54-08:00	
Germany's Scholz discusses Ukraine with Russia's Putin in first such call in 2 years	BERLIN (AP) — German Chancellor Olaf Scholz spoke Friday with Russian President Vladimir Putin, the Kremlin leader’s first publicly announced conversation with the sitting head of a major Western power in nearly two years. Scholz urged Putin to be open to negotiations with Ukraine, his office said. The Kremlin leader responded that any peace deal should acknowledge Russia's territorial gains and security demands, including that Kyiv renounce joining NATO. Government spokesman Steffen Hebestreit said Scholz urged Putin in the hour-long call to withdraw his troops and end the full-scale invasion launched in February 2022. The conflict will reach its 1,000th day on Tuesday, and exiled Russian opposition leaders, including Alexei Navalny's widow, Yulia, have set an antiwar rally for Sunday in Berlin. 'The chancellor urged Russia to be willing to negotiate with Ukraine with the aim of achieving a just and lasting peace and stressed Germany’s unwavering determination to support Ukraine in its fight against Russian aggression for as long as necessary,' Hebestreit said in a statement. The new communication between Scholz and Putin — their first since December 2022 — comes at a time of widespread speculation about what the new administration of President-elect Donald Trump will mean for Ukraine. Scholz faces a political crisis at home and has called for a vote of confidence next month, with an early election in February. Washington has been Ukraine's biggest military backer, but Trump has repeatedly questioned the amount of aid being given to Ukraine. While Trump has suggested he could settle the war quickly, Ukraine has ruled out giving up any territory to Moscow in return for peace. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy criticized Scholz’s call to Putin, calling it 'a Pandora’s box' and would only serve to make Russia less isolated. 'Now there may be other conversations, other calls. Just a lot of words. And this is exactly what Putin has wanted for a long time,' Zelenskyy said in his nightly address. 'It is crucial for him to weaken his isolation. ... And to engage in negotiations, ordinary negotiations, that will lead to nothing.' Scholz condemned Russian air raids on Ukrainian civilian infrastructure and warned that the deployment of North Korean troops to Russia to fight in the war would mark a serious escalation. The U.S., South Korea and Ukraine say North Korea has sent thousands of troops to Russia to support its war against Ukraine. The Kremlin said Germany initiated the call, during which the leaders had a 'detailed and frank exchange of opinions on the situation in Ukraine.' Putin blamed 'the current crisis' on what he called NATO’s 'long-standing aggressive policy aimed at creating an anti-Russian stronghold on Ukrainian territory while ignoring our country’s security interests and trampling on the rights of Russian-speaking residents,' a Kremlin readout said. Putin also said Russia remains open to resuming peace talks, pointing to conditions he laid out in June that included Kyiv renouncing its bid to join NATO and withdrawing troops from the four Ukrainian regions that Moscow illegally annexed in 2022. 'Possible agreements should take into account the interests of the Russian Federation in the security sphere, proceed from new territorial realities, and most importantly, eliminate the root causes of the conflict,' the readout said. Putin, who earlier this month said it's up to Western leaders to resume contact with Russia if they want, also noted the 'unprecedented degradation' in bilateral relations between Germany and Russia, the Kremlin statement said, while noting that leaders also discussed the situation in the Middle East. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the leaders had a 'detailed' and 'frank' exchange of opinions but added that 'there is no talk about convergence of opinions.' The two sides agreed to remain in contact after the call. ___ Associated Press writer Jamey Keaten contributed.	https://apnews.com/article/scholz-putin-germany-russia-phone-call-f18e42dc5418fb682682d7dae69483a5	2024-11-15T05:27:43-08:00	
Poland moves to reopen embassy in North Korea closed during COVID pandemic	WARSAW, Poland (AP) — Poland said Friday it is reactivating its embassy in North Korea’s capital to become the second Western nation after Sweden to resume operations that were suspended due to Pyongyang's tight COVID-19 restrictions. The move by NATO member Poland opens another channel of communication between NATO states and Pyongyang, a close ally of Russia, which has provided troops to fight in Ukraine. New NATO member Sweden resumed activity at its Pyongyang mission in September. Polish Foreign Ministry representatives were in the North Korean capital this week as Poland seeks to restore its diplomatic presence. 'The visit is of a technical and political nature and one of its main goals is to restore the permanent diplomatic presence,' the ministry said. The Polish embassy was closed in December 2020 after the North Korean authorities announced a complete closure of the state border due to COVID-19. That made the normal work of the diplomatic mission 'impossible,' the ministry said. Sweden, which became a NATO member in March, also represents the interests of other countries who don't have embassies in Pyongyang at its mission that reopened in September. The restored diplomatic channels will be helpful given developments in the war in Ukraine. NATO and the European Union — to which Poland and Sweden also both belong — have been ramping up efforts to persuade China to help get North Korea to stop sending troops and other support to Russia to back its war on Ukraine. Up to 12,000 North Korean troops have been sent to Russia’s Kursk border region to help beat back Ukrainian forces there, according to U.S., South Korean and Ukrainian intelligence assessments. NATO says Russia is sending missile technology to North Korea in return.	https://apnews.com/article/poland-embassy-reopens-north-korea-533adb5cd7d4d9454638e8f2a3c53548	2024-11-15T05:03:45-08:00	
Biden to meet South Korean and Japanese leaders amid growing worries about North Korea	LIMA, Peru (AP) — President Joe Biden is gathering South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol and Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba for talks Friday amid heightened concerns about North Korea’s growing military partnership with Russia and Pyongyang’s stepped-up cadence of ballistic missile tests. The meeting on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Peru comes as North Korea has deployed thousands of troops to Russia to help Moscow try to claw back land in the Kursk border region that Ukraine seized earlier this year. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un also ordered a series of ballistic missile tests in the lead-up to this month’s U.S. election and is claiming progress on efforts to build capability to strike the U.S. mainland. White House officials are concerned that Pyongyang could be dialed up for more provocative action ahead of President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration and the early days of his administration. 'I do not think we can count on a period of quiet with the DPRK,' said White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan, using the initials for North Korea's formal name. 'The possibility of a seventh nuclear test remains ever present and something we’re vigilant for. The transitions have historically been time periods when the DPRK has taken provocative actions both before and after the transition from one president to a new president.' The introduction of North Korean troops to the Russia-Ukraine conflict comes as Moscow has seen a favorable shift in momentum in the grinding war on its neighbor. Trump has signaled that he could push Ukraine to agree to give up some land seized by Russia to find an end to the conflict. Up to 12,000 North Korean troops have been sent to Russia, according to U.S., South Korean and Ukrainian intelligence assessments. U.S. and South Korean intelligence officials say North Korea also has provided Russia with significant amounts of munitions. South Korea’s spy agency said last month that North Korea had sent more than 13,000 containers of artillery, missiles and other conventional arms to Russia since August 2023 to replenish its dwindling weapons stockpiles. Sullivan said the U.S., Japanese and South Korean leaders would use their meeting to discuss the North Korean soldiers in Russia and ensure their three countries are acting in a 'coordinated way.' Friday’s meeting will be the first face-to-face engagement between Biden and Ishiba, who took office on Oct. 1, replacing his unpopular predecessor Fumio Kishida. Ishiba pledged to pursue a military buildup plan under a 2022 security strategy adopted by his predecessor, which calls for a counterstrike capability with long-range cruise missiles, a break from its self-defense only principle. Ishiba said he will seek to improve cooperation between Japanese and U.S. troops. The trilateral talks are a follow-up on a partnership launched at a historic 2023 meeting between Biden, Yoon and Kishida at the U.S. presidential retreat at Camp David, Maryland. Biden nudged Japan and South Korea to put aside years of historic animosity and strengthen economic and security ties as the countries confront the threat from North Korea as well increasing military assertiveness by China in the Pacific. The three countries signed a pledge agreeing to consult, share information and align their messaging with each other in the face of a threat or crisis. Sullivan said the Biden administration is working to ensure the three-country cooperation is 'an enduring feature of American policy.' He expects it would continue under Trump, noting its bipartisan support, but acknowledged it was up to the incoming president’s team. Both Yoon and Ishiba already have reached out to Trump and are aiming to keep their countries’ relationships with the incoming administration on steady footing amid the heightened tensions. North Korea fired a barrage of short-range ballistic missiles into the sea just hours before Election Day in the United States. Those launches came days after Kim supervised a flight test of the country’s newest intercontinental ballistic missile designed to reach the U.S. mainland. In response, the United States flew a long-range B-1B bomber in a trilateral drill with South Korea and Japan on Sunday in a show of force. Biden also will meet Peru President Dina Boluarte on Friday. ___ Associated Press writer Rebecca Santana in Washington contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/biden-south-korea-japan-north-korea-russia-24e1a85916b650c130c5b167cd3c8b79	2024-11-15T03:47:58-08:00	
Workers at Canada's national postal service go on strike Friday, disrupting deliveries	TORONTO (AP) — Workers at Canada's national postal service are on strike after failing to reach a negotiated agreement with Canada Post. The Canadian Union of Postal Workers said early Friday approximately 55,000 workers are striking, claiming little progress has been made in the bargaining process. The work stoppage will disrupt mail service ahead of the busy holiday season. The union issued a 72-hour strike notice earlier in the week, saying it’s been asking for fair wages, safer working conditions and other improvements over nearly a year of bargaining. 'We still believe we can achieve negotiated collective agreements, but Canada Post must be willing to resolve our new and outstanding issues,' CUPW said in a statement. Canada Post served the union with the lockout notice not long after but had said it didn’t intend to lock workers out. The government corporation released a statement early Friday morning confirming that customers will experience delays. Mail and parcels will not be delivered for the duration of the strike, and some post offices will be closed. Canada Post says shutting down facilities will affect its national network, with processing and delivery of mail possibly needing time to return to normal once the strike is over. Ahead of the strike deadline, federal Labor Minister Steven MacKinnon said he formally appointed the director general of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Services as a special mediator to help in the talks. 'We are making sure that these two groups have everything they need to reach a deal,' he said in a post on X.	https://apnews.com/article/canada-post-strike-national-mail-service-cupw-mackinnon-b74d2a5c128dc96540e72aa0f170b6b7	2024-11-15T03:40:45-08:00	
Police and protesters clash in Georgia's separatist Abkhazia region over pro-Moscow property measure	TBILISI, Georgia (AP) — Protesters opposing a measure that would have allowed Russians to buy property in the Georgian territory of Abkhazia stormed into the separatist region's parliament building and presidential office on Friday and clashed with police. At least eight people were injured in the melee in the regional capital of Sukhumi on the Black Sea, news reports said. The parliament was to have discussed ratifying the measure but postponed the session as the demonstrators gathered outside the gates of the government compound. They rammed a gate with a truck and streamed inside the grounds, throwing rocks at police who responded with tear gas. President Aslan Bzhania's office later announced he was preparing an order to remove the measure from consideration. Police then left the parliament building but demonstrators remained, demanding Bzhania's resignation. Demonstrators also stormed into the presidential administration building and vowed to remain there until Bzhania resigned and snap elections were called. Most of Abkhazia broke away from Georgia in fighting that ended in 1993, and Georgia lost control of the rest of the territory in the short war with Russia in 2008. Russia recognizes Abkhazia as an independent country, but many Abkhazians are concerned that the region of about 245,000 people is just a client state of Moscow. Opponents of the property agreement say it would drive up prices of apartments and boost Moscow's dominance in the region. Abkhazia's mountains and Black Sea beaches make it a popular destination for Russian tourists, and the demand for holiday homes could be strong. The arrest of five opposition figures at a similar demonstration Monday set off wide protests the next day in which bridges leading to Sukhumi were blocked.	https://apnews.com/article/georgia-russia-abkhazia-protest-parliament-ae03ce7d8335e6a20316a95d0f7acc84	2024-11-15T03:40:23-08:00	
Italian hotel manager rejects Israeli couple's reservation, accusing Israeli people of 'genocide'	ROME (AP) — The manager of a small hotel in northern Italy refused a reservation made by an Israeli couple, accusing Israeli people of being 'responsible for genocide.' Jewish groups decried the incident as an example of antisemitism. The couple had booked two nights for the beginning of November at the Hotel Garni Ongaro in Selva di Cadore, a mountain village surrounded by the Dolomites, using the Booking.com online reservation platform. A day before their departure, they received a message from the hotel’s staff: 'Good morning. We inform you that the Israeli people as those responsible for genocide are not welcome customers in our structure.' The hotel manager then invited the tourists to cancel their reservation, adding they 'would be happy to grant free cancellation.' The manager has since closed his Facebook profile, and he wasn't immediately available for comment. 'I feel infinite sadness for the ignorance shown by certain people,' Dario Calimani, the president of the Jewish Community of Venice, said on Thursday. 'When you don’t agree with what Israel does, you spread hatred against all Israelis.' The incident caught the attention of the Israeli Foreign Ministry, which has confirmed they were investigating the matter. Booking.com said Friday that it had removed the hotel from its platform. 'We do not tolerate discrimination of any kind and in the rare event that we are alerted to discriminatory behavior from a property, we investigate immediately and will remove the listing from our platform, just as we have done in this instance,' the travel site said in an email sent to The Associated Press. The Veneto region governor, Luca Zaia, dubbed the incident as 'extremely serious.' 'I feel deeply disturbed and I’m shocked by what has happened,' he said. 'Veneto must guarantee its doors are open to all.' Incidents of antisemitism have increased in Italy to about 80 or 90 a week in the last year, from about 30 a week before the war in Gaza started, the Antisemitism Observatory reported. Last month, a mural depicting a survivor of last year’s Oct. 7 attack by Hamas on Israel, which killed around 1,200 people in Israel, was vandalized in Milan. More than 43,000 people have been killed in Israel’s military campaign in Gaza, more than half of them women and children, according to Palestinian health officials, who don’t distinguish between civilians and combatants when recording the deaths. Word of the hotel incident came on the same day that former hostages held by Hamas in Gaza and their relatives met at the Vatican with Pope Francis. Sharone Lifshitz, whose father remains a hostage after her mother was freed last year, responded to a request for comment, saying it was wrong to consider all Israelis as agents of the Israeli government, just as it would be wrong to consider all Americans as agents of the U.S. government. The tendency to do that, she added, was a sign of antisemitism. 'Not all people agree with the current government of Italy, and yet I don’t think the people of Italy traveling the world would be subjected personally as individuals to the actions of their government,' she said. 'The government of Israel does many things that I personally and absolutely and categorically don’t agree with as an individual … and yet we are taken as agents of our government,' she said.

Rafael Nadal's farewell at the Davis Cup: When he'll play, how to watch on TV and more to know	MALAGA, Spain (AP) — Rafael Nadal is getting set to retire from professional tennis after one last event: He will be part of Spain's team at the Davis Cup finals that start Tuesday in front of a home crowd in Malaga. The 38-year-old Nadal has been on tour for more than 20 years and is the second member of the so-called Big Three of men’s tennis to stop playing. Roger Federer announced his departure in 2022, while Novak Djokovic is still near the top of the game. 'It is obviously a difficult decision, one that has taken me some time to make. But in this life, everything has a beginning and an end,' said Nadal, who has been practicing daily in Malaga since last week. 'And I think it is the appropriate time to put an end to a career that has been long and much more successful than I could have ever imagined.' Here is a guide to Nadal's goodbye to tennis: How to watch Rafael Nadal and the rest of the Davis Cup on TV —In the U.S.: Tennis Channel —Other countries are listed here. When will Nadal play his final match? It's not entirely clear when Nadal's last match will come, in large part because the Davis Cup is a team event and what's now known as the 'Final 8' begins at the quarterfinal stage. Spain will get things started against the Netherlands on Tuesday. Win that, and the Spaniards would advance to the semifinals Friday against Canada or Germany (who meet each other Wednesday). The other quarterfinals are scheduled for Thursday: the United States vs. Australia, and defending champion Italy vs. Argentina. The championship round will be Sunday. There are two matches in singles and one in doubles in each matchup; the first country to win twice progresses. The other wild card in all of this: No one knows for sure whether Nadal will be chosen by Spain's captain, David Ferrer, to play singles, doubles, both or — theoretically possible, if unlikely — neither. 'If I really don’t see myself ready to have a chance of winning in singles,' Nadal said, 'I’ll be the first who won’t want to play.' Who are Nadal’s teammates on Spain’s Davis Cup team? Nadal is joined on Spain’s roster by four-time Grand Slam champion Carlos Alcaraz, Roberto Bautista Agut, Pedro Martinez and Marcel Granollers. Why is Nadal retiring now? The biggest reason he is ready to move on is that he has been bothered by a series of injuries, including a painful foot, abdominal muscle problems and a hip issue that required surgery last season. 'The reality is that it has been some difficult years, these last two especially,' Nadal said. 'I don’t think I have been able to play without limitations.' When was Nadal’s most recent match? Nadal has not played much at all each of the last two seasons because of injuries; he's just 12-7 in 2024. His most recent official competition anywhere came in early August at the Paris Olympics, where he lost to his longtime rival — and eventual gold medalist — Djokovic in the second round of singles, and reached the doubles quarterfinals alongside Alcaraz before bowing out. Nadal also played two exhibition matches in Saudi Arabia last month. How many Grand Slam titles did Nadal win? Nadal finishes with 22 Grand Slam singles titles, behind only Djokovic's 24 among men in the history of tennis, and ahead of Federer's 20. The breakdown: 14 at the French Open, four at the U.S. Open, two at Wimbledon, two at the Australian Open. Nadal's last major championship came in Paris in 2022, when he needed nerve-numbing injections in his left foot. Has Nadal helped Spain win the Davis Cup in the past? Nadal has been a part of Spain's team at some stage of the Davis Cup during five years when the country won the title — in 2004, 2008, 2009, 2011 and 2019. That first title came after a teenage Nadal defeated then-No. 2-ranked Andy Roddick as Spain got past the U.S. 'I am very excited that my last tournament will be the final of the Davis Cup and representing my country,' Nadal said. 'I think I’ve come full circle, because one of my first great joys as a professional tennis player was the Davis Cup final in Seville in 2004.' ___ AP tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/tennis	https://apnews.com/article/rafael-nadal-retirement-davis-cup-watch-guide-78e557ac78e8a3ea2cfbca9fbadfcfa8	2024-11-15T02:00:25-08:00	
Lebanon's prime minister asks Iran to help secure a cease-fire in Israel-Hezbollah war	BEIRUT (AP) — Lebanon’s caretaker prime minister on Friday asked Iran to help secure a cease-fire in the war between Israel and Hezbollah and appeared to urge it to convince the militant group to agree to a deal that could require it to pull back from the Israel-Lebanon border. The prime minister made the comments in talks with Ali Larijani, a top adviser to Iran’s supreme leader, Ali Khamenei. Larijani’s visit to Lebanon comes as the United States continued pushing both sides to agree to a deal to end 13 months of exchanges of fire between Israel and Hezbollah. Iran is a main backer of Hezbollah and for decades has been funding and arming the Lebanese militant group. Hezbollah began firing rockets into northern Israel the day after Hamas’ surprise attack into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023 ignited the war in Gaza – prompting exchanges between the two sides ever since. Since late September, Israel dramatically escalated its bombardment of Lebanon, vowing to cripple Hezbollah and end its barrages in Israel. More than 3,300 people have been killed in Lebanon by Israeli fire – 80% of them in the past month -- Lebanon’s Health Ministry says. According to Lebanese media, U.S. Ambassador Lisa Johnson handed over a draft of a proposed cease-fire deal to Lebanese Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri, who has been leading the talks representing Hezbollah. A Lebanese official confirmed that Beirut has received a copy of a draft proposal based on U.N. Security Council resolution 1701, which ended the last Israel-Hezbollah war, in the summer of 2006. That resolution, among other things, said that only the Lebanese army and U.N. peacekeepers should operate in southern Lebanon, meaning Hezbollah would have to end its presence there. That provision was never implemented. Lebanon accuses Israel of also violating the resolution by maintaining hold of a small, disputed border area and conducting frequent military overflights over Lebanon. The Lebanese official did not give details other than to say Israel was insisting that some guarantees be included. The official spoke on condition of anonymity, because they weren’t authorized to speak to the media about the ongoing talks. The U.S. Embassy refused to either confirm or deny the reports. In talks with Larijani, caretaker Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati urged Iran to help implement resolution 1701. He said the Lebanese government wants the war to end and the resolution to be implemented 'in all its details,' according to a statement on the talks issued by his office. Mikati, who in recent weeks has become more critical of Iran’s role in Lebanon, also said the government wants Iran to help Lebanon’s national unity and not take any stance backing one party against another. Iran’s backing for Hezbollah has helped the group, which is the most powerful faction among Lebanon’s Shiite Muslims, dominate the country’s politics the last decade. After meeting Mikati and Berri, Larijani said his visit’s main aim was 'to loudly say that we will stand by Lebanon’s government and people.' Asked if he was trying to thwart U.S. cease-fire mediation, Larijani said, 'We are not trying to blow up any effort, but we want to solve the problem and we will stand by Lebanon, whatever the circumstances.' Larijani held similar talks a day earlier in Syria with President Bashar Assad. Syria’s state news agency said that Assad and Larijani discussed the 'ongoing aggression on Palestine and Lebanon and the necessity of stopping it.' While Larijani was in Beirut, Israeli forces carried out a new strike on the southeastern edge of the city. Images taken by an Associated Press photographer showed a rocket about to strike an 11-story residential building in Beirut’s Tayouneh neighborhood – then a blast of flame erupts from the side of the building. Much of a lower level of the building was smashed to rubble. There were no immediate reports of casualties. The Israeli military had issued a warning before the attack, saying it was a facility that belonged to Hezbollah. Near the eastern Lebanese city of Baalbek, rescue teams continued searching through the rubble Friday at the site of an Israeli strike the night before that hit a civil defense center in the town of Douris. So far, the bodies of 13 employees and volunteers with the Lebanese Civil Defense had a been recovered, the agency said, as well as some other remains that will require DNA testing. Israel expanded its operations in Lebanon even as it continues its campaign in the Gaza Strip, vowing to destroy Hamas, which is also backed by Iran. Funerals were held Friday for 11 Palestinians killed Thursday in a series of Israeli airstrikes in and around the central Gaza Strip city of Deir al-Balah. Two children were among the dead, seen with the other dead by an AP reporter. On Thursday, the U.N. Security Council’s 10 elected members circulated a draft resolution demanding 'an immediate, unconditional and permanent cease-fire' in Gaza. The U.S., Israel’s closest ally, holds the key to whether the U.N. Security Council adopts the resolution. The four other permanent members — Russia, China, Britain and France — are expected to support it or abstain. The Israel-Hamas war began after Palestinian militants stormed into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing about 1,200 people — mostly civilians — and abducting 250 others. Israel’s bombardment and ground offensives since then have killed more than 43,000 people in Gaza, Palestinian health officials say. The officials don’t distinguish between civilians and combatants but say more than half of those killed have been women and children. ___ Rising reported from Bangkok.

At least 10 people were killed in a fire at a nursing home in northeastern Spain	MADRID (AP) — At least 10 people died and others were injured in a blaze at a nursing home near Zaragoza in northeastern Spain, before firefighters managed to extinguish the flames, local authorities said Friday. The alarm was raised just before 5 a.m. on Friday in Villafranca de Ebro, about 28 kilometers (18 miles) from the city of Zaragoza. Two people remained in critical condition, officials said. The cause of the fire was not yet known. Local media said 82 people had been living in the Jardines De Villafranca nursing home, which focused on treating people with dementia and mental health issues. Jorge Azcón, head of the regional government of Aragon — which includes Villafranca de Ebro, population 840 — told reporters outside the nursing home that an investigation would be opened into the cause of the fire. The immediate priority was to transfer the remaining uninjured residents to other facilities, he said, including one in the city of Huesca, about 90 kilometers (56 miles) away. Volga Ramírez, mayor of Villafranca de Ebro, told reporters that intense smoke from the blaze was likely responsible for the deaths. 'It is due to smoke inhalation,' Ramírez said, 'not because they were burned.' She said that the remaining residents of the center had been safely evacuated. Zaragoza fire chief Eduardo Sánchez told reporters that firefighters had extinguished the blaze that came from one room of the center. A fire door had prevented the blaze from spreading to the other half of the building, he said. On X, formerly Twitter, Azcón announced that all government events in the Aragon region were cancelled for the day. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez wrote on X that he was 'shocked by the tragedy' and expressed condolences to the victims. The fire took place just weeks after devastating flash floods in the Spanish region of Valencia killed more than 200 people and destroyed thousands of homes. The floods were the worst natural disaster in Spain's recent history.	https://apnews.com/article/spain-fire-nursing-home-zaragoza-065863dafb5fbedbd4692131e0d1e540	2024-11-14T23:17:02-08:00	
UK economic growth slows down sharply in the third quarter	LONDON (AP) — U.K. economic growth slowed down sharply in the third quarter of the year, official figures showed Friday. The Office for National Statistics said growth during the July to September period was just 0.1%. That was lower than the 0.5% recorded in the previous three-month period and below market expectations for 0.2%. The statistics agency said output in September shrank, a development that is likely to fuel accusations from critics of the new Labour government talked the economy down in its first few weeks in power. Labour, which took office in July for the first time in 14 years, has made raising economic growth its number one priority over the next five years. Since the global financial crisis in 2008-9, the British economy has underperformed relative to previous years.	https://apnews.com/article/britain-growth-labour-economy-reeves-output-q3-53fbbd31d5b959e94b453455a3b6823d	2024-11-14T22:38:53-08:00	
Shanghai, Tokyo, New York, Houston spew most greenhouse gas of world cities	BAKU, Azerbaijan (AP) — Cities in Asia and the United States emit the most heat-trapping gas that feeds climate change, with Shanghai the most polluting, according to new data that combines observations and artificial intelligence. Seven states or provinces spew more than 1 billion metric tons of greenhouse gases, all of them in China, except Texas, which ranks sixth, according to new data from an organization co-founded by former U.S. Vice President Al Gore and released Friday at the United Nations climate talks in Baku, Azerbaijan. Nations at the talks are trying to set new targets to cut such emissions, and figure out how much rich nations will pay to help the world with that task. Using satellite and ground observations, supplemented by artificial intelligence to fill in gaps, Climate Trace sought to quantify heat-trapping carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide, as well as other traditional air pollutants worldwide, including for the first time in more than 9,000 urban areas. Earth's total carbon dioxide and methane pollution grew 0.7% to 61.2 billion metric tons with the short-lived but extra potent methane rising 0.2%. The figures are higher than other datasets 'because we have such comprehensive coverage and we have observed more emissions in more sectors than are typically available,' said Gavin McCormick, Climate Trace's co-founder. Plenty of big cities emit far more than some nations Shanghai's 256 million metric tons of greenhouse gases led all cities and exceeded those from the nations of Colombia or Norway. Tokyo's 250 million metric tons would rank in the top 40 of nations if it were a country, while New York City's 160 million metric tons and Houston's 150 million metric tons would be in the top 50 of countrywide emissions. Seoul, South Korea, ranks fifth among cities at 142 million metric tons. 'One of the sites in the Permian Basin in Texas is by far the No. 1 worst polluting site in the entire world,' Gore said. 'And maybe I shouldn’t have been surprised by that, but I think of how dirty some of these sites are in Russia and China and so forth. But Permian Basin is putting them all in the shade.' China, India, Iran, Indonesia and Russia had the biggest increases in emissions from 2022 to 2023, while Venezuela, Japan, Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States had the biggest decreases in pollution. The dataset — maintained by scientists and analysts from various groups — also looked at traditional pollutants such as carbon monoxide, volatile organic compounds, ammonia, sulfur dioxide and other chemicals associated with dirty air. Burning fossil fuels releases both types of pollution, Gore said. This 'represents the single biggest health threat facing humanity,' Gore said. Climate talks wrestle with fossil fuel interests Gore criticized the hosting of climate talks, called COPs, by Azerbaijan, an oil nation and site of the world's first oil wells, and by the United Arab Emirates last year. 'It’s unfortunate that the fossil fuel industry and the petrostates have seized control of the COP process to an unhealthy degree,' Gore said. 'Next year in Brazil, we’ll see a change in that pattern. But, you know, it’s not good for the world community to give the No. 1 polluting industry in the world that much control over the whole process.' Brazil President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has called for more to be done on climate change and has sought to slow deforestation since returning for a third term as president. But Brazil last year produced more oil than both Azerbaijan and the United Arab Emirates, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. At a press conference Friday by the Alliance of Small Island States, it's Chair, Cedric Schuster, said the negotiating bloc feels the need to remind everyone else why the talks matter. 'We’re here to defend the Paris agreement,' Schuster said, referring to the climate deal in 2015 to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit). 'We’re concerned that countries are forgetting that protecting the world’s most vulnerable is at the core of this framework.' ___ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

South Korean opposition leader gets a suspended jail term for violating election law	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korean opposition leader Lee Jae-myung was convicted of violating election law and sentenced to a suspended prison term Friday by a court that ruled he made false statements while denying corruption allegations during a presidential campaign. If it stands, the ruling could significantly shake up the country’s politics by potentially unseating Lee as a lawmaker and denying him a shot at running for president in the next election. But Lee, who faces three other trials over corruption and other criminal charges, is expected to challenge any guilty verdict and it remains unclear whether the Supreme Court would decide on any of the cases before the presidential vote in March 2027. Lee told reporters that he plans to appeal Friday’s verdict at the Seoul Central District Court, which gave him a sentence of one year in prison, suspended for two years. Under South Korean law, Lee would lose his legislative seat and be barred from running in elections for five years if he receives either a penalty exceeding a 1 million won ($715) fine for election law violations or any prison sentence for other crimes. 'There are still two more courts left in the real world, and the courts of public opinion and history are eternal,' he said, apparently referring to plans to take the case to the Supreme Court. 'This is a conclusion that’s impossible to accept.' Lee, a firebrand liberal who narrowly lost the 2022 election to conservative President Yoon Suk Yeol, had steadfastly denied wrongdoing. Choo Kyung-ho, the floor leader of Yoon’s People Power Party, said the verdict showed that 'justice was alive' and called for the judiciary to conclude the case swiftly. The ruling drew intense media coverage and seemingly thousands of protesters. Surrounded by police lines, Lee’s supporters and critics occupied separate streets near the court, shouting opposing slogans and holding signs that said 'Lee Jae-myung is innocent' and 'Arrest Lee Jae-myung.' There were no immediate reports of major clashes. Prosecutors indicted Lee in 2022 over charges that he made false claims related to two controversial development projects in the city of Seongnam, where he was mayor from 2010 to 2018, while campaigning as the presidential candidate for the Democratic Party. One of the comments cited by prosecutors is related to suspicions that Seongnam city in 2015 changed the land-use designation to allow a housing project on a site previously preserved as green space due to lobbying by private developers. Lee said during a parliamentary hearing in October 2021 that the city was instead 'coerced' by the national government to make the change to the site in the district of Baekhyeon-dong. Prosecutors say there’s no evidence to back Lee’s claim, which has been denied by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport. Prosecutors also cited a TV interview Lee gave in December 2021, when he said he didn’t know a senior official at Seongnam city’s urban development arm during his time as mayor. Lee spoke a day after the official was found dead amid an investigation into a property development project in the district of Daejang-dong, which reaped huge profits for a small asset management firm and its affiliates and raised suspicions about possible corrupt links between them, city officials and politicians. Prosecutors argued that Lee was lying to the public to distance himself from the controversies and improve his chances of winning the election. They had sought a two-year prison sentence for him. The court found Lee guilty over the comments related to the Baekhyeon-dong project, saying it was clear that the city’s decision to change the site’s land-use designation wasn’t based on demands by the land ministry. It acquitted Lee on most of the charges related to his Daejang-dong comments, citing a lack of evidence. 'When false information is distributed to voters during an election process, that could prevent voters from making proper choices and risks distorting the will of the people and damaging the function of the electoral system,' the court said in a statement. 'Such actions cannot be taken lightly.' The same court on Nov. 25 will rule on another case against Lee. He is accused of suborning perjury by allegedly pressuring a Seongnam city employee to give false testimony in a different court case in 2019. The testimony was meant to downplay his 2003 conviction that, when as a lawyer, he had helped a TV journalist impersonate a prosecutor to secure an interview with then-Seongnam Mayor Kim Byung-ryang over suspected corruption in 2002. While running for Gyeonggi Province governor in 2018, Lee claimed he had been wrongly accused over the incident, prompting prosecutors to indict him on a charge of making false statements during an election campaign. Lee was acquitted in 2019, partially based on the testimony of the city employee, who had worked as Kim's secretary and said he contemplated dropping charges against the journalist to make Lee the main culprit of the incident. Prosecutors indicted Lee on the perjury charges in October last year, presenting transcripts of telephone conversations that they said showed Lee persuading the employee to testify in court that he was framed. A third and more significant trial at the Seoul Central District Court involves various criminal allegations stemming from Lee’s days as Seongnam mayor, including that he provided unlawful favors to private investors involved in the two development projects seen as dubious. Lee is also facing a trial at the Suwon District Court over allegations that he pressured a local businessman into sending millions of dollars in illegal payments to North Korea as he tried to set up a visit to that country that never materialized. While denying wrongdoing, Lee has accused the government of Yoon, a prosecutor-turned-president, of pursuing a political vendetta. Yoon, who has seen his approval ratings drop to the 20s in recent weeks, is grappling with his own political scandal. It centers around allegations that Yoon and first lady Kim Keon Hee exerted inappropriate influence on the People Power Party to pick a certain candidate to run for a parliamentary by-election in 2022 at the request of election broker Myung Tae-kyun, who was arrested this week.	https://apnews.com/article/south-korean-opposition-leader-lee-jae-myung-suspended-prison-sentence-321aa7e383e409edff4bd5924ad73776	2024-11-14T21:44:07-08:00	
Van falls off mountain highway in Nepal, killing 8 and injuring 4	KATHMANDU, Nepal (AP) — A passenger van veered off a mountain road early Friday in western Nepal, killing eight people and injuring four others, the army said. The van rolled about 200 meters (650 feet) below the road before dawn near the village of Shaileshikar, about 600 kilometers (375 miles) west of the capital, Kathmandu. The van was returning to the village with people who had been to a festival in a nearby town. The army said it used a helicopter to rescue the four injured people and flew them to a hospital for treatment. It was not clear what caused the crash. Nepal is covered with mountains where roads are narrow and poorly maintained, and autumn and winter weather conditions also make driving difficult and dangerous.	https://apnews.com/article/nepal-passenger-van-crash-2921bdf81b26bcb920a7f077e9d1e6fb	2024-11-14T21:09:44-08:00	
Activists at COP29 spend weeks planning demos. But they can feel stifled by rules and restrictions	BAKU, Azerbaijan (AP) — In the nosebleed seats of a nearly-empty Baku Olympic stadium coated with a layer of dust, activists used a giant banner to beam the words 'Pay Up' to the world. The protest took weeks of thought and planning, but most of the attendees at this year's U.N. climate talks didn't see or hear it — except for maybe some in the COP29 presidency offices right below. The majority of the people involved in deciding the financial future of climate action at the talks remained in the sprawling venue, under white tarps with no windows. It’s 'really hard to make our demands heard,' said Bianca Castro, a climate activist from Portugal. She’s been to several COPs in the past and remembers years when there were thousands of protestors in the streets, and a multitude of strikes and actions throughout the event. But at the stadium's seats, they were told exactly where and when they could stand and chants were restricted. A United Nations climate change spokesperson said that the action was in a part of the venue that isn’t open to participants, and involved extensive dialogue among the participants, facility managers and health and safety officers. Still, Castro said the difficulty of making an impact meant many are 'losing hope in the in the process.' People involved in protests say they have felt a trend in recent years of stricter rules from the United Nations organizers with COPs being held in countries whose governments limit demonstrations and the participation of civil society. And some community spaces for prepping and organizing have had to resort to going underground because of security concerns. But the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change — who run the COPs — say the code of conduct that governs the conferences has not changed, nor has the way it's applied, and COP29 organizers say there's space across the venue for participants to 'make their voices heard in line with the UNFCCC code of conduct and Azerbaijan law safely and without interference.' Despite the challenges and what some see as a depressing mood, activists say it remains a critical time to speak up about the historical and present-day injustices that are in desperate need of money and attention. It's especially true this year at a COP where the theme is finance, because voices from the Global South play a pivotal role in bringing ambitious demands to the negotiating table, said Rachitaa Gupta, who coordinates a global network of organizations advocating for climate justice. But she said that there have been more and more defamation rules each year that prohibit protestors from calling out specific countries or names. 'We do feel that the restrictions have reached a stage where it’s a constant battle on what we can say,' Gupta said. Activists can’t name specific countries, people or businesses in line with the UNFCCC’s code of conduct. Meanwhile, across town in a downtown Baku building, activists paint, snip fabric and sculpt with cardboard and papier-mache in a quest for visually compelling symbols of climate action. The art space was once a place of community, where people came to pour their feelings into a creative outlet, said Amalen Sathananthar, coordinator at a collective called the Artivist Network. But now his team keeps the art space private and doesn't reveal its location because of security concerns. Restrictions, though, can breed creativity among the artists designing the banners, flags and props that demonstrators use during protests. In the absence of naming specific people or countries, or carrying country flags, they instead have to come up with other imagery to get their messages across. One of this year’s pieces was a larger-than-life snake for an action with the slogan 'Weed Out the Snakes,' calling attention for the removal of big polluters and fossil fuel lobbyists at climate talks, something that's been 'outrageous,' said Jax Bongon, whose organization is part of the Kick Big Polluters Out coalition. 'Would you invite an arsonist to put out the fire?' It's an issue that's 'particularly hard for me as someone from the Philippines,' Bongon added, but called it 'really uplifting' to watch the action come together despite challenges. Demonstrators hoisted the fire-colored serpent with on their shoulders and heads. Together, their hisses filled the tent, bringing the snake to life. 'I think that the only reason people dare to do this is because, one, they're struggling on how to be heard,' said Dani Rupa, one of the artists working in Baku with The Artivist Network. 'But, two, that there is like creative support for them to be able to do this.' The Artivist Network have been doing this for a long time, attending COPs unofficially since the early 2000s and officially since they formalized in 2018. Sathananthar's seen the multitude of ways protestors have had to argue with host countries and the UNFCCC governing body to get space for activism. But this year, especially, he said it's a struggle — 'negotiations within negotiations' that have had Sathananthar staying up late into the night in talks and on occasion have left him 'fuming.' A spokesperson for UNFCCC said they've 'been a recognized global leader in ensuring safe civic spaces at COPs for many years' which normally doesn't happen at other intergovernmental events. Still, activists feel that only being able to protest within certain areas throughout the venue — when previous years have seen mass street marches in host cities — can be frustrating. 'Every action you now have to fight for desperately,' Sathananthar said. 'We fought to get these spaces and we will fight to keep them.' ___ Follow Melina Walling on X at @MelinaWalling.

Trump's pick of Rubio as America's top diplomat jolts Latin America, long accustomed to US neglect	MIAMI (AP) — Growing up in Miami among Cuban exiles who fled Fidel Castro's revolution, Sen. Marco Rubio developed a deep hatred of communism. Now as President-elect Donald Trump's choice for America's top diplomat, he's set to bring that same ideological ammunition to reshaping U.S. policy in Latin America. As the first Latino secretary of state, Rubio is expected to devote considerable attention to what has long been disparagingly referred to as Washington’s backyard. The top Republican on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and a longtime member of the Foreign Relations Committee, he's leveraged his knowledge and unmatched personal relationships to drive U.S. policy in the region for years. For decades since the end of the Cold War, Latin America has faded from the U.S. foreign policy agenda even as U.S. adversaries like Russia, Iran and especially China have made deep inroads. If confirmed, the Florida Republican is likely to end the neglect. But Rubio’s reputation as a national security hawk, embrace of Trump’s plan for mass deportation of migrants and knack for polarizing rhetoric is likely to alienate even some U.S. allies in the region unwilling to fall in line with the incoming president’s America First foreign policy. 'Typically, Latin America policy is left to junior officers,' said Christopher Sabatini, a research fellow at Chatham House in London. 'But Rubio’s reflexes are firmly focused on the region. He’ll be paying attention, and governments are going to have to be more cooperative in their larger relationship with the U.S. if they want to draw close.' Rubio, through a Senate spokeswoman, declined to comment about his foreign policy goals. But his views on Latin America are well known and contrast sharply with the Biden administration’s preference for multilateral diplomacy and dialogue with U.S. critics. Taking cues from his boss, Rubio's main focus in the region is likely to be Mexico, on trade, drug trafficking and migration. Once a sponsor of bipartisan reforms allowing undocumented migrants a path to citizenship, Rubio transformed himself during Trump's first administration into a loyal supporter of his calls for increased border security and mass deportation. Rubio has said little about Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, who took office last month. But he was a fierce critic of her predecessor, Andres Manuel López Obrador, who in 2022 defiantly skipped the U.S.-organized Summit of the Americas in Los Angeles for a gathering of leftist leaders in Cuba. Rubio accused López Obrador of capitulating to drug cartels and serving as an 'apologist for tyranny' in Cuba, Venezuela and Nicaragua. The Mexican president responded by calling Rubio a 'racist.' Despite the snub, the Mexican president was welcomed by President Joe Biden to the White House three weeks later as a 'friend' and 'partner.' 'That won’t happen under Rubio,' said Sabatini. 'He keeps close tabs on who is following his policy preferences.' Rubio, 53, has long had Trump's ear on Latin America — and hasn't hesitated to use that access to promote his hard-line agenda. He's been one of the most outspoken critics of Russian and Chinese economic, political and military outreach in the region, and is expected to punish countries who cozy up to America's geopolitical rivals, or those who fail to support Israel. When Trump canceled what would have been his first presidential visit to Latin America in 2018, Rubio was there to fill the void, sitting for meetings and photo ops at the Summit of the Americas in Peru with regional leaders from Argentina, Haiti and elsewhere. 'There's nobody in the U.S. Senate who comes close to having his affinity and depth of knowledge on Latin America,' said Carlos Trujillo, Rubio's close friend and former U.S. ambassador to the Organization of American States. 'Not only does he have personal relationships with dozens of officials, some of them for decades, but he has vetted almost every U.S. ambassador deployed to the region. It's a significant advantage.' Among those eager to work with Rubio is Argentine President Javier Milei, whose combative style, attacks on institutions and transformation from TV personality to far-right leader have drawn comparisons with Trump. Another ally is El Salvador's Nayib Bukele, whose crackdown on gang violence that once drove millions of Salvadoran migrants to the U.S. has drawn praise from Rubio. Rubio hasn't hesitated to use his power to bully leftist leaders he sees as harming U.S. national security interests. Even democratically elected moderates have been targets. Earlier this year, he slammed Chilean President Gabriel Boric, a critic of Israel's actions in Gaza, for allegedly providing safe haven for Hezbollah financiers, calling him 'one of the leading anti-Israel voices in Latin America.' In 2023, he called Colombian President Gustavo Petro, a former member of the M-19 guerrilla group, a 'dangerous' choice to lead a country that has been the longtime U.S. partner in the war on drugs. But it is on Venezuela that Rubio has left his biggest mark. Within weeks of Trump taking office in January 2017, Rubio brought the wife of prominent Venezuelan dissident Leopoldo Lopez to the White House. The Oval Office visit, marked by a photo of a grinning Trump and Rubio flanking the then jailed activist’s wife, immediately thrust Venezuela to the top of the U.S. foreign policy agenda, in a break from previous U.S. administrations efforts to keep a distance from the nation's troubles. Over the next two years, Trump slapped crushing oil sanctions on Venezuela, charged numerous officials with corruption and began talking of a 'military option' to remove President Nicolás Maduro. In 2019, at the height of Rubio’s influence, the U.S. recognized National Assembly President Juan Guaidó as the country’s legitimate leader. But the combative stance — popular among exiles in South Florida — came to haunt Trump, who later recognized he had overestimated the opposition. By strengthening Maduro's hand, it also paved the way for deeper Russian, Chinese and Iranian interests in the country, all the while aggravating a humanitarian crisis that led millions to uproot, with many migrating to the U.S. Michael Shifter, the former president of the Inter-American Dialogue in Washington, believes Trump may prove more forgiving of Maduro this time, even with Rubio heading the State Department, and continue the path of engagement and sanctions relief pursued by the Biden administration. 'Trump may begin to treat Maduro as he typically treats other strongmen around the world, and cater a bit less to the Cuban-American exile community in Florida,' Shifter said. Trujillo said Rubio's reputation for candor will serve him well negotiating with America's friends and foes alike, even if he has to temper his sometimes-heated rhetoric. 'He's going to be playing a different role now, but he's an exceptional negotiator and I have no doubt he will rise to the occasion,' Trujillo said. With Trump's selection of another vocal Maduro critic, Rep. Michael Waltz of Florida, as his national security adviser, Trujillo said the Venezuelan leader and his authoritarian allies in Cuba and Nicaragua should be worried. So far, officials in Venezuela and Cuba, who routinely criticize the U.S. on social media, haven’t commented on Rubio’s nomination and have remained largely muted on Trump’s victory. 'There is an opportunity to negotiate but it will have to be in good faith,' Trujillo said. 'If they don't, there will be consequences.' ___ Mark Stevenson and Maria Verza in Mexico City, and Isabel DeBre in Buenos Aires, Argentina, contributed to this report	https://apnews.com/article/marco-rubio-trump-latin-america-secretary-of-state-87aff0ce93f638fb69e30b067ecd84fb	2024-11-14T20:41:31-08:00	
As airlines avoid Israel, UAE's FlyDubai and Etihad keep up flights for both diplomacy and dollars	BEN GURION INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT, Israel (AP) — At Israel's Ben Gurion International Airport, more than a year of war has taken its toll. Global airlines have canceled flights, gates are empty and pictures of hostages still held in the Gaza Strip guide the few arriving passengers to baggage claim. But one check-in desk remains flush with travelers: the one serving flights to the United Arab Emirates, which have kept up a bridge for Israelis to the outside world throughout the war. The Emirati flights, in addition to bolstering the airlines' bottom line, have shined a light on the countries’ burgeoning ties — which have survived the wars raging across the Middle East and could be further strengthened as U.S. President-elect Donald Trump prepares to return to office. 'It’s a political and economic statement,' said Joshua Teitelbaum, a professor of Middle Eastern studies at Israel’s Bar-Ilan University. 'They are the main foreign airlines that continue to fly.' Since the wars began with Hamas’ initial Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel, many international airlines have halted, restarted and halted again their flights into Israel’s main gateway to the rest of the world. The concern is real for the carriers, who remember the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 over Ukraine 10 years ago and Iran shooting down Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752 after takeoff from Tehran in 2020. But FlyDubai, the sister airline to the long-haul carrier Emirates, has kept up multiple flights daily and kept Israel connected to the wider world even as its other low-cost competitors have stopped flights. Abu Dhabi’s Etihad has continued its flights as well. While maintaining the flight schedule remains politically important for the UAE after its 2020 diplomatic recognition of Israel, it also provided a further shot in the arm for revenues — particularly for FlyDubai. Since the wars started, international carriers such as Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines Inc., Germany’s Lufthansa and other major airlines halted their flights. Some resumed, only to stop again after Iran’s Oct. 1 ballistic missile attack on Israel and Israel’s Oct. 26 retaliatory strike on the Islamic Republic. Tehran has threatened to strike Israel again. That’s brought major business to Israel's national carrier El Al, which had struggled in the coronavirus pandemic and prior years. The airline posted its best-ever half-year results this year, recording a $227 million profit as compared to $58 million profit in the same period last year. El Al stock has risen by as much 200% over the last year, as compared to a 29% rise in the wider Tel Aviv 125 stock market index. El Al, however, lacks the routes and connections of major international carriers. Low-cost carriers as well have stopped flying into Israel during periods of the war, sending the price of El Al tickets ever higher. Passenger numbers through Ben Gurion halved compared to the same period the year before, El Al said in its second-quarter financial results. However, FlyDubai has kept flying. The carrier has operated over 1,800 flights to Israel since October last year, cancelling only 77 flights overall, according to Cirium, an aviation analytics company. In September alone, it flew over 200 flights. As a line snaked toward the FlyDubai check-in counters at Ben Gurion Airport, UAE-bound Motti Eis said the flights were 'a symbol that the Emirates countries decided to keep the peace.' FlyDubai declined to answer questions from The Associated Press about the flights. Etihad, the flag carrier for Abu Dhabi, has kept flying into Tel Aviv, but the number of its flights has been dwarfed by FlyDubai. FlyDubai had 3.6% market share at Ben Gurion, compared to El Al’s 43.2% in the second half of 2024. However, at least two of the foreign low-cost airlines with greater market, Wizz Air and Blue Bird, stopped flying for extended periods this year. Etihad said it maintains a close watch on the situation in the region, but continues its daily flights to and from Tel Aviv. 'Ben Gurion International Airport remains open, employing best practices in safety and security practices, enabling Etihad and other airlines to provide essential air connectivity as long as it is secure to do so,' the airline said in a statement. But beyond the financial impact, the decision also takes root in the UAE’s decision to recognize Israel in 2020, under agreements brokered by then President Trump known as the Abraham Accords. While Abu Dhabi has repeatedly expressed concern and outrage as Israel’s conduct during the wars, Israel’s Consulate in Dubai and Embassy remain open in the country. And while Dubai broadly speaking remains focused on business in the country, Abu Dhabi’s focus long has been on its geopolitical aims — which since the 2011 Arab Spring have been squarely focused on challenging Islamist movements, and those who back them, in the wider region. The UAE, a hereditary autocracy, long has viewed those groups as serious challenges to its power. The Emirati government, in response to questions from the AP over the flights, sent a story published by its state-run WAM news agency about its participation in a Nov. 1 conference in Riyadh in support of a two-state solution to the decadeslong Israel-Palestinian crisis. The UAE has called repeatedly for a cease-fire in the Gaza Strip, along with the release of hostages and Palestinian prisoners. However, likely given the wider anger in the Arab world over Israel’s devastating militant campaign in Gaza, Dubai International Airport no longer advertises on its electronic billboard the location of the check-in for Tel Aviv. It sits in a distant corner of one of the airport’s terminals, next to a Dubai police stand. Private security guards also keep watch over the line, while individuals who appeared to be undercover police officers watched the gate, a higher level of security than normally noticed at the airport. But in the lines, Hebrew and Arabic can be heard and those traveling routinely have their blue-backed Israeli passports out in their hands. 'It’s just a symbol of the UAE’s commitment to the relationship,' said Dina Esfandiary, a senior advisor on the Middle East at the International Crisis Group, a think tank. 'No matter what happens, no matter where the war goes, no matter how much Israel flouts international law, the UAE has decided that this is a step they took, that the relationship remains beneficial to them.' ___ Goldenberg reported from Tel Aviv, Israel.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-flydubai-el-al-airlines-816f5ac4fe206d35889989f0d40feda5	2024-11-14T20:15:32-08:00	
APEC leaders to open Lima summit as Trump prepares to return to office	LIMA, Peru (AP) — Representatives from 21 members representing the Pacific Rim are meeting in Peru on Friday for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, the first global summit since U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s victory featuring several major world leaders. The annual gathering brings together countries and members that jointly account for almost two-thirds of global GDP and half the world's trade, according to organizers. They confirmed heads of government attending in Lima include outgoing U.S. President Joe Biden, China's President Xi Jinping, Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Indonesia's President Prabowo Subianto, Japan's Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and Australia's Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, among others, as the world wonders how a new U.S. government might upend global dynamics. Leaders and other representatives will hold closed-door discussions in the morning among themselves, and in the afternoon with members of APEC's business advisory council. The council met Wednesday and called on APEC nations and members to boost inclusive growth and prioritize the needs of micro-, small-, and medium-sized enterprises, particularly those led by women and Indigenous entrepreneurs. 'While the global economy remains resilient, APEC economies are grappling with persistent inflation, economic disparities, high interest rates and the urgent need to increase investments for a green, climate-resilient future,' said council chairwoman Julia Torreblanca. APEC is bound to be one of Biden's last before leaving office, and White House officials insist that his attendance as well as his subsequent visit to Brazil for the Group of 20 meeting next week will be substantive, with talks to focus on climate issues, global infrastructure, counter-narcotic efforts. For the first time since last year’s APEC forum, Biden will meet one-on-one with Chinese President Xi on Saturday. He will also meet with South Korea’s Yoon Suk Yeol, Japan’s Shigeru Ishiba and Peru’s President Dina Boluarte. The officials say Biden also will use the summits to press allies to keep up support for Ukraine as it tries to fend off Russia’s invasion and persist in negotiating an end to Israel's wars in Lebanon and Gaza. Still, analysts say he will be overshadowed at APEC by Xi, who arrived Thursday and proceeded to inaugurate a $1.3 billion megaport that is perhaps the clearest sign of Latin America’s ongoing reorientation in the region. The Chancay port will shave 10 days off shipping times to China, which has seen trade with South America boom over the past two decades. Peru’s economy minister in June said neighboring nations are actively modifying their supply chains to benefit from the port, in which total investment will top $3.5 billion. Ahead of the inauguration at the port, 60 kilometers (37 miles) north of Lima, locals told The Associated Press that the development hasn't buoyed their economic prospects. On the contrary, they said the port has impaired their ability to fish, threatening their livelihoods. Discontent has been brewing in the middle-class San Borja neighborhood outside Lima’s Convention Center, where the APEC conference is sited. Metal barriers and police equipped with riot gear surround the perimeter where, for the past two days, anti-government protesters angry about a recent spate of gang-fueled violence have shouted slogans demanding that their wildly unpopular presiden t take action against the crime wave. The rallies have devolved into scuffles with police, who used batons to drive away the more aggressive protesters on Thursday. ___ AP writer Isabel DeBre contributed	https://apnews.com/article/peru-apec-biden-xi-lima-china-fc2ac014b2f7314bfa1a53351b0bc3a7	2024-11-14T19:18:12-08:00	
Party of Sri Lanka's new Marxist-leaning president takes large lead in parliamentary vote	COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) — The party of Sri Lanka’s new Marxist-leaning President Anura Kumara Dissanayake took a large lead Friday in early results from the parliamentary elections, in an apparent solid mandate for his program for economic revival. Dissanayake’s National People’s Power Party won 15 of the 22 electoral districts whose results have been released so far by the Elections Commission. Dissanayake was elected president on Sept. 21 in a rejection of traditional political parties that have governed the island nation since its independence from British rule in 1948. But he received just 42% of the votes, fueling questions over his party’s outlook in Thursday’s parliamentary elections. But the party received large increases in support less than two months into his presidency. In a major surprise and a big shift in the country's electoral landscape, his party won the Jaffna district, the heartland of ethnic Tamils in the north, and many other minority strongholds. The victory in Jaffna marks a great dent for traditional ethnic Tamil parties that have dominated the politics of the north since independence. Of the 225 seats in parliament, 196 were up for grabs under Sri Lanka’s proportional representative electoral system, which allocates seats in each district among the parties according to the proportion of the votes they get. The remaining 29 seats — called the national list seats — are allocated to parties and independent groups according to the proportion of the total votes they receive countrywide.	https://apnews.com/article/sri-lanka-election-dissanayake-parliament-a57fb69161d49ebeac77d73568599a4e	2024-11-14T19:10:24-08:00	
Activists plant trees in Mali but residents strip them for firewood. They say there's no choice	BAMAKO, Mali (AP) — After years of serving as Mali's minister of the environment, Aida M'bo now spends her time planting trees in a fight that many in the arid West African country acknowledge they are losing. 'Deforestation is an important issue in Mali,' she said, standing in front of the Zamblara forest. For decades it has been classified as protected, but like many forests in the vast Sahel, it could be wiped out. 'It is mainly due to the excessive wood-cutting,' M'bo said. Even some of her fellow tree-planters that day were to blame. Salimata Diabate, who took part in the ceremony last month, lives nearby and sells firewood from the forest in the Sikasso region, long considered Mali’s breadbasket. While Diabate expressed concern about the threats to Mali’s forests, she said people like her in the countryside have no choice but firewood for cooking. 'Things like cooking gas and solar panels are better, but it’s too expensive for rural women,' she said. The loss of forests has become a pressing issue across Africa as the Sahara Desert continues to creep southward. Over the last three decades, nearly 7,722 square miles (20,000 square kilometers) of forest have been lost in Mali, according to the environmental nonprofit Tree Aid. M'bo's nonprofit, Energia, is financially supported by the Great Green Wall, an initiative by African countries launched in 2007 that aims to plant trees in a nearly 5,000-mile line across the continent, creating a natural barrier to hold back the desert as climate change sweeps the sands south. But millions of the trees died as temperatures rose and rainfall diminished. As a result, only 4% of the Great Green Wall’s original goal has been met, and an estimated $43 billion would be needed to achieve the rest. In Mali, the initiative is facing an additional challenge : the population’s dependency on firewood. Lassana Coulibaly, who lives in the town of Senou near the capital, Bamako, spends his days chopping up and reselling wood he buys from people who cut it from a nearby forest. 'This how we make a living on a daily basis,' he said. He doesn’t believe the forest will disappear. A 2019 study by the African Energy Commission found that 64% of Mali’s total fuel consumption was of biomass, primarily firewood and charcoal for household use. Their sale remains legal. Despite being one of Africa’s top gold producers, Mali ranks among the world's least developed nations, with almost half of its 23 million population living below the national poverty line. The problem is worse in rural areas, where subsistence farming — many people's only real option for survival — is threatened by armed conflict and climate change. The country has been plagued by an insurgency fought by armed groups, including some allied with al-Qaida and the Islamic State group, and two military coups since 2020. Mali is also among several countries in the Sahel that have experienced record-breaking floods this year, with more than 1,000 people killed and hundreds of thousands displaced across the region. Khady Camara, an environmental activist based in Senegal, said forests can help to weather the effects of climate change by absorbing water to prevent floods, and by absorbing carbon that would otherwise end up in the atmosphere as part of heat-trapping gas. 'We need to give more priority to our forests, but we also need to set up new forests and give priority to natural regeneration,' said Camara, whose organization Vacances Vertes has planted 150,000 trees in Senegal. She said the effects of climate change on the Sahel region can’t be overstated, and the causes often come from far beyond the African continent. ' Africa produces only 3% of greenhouse gases. Ninety percent is from the West,' she said. 'If we continue like this, I’m saying to myself that this will be the disappearance of Africa, and of Africans.' ___ The Associated Press receives financial support for global health and development coverage in Africa from the Gates Foundation.

Japanese Princess Yuriko, wartime Emperor Hirohito's sister-in-law, dies at 101	TOKYO (AP) — Japanese Princess Yuriko, the wife of wartime Emperor Hirohito’s brother and the oldest member of the imperial family, has died after her health deteriorated recently, palace officials said. She was 101. Yuriko died Friday at a Tokyo hospital, the Imperial Household Agency said. It did not announce the cause of death, but Japanese media said she died of pneumonia. Born in 1923 as an aristocrat, Yuriko married at age 18 to Prince Mikasa, the younger brother of Hirohito and the uncle of current Emperor Naruhito, months before the start of World War II. She has recounted living in a shelter with her husband and their baby daughter after their residence was burned down in the U.S. fire bombings of Tokyo in the final months of the war in 1945. Yuriko raised five children and supported Mikasa’s research into ancient Near Eastern history, while also serving her official duties and taking part in philanthropic activities. She outlived her husband and all three sons. Her death reduces Japan’s rapidly dwindling imperial family to 16 people, including four men, as the country faces the dilemma of how to maintain the royal family while conservatives in the governing party insist on retaining male-only succession. The 1947 Imperial House Law, which largely preserves conservative prewar family values, allows only males to take the throne and forces female royal family members who marry commoners to lose their royal status. The youngest male member of the imperial family, Prince Hisahito — the nephew of Emperor Naruhito — is currently the last heir apparent, posing a major problem for a system that doesn’t allow empresses. The government is debating how to keep succession stable without relying on women. Yuriko had lived a healthy life as a centenarian before suffering a stroke and pneumonia in March. She enjoyed exercise in the morning while watching a daily fitness program on television, the Imperial Household Agency says. She also continued to read multiple newspapers and magazines and enjoyed watching news and baseball on TV. On sunny days, she sat in the palace garden or was wheeled in her wheelchair. Yuriko was hospitalized after her stroke and had been in and out of intensive care since then. Her overall condition deteriorated over the past week, the Imperial Household Agency said.	https://apnews.com/article/japan-oldest-princess-yuriko-obit-hirohito-6ebcce5d71b8e39f6c33f38e305e9e39	2024-11-14T17:51:24-08:00	
AP PHOTOS: Once-traditional camel trading fair in India transformed into tourist attraction	PUSHKAR, India (AP) — It’s early morning in Pushkar, a city at the edge of the Thar desert in the northwestern Indian state of Rajasthan, and a herd of about a dozen camels led by two men is returning, raising a golden sand cloud. The camels had been out grazing in the night at the foothills of the ancient Aravali mountain range, and their handlers spent the night out in the open. For the next two hours or so, when the heat is still bearable, prospective buyers will look for bargains among hundreds of camels that have been brought to be sold by herders and farmers from surrounding districts. Many camels wear necklaces made with a string of small round bells and have brightly colored plastic flowers on their snouts and heads. Specialized barbers walk around trimming camel hair for a fee to make them look more attractive to buyers. Some herders have walked with their animals for two weeks or more on paved roads and scrub land to reach the annual fair. Camels were once the most important animals used for transportation in the desert. Even though paved roads and vehicles have made them largely irrelevant, they are still being used in some remote parts of the state. Hitched to a wooden cart, they can be seen transporting people and construction materials. Some are still in use by farmers selling fresh vegetable produce to townsfolk. Herders supplement their diet with camel milk, make blankets with camel hair and use camel dung as cooking fuel. Even though fewer camels are being traded now, the state government has worked to turn the fair into a big tourist attraction. On the large sandy plain where the fair is held, large Ferris wheels are installed and dozens of stalls are set up to sell local handicrafts. Men with impressive moustaches compete for a prize, and tourists are encouraged to take selfies with them. Children wear traditional costumes, play string instruments and carry on their heads replicas of vessels used by women to fetch water as they enact rural scenes and mingle with the crowd presenting live tableaux. Everything is carefully choreographed for the tourists. Thousands of tourists from around the world now enjoy camel rides, watch cultural shows, and get to participate in rural sports contests and play a game of cricket watched by a bustling crowd. Hindu devotees visiting the fair can take a dip in the holy Pushkar Lake, situated about 2 kilometers (1¼ miles) from the site of the fair and visit a number of old temples dotting the city of Pushkar.	https://apnews.com/article/india-camel-trading-fair-photos-4b19104d0c7f5651694004662e19fc61	2024-11-14T17:37:27-08:00	
North Korea tests exploding drones as Kim calls for mass production	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korea tested exploding drones designed to crash into targets and leader Kim Jong Un called for accelerating mass production of the weapons, state media said Friday. The country’s latest military demonstration came as the United States, South Korea and Japan engaged in combined military exercises involving advanced fighter jets and a U.S. aircraft carrier in nearby international waters, in a display of their defense posture against North Korea. North Korea’s official Korean Central News Agency published photos of Kim talking with officials near at least two different types of unmanned aerial vehicles. They included those with X-shaped tails and wings that look similar to the ones the country disclosed in August, when Kim inspected another demonstration of drones that explode on impact. The drones flew various routes and accurately struck targets, KCNA said. Its images showed what appeared to be a BMW sedan being destroyed and old models of tanks being blown up. Kim expressed satisfaction with the weapons’ development process and stressed the need to 'build a serial production system as early as possible and go into full-scale mass production,' noting how drones are becoming crucial in modern warfare. KCNA paraphrased Kim as saying drones were easy to make at low cost for a range of military activities. The report didn’t say if Kim spoke directly about rival South Korea, which the North Korean drones are apparently designed to target. North Korea last month accused South Korea of sending its own drones to drop anti-North Korean propaganda leaflets over the North's capital of Pyongyang, and threatened to respond with force if such flights occur again. South Korea’s military has refused to confirm whether or not the North’s claims were true. Tensions in the region have escalated as Kim flaunts his advancing nuclear and missile program, which includes various nuclear-capable weapons targeting South Korea and intercontinental ballistic missiles that can potentially reach the U.S. mainland. Kim is also allegedly sending military equipment and troops to Russia to support President Vladimir Putin’s war on Ukraine, which raised concerns in Seoul that he would get Russian technology in return to further develop his arsenal. In addition to his intensifying nuclear threats, Kim has also engaged in psychological and electronic warfare against South Korea, such as flying thousands of balloons to drop trash in the South and disrupting GPS signals from border areas near the South’s biggest airport. South Korean officials say North Korea will be a key topic in a trilateral summit between South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol, U.S. President Joe Biden and Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba this week at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meetings in Peru. South Korean Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul and U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken met on the margins of the APEC on Thursday and discussed 'strong concerns' over deepening ties between Pyongyang and Moscow, particularly the deployment of North Korean troops to support Russia’s war against Ukraine, the U.S. State Department said.	https://apnews.com/article/north-korea-suicide-drones-attack-south-korea-kim-jong-un-de54b69cae1b30408bf4d63fdd7c3848	2024-11-14T16:26:29-08:00	
Australia's plan to ban children from social media proves popular and problematic	MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — How do you remove children from the harms of social media? Politically the answer appears simple in Australia, but practically the solution could be far more difficult. The Australian government’s plan to ban children from social media platforms including X, TikTok, Facebook and Instagram until their 16th birthdays is politically popular. The opposition party says it would have done the same after winning elections due within months if the government hadn’t moved first. The leaders of all eight Australian states and mainland territories have unanimously backed the plan, although Tasmania, the smallest state, would have preferred the threshold was set at 14. But a vocal assortment of experts in the fields of technology and child welfare have responded with alarm. More than 140 such experts signed an open letter to Prime Minister Anthony Albanese condemning the 16-year age limit as 'too blunt an instrument to address risks effectively.' Details of what is proposed and how it will be implemented are scant. More will be known when legislation is introduced into the Parliament next week. The concerned teen Leo Puglisi, a 17-year-old Melbourne student who founded online streaming service 6 News Australia at the age of 11, laments that lawmakers imposing the ban lack the perspective on social media that young people have gained by growing up in the digital age. 'With respect to the government and prime minister, they didn’t grow up in the social media age, they’re not growing up in the social media age, and what a lot of people are failing to understand here is that, like it or not, social media is a part of people’s daily lives,' Leo said. 'It’s part of their communities, it’s part of work, it’s part of entertainment, it’s where they watch content – young people aren’t listening to the radio or reading newspapers or watching free-to-air TV – and so it can’t be ignored. The reality is this ban, if implemented, is just kicking the can down the road for when a young person goes on social media,' Leo added. Leo has been applauded for his work online. His home state Victoria nominated him for the Young Australian of the Year award, which will be announced in January. His nomination credits his platform with 'fostering a new generation of informed, critical thinkers.' The grieving mom-turned-activist One of the proposal's supporters, cyber safety campaigner Sonya Ryan, knows from personal tragedy how dangerous social media can be for children. Her 15-year-old daughter Carly Ryan was murdered in 2007 in South Australia state by a 50-year-old pedophile who pretended to be a teenager online. In a grim milestone of the digital age, Carly was the first person in Australia to be killed by an online predator. 'Kids are being exposed to harmful pornography, they’re being fed misinformation, there are body image issues, there’s sextortion, online predators, bullying. There are so many different harms for them to try and manage and kids just don’t have the skills or the life experience to be able to manage those well,' Sonya Ryan said. 'The result of that is we’re losing our kids. Not only what happened to Carly, predatory behavior, but also we’re seeing an alarming rise in suicide of young people,' she added. Sonya Ryan is part of a group advising the government on a national strategy to prevent and respond to child sexual abuse in Australia. She wholeheartedly supports Australia setting the social media age limit at 16. 'We’re not going to get this perfect,' she said. 'We have to make sure that there are mechanisms in place to deal with what we already have which is an anxious generation and an addicted generation of children to social media.' A major concern for social media users of all ages is the legislation’s potential privacy implications. Age estimation technology has proved inaccurate, so digital identification appears to be the most likely option for assuring a user is at least 16. Australia’s eSafety Commissioner, an office that describes itself as the world’s first government agency dedicated to keeping people safer online, has suggested in planning documents adopting the role of authenticator. The government would hold the identity data and the platforms would discover through the commissioner whether a potential account holder was 16. The skeptical internet expert Tama Leaver, professor of internet studies at Curtin University, fears that the government will make the platforms hold the users’ identification data instead. The government has already said the onus will be on the platforms, rather than on children or their parents, to ensure everyone meets the age limit. 'The worst possible outcome seems to be the one that the government may be inadvertently pushing towards, which would be that the social media platforms themselves would end up being the identity arbiter,' Leaver said. 'They would be the holder of identity documents which would be absolutely terrible because they have a fairly poor track record so far of holding on to personal data well,' he added. The platforms will have a year once the legislation has become law to work out how the ban can be implemented. Ryan, who divides her time between Adelaide in South Australia and Fort Worth, Texas, said privacy concerns should not stand in the way of removing children from social media. 'What is the cost if we don’t? If we don’t put the safety of our children ahead of profit and privacy?' she asked.	https://apnews.com/article/australia-social-media-ban-children-1abadf5445418c8c14f5f68cf76b38d0	2024-11-14T16:23:11-08:00	
The world's tallest teenager, 7-foot-9 Olivier Rioux, plans to redshirt at Florida this season	GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) — The world's tallest teenager might have to wait a year to become the world's tallest college basketball player. Florida coach Todd Golden said Thursday that Olivier Rioux, a 7-foot-9 freshman who owns a spot in the Guinness record book, is planning to redshirt. Had the popular Canadian played in even one game, he would have burned one of his four seasons of college eligibility. Instead, Rioux, 18, will spend the 2024-25 season practicing with teammates and honing his skills — and still be a freshman next fall. 'I should have made that clear (before),' Golden said. 'Honestly, it’s put him in a tough situation. He’s sitting over there at the end of games and everybody’s yelling at him and trying to get him out there. They just hadn’t understood that that was our potential plan for him. 'So that’s where we’re at at this moment. I’m not saying that’s 100% going to be the plan. We’ll continue to talk to him and see if he changes what he wants to do. But as of right now, that’s the plan that we’re going to have with him as we move forward.' Florida students chanted for 'Oli' in both of the team's home games this season. Golden emptied the bench in the final minutes of an 86-62 victory over Grambling State on Monday night and even said a few words to Rioux during the chaotic scene. 'I was just explaining to him, ’Hey, the reason why I’m not putting you in right now is what we’ve talked about a little bit,'' Golden said. 'This wasn’t a choice that I made for him. This is something that people (from) our program have talked with him and his family and his parents, his AAU coach and just kind of trying to figure out what the best route for him is. 'I just went up to him and I was like, ‘Hey, I’m not trying to be disrespectful with you. I’m just not trying to burn your year putting you in for 30 seconds.’' Rioux handled the decision well, Golden said. 'He’s a great kid, and he’s a pleaser,' Golden said. 'He wants to do what others think is best for him. And he’s coachable. Again, if this is what our staff, his parents, the people around him that care about him, think is best, I think he’s going to be comfortable. Ultimately, it’s his decision. But I think that’s where he’ll land.' ___ AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/hub/college-basketball and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll	https://apnews.com/article/florida-gators-olivier-rioux-tallest-teenager-897a48d6f01a3b65f7d20cf2a6548537	2024-11-14T11:18:33-08:00	
Tropical Storm Sara threatens to bring flash floods and mudslides to Central America	MIAMI (AP) — Tropical Storm Sara formed Thursday in the Caribbean Sea and was expected to cause life-threatening flash flooding and mudslides across portions of Central America, including Honduras, forecasters said. The storm was expected to stall and meander near the coast of Honduras through the weekend, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said. Heavy rain also is forecast for Belize, El Salvador, eastern Guatemala and western Nicaragua. The storm is expected to strengthen before approaching Belize and the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico early next week. It was too soon to determine Friday morning what conditions the system could bring next week to portions of the eastern Gulf of Mexico, including Florida, the Florida Keys, and Cuba, the hurricane center said.	https://apnews.com/article/tropical-storm-sara-1285618560ac8706a6b7735d7656bf15	2024-11-14T09:00:20-08:00

Masses flee homes in Haiti as gangs make violent push for power during political turmoil	PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) — Masses of people on Thursday fled one of the few communities in Haiti's capital that previously hadn't been taken over by gangs, part of a surge of violence this week as gangs capitalize on the country's political turmoil. Families frantically packed mattresses and furniture into cars and carried their belongings on their heads as they left the Solino neighborhood, one of a handful of areas in Port-au-Prince where a coalition of gangs, called Viv Ansanm, and police were locked in a violent firefight over the past several days. Violence has exploded in the capital after Haiti fired and replaced its interim prime minister amid political infighting and corruption allegations against members of a transitional council created to restore democratic order to Haiti. The Caribbean nation hasn't held an election since 2016, largely because of the gang violence. Gangs like the Viv Ansanm coalition often seize on moments of political chaos to make power grabs like the one seen in Solino in recent days. Gangs also largely shut down the country's main airport by shooting a number of planes, wounding one flight attendant on Monday. The United Nations said that it documented 20 armed clashes in Port-au-Prince in just one day. The U.N. estimates that gangs control 85% of the city. The country's new interim prime minister, Alix Didier Fils-Aimé, has been largely silent about the violence since he was sworn in on Monday, but on Wednesday released a statement condemning the plane shootings. His office said that he ordered police to regain control of the airport and nearby area. Meanwhile, videos on social media show smoke rising up from the area and gunfire has echoed through Solino's streets in recent days. While it wasn’t immediately clear how many people were fleeing the violence in Solino, it appeared that much of the neighborhood was emptying out. Residents said they were leaving after gangs killed a police officer, known as a community leader fighting back against the gangs in the neighborhood. That killing was also reported by local media, though The Associated Press wasn't able to confirm the death with authorities. In October, the same gang coalition made a similar violent push into the Solino neighborhood, setting fire to homes and leaving many fleeing with all they could carry or calling radio stations to plead for help. ___ Megan Janetsky contributed to this report from Mexico City.	https://apnews.com/article/haiti-port-au-prince-gangs-solino-c2c1a07304854f7e3c3f4db9d3e25b98	2024-11-14T08:55:07-08:00	
A France-trained and armed force aims to strengthen Ukraine's defenses at critical juncture in war	A FRENCH MILITARY BASE, France (AP) — A French military task force with a festive name — 'Champagne' — is wrapping up a mission that's no party: Training a whole new brigade of several thousand Ukrainian troops who will be joining the fight against Russia's invasion armed with France-supplied tanks, artillery canons and other heavy weaponry. The approaching return to Ukraine of the 'Anne of Kyiv' brigade, after more than two months of intense military training in eastern and southern France, comes at another critical juncture in the almost three-year war. Russian forces are driving westward in an effort to capture all of Ukraine's eastern Donbas region. They've been bolstered by up to 12,000 North Korean troops that have been deployed to Russia’s Kursk border region to help beat back Ukrainian forces there, according to U.S., South Korean and Ukrainian intelligence assessments. The reelection of Donald Trump is also keeping Ukraine and its allies guessing about the impact he'll have as U.S. president on the war's future trajectory, following his campaign pledges to swiftly end the fighting and suggestions that Kyiv should cede territory to Moscow in return for peace. When deployed, the French-trained and equipped brigade named after a Kyiv princess who became a queen of France could prove to be a formidable force on the battlefields. It will eventually be made up of 4,500 troops, formed of infantry battalions, plus engineers, artillery teams and other specialists, French authorities have previously said. The more than 2,000 soldiers who have been training in France are being put through final paces before their return to Ukraine. The majority of them were recently mobilized and previously had just a few weeks of basic training before their arrival in France in September, the French military says. The Ukrainian military is also training other troops for the brigade back in Ukraine, according to French authorities. The French military dedicated around 1,500 of its own soldiers to the 'Champagne' task force that has been teaching the Ukrainians how to fight effectively together and how to use and maintain their France-supplied weaponry. The French military says the brigade's arsenal will include 18 AMX 10 light tanks, 18 truck-mounted Caesar artillery pieces, 128 armored troop carriers, anti-tank and anti-aircraft missile systems, plus other weaponry and equipment. With observation drones buzzing overhead and amid clouds of smoke and bursts of gunfire and explosions, the Ukrainian soldiers conducted exercises this week at a French military training camp, showing how they have learned to defend and storm a complex of trenches like those on the battlefronts in Ukraine. The French military wouldn't allow visiting journalists to interview the Ukrainians. French officers involved in the training said the troops are now better prepared for combat that they'll likely experience in months ahead. 'They have improved a lot,' said Col. Paul. The French military withheld his last name, citing security reasons. 'Now they are able to fight, they are able to maneuver,' he said. 'They are able to use the different specialists and to use the different equipment they will have on the battlefield.' ___ Follow AP’s coverage of Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/ukraine and coverage of the war at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine	https://apnews.com/article/france-ukraine-russian-invasion-weaponry-military-5b1a638da2c69bd4f636b136939c2195	2024-11-14T07:41:12-08:00	
The Latest: Republicans take House as Democrats sound alarm over Matt Gaetz as attorney general	Republicans have won enough seats to control the U.S. House, completing the party’s sweep into power and securing their hold on U.S. government alongside President-elect Donald Trump. Meanwhile, Trump's pick of conservative loyalist Matt Gaetz to serve as attorney general has Democrats sounding the alarm with Sen. Dick Durbin saying Gaetz 'would be a disaster' in part because of Trump’s threat to use the Justice Department 'to seek revenge on his political enemies.' Follow the AP’s Election 2024 coverage at: https://apnews.com/hub/election-2024. Here’s the latest: Democrat Janelle Bynum wins election to US House in Oregon, beating incumbent Lori Chavez-DeRemer Democrat Janelle Bynum won election to a U.S. House seat representing Oregon on Thursday, defeating Republican Rep. Lori Chavez-DeRemer. The district, which includes the Portland suburbs and stretches through Bend, was a top target for Democrats. Democrats lost this seat in 2022, when Jamie McLeod-Skinner defeated seven-term Democratic Rep. Kurt Schrader in the primary but lost the general election. The district took in parts of more conservative central Oregon after 2022 redistricting. Bynum represents Happy Valley and North Clackamas in the state Legislature. The Associated Press declared Bynum the winner at 12:47 p.m. EST. Republican and Democratic senators call for ethics committee information on Gaetz Republican and Democratic senators alike on the Judiciary Committee that would review Matt Gaetz’s attorney general nomination are calling for a House Ethics Committee investigation into Gaetz to be made available to them. 'I think it’s going to be material in the proceedings,' said Sen. Thomas Tillis, a North Carolina Republican. Sen. John Cornyn, a Texas Republican, said, 'I think there should not be any limitation on the Senate Judiciary Committee’s investigation, including whatever the House Ethics Committee has generated.' Sen. Dick Durbin, the Democrat who currently chairs the Judiciary Committee, earlier Thursday said in a statement, 'We cannot allow this valuable information from a bipartisan investigation to be hidden from the American people.' Incoming Senate GOP Leader John Thune says Senate’s priority will be confirming Trump’s nominees Thune did not mention Matt Gaetz, Tulsi Gabbard or other Trump picks that have raised deep concerns among several senators. But he said senators should expect 'an aggressive schedule until his nominees are confirmed.' Sen. Dick Durban says ethics committee should preserve information gathered on Matt Gaetz Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Dick Durbin, D-Ill., is calling on the House Ethics Committee to preserve information it's gathered on former Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz, President-elect Donald Trump’s intended nominee for attorney general, and also share it with the Senate. Trump announced Gaetz as his pick for the post Wednesday and Gaetz immediately resigned from Congress, ending the investigation against him. The ethics panel said several months ago that its review included whether Gaetz engaged in sexual misconduct and illicit drug use, accepted improper gifts and sought to obstruct government investigations of his conduct. Gaetz has categorically denied all the allegations before the committee. 'The sequence and timing of Mr. Gaetz’s resignation from the House raises serious questions about the contents of the House Ethics Committee report,' Durbin said Thursday. 'We cannot allow this valuable information from a bipartisan investigation to be hidden from the American people.' Bohannan requests a recount in Iowa’s close congressional race as GOP wins control of House The Democrat looking to unseat an incumbent Republican in a close Iowa congressional race, one of a handful yet to be called after Republicans won control of the U.S. House, has asked for a recount. Democrat Christina Bohannan’s campaign on Thursday requested the recount in her bid against Republican incumbent Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks to represent Iowa’s 1st District. The initial tally puts Bohannan fewer than 1,000 votes — less than a percentage point — behind Miller-Meeks. The contest is a much tighter rematch of 2022, when Miller-Meeks won by 7 percentage points. Miller-Meeks earned a first term in Congress representing Iowa’s 2nd District when she defeated Democrat Rita Hart by just six votes in 2020.	https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-election-kamala-harris-70b2f4856efe7e22ead7661ca292ff80	2024-11-14T07:34:30-08:00	
Brazil authorities link bombing in the capital to extremist discourse	SAO PAULO (AP) — A Brazilian Supreme Court justice said Thursday that he believes the explosion outside the court in capital Brasilia was the consequence of frequent far-right attacks and hate speech targeting the country’s institutions. 'It grew under the guise of a criminal use of freedom of speech. To offend, threaten, coerce,' Justice Alexandre de Moraes said at an event in Brasilia. Federal Police are investigating the explosions on Wednesday as terrorism and a violent attack on the democratic rule of law, its director, Andrei Passos, said at a news conference later. Passos said that the man had attempted to enter the Supreme Court and that it appeared that he acted alone, though the police official indicated he also was viewing the attack in the broader context of extremism. 'Even if the visible action is individual, behind that action there is never just one person. It's always a group, or ideas of a group, or extremism, radicalism, that lead to committing those crimes,' Passos said. 'The action, in fact, was an individual action, but the investigation will tell if there are other connections, if there are other networks, what's behind it, what drove it.' The police director also said the Supreme Court has received other threats via email, without specifying when. Security camera footage from the Supreme Court, obtained by television network Globo, shows the suspect approaching a statue outside the Supreme Court. As a guard nears, the man throws an explosive and retreats a few steps, then throws a second device and an explosion follows. Finally, the suspect ignites a third device near to himself, causing his death. Passos said that the man was a native of southern Santa Catarina state where he previously ran for city council, and had been in Brasilia several months. Celina Leão, the lieutenant governor of Brazil’s federal district, said Wednesday night that the man first detonated explosives in a car in a Congress parking lot, which didn't cause injuries. Then he went to Three Powers Plaza, where the Supreme Court, Congress and presidential palace are located. Local media identified the man as being a member of Brazil’s Liberal Party, the same as former President Jair Bolsonaro. Bolsonaro has railed against the Supreme Court in the past and specifically focused his ire on de Moraes. Bolsonaro supporters consider de Moraes their chief enemy. He has led a five-year investigation into fake news and threats against Supreme Court justices, which has led to the ban of some far-right allies and supporters from social media and even some imprisonments. He also presided over the nation’s top electoral court when it ruled Bolsonaro ineligible for office until 2030, finding that he had abused his power and cast unfounded doubts on the validity of the 2022 election result. Bolsonaro condemned the attack on social media. 'It is high time for Brazil to once again cultivate an environment suitable for different ideas to confront each other peacefully, and for the strength of arguments to be worth more than the argument of force,' he wrote. Some accuse de Moraes of overstepping in the name of protecting Brazilian democracy from political violence and disinformation. Others view his brash tactics as justified by extraordinary circumstances. Months after Bolsonaro lost his 2022 election bid, Bolsonaro's supporters stormed the main government buildings in Brasilia, seeking to oust his leftist successor, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, from power. It was widely seen as an echo of the insurrection in the U.S. Capitol two years earlier. The Supreme Court has since convicted hundreds of those involved in the uprising for crimes such as criminal association and attempted coup. De Moraes said Thursday that the explosions outside the Supreme Court appeared to be the most serious attack on the institution since then. 'The country’s pacification is only possible with the accountability of all criminals. There is no possibility of pacification with amnesty for criminals,' de Moraes said. Earlier this year, de Moraes ordered a nationwide ban of X after clashing with its billionaire owner, Elon Musk, over free speech, far-right accounts and misinformation. Musk had disparaged de Moraes, calling him an authoritarian and a censor, even though his rulings, including X’s suspension, were repeatedly upheld by his peers. The platform was reinstated in October. Brazil will host the G20 summit in Rio de Janeiro next week. Passos said that the bombing shouldn’t raise any concerns, given that authorities are already implementing the highest level security possible, including with support of the armed forces. 'I am going this afternoon, shortly, to Rio de Janeiro, where I will personally accompany all actions so we can have the absolute guarantee of security,' he added.	https://apnews.com/article/brazil-supreme-court-explosion-29e8d6247a7ab7d3b6f6cf41d19bf278	2024-11-14T07:16:07-08:00	
2 Israeli airstrikes hit Syria's capital and a suburb, killing 15 people, Syrian state media say	DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) — Israel carried out at least two airstrikes on a a western neighborhood of Damascus and one of the capital’s suburbs on Thursday, killing at least 15 people and wounding another 16, Syria's state news agency said. The news agency, SANA, said the airstrikes on the Mazzeh neighborhood in Damascus and the suburb of Qudsaya northwest of the capital struck two buildings. An Associated Press journalist at the scene in Mazzeh said that a five-story building was damaged by a missile that hit the basement. The Israeli military said that it had hit infrastructure sites and command centers of the Islamic Jihad militant group in Syria, and had 'inflicted significant damage to the terrorist organization’s command center and to its operatives.' The airstrikes in Damascus and the nearby suburb came shortly before Ali Larijani, an adviser to Iran’s supreme leader Ali Khamenei, was scheduled to meet in the Syrian capital with representatives of Palestinian factions at the Iranian Embassy in Mazzeh. The Israeli military said that Islamic Jihad had participated alongside Hamas, the Palestinian militant group in the Gaza Strip, in the Oct. 7, 2023 attacks on southern Israel that triggered the ongoing war in the Middle East. The military 'will continue to operate against the Islamic Jihad terrorist organization wherever necessary,' it said. An official with the Palestinian Islamic Jihad Group said that the strike in Mazzeh targeted one of their offices, and that several members of the group were killed. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he wasn't authorized to speak to the media. Syria's state news agency SANA said that the country's air defenses were activated against a 'hostile target' south of the central city of Homs. It gave no further details. Tehran has been a main backer of Syrian President Bashar Assad’s government since a 2011 uprising turned into full-blown civil war and has played an instrumental role in turning the tide of the conflict in his favor. Iran has sent scores of military advisers and thousands of Iran-backed fighters from around the Middle East to Syria to fight on Assad’s side. Tehran has also been an economic lifeline for Assad, sending fuel and credit lines worth billions of dollars. Israel has carried out hundreds of airstrikes in Syria targeting members of neighboring Lebanon’s Hezbollah and officials from Iranian-backed groups.	https://apnews.com/article/syria-israel-war-airstrikes-damascus-1f6dd957d1d6c8f610349e99cfed1a98	2024-11-14T05:30:06-08:00	
Airbnb users to play gladiators in Rome's Colosseum, sparking mixed reactions over $1.5 million deal	ROME (AP) — The ancient Roman Colosseum will be the venue of gladiator fights — albeit staged — for the first time in two millennia under a $1.5 million sponsorship deal with Airbnb that aims to promote 'a more conscious tourism.' But some visitors to the monument Thursday, as well as housing activists, were skeptical about the value of the arrangement, citing ongoing controversies in many cities over the role of short-term rental platforms in fueling overtourism and limiting affordable housing for residents and students. Under the deal announced by Airbnb and the Colosseum on Wednesday, the sponsorship by the short-term rental giant will cover the renewal of an educational program inside the ancient Roman amphitheater covering the history of the structure and gladiators. Eight of the platform's users and their plus-ones will be able to participate in faux gladiator fights after the Colosseum's closing time on May 7-8, taking the same underground route used by gladiators in ancient Rome to reach the arena. People can apply for the experience on Nov. 27 at no cost, and the 'gladiators' will be chosen by lottery. The superintendent of the Colosseum Archaeological Park, Alfonsina Russo, told The Associated Press that the deal is in conjunction with the release of Ridley Scott's new film 'Gladiators II,' which opened in Italy on Thursday. Russo characterized the sponsorship arrangement as one of the many such deals to help finance projects at the park. The Italian fashion brand Tod's, for example, has funded a multimillion renovation of the Roman monument, including a cleaning, replacing the locking system of arches with new gates and redoing the subterranean areas. Alberto Campailla, the coordinator of the Nonna Roma nonprofit organization that focuses on housing and food for the poor, called the campaign with Airbnb 'a disgrace,' and a form of 'touristification.' Airbnb and other platforms offering short-term rentals 'are literally driving people out of not only the city center, but also the outskirts and suburban neighborhoods,' Campailla said. Tourists from other European cities grappling with overtourism also took issue with the deal. 'It seems to me that the purpose of the Colosseum today is to be a tourist attraction, but not to create an amusement park within it,' said Jaime Montero, a tourist visiting from Madrid. 'In the end, tourism eats the essence of the cities, here in Rome, as in other capitals.' Visiting from Naples, Salvatore Di Matteo saw the deal as 'yet another takeover of the territory' by big companies. 'If they start to touch sacred monuments such as the Colosseum here in Rome, it is obviously something that should make us think and is, in any case, a bit worrying,' he said. The Colosseum is the most important and largest amphitheater constructed by the ancient Romans. Built in the 1st century, it was the center of popular entertainment, hosting hunts and gladiator games, until the 6th century. ____ Colleen Barry contributed from Milan.	https://apnews.com/article/rome-colosseum-gladiators-airbnb-ac44f85f856293c5c8083e7e91662186	2024-11-14T05:22:12-08:00	
In Cyprus, Ukrainians learn how to dispose of landmines that kill and maim hundreds	NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) — In a Cypriot National Guard camp, Ukrainians are being trained on how to identify, locate and dispose of landmines and other unexploded munitions that litter huge swaths of their country, killing and maiming hundreds of people, including children. Analysts say Ukraine is among the countries that are the most affected by landmines and discarded explosives, as a result of Russia’s ongoing war. According to U.N. figures, some 399 people have been killed and 915 wounded from landmines and other munitions since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, equal to the number of casualties reported from 2014-2021. More than 1 in 10 of those casualties have been children. The economic impact is costing billions to the Ukrainian economy. Landmines and other munitions are preventing the sowing of 5 million hectares, or 10%, of the country’s agricultural land. Cyprus stepped up to offer its facilities as part of the European Union’s Military Assistance Mission to Ukraine. So far, almost 100 Ukrainian armed forces personnel have taken part in three training cycles over the last two years, said Cyprus Foreign Ministry spokesperson Theodoros Gotsis. 'We are committed to continuing this support for as long as it takes,' Gotsis told the Associated Press, adding that the Cyprus government has covered the 250,000 euro ($262,600) training cost. Cyprus opted to offer such training owing to its own landmine issues dating back five decades when the island nation was ethnically divided when Turkey invaded following a coup that sought union with Greece. The United Nations has removed some 27,000 landmines from a buffer zone that cuts across the island, but minefields remain on either side. The Cypriot government says it has disposed of all anti-personnel mines in line with its obligations under an international treaty that bans the use of such munitions. In Cyprus, Ukrainians undergo rigorous theoretical and practical training over a five-week Basic Demining and Clearance course that includes instruction on distinguishing and safely handling landmines and other explosive munitions, such as rockets, 155 mm artillery shells, rocket-propelled grenades and mortar shells. Theoretical training uses inert munitions identical to the actual explosives. Most of the course is comprised of hands-on training focusing on the on-site destruction of unexploded munitions using explosives, the chief training officer told the Associated Press. The officer spoke on condition of anonymity because he’s not authorized to disclose his identity for security reasons. 'They’re trained on ordnance disposal using real explosives,' the officer said. 'That will be the trainees’ primary task when they return.' Cypriot officials said the Ukrainian trainees did not want to be either interviewed or photographed. Defusing discarded munitions or landmines in areas where explosive charges can’t be used — for instance, near a hospital — is not part of this course because that’s the task of highly trained teams of disposal experts whose training can last as long as eight months, the officer said. Trainees, divided into groups of eight, are taught how to operate metal detectors and other tools for detecting munitions like prodders — long, thin rods which are used to gently probe beneath the ground’s surface in search of landmines and other explosive ordnance. Another tool is a feeler, a rod that’s used to detect booby-trapped munitions. There are many ways to booby-trap such munitions, unlike landmines which require direct pressure to detonate. 'Booby-trapped munitions are a widespread phenomenon in Ukraine,' the chief training officer explained. Training, primarily conducted by experts from other European Union countries, takes place both in forested and urban areas at different army camps and follows strict safety protocols. The short, intense training period keeps the Ukrainians focused. 'You see the interest they show during instruction: they ask questions, they want to know what mistakes they’ve made and the correct way of doing it,' the officer said. Humanitarian data and analysis group ACAPS said in a Jan. 2024 report that 174,000 sq. kilometers (67,182 sq. miles) or nearly 29% of Ukraine’s territory needs to be surveyed for landmines and other explosive ordnance. More than 10 million people are said to live in areas where demining action is needed. Since 2022, Russian forces have used at least 13 types of anti-personnel mines, which target people. Russia never signed the 1997 Ottawa Convention banning the use of anti-personnel mines, but the use of such mines is nonetheless considered a violation of its obligations under international law. Russia also uses 13 types of anti-tank mines. The International Campaign to Ban Landmines said in its 2023 Landmine Monitor report that Ukrainian government forces may have also used antipersonnel landmines in contravention of the Mine Ban Treaty in and around the city of Izium during 2022, when the city was under Russian control.	https://apnews.com/article/cyprus-ukraine-landmines-explosive-ordnance-demining-munitions-45aaa2eb9ac4d1dd9e94d3a8b666d1d1	2024-11-14T05:21:22-08:00	
Edinburgh Zoo blames fireworks for death of baby red panda	LONDON (AP) — Zookeepers in Scotland have blamed pyrotechnics from annual Bonfire Night celebrations for the death of a baby red panda named Roxie. The three-month-old died on Nov. 5 after choking on vomit that was believed to be caused by stress from the explosions that could be heard to mark Guy Fawkes Day, when fireworks and bonfires are lit to mark the failed plot in 1605 to blow up the British Parliament. 'Roxie had access to her den, but the frightening noises seem to have been too much for her,' said Ben Supple, deputy chief executive of the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland, which owns Edinburgh Zoo. 'Very sadly, she choked on her vomit on Bonfire Night and our vets believe this was probably a reaction to fireworks.' The red panda, a cat-sized nocturnal animal with reddish fur and a shaggy tail, is native to the eastern Himalayas and southwestern China. While it is protected in India, Bhutan, China, Nepal and Myanmar, the species is threatened by habitat loss, human encroachment and poaching. Fewer than 10,000 remain in the wild. The small mammals have a low chance of survival — even when born in captivity — and they are especially vulnerable in their first months. Studies show that as many as 60% don't reach their first birthday, according to the Toronto Zoo, which in August announced the death of one of two infant red pandas born there in June. Roxie's mother, Ginger, died five days earlier but Roxie had been eating on her own and responding well to care, Supple said. Stress from fireworks in the days between Halloween on Oct. 31 and Guy Fawkes' Day could have been a contributing factor in the mother's death, he said. Pet owners are well aware of the distress fireworks can cause dogs, cats, horses and other animals. The Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals has campaigned for tighter restrictions and the zoo used the incident to call for a ban on fireworks sales and for only light, public pyrotechnic displays. A petition to curb fireworks was signed by more than 1 million people and delivered to British Prime Minister Keir Starmer's office this month. Police in Edinburgh said disorder on Bonfire Night had caused a state of alarm in the city this year. More than a dozen people have been arrested so far on allegations that include shooting fireworks at police officers and other anti-social behavior. Scottish community safety minister Siobhian Brown said this had been the first year that local authorities could ban the use of fireworks in certain areas. She said it was now a matter for the U.K. government to take up. Alex Cole-Hamilton, leader of the Liberal Democrats in the Scottish Parliament, said current rules don't seem to be working and there may need to be a ban on noisy fireworks. 'This is extremely sad news. These are rare and beautiful creatures,' said Cole-Hamilton. 'The scenes across Edinburgh over the last few weeks have been anarchic and troubling.'	https://apnews.com/article/zoo-fireworks-baby-red-panda-death-34a452edc665d56b813bb6a527106256	2024-11-14T04:58:01-08:00	
EU slaps Meta with a nearly 800 million euro fine for engaging in 'abusive' Marketplace practices	LONDON (AP) — European Union regulators issued their first antitrust fine to Facebook parent Meta on Thursday with a penalty of nearly 800 million euros for what they call 'abusive practices' involving its Marketplace online classified ads business. The European Commission, the 27-nation bloc's executive branch and top antitrust enforcer, issued the 797.72 million euro ($841 million) penalty after its long-running investigation found that the company abused its dominant position and engaged in anti-competitive behavior. It’s the first time the EU has imposed a fine on the social media giant for breaches of the bloc’s competition law. Brussels has already slapped Big Tech rivals Google and Apple with billions in antitrust penalties. The commission had accused Meta of distorting competition by tying its online classified ad business to its social network, automatically exposing Facebook users to Marketplace 'whether they want it or not' and shutting out competitors. It was also concerned that Meta was imposing unfair trading conditions with terms of service that authorized the company to use ad-related data — generated from competing classified ad platforms who advertise on Facebook or Instagram — to benefit Marketplace. Meta's practices gave it 'advantages that other online classified ads service providers could not match,' Margrethe Vestager, the commission's executive vice-president in charge of competition policy, said in a press release 'This is illegal under EU antitrust rules. Meta must now stop this behaviour.' Meta said in a statement that the decision fails to prove any 'competitive harm' to rivals or consumers and 'ignores the realities of the thriving European market for online classified listing services.' The company said the Commission's case ignores the fact that Facebook users can choose to 'engage with Marketplace, and many don't.' It said online marketplaces, including global sites like eBay, Europe-wide platforms like Vinted, and national services are continuing to grow. Meta said it would comply with the Commission's order to end the offending conduct and not repeat it, but also vowed to appeal. The case dates back to 2021, when European Union regulators and their counterparts in Britain opened dual investigations into the classified business. The British regulator wrapped up its investigation last year after Meta made concessions. The company continues to face EU scrutiny on other fronts, including investigations into whether Facebook and Instagram child safety and election integrity measures comply with the bloc’s digital rulebook. Meta has previously been hit with a series of fines for breaches of the EU’s stringent privacy laws, including a record 1.2 billion euro penalty last year.	https://apnews.com/article/meta-facebook-european-union-competition-fine-6886192353a344126a15886d6ca7c627	2024-11-14T04:45:09-08:00	
2 charged in connection with orange spray attack on Stonehenge monuments	LONDON (AP) — Two environmental activists have been charged over the spraying orange paint powder at the Stonehenge monuments in southwest England in June, police said Thursday. Rajan Naidu, 73, and Niamh Lynch, 22, have been charged with 'destroying or damaging an ancient protected monument, and intentionally or recklessly causing a public nuisance,' Wiltshire Police said in a statement. They are due to appear at Salisbury Magistrates’ Court on Dec. 13. Soon after the spray attack at the UNESCO World Heritage Site, the group Just Stop Oil took responsibility and released video showing a man it identified as Naidu blast a fog of orange from a fire extinguisher at one of the vertical stones. The second protester, identified as Lynch, sprayed three stones before she was stopped. It said the paint was made of cornstarch and would dissolve in the rain. Following the protest, English Heritage, a charity that manages hundreds of historic sites, said that experts had quickly removed the orange powder from the stones. Stonehenge was built on a windswept plain in southern England in stages starting 5,000 years ago. Its origin and purpose remain somewhat of a mystery, though the stone circle aligns with the summer solstice sunrise and winter solstice sunset, drawing crowds of spiritualists, druids and sun worshippers. The publicity stunt was among a long line of disruptive acts by Just Stop Oil to draw attention to the climate crisis. The protests have halted sporting events, sullied famous works of art and caused traffic jams. The acts have led to convictions, jail terms and widespread criticism.	https://apnews.com/article/stonehenge-orange-paint-powder-activists-charged-uk-945ed9d9df23edd6310f3e1a2dd75903	2024-11-14T04:07:57-08:00	
Japan will resume V-22 flights after inquiry finds pilot error caused incident last month	TOKYO (AP) — Japan's fleet of hybrid-helicopter military aircraft have been cleared to resume operations after being grounded following an incident last month. A V-22 Osprey tilted and hit the ground as it was taking off during a joint exercise with the U.S. military on Oct. 27. An investigation has found human error was the cause. The aircraft was carrying 16 people when it 'became unstable' on takeoff from a Japanese military base on Yonaguni, a remote island southwest of Okinawa. The flight was aborted and nobody was injured, Japan Ground Self-Defense Force, or JGSDF, said at the time. In a statement on Thursday, the JGSDF said that the pilots had failed to turn on a switch designed to temporarily increase engine output during takeoff, causing the aircraft to descend and sway uncontrollably. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi said that an internal investigation determined that the incident was caused by a human error, not by 'physical or external factors.' He said that the fleet of more than a dozen V-22s would resume flight operations from Thursday after a review of safety and training measures. It was the first major incident involving Japan's V-22s since November 2023, when a U.S. Air Force Special Operations Command Osprey crashed off Japan’s southern coast, killing eight people. The fleet only resumed flight operations earlier this year, but the use of the V-22 remains controversial, particularly in Okinawa where residents have questioned its safety record. The small southern island is home to half of about 50,000 U.S. troops based in Japan.	https://apnews.com/article/japan-defense-osprey-aircraft-accident-3d6c8e4e82d1ae3a4007ed4bee8ec022	2024-11-14T03:40:43-08:00	
Biden arrives in Peru for international summit and meeting with Xi as world leaders brace for Trump	LIMA, Peru (AP) — President Joe Biden arrived Thursday in Peru to start his six-day visit to Latin America for the final major international summits of his presidency, even as world leaders turn their attention to what Donald Trump’s return to the White House means for their countries. The visit to the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Peru and stops in the Amazon rainforest and at the Group of 20 leaders summit in Brazil offer Biden one of his last chances as president to meet with heads of state he’s worked with over the years. But world leaders' eyes are firmly affixed on Trump. They already are burning up Trump's phone with congratulatory talks. At least one leader, South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol, is dusting off his golf clubs, in case the chance to bond with the golf-loving Trump should present itself. White House officials insist that Biden's visits will be substantive, with talks on climate issues, global infrastructure, counternarcotic efforts and one-on-one meetings with global leaders, including Chinese President Xi Jinping, and a joint meeting with South Korea's Yoon and Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba. The meeting with Yoon and Ishiba would aim to solidify the progress made since their initial meeting last year, White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters on Air Force One. That includes tightening security and economic cooperation amid increasingly tense relations with China and North Korea. It also would be an opportunity for them to discuss North Korean troops going to Russia to help with the war in Ukraine, Sullivan said. He says the Biden administration is working to ensure the three-country meeting is 'an enduring feature of American policy.' He expects it would continue under Trump, noting its bipartisan support, but acknowledged it was up to the incoming president's team. Biden's South American trip comes a day after he met with Trump in the White House. That wide-ranging discussion touched on the conflicts in Gaza, Lebanon and Ukraine. 'I wanted — I asked — for his views, and he gave them to me,' Trump told The New York Post after his conversation with Biden. Sullivan indicated that White House officials also are making clear to Trump's team that the delicate U.S.-China relationship is the 'paramount priority for the incoming administration.' He stressed the risks if stability is upended in the Taiwan Strait: 'that would be catastrophic for everyone involved — for Taiwan, for Beijing, for us, for the world,' he said. 'Because of the size of the risk, even if it’s not that likely, it’s something that has to be at the top of the agenda.' Beijing claims Taiwan as its own territory and vows to annex it — by force if necessary. The U.S. is Taiwan’s biggest unofficial ally and is bound by law to provide the island with the means to defend itself. Trump is nominating noted China hawks for key positions: Florida Sen. Marco Rubio for secretary of state and Florida Rep. Mike Waltz for his national security adviser. The White House had been working for months to arrange the meeting with Xi, whose country is the United States' most prominent economic and national security competitor. For Xi, front of mind will be Trump's campaign promise to impose 60% tariffs on Chinese imports. White House officials avoided commenting in detail about how Biden will approach conversations with Xi and other world leaders about Trump. Those officials say Biden also will use the summits to press allies to keep up support for Ukraine as it tries to fend off Russia's invasion and not lose sight on finding an end to the wars in Lebanon and Gaza. That includes bringing home hostages held by Hamas for more than 13 months. Between the summits, Biden will visit the Amazon rainforest, the first such visit by a sitting U.S. president. James Bosworth, founder of the Latin America-focused political consultancy Hxagon, said Biden will use one of his last big moments in the international spotlight 'to reassure the world that transitions of power are normal for democracies.' 'Biden will get public applause and praise, even as world leaders nervously await the transition,' Bosworth said. Biden's meeting with Xi will likely be the most consequential moment during the American president's time in South America. Biden has tried to maintain a steady relationship with Xi even as the U.S. administration repeatedly has raised concerns about what it sees as malign action by Beijing. U.S. intelligence officials have assessed that China has surged sales to Russia of machine tools, microelectronics and other technology that Moscow is using to produce missiles, tanks, aircraft and other weaponry to use against Ukraine. The Biden administration last month imposed sanctions on two Chinese companies accused of directly helping Russia build long-range attack drones. Tensions flared last year after Biden ordered the shooting down of a Chinese spy balloon that traversed across the intercontinental United States. And the Biden administration has criticized Chinese military assertiveness toward Japan, the Philippines and Taiwan. During the campaign, Trump spoke of his personal connection with Xi, which started out well during the Republican's first term before becoming strained over disputes about trade and the origins of COVID-19. In a congratulatory message to Trump, Xi called for the U.S. and China to manage their differences and get along in a new era, according to Chinese state media. Biden finds himself in a similar position to when then-President Barack Obama traveled to Peru in 2016 for the annual APEC leaders gathering soon after Trump's first White House victory. World leaders peppered Obama with questions about Trump's win would mean. 'His message was to wait and see ... because we didn’t know Donald Trump,' said Victor Cha, a National Security Council official in the George W. Bush administration. 'Now we’re in a very different situation where we do know what the first Trump administration was like.' ___ Associated Press writer Isabel DeBre in Lima, Peru, contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/biden-trump-apec-g20-latin-america-peru-8b317fc2c4f161a60f1a17d52eac3f0a	2024-11-14T03:11:02-08:00	
Lawmakers stage Māori protest in New Zealand's parliament during fraught race relations debate	WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — A vote in New Zealand’s parliament was suspended and two lawmakers ejected on Thursday when dramatic political theater erupted over a controversial proposed law redefining the country’s founding agreement between Indigenous Māori and the British Crown. Under the principles laid out in the 1840 Treaty of Waitangi, which guide the relationship between the government and Māori, tribes were promised broad rights to retain their lands and protect their interests in return for ceding governance to the British. The bill would specify that those rights should apply to all New Zealanders. The bill has scant support and is unlikely to become law. Detractors say it threatens racial discord and constitutional upheaval, while thousands of New Zealanders are traveling the length of the country this week to protest it. Despite its unpopularity, however, the proposed law passed its first vote on Thursday after dominating public discussion for months, due to a quirk of New Zealand’s political system that allows tiny parties to negotiate outsized influence for their agendas. It also reflects unease among some New Zealanders about more rapid progress in recent years toward upholding the promises made to Māori when the country was colonized. A 184-year-old treaty provokes fresh debate For decades after the Treaty of Waitangi was signed, differences between the English and Māori texts and breaches by New Zealand governments intensified the disenfranchisement of Māori. By the middle of the 20th century, Indigenous language and culture had dwindled, much tribal land was confiscated and Māori were disadvantaged on every metric. As the Indigenous protest movement surged in the 1970s, lawmakers and the courts slowly began to elucidate what it understood the treaty to promise Māori: partnership with the Crown, participation in decision-making and protection of their interests. 'What all of these principles have in common is that they afford Māori different rights from other New Zealanders,' David Seymour, leader of minor libertarian party ACT and the bill’s author, said Thursday. To those who have championed the treaty, that is the point. Work has involved billion-dollar land settlements, embrace of the Māori language, guaranteed representation in central and local government and attempts through policy to reverse the stark inequities Indigenous people still face. But Seymour – who is Māori -- said no law or court had actually settled for good a definition of the treaty’s principles, and that had caused division. His bill filled 'a silence this parliament has left for five decades,' he said. Lawmakers vote for a bill they oppose Prime Minister Christopher Luxon disagrees, but his party voted for the bill Thursday to fulfil the political deal with Seymour that handed Luxon power. Without enough seats to govern after last October's election, Luxon curried support from two minor parties – including Seymour's ACT, which won less than 9% of the vote – in return for political concessions. Luxon told Seymour his party would vote for the treaty bill once, while promising publicly that it would go no further. The treaty’s principles had been negotiated and debated for 184 years, Luxon told reporters Thursday, and it was 'simplistic' for Seymour to suggest that they could be resolved 'through the stroke of a pen'. Government lawmakers made awkward speeches in parliament explaining that they opposed the bill before voting for it to jeers from opponents, who demanded they break ranks. Luxon was spared that; he left the country for the meeting of leaders from the Asia-Pacific APEC bloc hours before the vote. His political horse-trading drew scorn from opposition lawmakers. A fraught and outraged response 'Shame! Shame! Shame on you, David Seymour,' roared Willie Jackson, a veteran Māori lawmaker. 'Shame on you for what you’re trying to do to this nation.' Jackson was thrown out of the debating chamber by Speaker Gerry Brownlee for calling Seymour a liar. 'You are complicit in the harm and the division that this presents,' said Rawiri Waititi, a lawmaker from Te Pāti Māori, an Indigenous group, speaking to all who advanced the bill. 'If you vote for this bill, this is who you are,' Green party leader Chloe Swarbrick told Luxon's lawmakers. No one deviated from their planned votes and the bill passed. But not before one final flashpoint. A rare outburst of protest When asked how her party’s lawmakers would vote, Hana-Rawhiti Maipi-Clarke of Te Pāti Māori stood and began a ringing haka – a rhythmic Māori chant of challenge – which swelled to a roar as first opposition lawmakers, and then spectators in the public gallery, joined in. An irate Brownlee was unable to quiet the fracas as opponents approached Seymour’s seat. The live broadcast of Parliament’s proceedings was cut and Brownlee ordered the public be removed before the vote resumed. He suspended Maipi-Clarke, 22, from Parliament for a day. The bill will proceed to a public submission process before another vote. Seymour hopes for an outpouring of support to change Luxon's mind about vetoing it. The proposal will shortly roil Parliament again. Thousands of protesters are due to arrive in the capital, Wellington, on Tuesday for what is likely to be one of the largest race relations marches in New Zealand’s history.	https://apnews.com/article/treaty-waitangi-protest-maori-zealand-seymour-haka-b85059be2620fc08b21ae06f62ab5079	2024-11-14T02:42:49-08:00	
UK plans to create pension megafunds with aim of unlocking $100 billion for investment	LONDON (AP) — British Treasury chief Rachel Reeves said Thursday the government planned to merge dozens of pension funds with the aim of unlocking tens of billions of pounds for investment and boosting the U.K.'s subpar economic growth. Reeves said in her speech to finance leaders in central London that the creation of so-called 'megafunds' will represent the 'biggest pension reform in decades.' In her first so-called Mansion House speech, an annual ritual for British chancellors of the exchequer, Reeves said the changes could help unlock 80 billion pounds ($100 billion) for investment. Pension funds invest in a variety of assets, such as shares, bonds, real estate and infrastructure, in an attempt to increase the retirement benefits for their members. The proposed merger of 86 local authority pension funds in England and Wales has echoes in Australia and Canada, where pension funds are widely seen to have taken advantage of their bigger size to invest in assets and boost growth. By 2030, the new Local Government Pension Scheme in England and Wales is set to manage assets worth around 500 billion pounds by 2030. The Labour government will introduce the reforms through a bill in parliament next year. Early indications suggest it has broad support across the political divide — the former Conservative government had indicated it would go this route, too — and within the pensions industry. 'Larger pension schemes can help achieve better outcomes for savers through economies of scale, stronger governance, negotiating power and additional resources,' said Zoe Alexander, director of policy and advocacy at the Pensions and Lifetime Savings Association, an organization that seeks to bring the industry together and promote best practices. Business leaders cautiously welcomed the reform plan but said the government needs to work hard to win their support following Reeves's tax-raising budget last month. 'With the budget piling additional costs on firms and squeezing their headroom to invest, the government needs to work hard to regain the confidence in the U.K. as a place businesses and communities can succeed,' said Confederation of British Industry chief economist Louise Hellem. 'Pension schemes will want to operate within a U.K. economy that is prospering,' she added. Since the global financial crisis in 2008-9, the British economy has underperformed relative to previous years. The government's main aim is to bolster growth. Figures Friday are predicted to show that the economy barely grew in the second quarter of the year.	https://apnews.com/article/britain-pensions-reeves-megafund-investment-growth-treasury-0c4cc275d3db9907469f6d58f49a0eff	2024-11-14T02:24:48-08:00	
AP PHOTOS: Thick smog shrouds Asian cities	NEW DELHI (AP) — Thick smog shrouded New Delhi and other cities around South and Southeast Asia as air pollution levels soared Thursday. Air pollution in the region worsens particularly in winter when the burning of crop residue in agricultural areas coincides with cooler temperatures that trap the smoke. The smoke is blown into cities, where there are more people and where auto emissions further add to the pollution. Emissions from industries without pollution controls and the use of coal to produce electricity are also linked to poor air quality in urban areas. Several studies have estimated more than a million Indians die each year from air pollution-related diseases. New Delhi’s air quality fell into the severe category, according to SAFAR, India’s main environmental monitoring agency. It measures particulate matter in the air that can enter the lungs. In many areas of the city, the levels were more than 50 times higher than the World Health Organization’s recommended safe limit. Forecasters warned air quality will worsen before the arrival of cold winds next week that could blow away the smog. Lahore, Pakistan, which is on the border with India, had an air quality index level considered hazardous, according to the Swiss group IQAir, which tracks global air quality. The levels in Hanoi, Vietnam, were unhealthy, according to IQAir. Transport, industry and construction were the main causes of bad air in Hanoi, Nguyen Hoang Anh, deputy head of the environmental quality management division at the ministry’s Pollution Control Department told state media on Monday. Hanoi has around 1 million cars and nearly 7 million motorbikes. Many are old and don’t meet emission standards. Construction projects also don’t stop dust from escaping, and factories use fossil fuel for power, contributing to the city’s smog. Bangkok’s air quality was unhealthy for sensitive groups on IQAir. The Meteorological Department said air ventilation rates have been poor recently and an atmospheric inversion layer caused airborne particles to accumulate.	https://apnews.com/article/india-air-pollution-smog-emissions-crop-burning-fe92c7a6d45ed080704945be41bc1303	2024-11-14T01:09:01-08:00	
Head of UN's nuclear watchdog visits Iran as Mideast wars and Trump's return raise worries	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency warned Thursday that the 'space for negotiation and diplomacy ... is getting smaller' over Iran's advancing atomic program as wars in the Mideast rage on and as President Donald Trump will return to the White House. Rafael Mariano Grossi of the IAEA was visiting Tehran in an effort to restore his inspectors' access to Iran's program and answer still-outstanding questions over it, as he has on previous trips with limited success since Trump unilaterally withdrew the U.S. from the Islamic Republic's nuclear deal with world powers. However, the remarks from both Grossi and his Iranian counterpart at a news conference suggested sizeable gaps still exist, even as some countries are pushing to take action against Iran at an upcoming IAEA Board of Governors' meeting. 'We know that it is indispensable to get, at this point of time, to get some concrete, tangible and visible results that will indicate that this joint work is improving (the) situation, is bringing clarification to things and in a general sense it is moving us away from conflict and ultimately war,' Grossi said. Since the deal’s collapse in 2018, Iran has abandoned all limits on its program, and enriches uranium to up to 60% purity — near weapons-grade levels of 90%. Surveillance cameras installed by the IAEA have been disrupted, while Iran has barred some of the Vienna-based agency’s most experienced inspectors. Iranian officials also have increasingly threatened that they could pursue atomic weapons, something the West and the IAEA has been worried about for years since Tehran abandoned an organized weapons program in 2003. Speaking at a news conference with Mohammad Eslami of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, Grossi stressed that while the IAEA and Iran continued to negotiate, time was not necessarily on their side. 'The fact that international tensions and regional tensions do exist — this shows that the space for negotiation and diplomacy is not getting bigger, it is getting smaller,' Grossi said. Before appearing with Eslami, Grossi met with Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, who later wrote on the social platform X that 'differences can be resolved through cooperation and dialogue.' However, he warned Tehran was 'NOT ready to negotiate under pressure and intimidation.' Some politicians have even suggested Iran abandon the Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons, known as the NPT, and pursue the bomb. Araghchi referred to Iran as 'a committed member of NPT,' though Eslami in his remarks warned Iran could retaliate if challenged at the upcoming IAEA Board of Governors' meeting. Grossi acknowledged some nations were considering taking action against Iran. 'We have repeatedly said any resolution seeking to intervene in the Islamic Republic of Iran’s nuclear affairs will be definitely followed by immediate reciprocal steps and we will not allow them to (exert) this kind of pressure,' Eslami said. Journalists at the news conference, as well as Eslami, criticized Israel for its longtime sabotage and assassination campaign targeting Iran's nuclear program. Some noted Israeli officials had threatened Iran's nuclear sites as targets for potential retaliation as Iran and Israel trade direct attacks amid the ongoing Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip and Israel's ground and air offensive in Lebanon. 'The answer is in what we do here, what we, the IAEA, and Iran can do in terms of solving the questions at hand,' Grossi said, describing 'a situation of tension' with Iran's nuclear program at its center. 'I am here to work with Iran, (to) try to find adequate solutions to ease tensions, to move forward. This is my target. This is my concern. And I am confident that we are going to be able to do it,' he said. But as the two men ended the news conference to shouted questions from journalists, neither had offered any sign a breakthrough was imminent. Grossi also met Thursday for the first time with reformist President Masoud Pezeshkian. He’s scheduled to visit Iran’s Fordo and Natanz nuclear enrichment sites Friday. ___ Associated Press writer Nasser Karimi in Tehran, Iran, contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/iran-iaea-nuclear-program-grossi-trump-eslami-ce1dcf29eb76a89bd83d51768597d887	2024-11-14T01:05:38-08:00	
Middle East latest: Human Rights Watch accuses Israel of war crimes in Gaza Strip	Human Rights Watch said in a report released Thursday that Israel has committed war crimes and crimes against humanity in the Gaza Strip, including massive forced displacements that amount to ethnic cleansing. A new report released by the New York-based rights group said people have been killed while evacuating under Israeli orders and in Israeli-designated humanitarian zones, where hundreds of thousands are crammed into squalid tent camps. The report said the widespread, deliberate demolition of homes and civilian infrastructure in Gaza -– some of them to carve a new road bisecting the territory and establish a buffer zone along Israel’s border -– was likely to 'permanently displace' many Palestinians. 'Such actions of the Israeli authorities amount to ethnic cleansing,' Human Rights Watch said. The Israeli military did not immediately comment on the report. Israel’s blistering campaign in Gaza has killed over 43,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to local health officials who do not distinguish between civilians and combatants. Around 90% of the territory’s population has fled their homes, with many displaced multiple times. The Israeli offensive has also damaged or destroyed around two-thirds of homes and other buildings in Gaza, according to U.N. assessments. Israel says it does not deliberately target civilians and blames Hamas for their deaths, saying the militants hide among civilians and operate in residential areas. Israeli forces have encircled the Gaza Strip’s northernmost areas for the past month, saying Hamas militants have regrouped there. Experts say the Israeli military campaign has caused a new wave of displaced civilians and warn that famine is imminent or may already be happening there. Israel has also been striking deeper inside Lebanon since September as it escalates the war against Hezbollah. On Thursday Israeli warplanes intensified airstrikes targeting multiple areas of Lebanon, killing at least nine people in the eastern city of Baalbek. The Israel-Hamas war began after Palestinian militants stormed into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people — mostly civilians — and abducting 250 others. Lebanon's Hezbollah group began firing into Israel on Oct. 8, 2023, in solidarity with Hamas in Gaza. Since then, more than 3,200 people have been killed in Lebanon and more than 14,200 wounded, the country's Health Ministry reported. In Israel, 76 people have been killed, including 31 soldiers. ___ Here's the latest: Lebanon reports 9 killed in airstrike on eastern city; strikes continue targeting Beirut suburbs BEIRUT — An Israeli airstrike hit a building in Baalbek city in eastern Lebanon, killing at least nine people and wounding five others, Lebanon’s state media said. The strike on Baalbek came without warning. The Israeli military did not immediately comment and the target was not clear. Israeli warplanes intensified airstrikes on Thursday, targeting various areas in southern and eastern Lebanon, including the outskirts of the southern port city of Tyre city and the Nabatieh province, the National News Agency said. Throughout the day, sporadic airstrikes targeted Beirut’s southern suburbs in a clear uptick in attacks on the area over the past two days, with the Israeli army issuing evacuation warnings for several locations and buildings in the suburbs. The Israeli military said it carried out strikes on Hezbollah targets in the Dahiyeh area, including weapons storage facilities and command centers. Lebanon’s Health Ministry said the death toll in Lebanon since the war began on Oct. 8, 2023 has reached 3,365 while those wounded are 14,344. Nearly 1.2 million people have been displaced in Lebanon.

EU's top diplomat proposes suspending political dialogue with Israel BRUSSELS — The European Union’s top diplomat is proposing that the bloc suspend political dialogue with Israel over concerns about human rights abuses and breaches of international law in its war against Hamas. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell will put the proposal to foreign ministers from the 27 member countries at a meeting he will chair in Brussels on Monday. Borrell 'will ask ministers to consider whether Israel is violating human rights, whether Israel is respecting or not international humanitarian law, and he will invite the ministers to express their views on his proposal to suspend political dialogue,' his spokesman said. The EU is deeply divided over Israel and the Palestinians and it’s unlikely that all the ministers would agree to halt the dialogue. 'Any kind of decisions regarding the political parts of this agreement are subject to unanimity of all the member states,' the spokesman, Peter Stano, told reporters on Thursday. Under the pact, the dialogue covers 'all subjects of common interest, and shall aim to open the way to new forms of cooperation with a view to common goals, in particular peace, security and democracy.' It’s meant to strengthen EU-Israeli relations.

Many in the minority community had seen the village as a symbol of their larger struggle against Israeli plans to relocate them. On Thursday, Israeli bulldozers entered the 400-person village in the Negev Desert and demolished the last building left standing –- the mosque. Residents had dismantled their makeshift homes earlier this week to avoid having to pay fees for the state to demolish them. Israel says the hundreds of villagers were squatting on public land and has offered them plots in a nearby Bedouin township. The villagers accuse the authorities of forcibly displacing them so the land can be developed for Israel’s Jewish majority. Israel’s far-right national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, celebrated the move, posting on X that there has been a 400% increase in the issuance of such demolition orders so far this year. 'Proud to lead a strong policy of demolishing illegal houses in the Negev!' he wrote. Or Hanoch, an Israeli activist who witnessed the demolition, said drones and helicopters hovered overhead as seven police bulldozers took down the mosque. 'After the mosque was demolished, the rest of the heavy machinery started re-destroying the rest of the houses, which were already demolished,' Hanoch said. Three members of the village council were arrested early Thursday before the demolition began, said Nati Yefet, the spokesperson for the Regional Council for Unrecognized Villages in the Negev. The council has accused Israel of clearing the land for the construction of a Jewish community. 'The destruction of Umm al-Hiran to make way for the settlement of Dror is part of a systematic population replacement program in the Negev,' it said. Four other Bedouin villages have been demolished this year as part of a larger plan to raze unrecognized villages and build new Jewish communities in their place, it said. Umm al-Hiran was founded in its current location in 1956, after the Israeli military relocated the village clan multiple times following the 1948 war that led to Israel’s creation. Israel’s more than 200,000 Bedouin are the poorest members of the country’s Arab minority, which also includes Christian and Muslim urban communities. Israel’s Arab population, which makes up roughly 20% of the country’s 10 million people, are citizens with the right to vote but often suffer discrimination and tend to identify with Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Syrian state media report explosions near Damascus and Homs DAMASCUS, Syria — Syrian state media are reporting explosions near the capital, Damascus, and the central city of Homs in what appeared to be Israeli airstrikes. State news agency SANA said the country’s air defenses were activated against a 'hostile target' south of Homs on Thursday. It gave no further details. The agency later reported an explosion near Damascus, adding that the cause of the blasts was not immediately clear. Israel has carried out hundreds of airstrikes in Syria targeting members of Lebanon’s Hezbollah and officials from Iranian-backed groups. Israel says it has allowed 15 trucks carrying aid into northern Gaza JERUSALEM — Israel says 15 trucks loaded with aid have been allowed into northern Gaza, where aid groups have warned that a monthlong offensive could cause a famine. The military body handling aid deliveries into the territory, COGAT, said the 15 trucks entered Gaza on Wednesday with aid shipped in by sea by the United Arab Emirates. It said the aid consists of food and water, as well as hygiene, shelter and medical supplies. U.N. agencies did not immediately confirm that the aid was delivered to its destination inside northern Gaza. Over the past week, the U.N. says aid trucks have entered the north but have not reached their final destinations due to Israeli movement restrictions and hungry crowds taking items from the trucks. Israel has scrambled to ramp up aid to Gaza after a monthlong stretch during which aid plunged to its lowest levels this year. The U.S. Biden administration warned Israel to increase the aid last month, saying a failure to do so could lead to a reduction in military support. The White House backed down this week, citing some improvements and ruling out any reduction in arms supplies, even after international aid groups said Israel had fallen far short of the American demands. Human Rights Watch accuses Israel of war crimes, crimes against humanity in the Gaza Strip JERUSALEM — Human Rights Watch says Israel has committed war crimes and crimes against humanity in the Gaza Strip, including massive forced displacements that amount to ethnic cleansing. A report released by the New York-based rights group on Thursday says Israeli evacuation orders have often caused 'grave harm' to civilians. People have been killed while evacuating and in Israeli-designated humanitarian zones, where hundreds of thousands are crammed into squalid tent camps. 'The Israeli government cannot claim to be keeping Palestinians safe when it kills them along escape routes, bombs so-called safe zones, and cuts off food, water, and sanitation,' said Nadia Hardman, refugee and migrant rights researcher at Human Rights Watch. The report said the widespread, deliberate demolition of homes and civilian infrastructure in Gaza -– some of them to carve a new road bisecting the territory and establish a buffer zone along Israel’s border -– was likely to 'permanently displace' many Palestinians. 'Such actions of the Israeli authorities amount to ethnic cleansing,' Human Rights Watch said. The Israeli military did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the report. Human Rights Watch called on governments to stop supplying weapons to Israel and to comply with a July opinion by the International Court of Justice saying Israel’s presence in the Palestinian territories is unlawful and must end. The group says its researchers interviewed 39 displaced Palestinians in Gaza, reviewed evacuation orders Israel has released throughout the war and analyzed satellite imagery and video of attacks along evacuation routes and in 'safe zones.' US military says it conducted strikes against Houthi rebels DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — The U.S. military says it has conducted several days of strikes targeting Yemen’s Houthi rebels. The strikes included U.S. Air Force and U.S. Navy aircraft, including the Navy’s F-35C stealth fighter jet, it said Thursday. The military also released video showing a strike by an MQ-9 Reaper drone on a mobile missile launcher placed on the back of what appeared to be a truck. A person standing next to the launcher is seen running away after the strike. 'This targeted operation was conducted in response to the Houthi’s repeated and unlawful attacks on international commercial shipping, as well as U.S., coalition and merchant vessels in the Red Sea, Bab al-Mandeb Strait and the Gulf of Aden,' the U.S. military’s Central Command said. 'It also aimed to degrade the Houthi’s ability to threaten regional partners.' The strikes happened Saturday and Sunday. The Houthis launched an attack this week targeted two U.S. Navy destroyers entering the Red Sea. The Americans said they 'engaged and defeated' eight bomb-carrying drones, five anti-ship ballistic missiles and four cruise missiles that the Houthis used to target the vessels. ___ For more Middle East news: https://apnews.com/hub/middle-east	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-hezbollah-mideast-latest-14-november-2024-ad692fc0f735157f8ed7997922e0138b	2024-11-14T01:00:11-08:00	
French weapons system found in Sudan is likely violation of U.N. arms embargo, says Amnesty	CAIRO (AP) — Armored vehicles manufactured by the United Arab Emirates and equipped with French defense systems have been captured by the Sudanese army during the civil war in Sudan, Amnesty International says. The rights group said in a report on Thursday it had identified the UAE-made armored personnel carriers (APCs) in various parts of Sudan, including the Darfur region, where they were used by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) in its fight with the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF). It added that the presence of the military vehicles on the battlefield 'likely constitutes a violation' of a United Nations arms embargo that prohibits the transfer of weapons to Sudan. The civil war broke out in April 2023 after simmering tensions between the RSF and the Sudanese army escalated to intense fighting across the North African country, where rampant human rights violations were committed. More than 20,000 people have been killed in the conflict, according to the U.N., while 11.6 million have been forcibly displaced, including 8.3 million people internally and 3.1 million people who fled to neighboring countries. Sudan's claim that the UAE has been supplying the RSF with weapons that prolonged the 18-month war with the army has been denied by the UAE. Amnesty's report said it had identified the presence of several Nimr Ajban APCs on the ground after verifying pictures shared on social media showing the vehicles captured or destroyed by the Sudanese army. The vehicles were reportedly made in the UAE by Edge Group and equipped with the Galix reactive defense system, which is manufactured in France by Lacroix Defense and KNDS France, according to the Amnesty report. The Galix system is designed to protect vehicles from approaching threats by releasing projectiles, smoke and decoys, according to Lacroix’s website. 'Our research shows that weaponry designed and manufactured in France is in active use on the battlefield in Sudan,' said Agnès Callamard, Amnesty International’s Secretary General. 'The Galix System is being deployed by the RSF in this conflict, and any use in Darfur would be a clear breach of the U.N. arms embargo. 'The French government must ensure that Lacroix Defense and KNDS France immediately stop the supply of this system to the UAE.' ِLacroix has been contacted through its website form for comment. Responding to the Amnesty report, a spokesperson for the Emirati government said in an emailed statement that the UAE is the 'target of a coordinated disinformation campaign aimed at undermining our foreign policy, regional role, and humanitarian efforts.' 'It is both outrageous and unacceptable that the SAF representatives continue to level accusations against the UAE, alleging our involvement in the ongoing conflict,' the statement read, adding that the UAE has been involved with humanitarian initiatives to help Sudanese people in the conflict. The UAE said it has told the U.N. Security Council and international partners that it is not providing support or supplies to the RSF or 'any of the belligerent warring parties in Sudan.' Last month, the United States sanctioned Algoney Hamdan Daglo Musa, a senior RSF leader and the brother of the paramilitary’s commander Mohamed Hamdan Daglo, for 'leading efforts' to supply weapons throughout the war. Algoney controls the UAE-based Tradive General Trading LLC, a front company that imported vehicles to Sudan on behalf of the paramilitary RSF and retrofitted them with machine guns.	https://apnews.com/article/sudan-war-uae-france-arms-embargo-7c8b68e42f6c51cecabd69637f332670	2024-11-14T00:53:00-08:00	
South African government says it won't help thousands of illegal miners inside a closed mine	JOHANNESBURG (AP) — South Africa's government says it will not help an estimated 4,000 illegal miners inside a closed mine in the country's North West province who have been denied access to basic supplies as part of an official strategy against illegal mining. The miners in the mineshaft in Stilfontein are believed to be suffering from a lack of food, water and other basic necessities after police closed off the entrances used to transport their supplies underground. It is part of the police’s Vala Umgodi, or Close the Hole, operation, which includes cutting off miners’ supplies to force them to return to the surface and be arrested. North West police spokesperson Sabata Mokgwabone said information received from those who recently helped bring three miners to the surface indicated that as many as 4,000 miners may be underground. Police have not provided an official estimate. In the past few weeks, over 1,000 miners have surfaced at various mines in North West province, with many reported to be weak, hungry and sickly after going for weeks without basic supplies. Police continue on Thursday to guard areas around the mine to catch all those appearing from underground. Cabinet Minister Khumbudzo Ntshavheni told reporters on Wednesday that the government would not send any help to the illegal miners because they are involved in a criminal act. 'We are not sending help to criminals. We are going to smoke them out. They will come out. Criminals are not to be helped. We didn’t send them there,' Ntshavheni said. Illegal mining remains common in South Africa's old gold-mining areas, with miners going into closed shafts to dig for any possible remaining deposits. The illegal miners are often from neighboring countries, and police say the illegal operations involve larger syndicates that employ the miners. Their presence in closed mines have also created problems with nearby communities, which complain that the illegal miners commit crimes ranging from robberies to rape. Illegal mining groups are known to be heavily armed and disputes between rival groups sometimes result in fatal confrontations.	https://apnews.com/article/south-africa-illegal-miners-arrests-4d376ae6f6afca6170220f88fe859f90	2024-11-14T00:29:16-08:00	
Trump's mainstream picks for top foreign policy posts could reassure allies — and worry China	WASHINGTON (AP) — President-elect Donald Trump is famously unconventional, but he made conventional picks for his two top foreign policy positions. That could be reassuring to American allies, while China and Iran have reasons to be wary. Trump on Wednesday announced his choice of Sen. Marco Rubio for secretary of state. Two days earlier, he picked Rep. Mike Waltz for national security adviser. Both men share Trump's hard-line stance on China and Iran. They have shown themselves willing to adapt their foreign-policy positions to echo aspects of Trump’s more isolationist 'America First' approach — a requirement for anyone serving under a president who demands absolute loyalty. But both are fairly mainstream conservatives with foreign policy experience who have previously differed with Trump on Russia, NATO and other issues. They've also been open to working with Democrats — a point underscored when Sen. Mark Warner, the Democratic chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said Rubio would be a 'strong voice for American interests' abroad. Rubio and Waltz stand in contrast to some other national security selections. Trump named Pete Hegseth, a Fox News host untested on the global stage, as defense secretary. He picked a congresswoman with little foreign policy experience, Rep. Elise Stefanik, as ambassador to the United Nations. His choice for ambassador to Israel, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, rejects the two-state solution to the conflict with Palestinians. And U.S. allies may be relieved that Rubio was selected over Richard Grenell for secretary of state. Grenell is an ardent and combative Trump advocate and former diplomat and intelligence official, with a reputation for favoring autocratic strongmen abroad. Rubio, a 14-year veteran of the Senate, is a senior member of the Senate Intelligence Committee and Foreign Relations Committee. His roots as the son of Cuban immigrants who worked as a bartender and a hotel maid after coming to the United States helped shape his tough positions on the leftist governments of Cuba and Venezuela. While Trump has alarmed U.S. allies in Europe with his criticism of the NATO military alliance and praise of Russian President Vladimir Putin, whose war on Ukraine has galvanized European fears of Russian expansionism, Rubio was instrumental in the Senate in securing the U.S. position in NATO. He and Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine spearheaded legislation to bar any president from pulling the U.S. out of NATO without Senate approval or an act of Congress. But Rubio, like Waltz in the House, has altered his public statements and legislative votes to more closely align with Trump's criticism of the Biden administration's backing of Ukraine as it battles invading Russian forces. After early votes and supportive statements for Ukraine after Russia's 2022 attack, Rubio and Waltz more recently voted against additional military aid to Ukraine. Rubio, like Trump, has increasingly stressed the need to end the war. That's in contrast to Ukraine supporters in both parties who say the U.S. must support Ukraine's fight so it gets the best possible terms in any eventual cease-fire. 'I don’t think he (Trump) puts people in positions that are going to disagree with him. He wants people to be loyal, and I don’t think he’s looking for people that are going to challenge his beliefs,' said Kelly Grieco, a senior fellow at the Stimson Center, a Washington-based research institute. 'So I think this is actually quite revealing, probably, of what the direction of U.S. policy will be, that it will be really hawkish on China in particular. And I think also on Iran.' In China, analysts consider Rubio and Waltz to be 'ultra-hawkish' toward Beijing and have taken to calling them part of the 'Florida faction' in foreign policy, since both are from the state. Trump piled tariffs on China in his first term and promises more tariffs in his next one. Rubio has argued for a more confrontational approach toward China, and he has been a vocal supporter of Taiwan, which Beijing sees as Chinese territory. Rubio is known in China as the 'anti-China vanguard' for his ideologically driven, anti-communism stance. He landed on Beijing’s blacklist in 2020 over his support for the minority Uyghurs in China’s far western region of Xinjiang and for Hong Kong activists. He co-chaired the bipartisan Congressional-Executive Commission on China, which focuses on human rights, and introduced and supported numerous bills on China’s rights issues. The sanctions Beijing imposed on Rubio bar him from visiting the country. It’s unclear if China's foreign minister will meet with him given the ban, or how the ban will otherwise affect his dealings with Chinese officials. For his part, Waltz is a former Green Beret with combat tours in Afghanistan and the Middle East, a former defense policy director in the Pentagon, and a senior member of the House committees for armed services, intelligence and oversight. He’s supported Western backing for Ukraine, saying doing nothing would invite further Russian aggression in Europe and draw in U.S. troops. But Waltz increasingly emphasizes the importance of Ukraine’s neighbors stepping up, saying Europeans should be spending as much on Ukraine's defense as the United States does. In a Nov. 2 article he co-wrote for The Economist, Waltz argued that China has benefited from the Biden administration’s failures to deter conflicts in Europe and in the Middle East. In 2021, Waltz introduced a resolution calling on the U.S. Olympic Committee to withdraw from the 2022 Winter Games in Beijing. 'The world cannot legitimize the CCP’s acts of genocide in Xinjiang, destruction of the democratic rights of Hong Kong, and dangerous suppression of the coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan that cost lives by sending delegations to Beijing,' Waltz said then, referring to the Chinese Communist Party. At a daily briefing in Beijing, Lin Jian, a spokesman for the Chinese foreign ministry, said China would not comment on Trump's appointments. Shen Dingli, a Shanghai-based international relations expert, noted the gap between Trump and his nominees on China. 'Trump didn’t say China was an enemy during his first term and the presidential elections, but the hawkish officials he has appointed may believe China is an enemy to some extent,' Shen said. Robert Manning, a China expert at the Stimson Center, said Trump is not as ideologically driven as Rubio but he raised concerns that Trump's foreign policy could be more disruptive than President Joe Biden's. 'I think some in the Trump camp want to get rid of the Communist Party of China, which I think is a fool’s errand, but nonetheless I think they’re more focused on a different endgame than achieving a stable balance of power,' he said. ___ Associated Press writer Mary Clare Jalonick in Washington and AP researchers Yu Bing and Liu Zheng in Beijing contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/trump-rubio-waltz-china-foreign-policy-6179fa4a34e8c1768c75ad70b55b17cc	2024-11-13T20:08:23-08:00	
The Latin Grammys are almost here for a 25th anniversary celebration	The 2024 Latin Grammy Awards are here and back in Miami. It's a big year: the award show is celebrating its 25th anniversary, and Latin music genres have never been bigger globally. So, what should you expect? Édgar Barrera — the producer and songwriter known for his work with such artists as Madonna, Karol G, Peso Pluma, Shakira, Grupo Frontera and beyond — leads the 2024 Latin Grammy nominations for a second year in a row. This year, he’s up for nine awards; last year he received 13 nominations and won three. Barrera is nominated for producer, songwriter, record and album of the year. He’s also nominated twice in the best Regional Mexican song category, and three times in the song of the year category, for his work on Shakira and Grupo Frontera’s 'Entre Paréntesis', Karol G’s 'Mi Ex Tenía Razón,' and Maluma and Carin León’s 'Según Quién.' Just behind Barrera are some of his collaborators, like Karol G and Bad Bunny. Those giants of reggaetón and beyond are tied with eight nominations each. Colombian songwriter Keityn has six nods. The Latin Grammys will begin at 8 p.m. Eastern and are being held at the Kaseya Center in Miami. Performers at this year’s bash include Barrera, Residente, Myke Towers, DJ Khaled, Jon Bon Jovi, Joe Jonas, Anitta, Becky G, Eladio Carrión, Grupo Frontera, Kali Uchis, Pitbull, Luis Fonsi, Juan Luis Guerra, Carín León and many more. The 2024 Latin Recording Academy Person of the Year recipient, Carlos Vives, will also perform. Past winners include Juanes, Laura Pausini, Marco Antonio Solís, Rubén Blades and more. There are also two new categories this year: best Latin electronic music performance, housed within the new electronic music field, and best contemporary Mexican music album. The three-hour 25th annual Latin Grammy Awards telecast will air live on Univision, UniMás, Galavisión and ViX.	https://apnews.com/article/2024-latin-grammys-show-a1320963a36cc848ea4a8d7b521a0cba	2024-11-13T20:07:43-08:00	
Ukrainian soldiers focus on keeping Russian advances at bay and brace for storm to come from US	KHARKIV REGION, Ukraine (AP) — The four drones were designed to carry bombs, but instead the men of Ukraine's Khartia brigade pack them with food, water and handwarmers and launch them in darkness toward the front line, a 15-minute flight away. The unit commander who goes by the callsign Kit, or 'cat,' pilots the tiny uncrewed aircraft from a basement room he jokingly calls their Airbnb. Guided by the drone's night-vision camera, he drops the 10-kilogram (22-pound) packages one by one as close as he can to the position where as many as five infantrymen battle Russian forces in the late autumn chill. The delivery will hold them for two or three days. That's about as far as Kit dares look into the future. He knows that the reelection of Donald Trump will change something in his life, but as far as he and other Ukrainian soldiers on the front are concerned, trying to figure out how is a game for politicians. For him, all that matters is the distance he measures in the meters (yards) that Russian forces advance or retreat in the front-line sector that is his responsibility. 'We are trying with all our might to destroy them and win back our territories, so that it does not go any further, so that there are no more destroyed cities and destroyed lives,' Kit said. 'We need to focus on the present in our work and try to do it effectively in the here and now.' But he cannot escape the sense of a gathering storm. Russia is increasingly hitting the Kharkiv region with unstoppable, building-leveling glide bombs and swarms of drones and chipping away at territory there. Its troops are advancing in the Donetsk and Zaporizhzhia regions. Up to 12,000 North Korean troops have been sent to Russia's Kursk border region to help beat back Ukrainian forces there, according to U.S., South Korean and Ukrainian intelligence assessments. Trump, who has called President Vladimir Putin 'pretty smart' for invading Ukraine, has repeatedly criticized American backing of Ukraine. He characterized Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as 'the greatest salesman on Earth' for winning U.S. aid. Zelenskyy was among the first world leaders to publicly congratulate Trump, and said the two discussed how to end 'Russian aggression against Ukraine' when they met in September. Between now and Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration, the Biden administration has said it will send as much aid to Ukraine as possible to help hold back Russian forces and possess a strong hand in any potential peace negotiations. But Russia is pressing just as hard for an advantage in what most believe are crucial weeks to come. Aviator, a Khartia soldier launching the supply drones, said he can only do his job and hope for the best. His attention is fixed on how many hours remain before the coming dawn, when Russian forces will be able to spot the uncrewed aircraft and shoot them down. If his mission fails, he knows that the men he calls brothers will suffer. 'You feel you’re useful, that you are in the right place, that the lives and health of our brothers depend on your work,' said Aviator, who returned to Ukraine from a job in Poland to join the army. 'We’re just doing our job, we don’t have time to worry about the election.' Tolstiy, who runs a drone repair workshop not far away, knows firsthand what happens to territory captured by Russia. A former infantryman, he fought in Bakhmut and watched the city fall to Russian forces who bombed it to rubble. He confessed that sometimes, reading the news makes him want to give up. But that's simply unthinkable. 'It’s like we’re in another world here,' he said. 'When you see that your comrades are injured or killed, it motivates you.' ___ Lori Hinnant contributed from Kyiv.	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-trump-frontline-weapons-b466c861d935c5b41631a6710ce9ea48	2024-11-13T20:07:24-08:00	
1 million migrants in the US rely on temporary protections that Trump could target	NEW YORK (AP) — Maribel Hidalgo fled her native Venezuela a year ago with a 1-year-old son, trudging for days through Panama's Darien Gap, then riding the rails across Mexico to the United States. They were living in the U.S. when the Biden administration announced Venezuelans would be offered Temporary Protected Status, which allows people already in the United States to stay and work legally if their homelands are deemed unsafe. People from 17 countries, including Haiti, Afghanistan, Sudan and recently Lebanon, are currently receiving such relief. But President-elect Donald Trump and his running mate, JD Vance, have promised mass deportations and suggested they would scale back the use of TPS that covers more than 1 million immigrants. They have highlighted unfounded claims that Haitians who live and work legally in Springfield, Ohio, as TPS holders were eating their neighbors’ pets. Trump also amplified disputed claims made by the mayor of Aurora, Colorado, about Venezuelan gangs taking over an apartment complex. 'What Donald Trump has proposed doing is we’re going to stop doing mass parole,' Vance said at an Arizona rally in October, mentioning a separate immigration status called humanitarian parole that is also at risk. 'We’re going to stop doing mass grants of Temporary Protected Status.' Hidalgo wept as she discussed her plight with a reporter as her son, now 2, slept in a stroller outside the New York migrant hotel where they live. At least 7.7 million people have fled political violence and economic turmoil in Venezuela in one of the biggest displacements worldwide. 'My only hope was TPS,' Hidalgo said. 'My worry, for example, is that after everything I suffered with my son so that I could make it to this country, that they send me back again.' Venezuelans along with Haitians and Salvadorans are the largest group of TPS beneficiaries and have the most at stake. Haiti's international airport shut down this week after gangs opened fire at a commercial flight landing in Port-Au-Prince while a new interim prime minister was sworn in. The Federal Aviation Administration barred U.S. airlines from landing there for 30 days. 'It's creating a lot of anxiety,' said Vania André, editor-in-chief for The Haitian Times, an online newspaper covering the Haitian diaspora. 'Sending thousands of people back to Haiti is not an option. The country is not equipped to handle the widespread gang violence already and cannot absorb all those people.' Designations by the Homeland Security secretary offer relief for up to 18 months but are extended in many cases. The designation for El Salvador ends in March. Designations for Sudan, Ukraine, and Venezuela end in April. Others expire later. Federal regulations say a designation can be terminated before it expires, but that has never happened, and it requires 60 days' notice. TPS is similar to the lesser-known Deferred Enforcement Departure Program that Trump used to reward Venezuelan exile supporters as his first presidency was ending, shielding 145,000 from deportation for 18 months. Attorney Ahilan T. Arulanantham, who successfully challenged Trump's earlier efforts to allow TPS designations for several countries to expire, doesn't doubt the president-elect will try again. 'It's possible that some people in his administration will recognize that stripping employment authorization for more than a million people, many of whom have lived in this country for decades, is not good policy' and economically disastrous, said Arulanantham, who teaches at the University of California, Los Angeles School of Law, and helps direct its Center for Immigration Law and Policy. 'But nothing in Trump’s history suggests that they would care about such considerations.' Courts blocked designations from expiring for Haiti, Sudan, Nicaragua and El Salvador until well into President Joe Biden's term. Homeland Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas then renewed them. Arulanantham said he 'absolutely' could see another legal challenge, depending on what the Trump administration does. Congress established TPS in 1990, when civil war was raging in El Salvador. Members were alarmed to learn some Salvadorans were tortured and executed after being deported from the U.S. Other designations protected people during wars in Bosnia-Herzegovina and Kuwait, from genocidal violence in Rwanda, and after volcanic eruptions in Montserrat, a British territory in the Caribbean, in 1995 and 1997. A designation is not a pathway to U.S. permanent residence or citizenship, but applicants can try to change their status through other immigration processes. Advocates are pressing the White House for a new TPS designation for Nicaraguans before Biden leaves office. Less than 3,000 are still covered by the temporary protections issued in 1998 after Hurricane Mitch battered the country. People who fled much later under oppression from President Daniel Ortega’s government don’t enjoy the same protection from deportation. 'It's a moral obligation' for the Biden administration, said Maria Bilbao, of the American Friends Service Committee. Elena, a 46-year-old Nicaraguan who has lived in the United States illegally for 25 years, hopes Biden moves quickly. 'He should do it now,' said Elena, who lives Florida and insisted only her first name be used because she fears deportation. 'Not in January. Not in December. Now.' __ Snow reported from Phoenix.

Thousands of police officers but few visiting fans for France-Israel soccer match after attacks	PARIS (AP) — There will be a heavy police presence but few visiting fans at Thursday’s soccer match between France and Israel in the Nations League, with authorities in Paris on high alert amid an increasingly tense political climate. French police chief Laurent Nuñez said 4,000 police officers and security staff will be deployed around the Stade de France stadium, with another 1,500 police on public transport. The extreme measures come one week after violence against Israeli fans around a Europa League soccer game in Amsterdam in attacks widely condemned across Europe as antisemitic. Three months after hosting an Olympic closing ceremony, the atmosphere has gone from festive to fearful and the national stadium was expected to be three-quarters empty for the match. French President Emmanuel Macron and French Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau will be present. Only 20,000 of 80,000 tickets have been sold with around 150 Israel supporters reportedly attending, escorted by police. 'We’ve tried to prepare for this match as normally as possible. But obviously none of us within the team can be insensitive to such a heavy context,' France coach Didier Deschamps said Wednesday. 'It impacts the amount of supporters present tomorrow and everything that goes with it.' The away match against Israel on Oct. 10 — which France won 4-1 — was played in Budapest, Hungary. 'These are situations the players are not accustomed to,' Deschamps said. 'But we have to adapt.' The low number of visiting fans comes after Israel’s National Security Council warned citizens abroad to avoid sports and cultural events, specifically the match in Paris. Retailleau told French news channel TF1 on Tuesday that no specific threats were identified but 'zero risk does not exist.' Therefore, he said, exceptional measures are in place 'before the match, during the match and after the match.' The elite tactical unit of the French National Police, known as RAID, will be in the stadium and some police will be in plain clothes mingling with fans. There will also be heavy surveillance within Paris, including at Jewish places of worship. 'It is out of the question that we take the risk of seeing a repeat of the dramatic events, of the manhunt, that we saw in Amsterdam,' Retailleau said, adding that postponing or moving the game elsewhere was ruled out. 'France does not retreat,' he said. 'France does not submit, and the France-Israel match will take place where it's supposed to.' Last Thursday night, Amsterdam witnessed scenes of chaos when Israeli fans were attacked by hordes of young people apparently riled up by calls on social media to target Jewish people, according to Dutch authorities. Before the game, a large group of supporters of the Israeli team could be seen on video chanting anti-Arab slogans as they headed to the stadium, escorted by police. Protests erupted in Paris on Wednesday night against a controversial gala organized by far-right figures in support of Israel. The game in Saint-Denis, the suburb north of Paris where the stadium is located, is scheduled to kick off at 8:45 p.m. local time (1945 GMT) on Thursday. Nine years ago, Stade de France was one of several locations during the Nov. 13 terror attacks in which 130 people died. France was playing Germany that night when two explosions happened outside the stadium. Deschamps, Germany coach Joachim Löw and all the players stayed together in the locker rooms for hours until it was safe to leave. 'It's a sad date for us given what happened in 2015,' Deschamps said. ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer	https://apnews.com/article/france-israel-security-fans-nations-league-d8104e6838a460741361297b23af539c	2024-11-13T20:03:18-08:00	
China's president unveils a megaport in Peru, but locals say they're being left out	CHANCAY, Peru (AP) — On the edge of Peru’s coastal desert, a remote fishing town where a third of all residents have no running water is being transformed into a huge deep-water port to cash in on the inexorable rise of Chinese interest in resource-rich South America. The megaport of Chancay, a $1.3 billion project majority-owned by the Chinese shipping giant Cosco, is turning this outpost of bobbing fishing boats into an important node of the global economy. From the presidential palace in Lima, 60 kilometers (37 miles) south of the port inauguration ceremony, China’s President Xi Jinping watched a livestream of the ribbon-cutting alongside his Peruvian counterpart, Dina Boluarte, late Thursday. The leaders' faces appeared on a giant screen in Chancay, where engineers in bright orange safety vests declared the port operational to the swell of string instruments. Chinese dancers with red dragon-costume heads seemingly burst out of nowhere to prance around the docking station as a crane lowered the first aluminum containers onto a berthed cargo ship. 'Considerable income and enormous job opportunities will be generated for Peru,' Xi said from Lima, where world leaders were preparing to gather for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum. 'This will generate tangible results for the people of the region.' But the development — expected to encompass 15 quays and a large industrial park drawing more than $3.5 billion in investment over a decade — has met a skeptical response from impoverished villagers, who say it is depriving them of fishing waters and bringing no economic benefit to locals. 'Our fishing spots no longer exist here. They destroyed them,' said 78-year-old fisherman Julius Caesar — 'like the emperor of Rome' — gesturing toward the dockside cranes. 'I don't blame the Chinese for trying to mine this place for all it's worth. I blame our government for not protecting us.' The Peruvian government hopes the port will become a strategic transshipment hub for the region, opening a new line connecting South America to Asia and speeding trade across the Pacific for Peru's blueberries, Brazil's soybeans and Chile's copper, among other exports. Officials cite the port's potential to generate millions of dollars in revenues and turn coastal cities into so-called special economic zones with tax breaks to lure investment. 'We Peruvians are focused primarily on the well-being of Peruvians,' Foreign Minister Elmer Schialer told The Associated Press. But many of Chancay's 60,000 residents are unconvinced. Fishermen returning to port with smaller catches complain that they have already lost out. The dredging of the port — which sucked sediment from the seabed to create a shipping channel 17 meters (56 feet) deep — has ruined fish breeding grounds, locals said. 'I’ve been out in the water all day and I’m always needing to venture farther,' said Rafael Ávila, a 28-year-old fisherman with sand in his hair, returning to shore empty-handed and exhausted. 'This used to be enough,' he said, pointing at his painted dinghy. 'Now I need a larger, more expensive boat to reach the fish.' To make extra cash, Ávila started offering occasional joyrides to selfie-taking visitors wanting to get a glimpse at the hulking Chinese ships. With some of the world's largest container ships to berth at Chancay Port in January 2025, residents also fear the arrival of pollution and oil spills. In 2022, a botched tanker delivery at La Pampilla refinery nearby sent thousands of barrels of crude oil spilling into Peru's famously biodiverse waters, killing countless fish and putting legions of fishermen out of work. Today a glance at the moribund town center, featuring mostly empty seafood restaurants, tells the story of diminished fishing stocks and decimated tourism even without the port being operational. The port's breakwater changed the currents and destroyed good surfing conditions, locals said, affecting everyone from ice vendors to truckers to restaurant owners. 'No to the megaport' is spray-painted on a wall overlooking the waterfront. 'This port is a monster that's come here to screw us,' said 40-year-old Rosa Collantes, cleaning and gutting slimy drum fish on the shore. 'People come to the port and they say ‘Wow, tremendous!' but they don't see the reality.' Port authorities say they're aware of the stark contrast between the sleek modern port and the surrounding village of Chancay, where many live on unpaved roads lined with ragged shacks and littered with trash. 'You cannot build a state-of-the-art port and have a city next to it that has no drinking water, no sewage, a collapsing hospital and no educational centers,' said Mario de las Casas, a manager for Cosco in Chancay, adding that the company had already launched studies to determine how the port could help reduce inequality and spur local growth. 'The port should not be a blemish,' De las Casas said.	https://apnews.com/article/china-peru-port-poverty-latin-america-1e06904f76cca1d7aaf19bca8bd24d93	2024-11-13T20:02:57-08:00	
An overwhelmed Philippines braces for another typhoon, the fifth major storm to hit in three weeks	MANILA, Philippines (AP) — The fifth major storm in three weeks approached the Philippines on Thursday, prompting more largescale evacuations and a United Nations request for emergency funds to help the government ease the plight of hard-hit villagers. Typhoon Usagi had sustained winds of up to 185 kilometers (115 miles) per hour and gusts of up to 230 kph (143 mph) and was forecast to strengthen further before slamming Thursday afternoon into the coast of Cagayan province at the northern tip of Luzon, the country’s most populous agricultural region. Another storm was brewing in the Pacific and may hit the northern Philippines this weekend, according to forecasters. The country's weather agency warned of life-threatening tidal surges of up to three meters (nearly 10 feet) in coastal areas of Cagayan and seven other nearby provinces and clusters of islands, and urged all ships to remain in port or immediately take shelter. Typhoon Toraji blew away from the northern Philippines just two days ago after unleashing floods, knocking down power lines and forcing more than 42,000 people to evacuate their homes. The government has struggled to deal with the impact of the last four major storms, which left at least 160 people dead, displaced millions and devastated farmland and infrastructure, mostly in the northern Luzon region. President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.’s administration has spent more than 1 billion pesos ($17 million) for food and other aid for hundreds of thousands of storm victims, Welfare Assistant Secretary Irene Dumlao said. Defense Secretary Gilberto Teodoro, who oversees disaster-response efforts, sought the help of neighboring countries, including Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia and Brunei, in providing additional aircraft to transport food, water and other aid to villages isolated by the storms. The United States, Manila’s longtime treaty ally, deployed cargo aircraft with food and other assistance. The U.N. Humanitarian Country Team in the Philippines said it was raising $32.9 million to help the government provide assistance to about 210,000 people in critical need of aid and protection, especially women, children and people with disabilities, in the next three months. 'The Philippines is facing an exceptionally challenging tropical cyclone season, with successive cyclones reaching unprecedented locations and scales,' the U.N. team in said in its emergency plan. 'Local authorities, who are often impacted themselves, are overwhelmed as they simultaneously respond to the crisis and coordinate rescue efforts for affected families.' The Philippines is battered by about 20 typhoons and tropical storms each year. It is often hit by earthquakes and has more than a dozen active volcanoes, making it one of the world’s most disaster-prone countries. In 2013, Typhoon Haiyan, one of the strongest recorded tropical cyclones, left more than 7,300 people dead or missing, flattened entire villages and caused ships to run aground and smash into houses in the central Philippines.	https://apnews.com/article/philippines-typhoon-usagi-united-nations-4690fe8d399105fe63f3071c4912d1c2	2024-11-13T20:02:24-08:00	
Stock market today: Wall Street drifts near its records as Disney soars	NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks are drifting Thursday as the market’s big burst following Donald Trump’s election continues to cool. The S&amp;P 500 was virtually unchanged in early trading and still near its all-time high set on Monday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 41 points, or 0.1%, as of 9:50 a.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite was 0.2% lower. The Walt Disney Co. helped lead the market with a jump of 10.6% after the entertainment giant reported stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. Disney CEO Robert Iger credited improved profits at its streaming businesses and strong box-office results for its movies, including 'Inside Out 2' and 'Deadpool &amp; Wolverine,' among other things. ASML, a major supplier to the global chip industry, also gave some encouraging signals for technology stocks. The Dutch company said it expects global semiconductor sales to top $1 trillion by 2030, with the help of demand related to artificial-intelligence technology, and it stood by its long-term financial forecasts. ASML shares that trade in the United States rose 4.9%. But a 1.3% drop for Cisco Systems was helping to keep indexes in check, even though the tech giant reported stronger profit than analysts expected for the latest quarter. Investors may have been looking for it to raise its financial forecasts more, analysts suggested. Super Micro Computer, which has been one of the biggest winners of the AI boom, fell 13.4% for the worst loss in the S&amp;P 500. It said on Wednesday that it doesn’t expect to file its quarterly financial statements with U.S. regulators on time. The server maker's stock has been struggling recently, particularly after Ernst &amp; Young resigned as its public accounting firm. A special committee of the company's board has since said that it’s found 'no evidence of fraud or misconduct on the part of management or the Board of Directors.' Tapestry shares jumped 11.4% after the luxury fashion company said it’s terminating its merger with Capri, another luxury brand owner. The companies agreed to a $8.5 billion deal in August 2023 to unite the makers of Coach and Michael Kors handbags, but the tie-up has faced numerous challenges, including a lawsuit from the Federal Trade Commission to block the deal on antitrust grounds. Capri shares fell 3.2%. Stocks were also feeling the effects of swinging yields in the bond market following the latest update on inflation. Prices paid at the U.S. wholesale level were 2.4% higher in October from a year earlier. That was an acceleration from September’s 1.9% inflation rate and a worse jump than economists expected. A separate report, meanwhile, suggested the U.S. job market remains solid. Fewer U.S. workers applied for unemployment benefits last week in the latest signal that layoffs aren’t taking off. Treasury yields initially jumped following the reports, as traders trimmed their expectations a bit for a coming cut to interest rates by the Federal Reserve at its meeting next month. But yields later regressed, and the yield on the 10-year Treasury eased to 4.42% from 4.45% late Wednesday. The Fed began cutting rates from their two-decade high in September to offer support for the job market, hoping to keep it humming after bringing inflation nearly all the way down to its target of 2%. Prior forecasts published by the Fed implied it could keep cutting rates through next year. But Trump’s victory may have scrambled such plans. Economists say his preferences for lower tax rates, higher tariffs and less regulation could ultimately lead to higher U.S. government debt and inflation, along with faster economic growth. While lower interest rates can give a boost to the economy and to prices for investments, they can also give inflation more fuel. And expectations for lower interest rates had been a major reason for the S&amp;P 500’s big jump of more than 20% for the year so far, as well as for hopes that the U.S. economy can keep growing and avoid a long-predicted recession. In stock markets abroad, European indexes were higher, including a 1.4% jump for Germany’s DAX. Asian markets were mixed, meanwhile. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng dropped 2%, but South Korea’s Kospi added 0.1%. In the crypto market, bitcoin was up roughly 1% at $90,916 after crossing above $93,000 as cryptocurrencies generally soared. Trump has embraced cryptocurrencies, pledging to make the U.S. the crypto capital of the world. ___ AP Business Writers Matt Ott and Elaine Kurtenbach contributed.	https://apnews.com/article/stocks-markets-rates-inflation-dollar-6a96ed4aef82bac9c23efd5d05d07a9b	2024-11-13T19:50:38-08:00	
India's Modi likely to find comfort in Trump's return and a shared worldview	NEW DELHI (AP) — Donald Trump’s return to the White House has made many countries anxious and recalculating where they stand with the U.S., but India appears to be welcoming the change that may embolden nationalist leaders like Prime Minister Narendra Modi. 'I know today a lot of countries are nervous about the U.S., let’s be honest about that,' India’s External Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar said over the weekend. India was 'not one of them.' A call from Modi 'was among the first three calls, I think, that President (elect) Trump took,' he added. A second Trump presidency is likely to play out in New Delhi’s favor, experts say, especially as Modi seeks to reset India’s relationship with the West after recent frictions over his refusal to join sanctions against Russia or condemn its 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Modi has also been criticized over India's democratic backsliding. 'Trump’s victory means that the Indian policies that have put New Delhi at odds with the West … will no longer be a cause of concern for Washington,' said Michael Kugelman, South Asia director at the Wilson Center. There could be ruptures on trade, immigration and climate change goals — but on balance, 'the return of Trump means that India’s relations with the West – and specifically its most powerful country — will get a boost,' he added. Modi has sought to cast India as a rising global player with a fast-growing economy that can counter China. But critics say his authoritarian politics and right-wing Bharatiya Janata Party have deeply polarized the country with minorities increasingly marginalized and the right to free speech and press under attack. When President Joe Biden honored Modi with a state visit last year, he walked a tightrope as activists and groups pressured him to confront Modi over his human rights record. Still, the two leaders rolled out new business deals on defense and technology. Such concerns won't be an issue with Trump, said Uday Chandra, an expert on South Asia and foreign policy. 'He is a refreshing reset from the Indian perspective … he is much more transactional.' Trump, long an open admirer of Russian President Vladimir Putin, is also likely to be more understanding of India’s strategic partnership with Moscow, which dates back to the Cold War, its record purchases of Russian crude, and its refusal to pick a side in the war in Ukraine. 'This was the real sort of thorn in India-U.S. relations over the past two years … but with Trump, I don’t see this being an issue,' Chandra said. One hot-button issue is trade. In his first term, trade differences between the two countries came to the fore with Trump calling India the 'tariff king' over disagreements on farm goods, Harley Davidson motorcycles and medical devices. In 2019, he canceled the country's special trade privileges and India responded by slapping tariffs on more than two dozen U.S. goods. This time, Trump wants to impose a 'universal' tax of 10% or 20% on all imports and raise tariffs on Chinese goods to 60%. India, which counts the U.S. as its second-largest trading partner, won't be an exception. 'New Delhi will have to do more than just tinkering with its policies to deal with Trump’s emphasis on fair trade,' said C Rajamohan, a professor at the Institute of South Asian Studies in Singapore. Immigration could turn into a sore point if Trump attempts to also curb skilled migration. Indians have often been the largest group applying for the H1-B work visa but Trump had called the visa program 'very bad' and 'unfair' for U.S. workers. Progress on climate change and clean energy could also be hit. 'India and the U.S. have done quite a lot on this front over the past four years — but this is something that could unravel because a Trump administration is more aligned with the fossil fuel industry than with green technology,' said Milan Vaishnav, South Asia Program director at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. Both Trump and Modi embody strongmen tactics, count on an impassioned support base and have ramped up polarization to consolidate votes. And unlike liberal leaders in the West, Trump doesn’t view Modi’s policies at home problematic – or even relevant, said Kugelman. 'They’re both ardent nationalists committed to making their nations stronger at home and abroad,' he added. Analysts also point to the personal bond between the two. When Trump visited India in 2020, Modi threw him an event in the world's largest cricket stadium. The year before that, Trump held a massive rally for Modi in Texas and likened him to Elvis Presley for his crowd-pulling power. In his congratulatory post to Trump on X last week, Modi shared photos of the two leaders hugging, smiling and holding hands. 'There’s a bromance between the two,' said Chandra. 'But they're also united by a shared worldview — that we are in a post- liberal world and that liberalism as an ideology for conducting global politics is no longer viable. That’s as true in India as it is in America.'	https://apnews.com/article/india-us-election-2024-trump-modi-a291df0d68d76d88da353e1e12ad1934	2024-11-13T17:14:46-08:00	
Sri Lanka votes in a parliamentary election that's key for its new Marxist-leaning president	COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) — Sri Lankans are voting in a parliamentary election Thursday that is key for the country's new, Marxist-leaning president to consolidate his party's power and follow through on promises of economic recovery. President Anura Kumara Dissanayake won the presidential election on Sept. 21 in a victory that marked a rejection of the traditional political parties, which have governed the island nation since its independence from British rule in 1948. However, Dissanayake’s failure to secure more than 50% of the vote has fueled concerns over his party’s outlook in Thursday's election. His National People’s Power party must increase its votes significantly — from the 42% it won in the presidential election — if it is to acquire a minimum of 113 seats to take control of the 225-member Parliament. The biggest challenge for the NPP — which was founded in 2019 and is a relative newcomer on Sri Lanka’s political scene — is that many of its candidates are new faces in politics running against well-established politicians from the traditional parties. Of the 225 parliament seats, 196 are up for grabs under Sri Lanka's proportional representative electoral system, which allocates seats in each district among the parties according to the proportion of the votes they get. The remaining 29 seats — called the national list seats — are allocated to parties and independent groups according to the proportion of the total votes they receive countrywide. There are 8,821 candidates vying for the 196 seats for elected members of Parliament. Sajith Premadasa, who came in second in the presidential election and his Samagi Jana Balawegaya, or United People's Power party, is NPP's main competition. Dissanayake, while campaigning for his party’s candidates, has called on voters to help elect them to Parliament so he won’t need to rely on a coalition to enact the reforms he promised. Election results are expected on Friday. The election comes at a decisive time for Sri Lankans, as the island nation is struggling to emerge from its worst economic crisis, having declared bankruptcy after defaulting on its external debt in 2022. The country is now in the middle of a bailout program with the International Monetary Fund and debt restructuring with international creditors nearly complete. Dissanayake had said during the presidential campaign that he planned to propose significant changes to the targets set in the IMF deal, which his predecessor Ranil Wickremesinghe signed, saying it placed too much burden on the people. However, he has since changed his stance and says Sri Lanka will go along with the agreement. Sri Lanka’s crisis was largely the result of economic mismanagement combined with fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic, which along with 2019 terrorism attacks devastated its important tourism industry. The pandemic also disrupted the flow of remittances from Sri Lankans working abroad. The government also slashed taxes in 2019, depleting the treasury just as the virus hit. Foreign exchange reserves plummeted, leaving Sri Lanka unable to pay for imports or defend its currency, the rupee. Sri Lanka’s economic upheaval led to a political crisis that forced then-President Gotabaya Rajapaksa to resign in 2022. Parliament then elected Wickremesinghe to replace him. The economy was stabilized, inflation dropped, the local currency strengthened and foreign reserves increased under Wickremesinghe. Nonetheless, he lost the election as public dissatisfaction grew over the government’s effort to increase revenue by raising electricity bills and imposing heavy new income taxes on professionals and businesses, as part of the government’s efforts to meet the IMF conditions. Dissanayake’s promise to punish members of previous governments accused of corruption and to recover allegedly stolen assets has also raised much hope among the people.	https://apnews.com/article/sri-lanka-parliamentary-election-dissanayake-fde212f89fb237f2a623b792ec958a22	2024-11-13T16:33:05-08:00	
Nevada trial set for ‘Dances with Wolves’ actor in newly-revived sex abuse case	LAS VEGAS (AP) — Former 'Dances with Wolves' actor Nathan Chasing Horse is set to stand trial early next year in Las Vegas on charges that he sexually abused Indigenous women and girls, a significant development in the sweeping criminal case after more than a year of stalled court proceedings while he challenged it. His trial in Clark County District Court is currently scheduled to begin on Jan. 13, court records show. He pleaded not guilty on Wednesday to 21 felonies, including sexual assault, kidnapping and producing and possessing videos of child sexual abuse, KLAS-TV in Las Vegas reported. Prosecutors are now able to move forward with their case because Chasing Horse was again indicted last month following a Nevada Supreme Court decision that his original indictment be dismissed. The high court's order left open the possibility for the charges to be refiled, and prosecutors quickly took their case before another grand jury. The high court said in its September order that prosecutors had abused the grand jury process when they provided a definition of grooming as evidence of Chasing Horse's alleged crimes without any expert testimony. But the justices also made clear in their ruling that their decision was not weighing in on Chasing Horse's guilt or innocence, saying the allegations against him are serious. Best known for portraying the character Smiles A Lot in the 1990 movie 'Dances with Wolves,' Chasing Horse was born on the Rosebud Reservation in South Dakota, which is home to the Sicangu Sioux, one of the seven tribes of the Lakota nation. After starring in the Oscar-winning film, according to prosecutors, Chasing Horse began promoting himself as a self-proclaimed Lakota medicine man while traveling around North America to perform healing ceremonies. Prosecutors said he used his authority to gain access to vulnerable women and girls for decades until his arrest in January near Las Vegas. He has been jailed ever since. Chasing Horse's arrest reverberated around Indian Country as law enforcement in the U.S. and Canada quickly followed up with more criminal charges. In Montana, authorities there said his arrest helped corroborate long-standing allegations against him on the Fort Peck Indian Reservation. Tribal leaders banished Chasing Horse from the reservation in 2015 amid allegations of human trafficking. His latest indictment in Las Vegas includes new allegations that Chasing Horse filmed himself having sex with one of his accusers when she was younger than 14. Prosecutors have said the footage, taken in 2010 or 2011, was found on cellphones in a locked safe inside the North Las Vegas home that Chasing Horse is said to have shared with five wives, including the girl in the videos.	https://apnews.com/article/chasing-horse-dances-with-wolves-trial-nevada-de876354ce245a878c851f9e365c6d32	2024-11-13T16:27:44-08:00	
US ambassador says Mexico 'closed the doors' on security cooperation and denies its violence problem	MEXICO CITY (AP) — U.S. Ambassador Ken Salazar lashed out Wednesday at Mexico’s failure to accept aid in the fight against drug cartels, claiming the country 'closed the doors' on security cooperation. In a press conference, Salazar launched his harshest criticism yet of rampant violence, police corruption and the Mexican government’s mistaken attitude that 'there is no problem.' 'When they just say ‘there is no problem, we have these statistics to show people there is no problem,’ that is not based on reality,'' Salazar said. 'There is a very big problem.' Mexico sent a diplomatic note to the U.S. embassy 'expressing its surprise' at Salazar's statement, the foreign relations ministry said in a statement later Wednesday. Salazar cited violence in recent days in the northern state of Sinaloa as an example. Sinaloa state police chief Gerardo Mérida said Wednesday authorities found a pile of between five and seven bodies on a roadside there, but were still counting body parts to see how many there were. 'There is a pile of various bodies, with what we have found we have identified five bodies, but some are in pieces, they have been dismembered, there are mentions of seven,' said Mérida. Sinaloa's embattled governor, Ruben Rocha, seemed to typify Mexico's attitude when he said Tuesday —after a similar number of dead bodies were dumped on roadsides - that 'we're doing well, we'll get over this soon.' Salazar countered that in Sinaloa 'the dead can be seen everywhere.' Salazar had previously defended many of the Mexican government’s actions, but he now says former President Andrés Manuel López Obrador’s 'hugs not bullets' strategy of not confronting the cartels 'did not work.' López Obrador left office on Sept. 30, but his successor, President Claudia Sheinbaum, has pledged to continue the policy, even though under her leadership troops appear more willing to open fire. Fighting between two factions of the Sinaloa drug cartel broke out after two drug capos — one from each faction — flew to the United States and were arrested there on July 25. Drug lords Ismael 'El Mayo' Zambada and Joaquín Guzmán López were apprehended in the United States after flying there in a small plane. Zambada later claimed he was kidnapped and forced aboard the plane by Guzmán López, causing a violent battle between Zambada’s faction and the 'Chapitos' group led by the sons of imprisoned drug lord Joaquin 'El Chapo' Guzmán. Mexico later blamed the United States for detaining the capos, saying that had caused the outbreak of violence. Salazar said Mexico also shut down anti-drug cooperation after that. 'It totally accelerated from there, the Mexican government closed its doors,' Salazar said. The ambassador also criticized efforts by both López Obrador and Sheinbaum to downplay the problem of crime and violence, claiming the problem was being exaggerated and crime statistics were dropping. Salazar did not clarify why he thought the Mexican government's numbers were untrustworthy, but in recent days the government appears to have changed the way it reports homicide figures. 'The reality for the Mexican people, and that is for businesspeople, members of the press like you who work on the streets, those who have ranches, like the cattleman killed in Sinaloa over the weekend because he was a leader, they don't live with security,' Salazar said. The continuing violence 'is a very serious problem in Mexico and saying there is no problem, blaming someone else, blaming the United States, obviously is not (the solution)', he continued. He also blamed López Obrador for having refused '$32 million,' an apparent reference to López Obrador's decision to drop out of a U.S.-funded program to donate money to train and equip Mexican police. 'It was rejected for ideological problems, and other explanations,' Salazar said. López Obrador said at the time he didn't want U.S. helicopters and guns, but by that point most of the U.S. money was going for training, professionalization and legal reform. After taking office in 2018, López Obrador also cut funding for police forces and gave the army, navy and militarized National Guard the lead role in law enforcement. 'Police become corrupt because they don't earn enough to live on,' Salazar said. 'You cannot pay a police officer almost nothing and expect them to do their job.' Salazar had been previously known for defending López Obrador despite his constant efforts to militarize law enforcement, concentrate power, eliminate regulatory and oversight bodies and shore up Mexico's government-run companies even at the expense of U.S. firms. It was unclear if Wednesday's critical turn in his rhetoric was in any way related to the victory of Donald Trump in last week's U.S. presidential elections. Trump has long been fiercely critical of Mexico. ____ Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america	https://apnews.com/article/mexico-sinaloa-cartel-violence-bodies-02e0c9a499e9605291f3ba5a2f9e6f4d	2024-11-13T14:53:25-08:00	
Man kills himself with blasts outside Brazil's Supreme Court after failing to get inside	SAO PAULO (AP) — A man who failed in an attempt to break into Brazil's Supreme Court killed himself in explosions outside the building Wednesday that forced justices and staff to evacuate, authorities said. The two strong blasts were heard about 7:30 p.m. after the day's session finished and all the justices and staff left the building safely, Brazil's Supreme Court said in a statement. Local firefighters confirmed one man died at the scene in the capital Brasilia, but did not identify him. Celina Leão, the lieutenant governor of Brazil's federal district, said the suspect had earlier detonated explosives in a car in a Congress parking lot, which did not cause injuries. 'His first action was to explode the car. Then he approached the Supreme Court and tried to get in the building. He failed and then there were the other explosions,' Leão said in a news conference. Local media reported that the car that exploded belonged to a member of Brazil's Liberal Party, the same of former President Jair Bolsonaro. Leão said only investigations will determine whether the owner of the car is the same man who died in the blasts. Leão recommended that Congress be closed Thursday to avoid new risks. Brazil's Senate heeded her call and the lower house will be shut until noon, speaker Arthur Lira said. 'It could have been a lone wolf, like others we've seen around the world,' Leão said in a news conference. 'We are considering it as a suicide because there was only one victim. But investigations will show if that was indeed the case.' Leão added only forensics will be able to identify the body, which remained outside the Supreme Court for three hours after the blasts. The blasts outside the Supreme Court took place about 20 seconds apart in Brasilia's Three Powers Plaza, where Brazil’s main government buildings, including the Supreme Court, Congress and presidential palace, are located. President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva was not in the neighboring presidential palace at the time, spokesman José Chrispiniano said. Police blocked all access to the area and the presidential security bureau was conducting a sweep of the grounds around the presidential palace. Brazil’s federal police said it is investigating and did not provide a motive. The Supreme Court in recent years has become a target for threats by far-right groups and supporters of Bolsonaro's due to its crackdown on the spread of false information. In particular, Justice Alexandre de Moraes has been a focus for their ire. Lula's spokesman said that late on Wednesday the leftist leader was gathering at the presidential residence with federal police chief Andrei Rodrigues, and Supreme Court Justices de Moraes and Cristiano Zanin.	https://apnews.com/article/brazil-supreme-court-explosion-police-350cf148ecf964818eba203f7e131f88	2024-11-13T14:46:18-08:00	
Protests erupt in Paris over pro-Israel gala organized by far-right figures	PARIS (AP) — Protests erupted in Paris on Wednesday against a controversial gala organized by far-right figures in support of Israel. The event, intended to raise funds for the Israeli military, included Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich among its invited guests. The demonstrations came on the eve of a high-stakes soccer match at France's national stadium against the Israeli national team, overshadowed by tensions around the wars in the Middle East. Authorities in Paris announced that more than 4,000 police officers and 1,600 stadium staff will be deployed for the game. Smotrich, a vocal advocate of Israeli settlements, had been expected to attend Wednesday's gala, dubbed 'Israel is Forever,' which was planned by an association of the same name. The group’s stated goal is to 'mobilize French-speaking Zionist forces.' After days of growing criticism of the event, Smotrich's office confirmed Wednesday that the minister would not travel to Paris to participate. But the invitation to Smotrich drew sharp criticism from local associations, unions and left-wing political parties, prompting two protests in the French capital. The minister, a hard-line settler leader, has been accused of inflaming tensions in the West Bank and drew international condemnations this week by saying he hopes the election of Donald Trump will clear the way for Israeli annexation of the West Bank — a step that would extinguish Palestinian statehood dreams. The French Foreign Ministry called Smotrich’s remarks 'contrary to international law' and counterproductive to efforts to reduce regional tensions. 'France reiterates its commitment to the implementation of the two-state solution, with Israel and Palestine living side by side in peace and security, which is the only prospect for a just and lasting settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict,' the ministry said in a statement. Critics also pointed at Nili Kupfer-Naouri, president of the 'Israel is Forever' association, who sparked outrage in 2023, after the Israel-Hamas war started, when she tweeted that 'no civilian in Gaza was innocent.' On Wednesday night, several hundred protesters marched through central Paris, denouncing the event as a 'gala of hatred and shame.' 'Imagine if an association were hosting a gala for Hezbollah or Hamas — there’s no way the police would allow that,' said Melkir Saib, a 30-year-old protester. 'The situation is just unfair.' The march was largely peaceful, but some demonstrators broke windows at a McDonald's along the route. A separate group, including Jewish leftist organizations opposed to racism and antisemitism, gathered near the Arc de Triomphe chanting slogans against the gala and Smotrich. French authorities defended the event, with Paris police chief Laurent Nunez stating that the gala posed 'no major threat to public order.' The protests came days after tensions flared in Paris and Amsterdam related to the conflicts in the Mideast. A massive 'Free Palestine' banner was displayed during a Paris Saint-Germain Champions League match against Atletico Madrid, while violence broke out in Amsterdam last week targeting fans of an Israeli soccer club.	https://apnews.com/article/france-israel-gala-protests-c7d2fef2ad4aedea2fdd3d844e48fd6d	2024-11-13T13:43:56-08:00	
New storms and flooding threaten Spain's hard-hit Valencia again	MADRID (AP) — New storms in Spain caused school closures and train cancellations on Wednesday, two weeks after flash floods in Valencia and other parts of the country killed more than 220 people and destroyed thousands of homes. Coastal areas of Valencia were placed under the highest alert on Wednesday evening. Forecasters said up to 180 millimeters (7 inches) of rain could fall there within five hours. Cleanup efforts in parts of Valencia hardest hit by the Oct. 29 storm were still continuing, and there were concerns over what more rain could bring to streets still covered with mud and debris. In southern Malaga province, streets were flooded, while 3,000 people near the Guadalhorce river were moved from their homes as a preventive measure. Schools across the province were closed, along with many stores. Train service was canceled between Malaga and Madrid, and between Barcelona and Valencia. Valencia's regional government also restricted the use of private vehicles until Thursday in areas hit by the October storm, when tsunami-like floods caused severe car pile-ups. There were no reports of deaths due to the new storms. Spanish weather forecaster AEMET put Malaga on red alert, saying up to 70 millimeters (roughly 3 inches) of rain had accumulated in an hour. Parts of Tarragona province in the east also faced heavy rain and remained under red alert. The forecast in Malaga delayed the start of the Billie Jean King Cup tennis finals between Spain and Poland, which was set for Wednesday. The storm system affecting Spain is caused by warm air that collides with stagnant cold air and forms powerful rain clouds. Experts say that drought and flood cycles are increasing with climate change.	https://apnews.com/article/spain-floods-malaga-79ec155360f14a0b89a788e8cb6787b4	2024-11-13T08:15:40-08:00	
Argentina tribunal upholds corruption verdict against former President Cristina Fernández	BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) — A tribunal in Argentina on Wednesday upheld a six-year prison sentence and a lifetime ban from holding public office against former President Cristina Fernández, a dominant political leader in recent years in the South American country. Fernández was convicted and sentenced in 2022 by a three-judge panel for a fraud scheme that embezzled millions of dollars through public works projects during her presidency. She appealed, but the higher tribunal ratified the original ruling. Fernández has denied all the accusations. The Peronist leader can appeal to the Supreme Court, which means that she will remain free pending the outcome. Argentina’s dominant leader this century, she was accused of improperly granting public works contracts to a construction magnate with links to her family.	https://apnews.com/article/argentina-cristina-fernandez-corruption-sentence-dc8b668e3da263c18a9e84e0be8e71e0	2024-11-13T06:06:37-08:00	
Danish palace scraps system dating to the 1800s that grants royal labels for products	COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) — Denmark’s royal court said Wednesday it will phase out a labeling system dating back to the 1800s that grants companies the right to use the image of the Danish crown on their letterhead, packaging and labels. The five-year renewable designations, including 'Holder of the Royal Warrant' and 'By Appointment to the Royal Danish Court' and others, will be phased out by Dec. 31, 2029, the palace said in a statement. Currently, there there are 104 Danish suppliers and five foreign companies who can use such designations and images of the Danish crown on their products. 'A system which implies that individual companies can claim special recognition from the Royal House of Denmark for a number of years is no longer in keeping with the times,' the palace said in a statement. The first company to get such a title was in 1840. Originally, such designations were given to companies or tradesmen who continually supplied goods or services to the royals. In recent years, however, several of the companies which supply goods or services to the royal household are not on the list of Royal Warrant holders. King Frederik took over Denmark's throne last January after his mother, Queen Margrethe II, then Europe’s longest-serving monarch, became the first Danish monarch to voluntarily relinquish the throne in nearly 900 years. Margrethe had stunned the nation when she announced during her traditional New Year’s Eve speech that she would step down for health reasons. The abdication has left Denmark with two queens: Margrethe keeps her title, while Frederik’s wife becomes Queen Mary. Frederik and Mary’s eldest son Christian, 18, is now the crown prince and heir to the throne.	https://apnews.com/article/denmark-royal-danist-court-purveyor-e7bae9c904ed405cc61880b2684ea1dc	2024-11-13T05:41:11-08:00	
The Latest: Republicans win House majority of 218 seats	Republicans have won enough seats to control the House of Representatives, completing the party’s sweep into power and securing their hold on both chambers of Congress and the White House. Republicans gained control of the Senate last week. Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz resigned from Congress Wednesday, ending an ethics probe into allegations of sex trafficking, sexual misconduct and drug use after President-elect Donald Trump nominated him for attorney general. Gaetz's nomination was one of several picks unveiled by Trump, including Sen. Marco Rubio as secretary of state and Tulsi Gabbard as director of national intelligence. President Joe Biden welcomed Trump to the White House for an Oval Office visit that's a traditional part of the peaceful handoff of power — a ritual Trump himself declined to participate in four years ago. Follow the AP’s Election 2024 coverage at: https://apnews.com/hub/election-2024. Here’s the latest: The GOP’s majority is thin and a highly functioning House is also far from guaranteed The past two years of Republican House control were defined by infighting as hardline conservative factions sought to gain influence and power by openly defying their party leadership. While Johnson — at times with Trump’s help — largely tamed open rebellions against his leadership, the right wing of the party is ascendant and ambitious on the heels of Trump’s election victory. The Republican majority also depends on a small group of lawmakers who won tough elections by running as moderates. It remains to be seen whether they will stay on board for some of the most extreme proposals championed by Trump and his allies. House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries, meanwhile, is trying to keep Democrats relevant to any legislation that passes Congress, an effort that will depend on Democratic leaders unifying over 200 members, even as the party undergoes a postmortem of their election losses. Trump’s governing trifecta will be different this time When Trump was elected as president in 2016, Republicans also swept Congress, but he still encountered Republican leaders resistant to his policy ideas, as well as a Supreme Court with a liberal majority. Not this time. When he returns to the White House, Trump will be working with a Republican Party that has been completely transformed by his 'MAGA movement' and a Supreme Court dominated by conservative justices, including three that he appointed. 'Republicans in the House and Senate have a mandate,' House Speaker Mike Johnson said earlier this week. 'The American people want us to implement and deliver that ‘America First’ agenda.' Republicans win 218 US House seats, giving Donald Trump and the party control of government Republicans have won enough seats to control the U.S. House, completing the party’s sweep into power and securing their hold on U.S. government alongside President-elect Donald Trump. A House Republican victory in Arizona, alongside a win in slow-counting California earlier Wednesday, gave the GOP the 218 House victories that make up the majority. Republicans earlier gained control of the Senate from Democrats. With hard-fought yet thin majorities, Republican leaders are envisioning a mandate to upend the federal government and swiftly implement Trump’s vision for the country. The incoming president has promised to carry out the country’s largest-ever deportation operation, extend tax breaks, punish his political enemies, seize control of the federal government’s most powerful tools and reshape the U.S. economy. The GOP election victories ensure that Congress will be onboard for that agenda, and Democrats will be almost powerless to check it. Rep. Matt Gaetz resigns from Congress Trump told Speaker Mike Johnson earlier today that he would be tapping Gaetz for his administration as attorney general, reducing Johnson’s slim majority even further. Gaetz submitted his resignation from Congress, effective immediately, launching an eight-week clock to fill his seat Johnson said, possibly in time for the start of the new Congress on Jan. 3. It also ends a long-running ethics investigation into the Florida congressman. Johnson framed the stunning move by Gaetz to resign early and before confirmation as a way to help the majority fill his vacancy much quicker than if he were to wait until his Senate confirmation as attorney general. But the decision and timing he chose to immediately step down raise concerns about the impending, years-long ethics probe into the Florida Republican, which was expected by many, including Gaetz, to be wrapped up by the end of the year. By stepping down, the bipartisan panel no longer has jurisdiction over Gaetz, deeming the probe and the subsequent report effectively dead. What other Cabinet positions does Trump still need to pick? While the president-elect has been busy filling out his incoming administration, there are still more appointments he needs to make. Here are the Cabinet positions that Trump has yet to pick: 1. Secretary of Treasury 2. Secretary of the Interior 3. Secretary of Agriculture 4. Secretary of Labor 5. Secretary of Health and Human Services 6. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development 7. Secretary of Transportation 8. Secretary of Energy 9. Secretary of Education 10. Secretary of Veterans Affairs 11. United States Trade Representative 12. Secretary of the Council of Economic Advisers 13. Administer of the Small Business Administration 14. Director of the Office of Management and Budget 15. Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy The House Ethics Committee’s GOP chair says its investigation into Gaetz will continue — for now Rep. Michael Guest, the GOP chair for the House Ethics Committee, told AP that Matt Gaetz’s nomination as attorney general does not change the panel’s ongoing probe into the congressman over alleged sex trafficking, sexual misconduct and drug use. But if Gaetz is confirmed for the cabinet position, the committee will no longer have jurisdiction to continue its probe or release its report. 'Once we lose jurisdiction, there would not be a report that would be issued,' Guest said. 'That’s not unique to this case, we have that every new Congress, where there are members who are under ethics investigation, who either choose not to run again, in some instances, or they resign or they lose reelection.' He added, 'We’re not going to rush this investigation because of the appointment. And so we’re going to again follow the rules and the procedures that we set in place.' Some at the State Department express cautious optimism over Rubio nomination At the State Department, at least some officials expressed cautious optimism about the Rubio nomination. Three officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations with colleagues, said there was a sense that Rubio would be willing to work with and listen to career staff even if he might ultimately discard their advice. And, one of them breathed a sigh of relief that Rubio was the least controversial pick announced by Trump. In comparison to Gabbard, Gaetz and Hegseth, Rubio, a current senator who sits on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, is likely to have a relatively quick and easy confirmation hearing and vote with support from all of his GOP colleagues and at least some Democrats. The new presidential transition rules Four years ago, the Trump-appointed head of the GSA, Emily Murphy, determined that she had no legal standing to determine a winner in the presidential race because Trump was still challenging the results in court, claiming falsely that there was widespread voter fraud. That held up funding and cooperation for the transition. It wasn’t until Trump’s efforts to subvert election results had collapsed across key states that Murphy agreed to formally ' ascertain a president-elect ' and begin the transition process. Trump eventually posted on social media that his administration would cooperate. To prevent that kind of holdup in future transitions, the Presidential Transition Improvement Act of 2022 mandates that the transition process begin five days after the election — even if the winner is still in dispute. That is designed to avoid long delays and means that 'an ‘affirmative ascertainment’ by the GSA is no longer a prerequisite for gaining transition support services,' according to agency guidelines on the new rules. Speaker Mike Johnson wins GOP nomination to remain in job, faces full House vote in new year While Johnson has no serious challenger, he faces dissent within his ranks, particularly from hard-right conservatives and the Freedom Caucus withholding their votes as leverage to extract promises ahead. Trump told House Republicans, during his first trip back to Washington since the party swept the 2024 election, that he’s with the speaker all the way, according to a person familiar with the remarks but unauthorized to discuss the private meeting near the Capitol. Johnson heaped praise on Trump, calling him the 'comeback king.' It’s been a remarkable political journey for Johnson, the accidental speaker who rose as a last, best choice to replace ousted former speaker Kevin McCarthy more than a year ago and quickly set course by positioning himself alongside Trump and leading Republicans during the elections. Trump’s selection of Gaetz is seen as a shock announcement The Florida lawmaker was not one of the main names seen as a likely pick for the top law enforcement job. And Trump’s announcement was first pushed out on his social media network instead of a more formal announcement from his transition team, as most of his picks have been made. Republican senators were reluctant to immediately criticize the pick. 16. Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley, the likely incoming chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, refused to directly answer questions about Gaetz and stood silently for around a minute while he waited for a Senate subway train. 17. Texas Sen. John Cornyn, another member of the Judiciary panel, said he didn’t know Gaetz 'other than his public persona, so we’ll handle it like any other nomination.' 18. Wyoming Sen. John Barrasso, newly elected as the incoming No. 2 Senate Republican, said that Trump 'is going to continue to make his appointments. We’re going to continue to look forward to them coming to the Senate and have hearings and get his cabinet confirmed as quickly as possible.' He would not comment on Gaetz specifically. 19. Only North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis, a Republican member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, appeared to express doubts about the nomination, saying he will have 'his work cut out for him' to win enough votes for confirmation. Trump says he will nominate Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida to be attorney general In selecting the congressman, Trump passed over some of the more established attorneys whose names had been mentioned as being contenders for the job. 'Matt will end Weaponized Government, protect our Borders, dismantle Criminal Organizations and restore Americans’ badly shattered Faith and Confidence in the Justice Department,' Trump said in a statement. Trump’s pick of Gaetz comes as the House Ethics Committee is still investigating allegations that he was part of a scheme that led to the sex trafficking of a 17-year-old girl. The committee said its review now includes whether Gaetz engaged in sexual misconduct and illicit drug use, accepted improper gifts and sought to obstruct government investigations of his conduct. Gaetz has categorically denied all the allegations before the committee. The Justice Department in 2023 ended a sex trafficking case against Gaetz with no charges against him. Trump picks ex-Rep. Tulsi Gabbard as director of national intelligence Trump has chosen Tulsi Gabbard, a former Democratic member of Congress and presidential candidate, to serve as director of national intelligence, continuing to stock his Cabinet with loyal personalities complimentary to his own, rather than long-term professionals in their requisite fields. 'As a former Candidate for the Democrat Presidential Nomination, she has broad support in both Parties - She is now a proud Republican!' Trump said in a statement. 'I know Tulsi will bring the fearless spirit that has defined her illustrious career to our Intelligence Community, championing our Constitutional Rights, and securing Peace through Strength. Tulsi will make us all proud!' Gabbard would come to the role as somewhat of an outsider compared to her predecessor, Avril Haines who was confirmed by the Senate in 2021 following several years in top national security and intelligence positions. Gabbard hasn’t worked directly in the intelligence community, though has served on House committees including two years on the Homeland Security Committee. Like others, she has been among Trump’s most popular political surrogates. Trump picks Sen. Marco Rubio as his Secretary of State In naming Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida as his nominee for secretary of state, Trump has set up a onetime critic who evolved into one of the president-elect’s fiercest defenders to become the nation’s top diplomat. The conservative lawmaker is a noted hawk on China, Cuba and Iran, and was a finalist to be Trump’s running mate this summer. On Capitol Hill, Rubio is the vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee and a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. He has pushed for taking a harder line against China and has targeted social media app TikTok because its parent company is Chinese. He and other lawmakers contend that Beijing could demand access to the data of users whenever it wants. 'He will be a strong Advocate for our Nation, a true friend to our Allies, and a fearless Warrior who will never back down to our adversaries,' Trump said of Rubio in a statement. Trump made the announcement while flying back to Florida from Washington after meeting with President Joe Biden. Trump has spoken with new Senate leader John Thune President-elect Donald Trump spoke on the phone today with Sen. John Thune, who is fresh off being elected as the next Senate majority leader. 'Senate Republicans are excited and ready to get to work implementing President Trump’s agenda on behalf of the American people,' Thune said on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter. Thune has had his differences with Trump, but reconnected with the president-elect earlier this spring as he launched a bid to replace Sen. Mitch McConnell atop the Senate Republican Conference. And in the days before the internal GOP leadership election, Thune stressed his commitment to working with Trump. Trump says he had a ‘very good meeting’ with Biden Trump told The New York Post that he and Biden discussed two issues they disagree on: Ukraine and Israel’s war against Hamas. 'I wanted — I asked for his views and he gave them to me,' Trump told the newspaper after the meeting. 'Also, we talked very much about the Middle East, likewise. I wanted to know his views on where we are and what, what he thinks. And he gave them to me, he was very gracious.' Biden strongly backs Ukraine’s fight against Russia’s invasion and has repeatedly said he supports Israel’s right to defend itself. Trump has promised to end the war in Ukraine quickly and has said the Biden administration isn’t doing enough to support Israel against Hamas and its other enemies. The White House says Trump and Biden had a ‘substantive’ meeting White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre says Biden and Trump had a 'substantive meeting' for about two hours in the Oval Office. She says they talked about domestic and foreign policy issues, and that Biden also raised important issues on Congress’ to-do list, such as funding the government and providing disaster relief money. Biden also stressed to Trump that the transition will be orderly and there will be a peaceful transfer of power. Trump heads back to Florida Trump’s plane took off from Joint Base Andrews just after 1:30 p.m. ET. He’s returning to his home in Palm Beach, Florida, after about four hours in Washington. Democratic state leaders prepare for a tougher time countering Trump in his second term Democratic governors and state attorneys general are dusting off the playbooks from their offices’ pushback against President-elect Donald Trump’s policies, but they know it could be a harder battle in his second time in office. Trump’s campaign promises included mass deportations of people in the country illegally, and his history includes rolling back environmental regulations and setting the stage for state abortion bans by nominating three new Supreme Court justices who helped overturn Roe v. Wade. All of that is putting liberals on edge — and believing that an organized resistance is necessary. Democratic state officials are positioning themselves to carry it out. ▶ Read more about Democrat-led states’ reaction to Trump’s reelection Trump leaves the White House Trump has left the White House after meeting with Biden for close to two hours.

Maine elections chief who drew Trump’s ire narrates House tabulations in livestream Maine’s elections chief, a former civil liberties attorney who sparred with President-elect Donald Trump over ballot access, is acting like a play-by-play sports announcer as she describes the state’s process of determining a congressional winner through ranked choice voting. Shenna Bellows is spending the week streaming the effort live on YouTube and answering questions in real time. 'We hope that when people see it for themselves, they will believe that our elections do have integrity, that they’re free and fair. And then maybe they’ll have a little more trust in the election officials who are working so hard to make these elections happen,' Secretary of State Shenna Bellows told The Associated Press. Democratic Rep. Jared Golden led Republican challenger Austin Theriault by about 2,000 first-place votes after nearly 400,000 ballots were cast in Maine’s 2nd Congressional District, but neither got more than 49%, so the ranked choice process will reallocate other votes to determine a majority, her office announced. ▶ Read more about the Maine House race Biden and Xi will meet in Peru as US-China relations tested again by Trump’s return President Joe Biden will hold talks Saturday with China’s Xi Jinping on the sidelines of an international summit in Peru, a face-to-face meeting that comes as Beijing braces for Donald Trump’s return to the White House. A senior Biden administration official, who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity ahead of the formal announcement, confirmed plans for the meeting to take place while the two leaders are in Lima for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit. That will come just over two months before Trump’s inauguration.

In a post on the social media platform X on Tuesday night, Baugh said 'despite running a strong campaign … that effort is going to come up a little short.'

Thune, who’s 63 and in his fourth Senate term, has promised to work closely with Trump despite differences the two have had over the years. Thune will be a crucial part of the incoming president’s efforts to push through his policy agenda. He beat out two other competitors, Sens. John Cornyn of Texas and Rick Scott of Florida, by gaining majority support from GOP senators in a secret ballot vote. Republicans are replacing Kentucky’s McConnell, the longest serving Senate party leader, as they prepare to take majority control with the 53 seats they won in last week’s elections. ▶ Read more about Senate Republicans Biden and Trump both promise a smooth transition At the White House, they sat in matching yellow chairs in front of a roaring fireplace. Biden told Trump his team will 'do everything we can to make sure you’re accommodated' and has everything he needs. 'Congratulations and I look forward to having a smooth transition,' Biden said. Trump responded by saying, 'Politics is tough and it’s, uh, in many cases, not a very nice world, but it is a nice world today and I appreciate very much a transition that’s so smooth it’ll be as smooth as it can get. And I very much appreciate that, Joe.' White House chief of staff Jeff Zients and incoming chief of staff Susie Wiles are attending the meeting. House Republicans say Elon Musk was a center of attention as Trump addressed them 'He got three standing ovations,' Rep. Ralph Norman, R-S.C., said of Musk. 'Out of everybody, Elon Musk is who (Trump) gave the biggest support for,' Norman said. Rep. Clay Higgins, R-La., described Musk as 'such a presence' during the meeting and drew a large crowd of lawmakers around him, though he didn’t get to speak to him personally. 'He’s a bright light in any room he’s in,' Higgins said Jill Biden joins the president to greet Trump at the White House First lady Jill Biden joined President Joe Biden to greet the president-elect when he arrived at the White House. The White House says the first lady also gave Trump a handwritten letter of congratulations for his wife, Melania, the incoming first lady. Melania Trump did not go to the White House with her husband for the traditional meeting with the outgoing first lady. In her letter, Jill Biden expressed her team’s readiness to assist Melania Trump with the transition, the White House said. During Biden meeting, an email went to Trump supporters with the subject ‘Trump is inside the White House’ The fundraising email said 'President Trump is inside the White House right now conducting a very important meeting' and directed supporters to fill out an online poll about what his priority should be. Trump’s fundraising operation has often timed his messages so they’re sent out notifying his supporters as he’s appearing on stage or — during his legal challenges — appearing in court. House Republicans were elated Wednesday when Trump came to speak to their conference Rep. Troy Nehls of Texas wore his 'Make America Great Again' tie with matching Trump gold sneakers. After Trump’s speech, Nehls told reporters it was electric inside the room and the party must put aside the chaos of the last few years and unify behind the president-elect. 'If Donald Trump says, ‘jump three feet high and scratch your head,’ we all jump three feet high and scratch our head,' Nehls said. Four advisers from Trump’s campaign will be joining his White House staff President-elect Donald Trump is bringing four advisers from his presidential campaign into his new White House as deputy chiefs of staff, including two longtime aides and the political director who played a key role in his victory. Trump announced Wednesday that longtime aide Dan Scavino will serve as a deputy without giving a specific portfolio; campaign political director James Blair as deputy for legislative, political and public affairs; and Taylor Budowich as deputy chief of staff for communications and personnel. All will have the rank of assistant to the president. Trump also formally announced Stephen Miller, an immigration hard-liner, will be deputy chief of staff for policy and homeland security adviser. That had previously been confirmed by Vice President-elect JD Vance on Monday. Speaker Johnson begins fight for the House gavel, winning nod from Trump Speaker Mike Johnson is beginning the hard fight for his gavel, a weeks-long campaign that starts Wednesday during internal House Republican leadership elections and will establish the new power centers in Congress for a Washington dominated by President-elect Donald Trump. While Johnson has no serious challenger, he faces dissent within his ranks, particularly from hard-right conservatives and the Freedom Caucus withholding their votes as leverage to extract promises ahead. The speaker won a welcome endorsement early Wednesday from Trump, who told House Republicans in a morning meeting near the Capitol he was with Johnson all the way, according to a person familiar with the private remarks and unauthorized to publicly discuss them. The visit was Trump’s first back to Washington after winning the 2024 election and Johnson heaped praise on the president-elect, calling him the 'comeback king.' ▶ Read more about House Republicans Biden greeted Trump with a handshake in the Oval Office, each pledging a smooth transition from Democrat to Republican Biden congratulated Trump.

Elon Musk arrives at the GOP conference in Washington Musk, who’s been a fixture of late with Trump, arrived at the GOP conference in Washington just as Trump was coming in to address leaders. On Tuesday night, Trump said Musk and former GOP presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy would run a panel focused on government efficiency that would be outside government but advise the White House. It’s not entirely clear how the operation will work. Trump says he thinks even Democratic strongholds can be won by the GOP 'We won it every way, all seven swing states by a lot,' he said, speaking to GOP leaders in Washington. Trump commented on the results in Democratic strongholds like New Jersey and California, declaring that winning in the latter state would be 'very doable. It would be really doable if they change the election process.' Trump says it’s ‘nice to win’ Trump is speaking to GOP leaders in Washington for the first time since he won the 2024 presidential election. 'It’s always nice to win,' Trump said.

Musk shared the post with the message: 'Important details' Melania Trump isn’t joining her husband at the White House 'Her husband’s return to the Oval Office to commence the transition process is encouraging, and she wishes him great success,' Melania Trump’s office said. No reason was given for why she didn’t accept the invitation. The Bidens had extended congratulations and a joint invite to the Trumps to meet at the White House. The spouses typically meet upstairs in the residence while the president and president-elect meet in the Oval Office. Trump makes a victor’s return to Washington to meet with Biden and GOP lawmakers Donald Trump is making a victor’s return to Washington. The president-elect’s plane landed at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland on Wednesday morning. President Joe Biden — both Trump’s successor and predecessor to the presidency — will welcome him to the White House for an Oval Office visit. It’s a traditional part of the peaceful handoff of power — a ritual Trump himself declined to participate in four years ago. Trump also planned to meet with congressional Republicans as they focus on his Day 1 priorities and prepare for a potentially unified government with a GOP sweep of power in the nation’s capital. His visit, amid Republican congressional leadership elections, could put his imprint on the outcome. ▶ Read more about Trump and Biden’s meeting When Trump rolls up to the White House to meet with Biden, Kamala Harris won’t be there The vice president is spending the morning in meetings at her official residence, according to a person with knowledge of her schedule.

Elon Musk to join Trump for his meeting with House Republicans Billionaire Elon Musk will join Trump in Washington, according to a Trump aide. The SpaceX owner, who Trump just named to a government efficiency advisory role in the new administration, is not currently expected to be at Trump’s meeting with Biden at the White House. Musk will join Trump’s earlier meeting with House Republicans before he and Biden meet in the Oval Office. He’s been a steady presence at Trump’s side since the election. Wednesday’s meeting puts Biden and Trump together for first time since their June debate It was Biden’s poor performance at that debate that led Democrats to start pressuring him to drop out and let another candidate take on Trump.

A meeting between the incoming and outgoing president is tradition but then-President Trump didn’t invite Biden to the White House after he lost to the Democrat in 2020.

South Dakota Sen. John Thune, Texas Sen. John Cornyn and Florida Sen. Rick Scott have been scrambling to win the most votes in the secret ballot election, promising a new direction in the Senate even as they furiously compete for Trump’s favor. It will be the first test of Trump’s relationship with Congress after he won the election decisively and claimed a mandate for his agenda.

A study says the global luxury goods market will shrink in 2025. Trump tariffs could make it worse	MILAN (AP) — Global sales of personal luxury goods are forecast to shrink in 2025 for the first time since the Great Recession, according to a Bain consultancy study released Wednesday. The outlook could worsen if the sector is hit by tariffs promised by Donald Trump. 'This could be a nightmare if implemented,’’ Claudia D’Arpizio, co-author of the study for Italy’s Altagamma association of luxury producers, told The Associated Press. 'European brands could end up being super expensive in an already expensive environment.’' Trump has pledged tariffs of up to 20% on imports, saying it would create factory jobs, shrink the federal deficit and lower food prices. While the study did not address the possible impact of tariffs, D’Arpizio said the impact on European luxury producers would depend on how the tariffs are implemented on the category, if at all. She noted that a dearth of American luxury substitutes may lead to an exemption. Any negative impact could also be offset by moving production to the United States, or by higher sales to U.S. tourists in Europe. The United States is the second-largest luxury market, following Europe, worth about 100 billion euros ($106 billion), or nearly one-third of all global high-end sales of apparel, leather goods and footwear. Sales of luxury goods are forecast to drop by 2% to 363 billion euros ($385 billion) next year, from an expected 369 billion euros in 2024, due to steep price increases imposed by brands and global turmoil, Bain said. The sector made a speedy rebound from the COVID-19 pandemic, surpassing 2019 sales by 2022, largely thanks to pent-up spending that was delayed by lockdowns. Even next year's modest dip would leave the market 28% higher than it was in 2019, and two-and-a-half times larger than the Great Recession lows in 2008. Social and political turbulence, including wars and a slate of national elections, have eroded consumer confidence, D’Arpizio said. In addition, brands’ strategy to increase prices while focusing on more 'subtle luxury' often lacking novelty has 'brought a strong negative impact on the willingness to buy,’’ even among wealthy consumers, she said. The creativity crisis is also alienating Gen-Z shoppers, many now in their 20s, the study found. The result is the luxury market has shrunk by 50 million customers, to an estimated 250 million to 360 million, as the luxury base shrinks for the first time. 'We have 50 million fewer customers either because they can’t afford to shop, or they don’t want to because they don’t feel there is enough juice,’’ D’Arpizio said.	https://apnews.com/article/luxury-sales-italy-trump-9806296c09548829bb71803aee572aff	2024-11-13T03:53:41-08:00	
Dutch lawmaker Wilders wants to deport those convicted of violence against Israeli soccer fans	THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — Hard-right Dutch political leader Geert Wilders on Wednesday blamed 'Moroccans' for attacks on Israeli soccer fans in Amsterdam last week, asserting that they 'want to destroy Jews' and recommending the deportation of people convicted of involvement if they have dual nationality. While lawmakers condemned antisemitism and agreed that perpetrators of the violence should be prosecuted and handed harsh punishments, opposition legislators accused Wilders of 'pouring oil on the fire' and said his statements during a parliamentary debate were not conducive to 'a better society.' Violence erupted in the Dutch capital before and after last week's soccer match between Ajax Amsterdam and Maccabi Tel Aviv. Fans from both sides were involved in unrest; a number of Maccabi fans attacked a cab and chanted anti-Arab slogans while some men carried out 'hit and run' attacks on people they thought were Jews, according to Amsterdam Mayor Femke Halsema. After the match, parts of a large group of Maccabi supporters armed with sticks ran around 'destroying things,' a 12-page report on the violence issued by Amsterdam authorities said. There were also 'rioters, moving in small groups, by foot, scooter or car, quickly attacking Maccabi fans before disappearing,' it said. Amsterdam police said five people were treated in hospital for injuries. Police detained dozens of people before the match, but there were no immediate arrests for violence after it. On Wednesday night, hundreds of pro-Palestinian protesters gathered on Amsterdam's central Dam Square to hold a demonstration despite a new city ban on such gatherings. Large numbers of police, including some on horseback, were present and detained most of the protesters after they refused to leave, escorting them mostly peacefully into two buses and driving them away from the square. Reports of antisemitic speech, vandalism and violence have been on the rise in Europe since the start of the war in Gaza, and tensions were high in Amsterdam ahead of the soccer match. The assaults on Maccabi fans sparked outrage and were widely condemned as antisemitic. The violence badly tarnished Amsterdam's long-held image as a haven of tolerance and sparked soul-searching across the country. Wilders, whose anti-immigration Party for Freedom won elections last year and now is part of a four-party ruling coalition government, said Wednesday that on the night Amsterdam commemorated Kristallnacht, the 1938 anti-Jewish pogrom in Nazi Germany, 'we saw Muslims hunting Jews on the streets of Amsterdam,' and blamed 'Moroccans who want to destroy Jews.' He gave no evidence. Police and prosecutors have not disclosed the identities of any of the suspects that were detained, in line with Dutch privacy rules. Wilders advocated canceling the Dutch passports of people convicted of involvement in the violence — if they have a double passport — and deporting them. Wilders, who is sometimes described as the Dutch Donald Trump because of his fierce anti-immigration rhetoric, has lived under round-the-clock protection for 20 years because of death threats from Islamic extremists. He has also long been a staunch supporter of Israel. Some lawmakers warned that his new comments only served to deepen divisions in Dutch society. Rob Jetten of the centrist D66 party said Wilders' rhetoric 'does not contribute in any way to healing. In no way does he contribute to bringing our country together, but he throws oil on the fire and thus does not bring solutions against antisemitism and for a better society any closer, but only further away.' Frans Timmermans, who leads the biggest center-left bloc in parliament, agreed. 'What you are doing is just stirring things up, dividing this country when this country needs politicians who bring people together, who bring solutions closer,' Timmermans said. In Amsterdam, a prominent Jewish member of the City Council, Itay Garmy, said that although there’s a lot of anger and fear within the Jewish community, inflammatory remarks wouldn’t help. 'Don’t use my security or my suffering or my fear as a Jew to create political gains for yourself and make your points about integration, migration or Muslim hate,' Garmy said. ___ Associated Press writer Bram Janssen in Amsterdam contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/netherlands-wilders-israel-unrest-antisemitism-4ef4867043b9ed7fb02adfa1ff5bbf61	2024-11-13T03:53:12-08:00	
German Chancellor Olaf Scholz says he'll ask for a vote of confidence in December	BERLIN (AP) — German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said Wednesday that he will ask for a vote of confidence on Dec. 16, paving the way for early parliamentary elections in February. He declared his plans during a speech in parliament, a week after his three-party coalition government collapsed. Germany has been governed since 2021 by a coalition led by Scholz’s left-leaning Social Democrats, which included the smaller pro-business Free Democrats and the Greens. It was an uneasy and fractious alliance, and it fell apart when Scholz fired Finance Minister Christian Lindner of the Free Democrats in a late-night move following disagreements over how to revive the shrinking economy. 'The date at the end of February has now been set and I am very grateful for that,' Scholz said, adding that he would try to pass important legislation through parliament before that, such as financial support for children of poor families, or amendments to the country's constitution to make the highest court more resilient to possible political interference. He said he would submit a request for a vote of confidence on Dec. 11, so that the Bundestag can decide on this on Dec. 16. The chancellor had initially wanted to have an early election only by late March — ahead of the vote that is regularly scheduled for September 2025. However, the center-right Christian opposition pushed for a quicker vote in the parliament to speed up the next election. In the end, party leaders across the political spectrum agreed on Wednesday on the two dates for the vote of confidence and the new election on Feb. 23. During his speech, Scholz as well as Friedrich Merz, the head of the main opposition party in parliament, the Christian Democrats, already shifted into campaign mode — though the heated part of campaigning usually only begins around six weeks before an election in Germany. 'There is a great sense of relief in our country. For a week now, the so-called progressive coalition ... has been history. And that is continuing good news for Germany,' Merz said to the applause of his Christian Democrats as he spoke after Scholz in the parliament. 'You are dividing the country, Mr. Chancellor. You are the one responsible for these controversies and for this division in Germany,' Merz attacked Scholz in his speech. 'You simply cannot govern a country like this.' He accused the chancellor of having tried to delay the vote of confidence and said he should have called for one immediately. According to Scholz's announcement on Thursday, his Social Democrats and the Greens will lead the country in a minority government until the chancellor asks for the vote of confidence on Dec. 16, which he is expected to lose. That will then set the path for a new parliamentary election in a little over 100 days from now, on Feb. 23. Four candidates are expected to make their bid for the chancellery with voters in February. Scholz has said he wants to run as chancellor candidate again — even though his party has not yet announced his candidacy. Merz of the Christian Democrats, currently leading the polls, was officially nominated as candidate by his party in September. For the environmentalist Greens, the country’s current economy minister and vice-chancellor, Robert Habeck, will lead his party as candidate for chancellor. The Greens are a small party that lost popularity in recent elections and whose support currently hovers around 10%, meaning it is unlikely that he would end up as the country’s leader. The far-right Alternative for Germany, or AfD, has said they would nominate current party leader Alice Weidel next month as their candidate. Merz’s Christian Democrats have been polling around 30% or more in the polls for a year now. Scholz’s Social Democrats, currently the strongest governing party, are in third place with around 16% — behind the AfD, which is at around 19%. The main campaign issues are likely going to be the country’s ailing econom y which led to the collapse of the government in the first place, more efficient control of migration, and — when it comes to foreign policy issues — Russia’s war on Ukraine and the next presidency of Donald Trump.	https://apnews.com/article/germany-scholz-vote-confidence-election-f3bf4635504f8df49b18f633da5d3d16	2024-11-13T03:41:43-08:00	
Italy's president sharply rebukes Elon Musk over comments on X about migration court rulings	ROME (AP) — Italian President Sergio Mattarella sharply rebuked Elon Musk on Wednesday for weighing in on Italian court rulings that have stymied the government’s plans to process some asylum-seekers in Albania. Musk, who is expected to have a top advisory role in Donald Trump’s new administration, wrote Tuesday on X that 'these judges need to go.' He was referring to the latest Italian court ruling against right-wing Premier Giorgia Meloni’s Albania immigration deal. In a subsequent post on Wednesday, Musk wrote: 'This is unacceptable. Do the people of Italy live in a democracy or does an unelected autocracy make the decisions?' The posts concerned a Rome court's refusal to rule on a formal request to detain seven migrants rescued at sea and transferred to Albania for processing. Monday's ruling, which resulted in the men being brought to Italy for processing, was the second judicial setback for Meloni’s much-touted plan to outsource to Albania the processing of some male asylum-seekers. Mattarella didn’t cite Musk by name but — in an unusually piqued statement — made clear on Wednesday that he was referring to him. Italy's head of state demanded respect for the country's sovereignty, especially from other soon-to-be public officials. 'Italy is a great democratic country and … knows how to take care of itself while respecting its Constitution,' Mattarella said in a statement issued by his spokesman. 'Anyone, particularly if as announced is about to assume an important role of government in a friendly and allied country, must respect its sovereignty and cannot attribute to himself the task of imparting prescriptions,' the statement said. Trump announced Tuesday that Musk, one of the most influential people around the U.S. president-elect, would help lead a Department of Government Efficiency, essentially an independent advisory panel to eliminate waste and fraud. Musk is a supporter of Meloni and has met with her in Rome on a few occasions, and in September joined her at an awards ceremony on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly. Photos of them together made such news that Musk seemingly felt the need to tamp down speculation by posting 'We are not dating.' Musk has a history of making provocative statements and sparring with leaders on X. Earlier this year, he posted messages insulting U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer and saying the United Kingdom was headed for civil war. He has also clashed with a Brazilian supreme court justice over free speech, far-right accounts and purported misinformation on X, and also accused Venezuela’s socialist president, Nicolás Maduro, of 'major election fraud' after that country’s disputed election. The courts’ rulings have raised the ire of Meloni’s far-right-led government, which has been seeking strategies to ease the strain on Italy of the arrival of migrants seeking a better life in Europe. The government had held up the opening of the Albanian centers as a centerpiece of its immigration crackdown, also as a means of deterrence, and said they could be a model for Europe. In both cases, Italian courts referred the cases to the EU court of justice in Luxembourg to rule if the countries of origin for the migrants are considered safe for repatriation. There is no word on when the European court might rule. But as a result of the Rome court decisions, no migrant has yet been processed in the Albanian centers, which are budgeted to cost Italy 670 million euros ($730 million) over five years to build and operate. Italy's opposition says the money could be much better spent on reinforcing Italian-operated migrant processing centers, while human rights groups say the outsourcing of asylum processing contravenes international law. The centers opened in October after a months-long delay, because crumbling soil at one of the facilities needed to be repaired. They are run by Italy and are under the country's jurisdiction, while Albanian guards provide external security.	https://apnews.com/article/musk-italy-albania-migration-8a3cad24845a86f7ae5a11fc00ce4931	2024-11-13T03:33:59-08:00	
Thailand's baby pygmy hippo Moo Deng has an official song released in 4 languages	BANGKOK (AP) — In case you can’t get enough of the little pygmy hippo Moo Deng from Thailand, there's now an official song featuring the internet's favorite baby animal — released in four languages for her global fans. The upbeat 50-second song 'Moodeng Moodeng,' available in Thai, English, Chinese and Japanese versions, features simple lyrics like 'Moo Deng Moo Deng, boing boing boing/ Mommy mommy, play with me.' Its music video consists of short clips of the baby hippo bouncing, playing with her keeper or hanging out with her mom Jona. The catchy number was produced and written by well-known Thai composer Mueanphet Ammara, and released by one of Thailand's largest music companies, GMM Music. Moo Deng — the name literally means 'bouncy pork,' a type of meatball, in Thai — became a global phenomenon just a month after she was unveiled on Facebook by the Khao Kheow Open Zoo in Thailand’s southern Chon Buri province. Fans say her name compliments her chaotic personality. Moo Deng likes to 'deng,' or bounce, and her giddy bouncing has appeared all over social media in countless memes. Her image has been used by sports teams and businesses. The hippo, now four months old, has drawn a huge amount of visitors to the zoo, which is around two-hour drive away from the capital Bangkok. The zoo estimated it has received 3,000 to 5,000 visitors a day on average in the past few months, and it's selling clothes, bedding and other merchandise based on Moo Deng. Zoo director Narongwit Chodchoi has said the increasing income from Moo Deng will help its breeding programs for many endangered species like the pygmy hippopotamus, which is threatened by poaching and loss of habitat. The species is native to West Africa and there are only 2,000-3,000 of them left in the wild. The zoo sits on 800 hectares (almost 2,000 acres) of land and is home to more than 2,000 animals. All four versions of the Moo Deng song is available on YouTube and streaming platforms including Spotify and Apple Music.	https://apnews.com/article/thailand-moo-deng-hippo-khao-kheow-zoo-song-7bd956dd6766d3f1302b3e2c6ac73644	2024-11-13T03:32:01-08:00	
Philippines says it will cooperate if ICC seeks Duterte's custody over drug killings	MANILA, Philippines (AP) — The Philippine government said Wednesday its law enforcement agencies will be bound to cooperate if the International Criminal Court seeks the custody of former President Rodrigo Duterte as part of an investigation into thousands of deaths during his crackdown on illegal drugs. The Hague-based court has been investigating the widespread killings that took place while Duterte was mayor of the southern Philippine city of Davao and later as president from 2016 to 2020, as a possible crime against humanity. Human rights groups estimate the deaths could exceed 20,000 during Duterte’s presidency alone. The bloody campaign alarmed Western governments and led to complaints that sparked the investigation by the ICC, a court of last resort for crimes that countries are unwilling or unable to prosecute themselves. Under intense grilling in a televised congressional inquiry Wednesday, the brash-speaking Duterte gave conflicting statements whether he would submit himself to the global court for investigation. 'The ICC does not scare me a bit. They can come here anytime,' Duterte told members of the House of Representatives conducting the inquiry. 'I’m asking the ICC to hurry up and come here and start the investigation tomorrow.' 'This issue has been hanging for many years and I may already die,' the 79-year-old said. 'If I’m found guilty, I can go to prison and rot there for all time.' Duterte, however, said later that he would physically kick any ICC investigator who would face him. Executive Secretary Lucas Bersamin, the most senior Cabinet member, said if Duterte 'desires to surrender himself to the jurisdiction of the ICC, the government will neither object to it nor move to block the fulfillment of his desire.' 'But if the ICC refers the process to Interpol, which may then transmit a red notice to the Philippine authorities, the government will feel obliged to consider the red notice as a request to be honored,' Bersamin said. 'In which case, the domestic law enforcement agencies shall be bound to accord full cooperation to the Interpol pursuant to established protocols.' A red notice flags law enforcement worldwide to locate and temporarily arrest a person pending extradition or surrender. Duterte withdrew the Philippines from ICC in 2019 in a move activists said was an attempt to evade accountability and prevent an international probe into the drug killings. However, the ICC still has jurisdiction over alleged crimes committed when the country was still a member state of the court. Duterte’s successor, Ferdinand Marcos Jr., has said his administration has no plan to rejoin the ICC. During the congressional inquiry, Duterte renewed a vague pledge under oath that he would take full responsibility for the actions — whether 'right or wrong' — of police officers who enforced his anti-drugs crackdown when he was in power. Duterte denied any involvement when confronted with specific details of the killings. He claimed that he once pushed a suspected criminal out of a helicopter as punishment but later walked it back, saying it was a 'hyperbole' not to be taken literally.	https://apnews.com/article/philippines-duterte-icc-interpol-drug-killings-71de48e00c77c70ce37cf67146a94d12	2024-11-13T03:18:52-08:00	
Israel's West Bank settlers hope Trump's return will pave the way for major settlement expansion	BEIT EL, West Bank (AP) — As Donald Trump’s victory became apparent in last week's U.S. elections, Jewish West Bank settlement advocates popped bottles of champagne and danced to the Bee Gees at a winery in the heart of the occupied territory, according to a post on Instagram. The winery said it was rolling out a special edition red named for the president-elect. Settlement supporters believe they have plenty of reasons to celebrate. Not only did the expansion of housing for Jews in the West Bank soar past previous records during Trump's first term, but his administration took unprecedented steps to support Israel’s territorial claims, including recognizing Jerusalem as its capital and moving the U.S. Embassy there, and recognizing Israel's annexation of the Golan Heights. This time around, as Israel is embroiled in a multifront war, settlement advocates believe Trump’s history of fervent support could translate into their supreme goal: Israeli annexation of the West Bank — a move that critics say would smother any remaining hopes for Palestinian statehood. Some are even gunning for resettling Gaza under a Trump administration. 'God willing, the year 2025 will be the year of sovereignty in Judea and Samaria,' Israeli Finance Minister and settlement firebrand Bezalel Smotrich said Monday, referring to the West Bank by its biblical name, in comments that sparked international uproar. He said he would make sure the government lobbies the Trump administration on the idea. Israel captured the West Bank, along with east Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip in the 1967 Mideast war. The Palestinians want those territories for their hoped-for future state. Israel annexed east Jerusalem in a move most of the international community does not recognize and in 2005 it withdrew its settlers and troops from the Gaza Strip, where it has been fighting a war against Hamas. Settlement expansion in the West Bank has ballooned during Israel’s open-ended occupation, with more than half a million Israelis living in about 130 settlements and dozens of unauthorized outposts. The Western-backed Palestinian Authority administers semiautonomous parts of the West Bank that are home to most of the Palestinian population. During his first term as president, Trump abandoned decades-long U.S. opposition to the settlements. He proposed a Mideast plan that would have allowed Israel to keep them all. His ambassador to Israel was a staunch settlement advocate and opponent of Palestinian statehood. But Trump also took steps that are keeping some settler proponents cautious. His Mideast plan did leave room for a Palestinian state, even if critics say it was an unrealistic vision for one. And the Trump-brokered normalization agreements between Israel and Arab countries held the country back from annexing the West Bank. While he has not explicitly stated his policy for his second term, his initial administration picks, including ambassadors to Israel and the U.N., are deeply pro-Israel, indicating he likely will not stand in the way of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s far-right government advancing settlement building. 'There has never been an American president that has been more helpful in securing an understanding of the sovereignty of Israel,' Mike Huckabee, Trump's nominee for ambassador to Israel, told Israel Army Radio, when asked about the possibility of West Bank annexation. 'I fully expect that to continue.' A spokesperson for Netanyahu declined to say whether the Israeli leader would pursue annexation during Trump's presidency. But Netanyahu has named an American-born, hard-line settlement activist, Yechiel Leiter, to serve as ambassador to Washington. Rights groups already claim Israel is enforcing an apartheid system in the West Bank, and annexation would open Israel up to similar charges if it doesn’t grant Palestinians there equal rights. Israel opposes giving West Bank Palestinians citizenship, saying it would destroy Israel’s Jewish character. Regardless of whether annexation comes, settler advocates envision unbridled expansion under Trump and under an Israeli government where settler leaders and supporters hold key positions. They see a presidential term where they will be able to more deeply entrench their presence in the West Bank with a proliferation of housing, roads and industrial zones. 'I’m sure that with President Trump it will be much easier because he supports the state of Israel,' said Israel Ganz, the chairman of the Yesha Council, a settler lobbying group. Israeli settlement expansion has carried on to varying degrees under multiple American administrations. During Trump's term, Israel advanced nearly 33,000 housing units, according to Peace Now, an antisettlement watchdog group, almost three times as much as during President Barack Obama's second term. The numbers fell significantly during the first two years of the Biden administration, but shot up again in 2023, shortly after Israel's current far-right, prosettlement government was formed, and have surged throughout the war. The Biden administration has slapped sanctions on Jewish settlers suspected of fomenting violence against Palestinians, an approach that is likely to end under Trump. In the West Bank, billboards advertise new settlement housing, beckoning passersby to make their home there. In Beit El, next to the Palestinian administrative center of Ramallah, a new neighborhood boasts not the red-roofed, single-family homes that became icons of the settler movement, but rather six towering multistory apartment buildings that can house hundreds, and look like any Israeli suburb. Palestinians view the settlements as a violation of international law and an obstacle to peace, a position with wide international support. Israel considers the West Bank to be the historical and biblical heartland of the Jewish people and says any partition should be agreed on in negotiations. Peace talks have been moribund for more than a decade, and support for a Palestinian state among Israelis fell after Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attacks that sparked the war. Wasel Abu Yusuf, a Palestinian official, said Trump hadn’t yet made his positions clear and it was unknown if he would support Israeli annexation. Dror Etkes, an antisettlement researcher and activist, said that during the first Trump administration, West Bank outpost farms, which have forced entire Palestinian communities off huge swaths of land, saw a 'meteoric rise,' as did infrastructure projects that allow settlements to expand, like roads and water systems. Over the next four years, 'we can assume that we will see more significant steps of de facto annexation or maybe even official annexation,' Etkes said. Some settler advocates, like Daniella Weiss, believe Trump will not pressure Netanyahu to withdraw troops swiftly from Gaza, creating an opening for resettlement. That notion would be a nonstarter with other American administrations, and much of the international community would oppose it. A similar strategy in the early years of Israel's West Bank occupation led to the proliferation of settlements there. Two of Netanyahu's key governing partners also support resettling Gaza, although the Israeli leader has said it is not 'realistic.' Yair Sheleg, a research fellow at Jerusalem's Shalom Hartman Institute who studies the settler movement, said Trump was 'fickle' and that in his expected push to normalize ties between Israel and Saudi Arabia, he could end up being less favorable to the settlement enterprise than many hope. But nonetheless, he said, the overarching feeling among settler advocates is that 'Trump understands ... the needs of the settlement enterprise.'	https://apnews.com/article/trump-israel-settlers-west-bank-gaza-e1813d86ac1d930c2354db0937abf5f2	2024-11-13T03:12:36-08:00	
Middle East latest: 3 young siblings killed in Gaza as Israeli strikes leave 6 dead in Lebanon	An Israeli strike on a home in northern Gaza killed three siblings aged 6 and under, among at least six people killed in airstrikes in the war-ravaged territory, Palestinian medics said. In Lebanon, an Israeli airstrike on an apartment building south of Beirut on Wednesday killed at least six people and wounded 15, the Health Ministry said. The Biden administration said Tuesday it won’t limit weapons transfers to Israel because it has made limited progress in increasing the flow of humanitarian aid to Gaza. Eight international aid groups had earlier said that Israel failed to meet U.S. demands for greater humanitarian access to the Gaza Strip, where hunger experts say the north may already be experiencing famine. Israel’s war in Gaza has killed more than 43,000 people, Palestinian health officials say. The officials do not distinguish between civilians and combatants, but say more than half of those killed were women and children. The Israel-Hamas war began after Palestinian militants stormed into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people — mostly civilians — and abducting 250 others. Lebanon's Hezbollah group began firing into Israel on Oct. 8, 2023, in solidarity with Hamas in Gaza. Since then, more than 3,200 people have been killed in Lebanon and more than 14,200 wounded, the country's Health Ministry reported. In Israel, 76 people have been killed, including 31 soldiers. ___ Here's the latest: Blinken says Israel should end the war in Gaza and allow displaced to return home BRUSSELS — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is urging Israel to allow displaced Palestinians and aid back into Gaza and says it should end the war against Hamas now that it’s achieved its main security aims. 'The situation is so difficult and so dramatic that to fully redress it, to fully answer the needs of people, the best way to do that is to end the war,' Blinken told reporters in Brussels on Wednesday. He said that Israel has accomplished its goals of dismantling the military wing of Hamas and ensuring that an attack like the one the militant group launched on Oct. 7 last year cannot happen again. 'Israel, by the standards it set itself, has accomplished the strategic goals it set for itself,' Blinken said. 'So this should be a time to end the war.' He said that hundreds of aid trucks in Gaza are unable to distribute relief supplies due to looting and other crime. 'It’s imperative that that be addressed. Israel has responsibilities to do that. We’re also working with Egypt,' he said. Blinken called for 'real and extended pauses' in the fighting in much of Gaza 'so that the assistance can effectively get to people who need it.' A new video shows an Israeli hostage in Gaza CAIRO — The Palestinian Islamic Jihad militant group has released a new video showing an Israeli hostage who has been held in Gaza for over a year. The video shows Sasha Troufanov, likely speaking under duress, describing the harsh conditions inside Gaza, warning against military operations to free him and calling on Israelis to protest for his release. It was the first such video to be released in several weeks. It was not clear when it was filmed, but Troufanov appeared to refer to Israel’s war against Hezbollah in Lebanon and its recent exchange of fire with Iran, which occurred in October. Islamic Jihad took part in Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023 attack into Israel, in which militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took another 250 people hostage. Some 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, about a third of whom are believed to be dead. Islamic Jihad released two previous videos of Troufanov earlier this year. He turned 29 on Monday, marking his second birthday in captivity. His mother, grandmother and girlfriend were also taken captive, but they were released during a November 2023 cease-fire. His father was killed in the Oct. 7 attack. The U.S., Egypt and Qatar have spent most of this year trying to broker a cease-fire and the release of the remaining hostages. Hamas has said it will only release the remaining hostages in return for a lasting cease-fire, the full withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza and the release of Palestinian prisoners. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to retain Israeli control over parts of Gaza and to continue the war until 'total victory' over Hamas and the return of the remaining captives. At least 6 dead and 15 wounded in an Israeli strike south of Beirut BEIRUT — An Israeli airstrike on an apartment building in the town of Aramoun, just south of Beirut, killed at least six people and wounded 15 others Wednesday, Lebanon’s Health Ministry said. The state-run National News Agency reported that there were children missing after the strike and it wasn't clear if they are under the rubble or were transferred to a hospital. There was no warning issued before the strike, and it was not clear what the target was. There was no immediate statement from the Israeli military. Also Wednesday morning, the Israeli military struck several sites in Beirut’s southern suburbs, an area known as Dahiyeh, after issuing evacuation warnings. It said the strikes were targeting 'Hezbollah facilities and interests.' There were no immediate reports of casualties. Israeli forces and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah have been clashing since Oct. 8, 2023, when Hezbollah began launching rockets across the border in support of its ally, Hamas, in Gaza. The conflict escalated beginning in mid-September. Israel has launched a widespread aerial bombardment of Lebanon and a ground invasion that it said is intended to push Hezbollah back from the border. 3 young siblings were killed in an Israeli strike in northern Gaza, Palestinian medics say DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — Palestinian medics say an Israeli strike on a home in northern Gaza killed three siblings aged 6 and under. They were among at least six people killed in Israeli strikes on Tuesday in the war-ravaged territory, where Israel has been at war with Hamas for more than 13 months. The Gaza Health Ministry’s emergency service says the three children were killed in a strike on a home near a clinic in the urban Jabaliya refugee camp, where Israel has been waging an offensive for over a month. In the central city of Deir al-Balah, a strike hit a tent in the western side of the city, killing at least two people, including a 15-year-old boy, Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital said. Another strike on a tent in the built-up Nuseirat refugee camp killed a man, the hospital said. An Associated Press journalist counted the three bodies at the hospital. Israel says it only targets militants and tries to avoid harming civilians. It accuses Hamas militants of hiding among civilians in homes and shelters. The military rarely comments on individual strikes, which often kill women and children. The war began when Hamas-led militants stormed into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking another 250 people hostage. Around 100 captives are still inside Gaza, a third of whom are believed to be dead. Israel’s retaliatory offensive has killed over 43,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities. They do not distinguish between militants and civilians in their count but say women and children make up more than half of those killed. US forces conduct strikes in Syria against Iranian-aligned militia groups WASHINGTON — U.S. forces conducted strikes in Syria against Iranian-aligned militia groups for a second day in a row Tuesday in response to further attacks on U.S. personnel, U.S. Central Command said late Tuesday. In the latest retaliatory strikes, U.S. forces hit a weapons storage and logistics facility after militia groups launched a rocket attack on U.S. personnel at Patrol Base Shaddadi in eastern Syria. Earlier Tuesday, Pentagon press secretary Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said that over the weekend the militias had also targeted U.S. personnel with a drone attack and indirect fire at another base, Green Village, where U.S. troops are operating — which prompted the U.S. to strike nine militia targets on Monday in self-defense. There are about 900 U.S. troops deployed in Syria. No U.S. troops were wounded in either attack. ___ For more Middle East news: https://apnews.com/hub/middle-east	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-hezbollah-mideast-latest-13-november-2024-2e7065731020a76e89b42643bdfcb9ae	2024-11-13T00:54:03-08:00	
US says it intends to shore up support for Ukraine until Trump takes office	BRUSSELS (AP) — President Joe Biden intends to bolster U.S. military support to Ukraine in the final months of his administration, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Wednesday, after Russia launched a sophisticated missile and drone attack on Kyiv. The U.S. will 'continue to shore up everything we’re doing for Ukraine to make sure that it can effectively defend itself against this Russian aggression,' Blinken told reporters at NATO headquarters, before planned meetings with allied envoys and Ukrainian officials. Blinken warned that North Korea’s decision to send its troops into combat operations alongside Russian forces 'demands and will get a firm response.' He didn't elaborate. U.S., South Korean and Ukrainian intelligence assessments say up to 12,000 North Korean combat troops are being sent to the war. The bulk of those troops were expected to be deployed in Russia’s Kursk region where Ukrainian troops have seized a swathe of territory. Russia’s early morning missile and drone attack was the first on Kyiv in 73 days. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said that Russia is intensifying its strikes, apparently in an effort to discourage Ukrainians from continuing the war, which is approaching its 1,000-day milestone. Russia appears to be pressing its advantage as doubt swirls about how Washington might change policy on the war after Donald Trump takes office as U.S. president in January. The U.S. is the biggest provider of military help to Ukraine. Trump has slammed the Biden administration for giving Kyiv tens of billions of dollars in aid and has promised to quickly end the conflict. Ukraine’s international backers fear that any rushed settlement would mostly benefit Russian President Vladimir Putin. ___ Follow the AP’s coverage of the war at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine	https://apnews.com/article/nato-ukraine-russia-us-biden-blinken-a25d225efa5b06eab62d903b0ba08afc	2024-11-13T00:07:47-08:00	
Biden is sending aid to help Ukraine keep fighting next year, Blinken says	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — The Biden administration is determined in its final months to help ensure that Ukraine can keep fighting off Russia's full-scale invasion next year, sending it as much aid as possible so that it might hold Russian forces at bay and possess a strong hand in any potential peace negotiations, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Wednesday. 'President Biden has committed to making sure that every dollar we have at our disposal will be pushed out the door between now and Jan. 20,' when president-elect Donald Trump is due to be sworn in, Blinken said. NATO countries must focus their efforts on 'ensuring that Ukraine has the money, munitions and mobilized forces to fight effectively in 2025, or to be able to negotiate a peace from a position of strength,' Blinken said during a visit to Brussels. The U.S. will 'adapt and adjust' with the latest equipment it is sending, Blinken said, without providing details. The almost three-year war has shown no signs of winding down. Russia attacked the Ukrainian capital Kyiv with a sophisticated combination of missiles and drones for the first time in 73 days on Wednesday. That came a day after the Pentagon said most of the North Korean troops sent to help Moscow's war effort are fighting to drive Ukraine's army off Russian soil in the Kursk border region. Ukraine is also straining to hold back a monthslong Russian onslaught in the eastern Donetsk region. Political uncertainty over how a U.S. administration under Trump will change Washington’s policy on the war is a key new factor in the conflict. U.S. military aid is vital for Ukraine, but Trump has signaled that he doesn’t want to keep giving tens of billions of dollars to Kyiv. Air raid warnings blared for hours as Russia targeted eight regions of Ukraine on Wednesday, firing six ballistic and cruise missiles and 90 drones, the Ukrainian air force said. Air defenses downed four missiles and 37 drones, and another 47 drones were stopped by electronic jamming, the statement said. The damage was being assessed. The air assault came as most of the more than 10,000 North Korean troops sent by Pyongyang to help Moscow in the war are engaged in combat in Russia's Kursk border region, according to the Pentagon. A Ukrainian army incursion into Kursk three months ago has succeeded in holding a broad area of land and has embarrassed the Kremlin. Russia’s military has trained the North Korean soldiers in artillery, drone skills and basic infantry operations, including trench clearing, Pentagon deputy spokesperson Vedant Patel told a briefing Tuesday. The cooperation faces challenges, according to the Pentagon, including how to achieve military interoperability and overcoming the language barrier. Kyiv officials say that Russia has deployed around 50,000 troops to Kursk in a bid to dislodge the Ukrainians. Russia has in recent months been assembling forces for a counteroffensive in Kursk, according to the Institute for the Study of War think tank, though the timescale of the operation isn't known. ___ Lorne Cook reported from Brussels. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-kyiv-attack-276e38b9e841f92032909f08456743f9	2024-11-12T23:16:55-08:00	
Trump's defense choice stuns the Pentagon, raises questions about the Fox News host's experience	WASHINGTON (AP) — President-elect Donald Trump stunned the Pentagon and the broader defense world by nominating Fox News host Pete Hegseth to serve as his defense secretary, tapping someone largely inexperienced and untested on the global stage to take over the world's largest and most powerful military. The news was met with bewilderment and wide-eyed worry among many in Washington, as Trump passed on a number of established national security heavy-hitters and chose an Army National Guard captain who is well-known in conservative circles as a co-host of Fox News Channel’s 'Fox &amp; Friends Weekend.' While some Republican lawmakers had a muted response to the announcement, others called his combat experience an asset or said he was 'tremendously capable.' Hegseth's choice could bring sweeping changes to the military, as he has made it clear on his show and in interviews that, like Trump, he is stridently opposed to 'woke' programs that promote equity and inclusion. He's also questioned the role of women in combat and advocated pardoning service members charged with war crimes. In June, at a rally in Las Vegas, Trump encouraged his supporters to buy Hegseth’s book after vowing that if he won: 'The woke stuff will be gone within a period of 24 hours. I can tell you.' A staunch conservative who embraces Trump's 'America First' policies, the 44-year-old Hegseth has pushed for making the military more lethal. During an interview on 'The Shawn Ryan Show' podcast, he said allowing women to serve in combat hurts that effort. 'Everything about men and women serving together makes the situation more complicated, and complication in combat, that means casualties are worse,' Hegseth said. And while he said diversity in the military is a strength, he said it was because minority and white men 'can perform similarly' but the same isn't true for women. While Trump lauded Hegseth as 'tough, smart and a true believer in America First,' others were quick to point to the TV personality's lack of experience, with some suggesting he could be Pentagon chief in name only as the Trump White House runs the department. A number of other names floated as possible defense choices had included Rep. Mike Rogers of Alabama, the GOP chairman of the House Armed Services Committee; retired Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg; Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa; and Robert Wilkie, a former Pentagon official who was head of Veterans Affairs in Trump's first term. 'There is reason for concern that this is not a person who is a serious enough policymaker, serious enough policy implementer, to do a successful job,' said Rep. Adam Smith of Washington, the ranking Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee. Mark Cancian, a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said Hegseth's lack of senior national security experience makes it more difficult to get Senate confirmation. 'I think Trump was tired of fighting with his secretaries of defense and picked one who would be loyal to him,' Cancian said. Military officials said the choice came out of the blue. A senior military officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the media, said Hegseth's selection is raising concerns about whether he has the practical experience to manage a large department with an enormous budget. The Defense Department has a budget exceeding $800 billion, with about 1.3 million active-duty troops and another 1.4 million in the National Guard, Reserves and civilian employees based worldwide. If confirmed, Hegseth would face a daunting array of global crises, from the wars in the Middle East and Ukraine and the expanding alliance between Russia and North Korea to the growing competition with China. There is also the need to upgrade the complex U.S. missile and nuclear defense apparatus and ensure the defense industry can keep up with America's need for weapons systems. Smith said that while Hegseth's combat experience is a plus, running the Pentagon requires a lot of other skill sets, and his nomination will need some time for consideration. 'What’s your plan? What are you going to do? ... How can you assure us that that lack of experience, you know, isn’t going to make it impossible for you to do the job?' Smith said. 'I think those are questions that need to be answered over the next couple of months.' Even some Republicans in the Senate — who would vote on his nomination — had a subdued response. North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis called the choice 'interesting,' and Indiana Sen. Todd Young, who served in the Marine Corps, said, 'I don’t know much about his background or his vision, so I look forward to learning more.' North Dakota Sen. John Hoeven said he’s not surprised that Trump chose Hegseth because Trump is 'close to him and likes him and trusts him.' 'The guy’s obviously tremendously capable, a great communicator,' Hoeven said. 'I look forward to getting to know him better.' House Speaker Mike Johnson said Hegseth brings a lot to the table and will be 'reform-minded in the areas that need reform.' Hegseth has been a contributor since 2014 for Fox News, developing a friendship with Trump, who made regular appearances on his show. He is the author of 'The War on Warriors: Behind the Betrayal of the Men Who Keep Us Free.' 'With Pete at the helm, America’s enemies are on notice — Our Military will be Great Again, and America will Never Back Down,' Trump said in a statement. 'Nobody fights harder for the Troops, and Pete will be a courageous and patriotic champion of our ‘Peace through Strength’ policy.' ___ Associated Press writers Lisa Mascaro, Mary Clare Jalonick and Farnoush Amiri in Washington and Jill Colvin in New York contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/trump-hegseth-defense-secretary-pentagon-2d8030921ecef933778cf92afd40ec72	2024-11-12T20:27:18-08:00	
In Africa, meager expectations and some hopes for a second Trump presidency	ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) — African leaders may have been quick to congratulate Donald Trump on his election, professing a desire for mutually beneficial partnerships, but there are meager expectations that his presidency will change things for this continent of over 1.4 billion people. In the wake of Trump's win, Kenya's William Ruto said his country 'stands ready' to deepen its ties with Washington. Nigeria's Bola Tinubu spoke of a second Trump administration ushering in an era of 'earnest, beneficial, and reciprocal' cooperation. Still, observers say African countries — once described by Trump as 'shithole countries' — are definitely not going to be high on his to-do list. Low priority or not even a concern? U.S. foreign policy has not made Africa a priority for a long while — beyond seeing the continent through the lens of countering rivals such as Russia and China, said Charles Ray, chair of the Foreign Policy Research Institute’s Africa Program. President Joe Biden talked about Africa as a key partner, said Ray, who served as the U.S. ambassador to Zimbabwe between 2009 and 2012. But not much action followed those words. Africa 'will be at the very bottom of (Trump's) list of priorities' and any U.S. action on the continent would likely be driven by his 'transactional, ego-driven leadership style,' Ray added. Many experts agree, citing Trump’s 'America First' strategy. Murithi Mutiga, program director for Africa at the Crisis Group, says the president-elect is 'a committed isolationist and clearly wants to pull back' on various fronts across the world. Some say there are deals to be made, even in Africa J. Peter Pham, Trump's former special envoy to Africa's Great Lakes and Sahel regions, says the next Trump presidency may look for a 'win-win' situation in Africa. That could include a renewal of the African Growth and Opportunity Act, which grants eligible African countries duty-free access to U.S. markets, Pham said during a Voice of America broadcast. However, U.S. lawmakers have been asking questions about whether African countries are complying with conditions under the program — or if they are undermining U.S. foreign policy interests and national security, Pham said. South Africa, one of the biggest beneficiaries of the program, was accused by U.S. Ambassador Reuben Brigety in 2023 of providing weapons and ammunition to Russia for its war in Ukraine and its professed neutral stance on the war was brought into question. Basically, you don't 'kick America in the teeth' in ways that raise questions about compliance with such deals, Pham said. Those that do 'will be treated as pariahs,' said Ray, with the Foreign Policy Research Institute. Africa's myriad health and other crises, abortion and LGBTQ+ rights The top concern is that the next Trump presidency will cut funding. In many parts of Africa, such cuts could be critical for millions of girls and young women whose reproductive health and choices are supported heavily by U.S.-funded programs. 'The situation is already bad for girls (and) it will turn into a disaster without these services,' said Valentine Damitoni, a mother at 18. She regularly visits a local clinic in Zimbabwe’s capital of Harare to receive a contraceptive under a U.S.-funded program that allows her to return to school without fears of falling pregnant again. Max Primorac, a former acting deputy administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development — one of Africa’s biggest development aid donors — criticized some of the agency's programs in Project 2025, a 900-page blueprint proposed by the conservative-leaning Heritage Foundation to reshape the federal government. In particular, Primorac criticized USAID programs that 'promote abortion, climate extremism and interventions against perceived systematic racism.' The document is said to align closely with Trump’s vision — though he has distanced himself from it. Kiron Skinner, the head of policy planning at the U.S. State Department during Trump’s first term in office, recommends in the document that in Africa, America should 'focus on core security, economic, and human rights' rather than impose 'radical abortion and pro-LGBT initiatives.' New realignments in Africa, turning to Russia and China In Africa's volatile Sahel region, soldiers are increasingly booting out elected presidents and riding anti-Western sentiments to sever ties with longstanding allies like the United States and France — while turning to a new friend: Russia. China, which casts infrastructural loans to African countries as mutually beneficial cooperation, rarely interferes in internal politics of the recipients countries. Russia, the continent’s biggest arms supplier, is often in bed with Africa's military juntas. Both countries, as indeed America, have shown huge interest in Africa’s rich mineral resources. Mutiga, of the Crisis Group, says 'the problem historically has been that the U.S. and the West viewed Africa as a problem' to be solved. China and others 'saw it as an opportunity to be grasped.' Will Trump backpedal on Biden's pledges? The Biden administration announced last December that it had invested at least $22 billion in Africa and promised to do more. Trump, during his first term, continuously sought to slash foreign affairs funding, sometimes as much as 30%. Analysts are concerned about whether key U.S. projects in health, security and development would be implemented under Trump — especially at a time of worsening hunger and resurgent threats to democracy in Africa. For many ordinary Africans, Trump is just a distant leader who can't do much about their everyday problems. 'Trump ... is not going to save us from hunger caused by our government,' said Isah Mohammed, a fruit seller in Nigeria's capital, Abuja. Africa's flashpoints, from Western Sahara to Somalia In Morocco, many rejoiced after Trump’s win, hoping his return to office would help the North African country further its push to win global recognition for its sovereignty over the disputed Western Sahara. 'The return of the friend of Morocco to the White House,' proclaimed the country's Assabah newspaper in its editorial. As part of a larger deal that included Morocco normalizing its ties with Israel, Trump shifted longstanding U.S. policy and recognized Morocco’s sovereignty claims before leaving office in 2020. Biden has not reversed that decision — but has also not advanced the Trump administration’s promise to build a consulate in the disputed territory. The stability in the Horn of Africa is increasingly threatened by the raging war in Sudan and growing tensions between Somalia and Ethiopia over the latter’s business deal with Somalia’s breakaway region Somaliland. Trump will likely cut funding to Somalia and engage more with Somaliland, predicts Rashid Abdi, an analyst at the Nairobi-based Sahan Research think tank. What's stopping Africa's progress? Maybe Africa itself The G20, the group of the world’s leading economies, welcomed the African Union as a permanent member last year — a powerful acknowledgement of the continent's more than 50 countries and something Biden had said was 'a long time in coming.' But despite that step on the global stage, observers say the union and its leaders have not lived up to expectations, failing to articulate their interests and table their demands as a united front. 'The question is often, what will Washington do, but, really, what is Africa’s interest?' said Mutiga, with the Crisis Group. 'We’re in an age of transactional global relations and unless Africa can engage in a way that articulates its own interests, America’s (interests in Africa) will continue to be determined by geopolitical competition with its rivals,' he said. ___ Associated Press reporters Farai Mutsaka in Harare, Zimbabwe, and Sam Metz in Rabat, Morocco, contributed to this report. ___ Follow AP’s Africa coverage at: https://apnews.com/hub/africa	https://apnews.com/article/trump-africa-us-foreign-policy-947951d341e0fb0cca66308557991cae	2024-11-12T20:05:36-08:00	
Children brought from Gaza to heal from war wounds become caught in another war, in Lebanon	BEIRUT (AP) — When Zarifa Nawfal’s family arrived in Beirut for her wounded daughter’s surgery, one of the first things she wanted to do was go to the sea. The Mediterranean had been a constant companion at their home in Gaza before the war. 'The moment I smelled the sea, I felt at peace inside — as if I were in Gaza,' she said. But soon their place of refuge reminded her of home in far more distressing ways. Nawfal’s 7-year-old daughter, Halima Abou Yassine, is one of a dozen severely wounded Palestinian children brought to Lebanon this year for treatment through a program launched by a British-Palestinian surgeon, Dr. Ghassan Abu Sitta. But months after their arrival, Lebanon is itself embroiled in a war some fear will end in Gaza-like destruction. In February, Nawfal was staying with her five children and her mother in an apartment in central Gaza. They had been displaced from their home in the north and Nawfal’s husband was missing, likely dead. The children were filling water containers outside when two missiles struck, Nawfal said. She rushed outside and found Halima, the youngest, lying in the street, her skull cracked open, her brain exposed. Through her shock, Nawfal said, 'I was relieved that her body was in one piece.' In Gaza, blasts often ripped people apart, leaving their loved ones without even a body to bury. Halima’s brother was unconscious next to her. He was quickly revived at the hospital. But staff at Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital confirmed Nawfal’s fears, she said: Halima was dead. Her small body was placed in the morgue. But as the family was preparing to bury her, the little girl’s uncle noticed faint signs of life, the family said. Officials at Al-Aqsa hospital could not be reached to confirm the account. But Abu Sitta, who has worked in several Gaza hospitals during the war, said in the chaotic situation it was not uncommon for patients to be misidentified as dead because normal protocols for emergency room examinations were often abandoned. 'Because of the sheer number of cases that would come in with each air raid ... the ambulance staff would take to the morgue immediately those who they thought were dead,' he said. In the days after her daughter was determined to be alive, Nawfal stayed with her, manually pumping oxygen into her lungs. After a week, the little girl began to breathe on her own. Finally, she woke up. 'Some of the doctors cried and said this is a miracle,' Nawfal said. But they were unable to do more than keep the little girl alive. Her skull was still gaping open, a shard of bone missing. Her brain was beset by infection. The family was evacuated to Egypt in May. In July, they boarded a plane for Lebanon. An unlikely refuge The first of the wounded Palestinian children arrived in Lebanon in May. Five-year-old Adam Afana had nearly lost his left arm in a blast that killed his father and sister. His arm was paralyzed and he needed a complex surgery to correct the nerve damage. At the time, Lebanon was already embroiled in a low-simmering conflict between Israel and Hezbollah. The Lebanese militant group began firing rockets across the border into Israel in support of its ally, Hamas, on Oct. 8, 2023, a day after Palestinian militants staged the deadly surprise incursion into southern Israel that sparked the ongoing war in Gaza. Israel responded with shelling and airstrikes. For months, the conflict in Lebanon was mainly confined to the border area, far from Beirut. Abu Sitta said he chose Lebanon for the wounded children's treatment because the Mediterranean country has specialists with wide experience treating war injuries. Lebanon has been through its share of conflicts, including a 15-year civil war that ended in 1990 and a brutal monthlong war between Israel and Hezbollah in 2006, as well as spillover effects from other regional conflicts. 'Even after the end of the wars (in Lebanon), the wounded from Iraq and Syria would come here for that kind of complex and multistage treatment,' Abu Sitta said. The war that followed them In July, Halima underwent successful surgery to repair her skull at the American University of Beirut Medical Center. Nawfal said her daughter has lingering memory problems but is improving with therapy. A chipper, happy-go-lucky child, Halima thrived in Beirut. She swam in the hotel pool, loved to color and played with the other children from Gaza. She walked with her siblings to pick out fruit at the neighborhood produce stand, a straw hat covering the scar on the back of her head. In mid-September, Israel launched an offensive against Hezbollah. It pummeled wide swathes of Lebanon with airstrikes, including Beirut’s southern suburbs and some sites within the city center. The children quickly snapped back into wartime habits. They cracked open the balcony's sliding glass doors to prevent the glass shattering from the pressure of a blast and began sleeping in the central sitting room in the family’s hotel suite, away from windows. Nawfal said some organizations offered to evacuate the family from Lebanon to continue treatment elsewhere, but she 'completely refused.' 'Lebanon isn’t just another Arab country or a country we came to for treatment — Lebanon is a sister to Gaza,' she said. 'We are like two souls in one body. ... We live or die together.' Adam Afana's uncle, Eid Afana, said the escalation in Lebanon 'reminds us of the beginning of the war in Gaza.' Afana said the sound of airstrikes frightened Adam, who felt the war was pursuing them. 'What we hope for Lebanon is that what happened in Gaza won’t happen here — that the beginning and the ending won’t both be the same,' Afana said. ‘All wars are waged on children’ The Ghassan Abu Sitta Fund halted bringing wounded Palestinian children to Lebanon but continues to treat the existing patients — with some challenges. Since arriving in Beirut, Adam has undergone a procedure to clear infection from his bones, a neurosurgery and regular physiotherapy sessions. With effort, he can now slightly clench his hand. But the final operation — a muscle transfer and surgery to repair the damaged nerves to his arm — is on hold. 'There’s just a handful of people who specialize in this globally, and we were expecting one of them to come to Lebanon,' Abu Sitta said. The trip has been delayed by the escalation in Lebanon. When he first launched the program, Abu Sitta hoped to treat 50 Palestinian children from Gaza at any given time. Unable to bring more patients in, the team is turning its resources to treating Lebanese children. The numbers of wounded Lebanese children are still far lower than in Gaza. As of last week, Lebanon’s Ministry of Public Health said 192 children had been killed and at least 1,255 wounded since October 2023. In Gaza, more than 13,000 children have been killed and thousands more have been wounded, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. Abu Sitta said the wounds of children in Lebanon are 'identical to the injuries of Palestinian children from Gaza.' Most were wounded while at home. They suffered 'crush injuries to the limbs, blast injuries to the face' and often 'multiple members of the family killed at the same time,' he said. 'As in Gaza, this war takes its toll on children,' he said. 'All wars are waged on children.'	https://apnews.com/article/lebanon-gaza-children-ghassan-abu-sitta-7ef6100b0f6bea94b1a939676ac09d34	2024-11-12T20:04:33-08:00	
Public mourns 35 killed in attack at sports complex in southern Chinese city	ZHUHAI, China (AP) — Members of the public paid their respects Wednesday to people killed by a driver who rammed into people exercising a sports complex in southern China, as the country mourned, but little information was available about the suspect or the victims in the attack. The crash Monday night in Zhuhai killed 35 people and severely injured 43 others, and the driver was detained as he was trying to escape. Authorities said the 62-year-old man with the surname Fan was upset over his divorce settlement. Members of the public had started bringing flowers in honor of the victims Tuesday night and continued into Wednesday. There was a light police presence in the morning at the Zhuhai sports complex, which was closed until further notice, but the number of officers increased as the morning passed. While police allowed people to leave bouquets of flowers in memory of the dead just outside the entrance of the sports complex, volunteers then quickly moved the flowers inside to the sports center. 'May there be no thugs in heaven,' said the message on one bouquet. 'Good deeds will be rewarded and evil deeds will be punished.' The attack on occurred on the eve of the Zhuhai Airshow, an aviation exhibition sponsored by the People's Liberation Army that is held every two years. China authorities often make extra efforts to tightly control information around major or sensitive events like the airshow. Censors also take extra care around major catastrophes or violence, often censoring eyewitness accounts. Clear information on the death and injury toll was not available for almost 24 hours after the attack. Videos were quickly censored inside China, though they circulated outside the Great Firewall. They were posted by Teacher Li, an artist turned dissident who runs a X account with 1.7 million followers that posts crowdsourced videos about news in China. Articles from Chinese media featuring interviews with survivors were quickly taken down Monday and Tuesday. The news that trended about the attack was largely based on official statements from authorities. Police said their preliminary investigation found Fan was dissatisfied with the split of financial assets in his divorce. Beyond that description, further information was not available on his divorce or alleged motive. Chinese leader Xi Jinping called for the 'strict' punishment of the perpetrator according to law, in a statement Tuesday evening. He also called on all local governments 'to strengthen prevention and control of risks at the source, strictly prevent extreme cases from occurring, and to resolve conflicts and disputes in a timely manner,' according to the official Xinhua news agency. ___ Wu reported from Bangkok.

Guns smuggled from the US are blamed for a surge in killings on more Caribbean islands	SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) — Dozens of soldiers and police fanned out across a neighborhood on a recent night in the Turks &amp; Caicos Islands just days after the archipelago reported a record 40 killings this year. They were on the hunt for criminals and illegal weapons fueling a surge of violence across the Caribbean as authorities struggle to control a stream of firearms smuggled in from the U.S. Half an hour into the Oct. 30 operation, one driver tried to run authorities off the road as he tossed a handgun into the bushes. 'Rest assured, we remain committed to disrupting the flow of illicit guns,' Police Superintendent Jason James said hours later. But the flow is too strong, with illegal firearms blamed for an increase or a record number of killings in a growing number of Caribbean islands this year, including Trinidad and Tobago and the Bahamas. No Caribbean nation manufactures firearms or ammunition or imports them on a large scale, but they account for half of the world’s top 10 highest national murder rates, according to a statement from U.S. Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut. In a letter sent to U.S. legislators in late September, New York’s attorney general and 13 other colleagues across the U.S. demanded new measures to stop the flow of guns, noting that 90% of weapons used in the Caribbean were bought in the U.S. and smuggled into the region. 'American-made guns are flowing into Caribbean nations and communities and fueling violence, chaos, and senseless tragedies throughout the region,' wrote New York Attorney General Letitia James. In mid-2023, the U.S. government appointed its first coordinator for Caribbean firearms prosecutions to help curb weapon smuggling from the U.S. to the region, with the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives already tracing firearms seized in the Caribbean. Last year, 266 firearms seized in the Bahamas were submitted to ATF, along with 234 firearms from Jamaica, 162 from the Dominican Republic and 143 from Trinidad and Tobago, according to the agency’s most recent data. The majority are handguns, followed by semiautomatic pistols. The information gleaned from recovered weapons can help authorities in the U.S. determine where and when they were bought, triggering a domestic firearms trafficking investigation. But it’s a struggle to stop the flow of weapons, with smugglers disassembling them and hiding their parts in sea-bound containers. 'As much as you try to harden the infrastructure at the official ports, it is essentially like trying to plug a sift,' said Michael Jones, executive director of the Implementation Agency for Crime and Security at Caricom, a Caribbean trade bloc. Brazen killings Homicides are not the only thing rising across parts of the Caribbean. There’s an increase in privately made firearms using 3D printers, and gunmen are using higher caliber weapons and becoming more brazen, with younger and younger people committing crimes, Jones said. Killings are now occurring during the day, and not necessarily via a drive-by shooting, he said. 'You have some who are so bold as to walk up to an individual, put the gun to their head, and walk away,' he said. Jones said gangs are franchising across the region, with gunmen sometimes traveling to a certain island to commit the crime and then leaving. Gangs also are preying on young people because they lack opportunities, Jones said. 'Even now, there are some countries that will tell you they don’t have a gang problem,' he said. The victims On a recent afternoon in late October, a 42-year-old employee with Trinidad and Tobago’s Forestry Division was fatally shot while in a car near his brother’s house. He was one of six people killed in the span of 48 hours, raising the death toll in the twin-island nation of 1.4 million people to 518 compared with 468 killings last year. The sister island of Tobago alone reported a record 20 killings — in mid-August — and still counting. During a recent budget presentation, Prime Minister Keith Rowley urged lawmakers to draft a bill to ban assault weapons and high-powered rifles. Experts say many killings in the Caribbean are a result of gang-on-gang violence, but civilians are increasingly getting caught in the crossfire. 'The proliferation of privately made rifles and semi-automatic pistols, combined with the circulation of conversion devices, increases the likelihood that significantly more rounds will be fired during criminal shootings, which may in turn increase the risk of multiple injuries, including among bystanders,' warned a June report by Caricom’s Impacs, the Small Arms Survey and others. One of those bystanders was a 4-year-old boy shot in the leg when gunfire erupted outside his preschool in Trinidad in late September. The bullet fractured one of his bones. In the Bahamas, a man holding his 8-month-old baby was shot and killed in early October as he stepped out of his car, where another 6-year-old child was sitting. Both children were unharmed. It was the 90th slaying of the year for the Bahamas, which so far has reported a 23% increase in killings compared with last year. Overall crime is down, though, according to government statistics. Jamaica, meanwhile, has one of the world’s highest homicide rates among countries with reliable statistics: 53.3 per 100,000 people. As of Nov. 2 police statistics show 960 people were reported killed, a nearly 20% drop from last year and far from a record 1,683 homicides reported in 2009, but violence persists on the island of 2.8 million people, 'It is of grave concern to us,' Prime Minister Andrew Holness said at a press conference in November about large-scale shootings. In late October, five men were killed at a soccer game in a Kingston neighborhood that previously struggled with gang violence. It was the island’s latest massacre. In a visit to the neighborhood, Holness noted police have reduced the number of gangs from almost 600 to 150. While Jamaica has passed anti-gang legislation to crack down on violence, the Turks &amp; Caicos Islands approved a law in early October that allows authorities to offer immunity or reduced sentences to those who provide key information about a crime. Police in Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago and the Turks &amp; Caicos Islands did not respond to repeated messages for comment. ‘We’re asking the US to do more' Most of the firearms smuggled into the Caribbean come from Florida, followed by Georgia and Texas. They usually are shipped directly to an island, although sometimes they first go through a port in Jamaica or the Bahamas. Firearms have been found inside items ranging from cars to washing machines. 'It’s a big problem,' said James Sutton, police commissioner for St. Kitts and Nevis. 'We’re asking the U.S. to do more.' The twin-island nation has reported at least 27 homicides, the vast majority committed with guns. It’s creeping close to a record 32 killings in 2016. Haiti remains the Caribbean nation hardest hit by smuggled weapons that feed gangs controlling 85% of the capital of Port-au-Prince. 'Despite the strengthening of the arms embargo measures, arms trafficking continues unabated,' stated a U.N. Security Council report released in late October. 'Gangs have been increasingly procuring larger caliber weapons, resulting in more damage and a posing greater challenge to the police and the (U.N.-backed) mission.' The report said trafficking from the U.S. to Haiti is not a sophisticated process, noting there are numerous networks often based on family or social connections and that the 'vast majority' of the 200 containers heading from South Florida to Haiti every week are not inspected. 'Despite being brought into the country in small quantities, this recurrent ‘ant trafficking’ quickly builds up, leaving the country awash with weapons,' the report said.	https://apnews.com/article/caribbean-turks-caicos-gun-violence-4bc996c17d956b7c2f3809326b703f77	2024-11-12T19:26:45-08:00	
A diminished Biden heads to APEC summit in Peru, overshadowed by China's Xi	LIMA, Peru (AP) — If things had gone differently last week, U.S. President Joe Biden could have arrived at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Peru on Thursday projecting confidence and pledging his successor’s cooperation with eager Latin American partners. No longer. Just as in 2016, the last time that Peru’s capital Lima hosted APEC, Donald Trump’s election victory has pulled the rug out from under a lame-duck Democrat at the high-profile summit attended by over a dozen world leaders. The renewed prospect of Trump’s 'America First' doctrine hampers Biden’s ability to reinforce the United States’ profile on his first presidential trip to South America, experts say, leaving China and its leader, Xi Jinping, to grab the limelight in America’s proverbial backyard. President Xi’s first order of business in Peru is inaugurating a $1.3 billion megaport that will put China’s regional influence on stark display. Total investment is expected to top $3.5 billion over the next decade. 'This isn’t the way the U.S. had hoped to participate in the summit,' said Margaret Myers, the director of the China and Latin America program at the Inter-American Dialogue, a Washington policy group. 'All eyes are going to be on the port, what Xi says about it and how he articulates relations across the Pacific.' With the U.S. seemingly headed back toward isolationism under Trump, 'China will be seen as the alternative,' Myers added. Sitting 60 kilometers (37 miles) northeast of Lima, the Chancay megaport — once a serene fishing village — is perhaps the clearest sign of Latin America's reorientation. The Chinese shipping and logistics giant Cosco holds a 60% stake in the project it developed with Peruvian partner, Volcan. 'With this port, we’re looking at the entire Pacific coast, from the United States and Canada all the way to Chile,' Peruvian Foreign Minister Elmer Schialer told The Associated Press in his office on Monday. 'The shipping business is being transformed.' Peruvian Economy Minister José Arista said in June during a visit to China that the country’s neighbors — Brazil, Colombia, Chile — are 'making constant trips to and from to see how they can modify their supply chain to use this port,' which will cut shipping time to Beijing by 10 days. China’s trade with the region ballooned 35-fold from 2000 to 2022, reaching nearly $500 billion, according to data from the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean. Most of the region's exports came from South America, and were concentrated in five products: soybeans, copper and iron ore, oil and copper cathodes. At the same time, China’s diplomatic engagement in the region has become more effective, with Xi visiting 11 Latin American countries since becoming president, according to Xinhua, China’s main state news agency. Brazil, host of the G20 summit, and Peru will bestow the rare honor of a full state visit to Xi this month, but not to Biden. The misguided notion that Latin America must choose between its two largest trading partners is 'a strategic defeat' for the U.S., said Eric Farnsworth, vice president at the Washington-based Council of the Americas. 'The idea that China is somehow a better partner is increasingly being heard around the region and I think Xi wants to solidify that and amplify that,' Farnsworth said. Roughly a decade after China poured billions of dollars into building power plants, roads, airports and other infrastructure that saddled some developing countries with unserviceable debt, few expect Beijing to direct more massive loans to Latin America through its Belt and Road Initiative. But deeper cooperation on other infrastructure is possible, particularly renewable energy and telecommunications, said the Boston University bulletin. The U.S. has appealed to Latin American governments to reject telecoms investment, particularly opposing Huawei, the Chinese tech giant that it argues could open the door to Chinese government spying. Similarly, U.S. officials have raised concerns over the Chancay port’s possible dual-use by Beijing’s navy in the Pacific — a prospect dismissed by Chinese officials. China 'is working to exploit insecurity in our hemisphere,' said U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin at the Southern Command headquarters in Florida this week, adding that the Asian giant is leveraging the need for investment in the Americas to advance its 'malign agenda.' Despite its objections to Chinese influence, the U.S. hasn’t shown the ability or willingness to build infrastructure like Chancay's megaport, experts note. Even when the U.S. government has worked to ensure competitive bidding in Latin American massive public works projects, American companies have refrained from participating, said Benjamin Gedan, director of the Wilson Center’s Latin America Program. A Kamala Harris administration wouldn’t have changed that, but a Democratic victory would have enabled Biden to speak in Lima with authority about U.S. collaboration to come, such as building regional supply chains, Gedan said. In sharp contrast to Biden’s alliance-building approach, Trump has vowed to protect American interests and promised more of the same unilateralist action the world saw in his first term, when he staked out a combative stance against foreign competitors and deepened the U.S. trade war with China. In 2022, Biden launched the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework to help integrate economies of the region and enable the U.S. to counterbalance China. But last year, on the campaign trail, Trump said he would kill the trade pact if he were to win the 2024 election and return to the White House — in the same way he pulled the U.S. from the Trans-Pacific Partnership immediately after taking office in 2017. In the years since, U.S. clout in South America has diminished while China’s has grown, said Farnsworth, recalling how the last time Lima hosted APEC in 2016, the shock of Trump’s victory sucked the energy out of then-President Barack Obama’s delegation. Peru’s top diplomat insists that the U.S. hasn’t ceded its dominant voice guiding discussions about trade at gatherings such as APEC — and doubted that it will, even under Trump. 'I’m not sure that Trump will go against these types of multilateral contexts just because he is worried about the American people,' Schialer said. 'He knows that the U.S. is too important for the world. We have to sit down and have a nice dialogue and see how we can face these challenges together.' Yet, in the wake of Trump’s win and China’s port opening in Peru, analysts expect the hard-nosed competition between the U.S. and China to overshadow APEC this week. 'The Chinese love the idea of outmaneuvering the U.S. in its near-abroad,' Gedan said. 'Xi will luxuriate in this dynamic of being able to arrive with a big delegation, (...) to inaugurate this transformational port and suck all the air out of the room when his American counterpart is very weak politically. That is significant to China.' ___ Associated Press writer Franklin Briceño contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/biden-xi-usa-china-apec-peru-504111bb2837ceae5fba1543a70d48c4	2024-11-12T19:20:48-08:00	
Stock market today: Asian stocks dip as Wall Street momentum slows with cooling Trump trade	HONG KONG (AP) — Asian stocks on Wednesday followed Wall Street lower as momentum cooled for the torrid 'Trump trade' that swept U.S. markets following Donald Trump’s presidential victory. Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 slipped 1.1% in morning trading to 38,953.44, as wholesale inflation reached its highest level since July of last year. The corporate goods price index, which measures the price changes of goods traded in the corporate sector, rose 3.4% in October year-over-year, according to Bank of Japan data. The increase was partly attributed to the decline of the Japanese yen against the U.S. dollar. South Korea’s Kospi lost 1.5% to 2,445.90. Samsung Electronics shares fell by 2.1% in Wednesday trading, reaching their lowest level in over four years. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng dropped for a fourth day, declining 0.5% to 19,754.92. The Shanghai Composite gained 0.2% to 3,426.98. Australia’s S&amp;P/ASX 200 fell nearly 1.0% to 8,178.00. U.S. futures dropped while oil prices were higher. On Tuesday, the S&amp;P 500 slipped 0.3% to 5,983.99, a day after setting its latest all-time high. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0.9% to 43,910.98, and the Nasdaq composite fell 0.1% to 19,281.40. Stocks had been broadly rising since last week on expectations that Trump’s preference for lower tax rates and other policies may mean faster economic growth, as well as bigger U.S. government debt and higher inflation. Some areas of the market rocketed on particularly high-grade fuel, such as smaller U.S. stocks seen as benefiting the most from Trump’s 'America First' ideas. They gave back some of their big gains Tuesday, and the Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell a market-leading 1.8%. Even Tesla, which is run by Trump’s ally Elon Musk, sank. It dropped 6.1% for its first loss since before Election Day. A jump in Treasury yields also added pressure on the stock market, as trading of U.S. government bonds resumed following Monday’s Veterans Day holiday. The yield on the 10-year Treasury jumped to 4.42% on Tuesday from 4.31% late Friday, which is a notable move for the bond market. Treasury yields have been climbing sharply since September, in large part because the U.S. economy has remained much more resilient than feared. The hope is that it can continue to stay solid as the Federal Reserve continues to cut interest rates in order to keep the job market humming, now that it’s helped get inflation nearly down to its 2% target. Some of the rise in yields has also been because of Trump. He talks up tariffs and other policies that economists say could drive inflation and the U.S. government’s debt higher. That puts upward pressure on Treasury yields and could hinder the Fed’s plans to cut interest rates. While lower rates can boost the economy, they can also give inflation more fuel. The next update on inflation will arrive Wednesday, when the U.S. government will give the latest reading on prices that U.S. consumers are paying across the country. Economists expect it to show inflation accelerated to 2.6% in October from 2.4% the month before. But they’re also looking for underlying inflation trends, which ignore prices for groceries and fuel that can zigzag sharply from one month to another, to stay steady at 3.3%. In the crypto market, bitcoin soared to another record before pulling back. Trump has embraced cryptocurrencies generally and pledged to make his country the crypto capital of the world. Bitcoin got as high as $89,995, according to CoinDesk, before dipping back toward $89,500. It started the year below $43,000. In energy trading, benchmark U.S. crude gained 26 cents to $68.38 a barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, fell 31 cents to $72.20 a barrel. In currency trading, the U.S. dollar edged up to 154.75 Japanese yen from 154.51 yen. The euro cost $1.0623, down from $1.0625. ___ AP Business Writer Stan Choe contributed.	https://apnews.com/article/stock-market-inflation-trump-bitcoin-china-394a0f6b3c08e07d014590e4835372f1	2024-11-12T19:10:13-08:00	
Welcome to China’s underground raves, from street techno to quotes from Chairman Mao	CHANGCHUN, China (AP) — Crouch through the small metal door and walk down the dark tunnel, and even before you step into the abandoned air raid shelter, the air reverberates with pounding techno beats. Young Chinese holding booze and cigarettes shake and sway in a red-lit passageway, below a big screen rolling through quotations from Chairman Mao. This is an underground rave in China, part of a subculture growing in hidden corners of the nation’s cities, even as its political and cultural mainstream grow increasingly controlled, staid and predictable. For Chinese ravers, these gatherings — often called 'ye di,' or 'wild dances' — not only offer a rare space for unfettered fun, but signal resistance to the narrowly prescribed future a rigid society expects for them. By day, Xing Long works in the office of a state-owned company in Changchun, an industrial city in China's northeastern rust belt region. By night, he’s a DJ and underground rave organizer, a side gig that offers an escape from the humdrum of reviewing corporate contracts. 'My job cannot make me feel I fulfilled my values,' he said. 'Going to work is like executing a prewritten program.' Chinese young people face intense pressure and high expectations from the society around them. In recent years, facing bleak economic prospects, Chinese youth culture has been swept by a series of viral slang terms to describe frustration and hopelessness: ' 996 ' — the brutal 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., six days a week work schedule many companies ask of employees. 'Involution' — an endless treadmill of pointless competition that fresh graduates face. ' Lying flat ' — the growing trend among young people of giving up all ambition and aiming to do as little as possible. Techno dance parties are an escape from all that for people like Xing. Every time he walks into a rave, the 31-year-old said, his brain 'jolts awake like a bang.' Xing first learned about techno music from a documentary made by the American media company Vice. 'My eyes brightened up when I heard it,' he said. 'I should’ve listened to this kind of music earlier.' Xing began going to raves in Shenzhen, a southern city with a population of 17 million, but when he moved home in 2021 he realized no one else was organizing them. 'I want this city to have an underground techno music scene,' he said. 'I want to listen to it myself, so I want to make it happen.' Xing said that the underground techno scene fascinated him because it's 'real' even if not perfect, bad, not in the right order, or broken. 'It’s not a beautiful thing that was deliberately produced into a mold to present to the mainstream.' In recent years, space for culture and creativity has been shrinking in China as the authorities have ramped up censorship of concerts, shows, and other cultural events. Comedians have been silenced after joking about topics considered politically sensitive. A growing number of independent bookstores and creative spaces have shut down under pressure, while state-sanctioned media promotes uplifting, often saccharine narratives. Yet underground raves are free from all those limitations because they sprout in gray zones. Hidden from public view, they skirt formal approval processes, neither supported nor suppressed by the state. Feng Zhe, 27, a rave organizer in Shenyang, a northeastern city about 400 miles from Beijing, said raves are about 'refusing to be disciplined by society.' 'This is probably not how the world functions nowadays,' he said, adding that societies want to make people follow their rules and be useful but 'underground culture is useless.' 'Most people are going to be repressed,' Feng said. But for most rave organizers, the real meaning of underground rave culture is simply having fun. Loong Wu, a 26-year-old art student, started organizing raves in 2021 during COVID-19 lockdowns out of boredom. 'My original intention was just to break through the boredom,' she said. 'When you are truly enjoying it, you don’t think about meanings.' On one recent Saturday night, civil servants, students, an ex-firefighter, girls with dyed hair, and a man with a full face mask and goggles filed into a bar tucked behind a flower shop in downtown Changchun to attend one of Xing’s raves. They danced to fast-paced industrial techno spun by Du Jizhe, a local part-time DJ who works in HR by day. He said it’s the natural soundtrack of auto manufacturing cities like Changchun and Detroit, which prides itself on being the birthplace of techno. For Du, techno evokes childhood memories of the auto factory where his father worked. 'Techno is basically industrial noise like hammering and mechanical sounds,' Du said 'These noises exert a subtle influence on people’s ears in industrial cities.' Chen Xiangyu, a fashion student in an oversized black t-shirt with hair dyed blond, a black leather choker, a lip piercing, and smoky eye makeup, said raves are a pure release. 'The first time I came, I thought to myself, I don’t know anyone, no one knows me, so nobody’s paying any attention to how I dance, so long as I’m happy, it’s all good,' she said. 'I shouldn’t care too much about what others think.' Even at raves, illegal drugs are rarely seen in China, but promoters still face risks from authorities who have little patience for unapproved social gatherings. Advertisements promoting raves are often cryptic, with only a date, a DJ line-up, and the cost of admission. Sometimes, the location won’t be revealed until an hour ahead of the party. Some organizers require guests to cover their phone’s camera with a sticker. Loong Wu said her requirements for a rave spot were no CCTV cameras, no security, and no nearby residents. Even those aren't a guarantee — local police once busted one of her raves in an industrial port. 'It was pathetic how few such places exist in the city,' she said. Frustrated with how hard to find a good rave spot, she once organized a public party where she put her DJ equipment on a cart and pushed it through city streets as revelers danced alongside. 'Restrictions exist for sure, but that’s exactly why we need to create our own scene,' she said. 'We always need ‘wild dances.’ We always need to dance outside of set rules.' ___ Chen reported from Washington.	https://apnews.com/article/china-raves-techno-changchun-youth-culture-2edde8f402a604e3671900c5109b6fcd	2024-11-12T17:15:14-08:00	
British writer Samantha Harvey’s space-station novel 'Orbital' wins the Booker Prize for fiction	LONDON (AP) — British writer Samantha Harvey won the Booker Prize for fiction on Tuesday with 'Orbital,' a short, wonder-filled novel set aboard the International Space Station that ponders the beauty and fragility of Earth. Harvey was awarded the 50,000-pound ($64,000) prize for what she has called a 'space pastoral' about six orbiting astronauts, which she began writing during COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns. The confined characters loop through 16 sunrises and 16 sunsets over the course of a day, trapped in one another’s company and transfixed by the globe’s ever-changing vistas. 'To look at the Earth from space is like a child looking into a mirror and realizing for the first time that the person in the mirror is herself,' said Harvey, who researched her novel by reading books by astronauts and watching the space station's live camera. 'What we do to the Earth we do to ourselves.' She said the novel 'is not exactly about climate change, but implied in the view of the Earth is the fact of human-made climate change.' She dedicated the prize to everyone who speaks 'for and not against the Earth, for and not against the dignity of other humans, other life.' 'All the people who speak for and call for and work for peace — this is for you,' she said. Writer and artist Edmund de Waal, who chaired the five-member judging panel, called 'Orbital' a 'miraculous novel' that 'makes our world strange and new for us.' Gaby Wood, chief executive of the Booker Prize Foundation, noted that 'in a year of geopolitical crisis, likely to be the warmest year in recorded history,' the winning book was 'hopeful, timely and timeless.' Harvey, who has written four previous novels and a memoir about insomnia, is the first British writer since 2020 to win the Booker. The prize is open to English-language writers of any nationality and has a reputation for transforming writers’ careers. Previous winners include Ian McEwan, Margaret Atwood, Salman Rushdie and Hilary Mantel. De Waal praised the 'crystalline' writing and 'capaciousness' of Harvey’s succinct novel — at 136 pages in its U.K. paperback edition, one of the shortest-ever Booker winners. 'This is a book that repays slow reading,' he said. He said the judges spent a full day picking their winner and came to a unanimous conclusion. Harvey beat five other finalists from Canada, the United States, Australia and the Netherlands, chosen from among 156 novels submitted by publishers. American writer Percival Everett had been the bookies’ favorite to win with 'James,' which reimagines Mark Twain’s 'Huckleberry Finn' from the point of view of its main Black character, the enslaved man Jim. The other finalists were American writer Rachel Kushner’s spy story 'Creation Lake'; Canadian Anne Michaels’ poetic novel 'Held'; Charlotte Wood’s Australian saga 'Stone Yard Devotional'; and 'The Safekeep' by Yael van der Wouden, the first Dutch author to be shortlisted for the Booker. Harvey is the first female Booker winner since 2019, though one of five women on this year’s shortlist, the largest number in the prize’s 55-year history. De Waal said issues such as the gender or nationality of the authors were 'background noise' that did not influence the judges. 'There was absolutely no question of box ticking or of agendas or of anything else. It was simply about the novel,' he said before the awards ceremony at Old Billingsgate, a grand former Victorian fish market in central London. Founded in 1969, the Booker Prize is open to novels originally written in English published in the U.K. or Ireland. Last year’s winner was Irish writer Paul Lynch for post-democratic dystopia 'Prophet Song.' Lynch handed Harvey her Booker trophy at the ceremony, warning her that her life was about to change dramatically because of the Booker publicity boost. Harvey said she was 'overwhelmed,' but remained down-to-earth about spending her prize money. She said she'd disburse 'some of it on tax. I want to buy a new bike. And then the rest — I want to go to Japan.'	https://apnews.com/article/britain-booker-prize-winner-7d2de84490e136f62295dd89f2344240	2024-11-12T12:56:03-08:00	
Why is only limited aid getting to Palestinians inside Gaza?	JERUSALEM (AP) — The threatened U.S. deadline for Israel to allow more aid for people into the Gaza Strip or see fewer weapons shipments for its war with Hamasexpired on Tuesday but the Biden administration said it would not limit arms transfers. Because of Israeli border controls, the amount of food and other aid getting in is at its lowest level this year. Food security experts and rights groups caution that famine may already be underway in north Gaza. Almost the entire population of around 2.3 million Palestinians is relying on international aid for survival as Israel and Hamas wage their nearly 13-month-old war. 'I witnessed during my visit to Gaza last week the deliberate starvation of almost 2 million civilians, whilst the bombardment continues,' said Jan Egeland, secretary-general of the Norwegian Refugee Council, a major relief provider. 'There is barely any aid crossing into Gaza.' Israel, which controls all crossings into Gaza, says it is committed to delivering humanitarian assistance and has scrambled to ramp up aid. It says the U.N. and international aid groups need to do a better job of distributing supplies, and criminal gangs are stealing aid before it gets to civilians. The State Department spokesman Vedant Patel said that the progress to date must be supplemented and sustained but that 'we at this time have not made an assessment that the Israelis are in violation of U.S. law' requiring recipients of military assistance to adhere to international humanitarian law and not impede the provision of such aid. 'We are not giving Israel a pass,' Patel said, adding that 'we want to see the totality of the humanitarian situation improve.' Where do aid levels stand? Aid into Gaza is typically measured in terms of truckloads of food and supplies entering the territory. The U.S. has demanded 350 trucks daily. Israeli government figures show roughly 57 trucks a day entering on average in Oct and 75 a day in November. The U.N. counts trucks differently and says it has only received 39 trucks daily since the beginning of October. In northern Gaza, where the Israeli military has been carrying out a major offensive over the past month, the figures were even lower. No aid entered the northernmost areas of Gaza – Jabaliya, Beit Lahiya and Beit Hanoun – in October, the U.N. says. Israel says it closed all the Gaza crossings for the Jewish high holidays in October and couldn’t send aid to the north because of the offensive against Hamas fighters. Over the last two days, the military body handling aid deliveries to Gaza — COGAT — says it has allowed aid trucks to enter the hardest-hit northern areas. But only three of the trucks have made it to their destination successfully, according to the World Food Program. Denial of passage and entry Aid groups accuse the Israeli army of blocking aid-packed trucks from reaching areas where the fighting is most intense, including northern Gaza, where hunger is most acute. 'There can be aid sitting at the border ready to come in. But if we are not provided a safe passage to go and collect it, it’s not possible for us to have it. And it will not reach the people who need it,' said Louise Wateridge, a spokesperson for UNRWA, the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees. UNRWA has been the main agency procuring and distributing aid in Gaza and a feud between Israel and the agency lead Israel to ban it last month. During October, the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said Israeli authorities rejected roughly 43% of all humanitarian movement requests, and impeded a further 16%. Israeli authorities have also prohibited some vehicles and goods from entering the enclave, aid groups say, often without reason. Rachel Morris, of the aid group Mercy Corps, said trucks carrying the group’s tent supplies have been turned away more than five times. Israel says it denies entry to supplies that could be weaponized by Hamas. Under intense international pressure, Israel has since taken measures to up aid delivery, with COGAT saying it was allowed trucks into the hard-hit north. On Monday, the Israeli security Cabinet approved increased aid for Gaza, which will increase the number of trucks that enter Gaza each day, according to an official familiar with the matter. But aid groups say access is still an issue. The World Food Program said vehicles filled with its supplies were denied access to Jabaliya, Beit Hanoun, and Beit Lahiya on Tuesday. The day before, the U.N. agency said it received approval from the army to deliver supplies to Beit Hanoun only to be stopped by troops on route in Jabaliya and ordered to offload the stockpile there. Lawlessness along aid routes Also stymying distribution is theft and criminality along aid routes. Israel accuses UNRWA of failing to pick up hundreds of trucks worth of supplies piling up at the territory’s main southern aid crossing. It says the aid has been waiting there for months. But the military and aid agencies both acknowledge that aid deliveries are treacherous because family-based crime groups are robbing the trucks. An Israeli official, speaking on the condition of anonymity under military briefing guidelines, estimated 30% to 40% of aid supplies are stolen by members of criminal families. COGAT spokesperson Shani Sasson said the Israeli army has tried to secure part of the route and find alternate routes for drivers, but cannot accompany each aid truck and the criminal groups are always moving. Many aid groups that used to use the crossing now say it is too dangerous for their staff to collect aid. Aseel Baidoun, a senior manager at Medical Aid for Palestinians, said that drivers sometimes have to pay fees to move their aid from the crossing into Gaza. He said the Israeli military was 'failing to provide an enabling environment to bring in sufficient humanitarian goods to Gaza.' Aid groups also say their warehouses and workers have come under attack from Israeli forces. OCHA says that at least 326 aid workers have been killed since the start of the war. It is not clear how many have been killed while working. As the deadline passes, what does Israel say? The U.S. has not yet said how it will respond to the low aid levels. Last week, the State Department said Israel needs to do more. Israel’s new foreign minister, Gideon Saar, appeared to downplay Washington’s deadline, telling reporters on Monday that he was confident 'the issue would be solved.' The Israeli military announced on Tuesday that it would open a fifth crossing for humanitarian aid into Gaza, a key demand by the United States. But it remains unclear when the Kissufim crossing in central Gaza will be operational.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-gaza-aid-hamas-unrwa-biden-bcf8489c338a2f33cb4d6f0a4f7138b5	2024-11-12T10:25:00-08:00	
Who is Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby and why did he resign during an abuse scandal?	LONDON (AP) — Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, the head of the Church of England and spiritual leader of the worldwide Anglican Communion, resigned Tuesday amid the fallout from a long-running sexual abuse scandal. Welby stepped down after an independent investigation found that he had failed to inform police about serial physical and sexual abuse by a volunteer at Christian summer camps as soon as he became aware of it. Here are the answers to some questions about the Church of England, Welby’s decision and its global significance. What is the Church of England? The Church of England, also known as the Anglican Church, is a Christian denomination and the official church of England. It was created in the 16th century when the English church broke away from the Roman Catholic Church. The church is part of the global Anglican Communion, a family of churches that has over 85 million members in more than 165 countries. Britain’s monarch is the supreme governor of the Church of England and has the power to appoint bishops and other church leaders. What is the Archbishop of Canterbury? The Archbishop of Canterbury is the head of the Church of England and is traditionally seen as the spiritual leader of the Anglican Communion. Each of the 46 churches that comprise the Anglican Communion has its own primate, but the Archbishop of Canterbury is considered first among equals. Who is Justin Welby? Justin Welby, 68, was the 105th Archbishop of Canterbury. He worked in the oil industry for 11 years before he left in 1989 to study for the priesthood. Welby was ordained in 1992 and worked extensively in Africa and the Middle East before he became Archbishop of Canterbury in 2013. Though a skilled mediator — who has worked to resolve conflicts in Nigeria and elsewhere in Africa — he struggled to unite the global Anglican Communion. What are the splits in the Anglican Communion? Like many Christian denominations, the Anglicans are split by disagreements over the church’s teachings about homosexuality and the role of women. While churches in England and America have become more welcoming to the LGBT community and moved to ordain women priests and bishops, some more conservative churches in Africa and Asia have resisted those changes. Those divisions have weakened the Archbishop of Canterbury’s influence in the Anglican Communion. Why did Welby resign? An independent investigation last week released its long-awaited report into the late John Smyth, who sexually, psychologically and physically abused more than 100 boys and young men at Christian summer camps in the United Kingdom, Zimbabwe and South Africa over five decades. The 251-page report concluded that Welby failed to report Smyth to authorities when he was informed of the abuse in August 2013, soon after he became Archbishop of Canterbury. Had he done so, Smyth could have been stopped sooner and many of his victims wouldn’t have been abused, the report found. Welby initially refused to resign, saying he was wrongly informed that police had already been notified and he shouldn’t do anything to interfere with their investigation. But his position became untenable after a growing number of church leaders and victims criticized him for failing to take responsibility for the scandal. 'It is very clear that I must take personal and institutional responsibility for the long and retraumatizing period between 2013 and 2024,' Welby said, announcing his resignation. Has the church faced other abuse allegations? Yes. Like the Catholic Church, the Church of England has faced a long series of allegations that priests and others affiliated with the church used their positions to abuse young men and women. An independent inquiry established by the government found that 390 people associated with the church were convicted of child sexual abuse between the 1940s and 2018. Deference to the authority of priests, taboos surrounding the discussion of sexuality and a culture that gave more support to alleged perpetrators than their victims helped make the Church of England 'a place where abusers could hide,' the inquiry found. Welby’s supporters said he was instrumental in changing the culture of the church and improving its safeguarding procedures after he became Archbishop of Canterbury in 2013. What happens next? The process of selecting Welby’s successor will begin with the Crown Nominations Commission, which nominates candidates for Archbishop of Canterbury and other bishoprics in England. The commission will send the name of a preferred candidate and an alternate to Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who will then advise King Charles III on his selection. The commission has 16 members, including the Archbishop of York, representatives of the clergy and laypeople, a representative of the Anglican Communion and a chair appointed by the prime minister.	https://apnews.com/article/church-of-england-abuse-justin-welby-resigns-2a34fc8107f7f1dc5b562c41f3b8b704	2024-11-12T09:51:59-08:00	
Imprisoned Belarus activist resurfaces after no contact with her family for 20 months	TALLINN, Estonia (AP) — Imprisoned Belarusian opposition activist Maria Kolesnikova has resurfaced after more than 20 months without any communication with relatives or friends and met with her father, a human rights group said Tuesday. Kolesnikova, one of the most popular and charismatic figures who helped lead protests of Belarus’ authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko, was last heard from in February 2023. The 42-year-old musician-turned activist, who suffered a serious illness and underwent surgery while in prison, has been serving her 11-year sentence at a facility near Gomel. Viasna, Belarus’ leading rights group, said Kolesnikova met her father, Alexander Kolesnikov, at a prison hospital. Raman Pratasevich, a former opposition journalist who later became a government supporter after he was arrested, on Tuesday released photos of smiling Kolesnikova embracing her father, who previously had been denied permission to see her. He said the meeting took place Tuesday, but it was not immediately possible to verify the photos or when they might have been taken. Kolesnikova gained prominence when mass protests erupted in Belarus after the widely disputed August 2020 election gave Lukashenko a sixth term in office. With her close-cropped hair, broad smile and trademark gesture of forming her outstretched hands into the shape of a heart, she often was seen at the front of the demonstrations. She became an even greater symbol of resistance the next month when Belarusian authorities tried to deport her. Driven to the Ukrainian border, she briefly broke away from security forces in the neutral zone at the frontier and tore up her passport, then walked back into Belarus. She was convicted a year later of charges including conspiracy to seize power. In November 2022, Kolesnikova was moved to an intensive care ward to undergo surgery for a perforated ulcer. Former inmates told her sister, Tatiana Khomich, that the 5-foot-9-inch Kolesnikova weighed only about 45 kilograms (100 pounds). Kolesnikova, who before the 2020 protests was a classical flautist, is one of several major Lukashenko opponents to disappear behind bars. Viasna counts about 1,300 political prisoners in Belarus, including the group’s Nobel Peace Prize-winning founder, Ales Bialiatsky. At least seven have died behind bars. The U.N. Human Rights Committee has repeatedly demanded Belarusian authorities take 'urgent protective measures' in relation to Kolesnikova and other political prisoners held incommunicado. In September, the European Parliament demanded that Belarus release all political prisoners. Lukashenko, who is seeking a seventh term in an election set for January 2025, has released 146 political prisoners since July. Those freed had health problems, wrote petitions for pardons and repented. At the same time, Belarusian authorities have launched a new wave of arrests, seeking to uproot any sign of dissent before the election. Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, the Belarusian opposition-leader-in-exile, told The Associated Press that she was happy that Kolesnikova was allowed to see her father and reaffirmed a demand that she and other political prisoners be released. 'We must to keep pressing for an end to the isolation of other political prisoners and their release,' said Tsikhanouskaya, whose husband, Siarhei Tsikhanouski, is serving a 19 1/2-year prison sentence and has been held incommunicado for more than 20 months. Pavel Sapelka of Viasna said allowing Kolesnikova to see her father could be a signal from Lukashenko that he's 'ready to start a conversation about the fate of other political prisoners.' 'Lukashenko is waiting for Western reaction to the latest steps and is prepared to bargain ahead of January's election,' Sapelka said.	https://apnews.com/article/belarus-crackdown-opposition-kolesnikova-lukashenko-prison-3665c76cdbe65769e747577a8ec5b6ce	2024-11-12T09:47:42-08:00	
French farmers protest EU-Mercosur deal that will increase South American imports	PARIS (AP) — French farmers protested Tuesday against a trade deal that would increase agricultural imports from South America, saying it hurt their livelihoods. The European Union and the Mercosur trade bloc, composed of Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay and Bolivia, reached an initial agreement in 2019, but negotiations stumbled due to opposition from farmers, and some European governments, leading to sweeping rallies where they particularly expressed worry about the use of pesticides in South American produce. Tuesday's protest in Aurillac, in southern France, was the start of a fresh wave expected to spread among the European agricultural community amid concern that the deal could be finalized at the G20 summit in Brazil on Nov. 18-19 despite the French minister of agriculture, Annie Genevard, saying it was 'highly unlikely.' A group of more than 600 French lawmakers also published an open letter in Le Monde, telling the EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen that the conditions for adopting an agreement with the Mercosur bloc 'have not been met.' Last week, French protesters blocked the state building in the western commune of Niort, while on Monday, the Copa-Cogeca European farmers’ group sent a letter to von der Leyen, urging her to reject the Mercosur deal and adopt 'a coherent trade policy' Meanwhile, France's three biggest farming unions have vowed action: The FNSEA, France’s largest, has called for nationwide protests once the winter sowing season ends in mid-November. Coordination Rurale has promised 'an agricultural revolt' starting on Nov. 19 in Auch and Agen, two cities in the Southwest of France, while the Confédération Paysanne, the third-largest union, known for its anti-globalization stance, is also planning its move against 'free trade agreements.' Farmers in Belgium have also called for demonstrations close to the EU headquarters in Brussels on Wednesday. European farmers' apprehensions stem from what they say are the too-strict EU environmental regulations they follow while the Mercosur deal could flood the market with imports from South America which are produced under lower environmental and labor standards, according to Véronique Le Floc’h, the president of Coordination Rurale, France’s second-largest farmers’ union. 'The anger hasn’t gone away. It’s still there, and, in fact, our worries have grown,' said Le Floc'h whose organization has been linked to France's far-right party National Rally. 'If the Mercosur agreement is signed, it will spell the end of our agriculture,' she said. Genevard, the agriculture minister, reiterated the government’s opposition to the deal on Tuesday. In an interview with TF1, she said: 'We don’t want this agreement because it’s harmful. It will bring in products, including substances banned in Europe, at the cost of deforestation. It will unfairly compete with our domestic production.' But Le Floc’h was not convinced. 'When the minister says the agreement won’t be signed, she’s either naive or thinks we are,' she said. 'Why should we believe her when so many countries are in favor of it?' In March, French President Emmanuel Macron called the deal 'terrible' and 'outdated.' Negotiations began on June 28, 1999, but have taken a long, torturous path since. Macron opposes any agreement as long as South American producers fail to adhere to the same environmental and health standards as Europeans.	https://apnews.com/article/france-farmers-protest-eu-mercosur-c3e28b8005655b3fedf2a4ed68529ea4	2024-11-12T08:53:05-08:00

Proposed assisted dying bill for England and Wales rekindles debate over choice and ethics	LONDON (AP) — Details of a proposed law to legalize assisted dying in England and Wales have been published, rekindling debate on the controversial topic ahead of a vote in Parliament later this month. The draft bill, published Monday, proposes allowing terminally ill adults expected to have less than six months to live to ask for and be provided with help to end their own life, subject to safeguards and protections. Opponents have voiced concerns that the bill would mean people could become pressured to end their lives. But Labour lawmaker Kim Leadbeater, who proposed the bill, said the law has robust safeguards built into it and contains 'three layers of scrutiny' — two doctors and a High Court judge will have to sign off on any decision. A debate and first vote on the bill is expected to take place on Nov. 29. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Tuesday he will study the details of the bill and 'will not be putting pressure on any MP (Member of Parliament) to vote one way or the other.' Here's a look at what's in the Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill and the next steps: What does the bill propose? Under the draft legislation, only those over 18-years-old in England and Wales and who are expected to die within six months can request assisted dying. They must have the mental capacity to make a choice about the end of their life and will be required to make two separate declarations about their wish to die. Two independent doctors have to be satisfied the person is eligible and a High Court judge will need to approve the decision. Anyone found guilty of pressuring, coercing or dishonestly getting someone to make a declaration that they wish to die will face up to 14 years in prison. Assisted suicide is currently banned in most parts of the U.K. It is not a specific criminal offense in Scotland, but assisting the death of someone can result in a criminal charge. Who will administer the medication? The patient must self-administer the life-ending medication themselves. No doctor or anyone else can give the medication. No health professional is under any obligation to provide assistance to the patient. Doctors who do take part would have to be satisfied the person making their declaration to die has made it voluntarily. They also must ensure the person is making an informed choice. What happens next? The bill will be debated in Parliament and lawmakers will be able to vote on it according to their conscience, rather than along party lines. Opinion among lawmakers appears to be divided, though some senior ministers including Health Secretary Wes Streeting has said he intended to vote against the bill. Starmer has previously supported assisted dying, but the government says it will remain neutral on the issue. If the bill passes the first stage in the House of Commons, it will face further scrutiny and votes in both Houses of Parliament. Leadbeater suggested that any new law is unlikely to come into effect within the next two to three years. Do other countries have similar laws? One argument supporting the bill is that wealthy individuals can travel to Switzerland, which allows foreigners to go there to legally end their lives, while others have to face possible prosecution for helping their loves ones to die. Other countries that have legalized assisted suicide include Australia, Belgium, Canada and parts of the United States, with regulations on who is eligible varying by jurisdiction. Assisted suicide is different to euthanasia, allowed in the Netherlands and Canada, which involves healthcare practitioners killing patients with a lethal injection at their request and in specific circumstances.	https://apnews.com/article/uk-assisted-dying-bill-contents-d11dab69f5d79ba516946afb30aee925	2024-11-12T08:19:01-08:00	
FAA prohibits US airlines from flying to Haiti and UN suspends flights after plane was shot by gangs	PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) — The Federal Aviation Administration announced Tuesday that it will prohibit U.S. airlines from flying to Haiti for 30 days after gangs shot a Spirit Airlines flight and the United Nations said it will suspend flights, 'obviously limiting the flow of humanitarian aid and humanitarian personnel into the country.' The bullets hit the plane when it was about to land Monday in the country’s capital Port-au-Prince, injuring a flight attendant. It was part of a wave of violence that erupted in Haiti as the country swore in its new prime minister after a politically tumultuous process. Life in much of Haiti’s capital was frozen after the wave of violence, which came to a head when gangs shot a Spirit Airlines airplane Monday, forcing the airport to shut down. Photos and videos obtained by The Associated Press show bullet holes dotting the interior of a plane. A number of airlines suspended flights to Haiti through Thursday, but it was unclear how long closures could drag on. Neither the former interim prime minister, Garry Conille, nor the newly inaugurated Alix Didier Fils-Aimé commented on the violence. But Luis Abinader, who as president of the neighboring Dominican Republic has cracked down on Haitian migration, called firing on the airplane terrorism. 'This was a terrorist act; the countries that are following and helping Haiti should declare these armed gangs as terrorist groups,' Abinader said in a news conference. On Tuesday, heavily armed police in armored cars outside the airport checked trucks used for public transportation passing by. Schools were closed, as were banks and government offices. Streets, where just a day before gangs and police were locked in a fierce firefight, were eerily empty, with few driving by other than a motorcycle with a man who had been shot clinging to the back. The sounds of heavy gunfire still echoed through the streets in the afternoon — a reminder that despite political maneuvering by Haiti's elites and a strong push by the international community to restore peace, the country's toxic slate of gangs kept its firm hold on much of the Caribbean nation. The United Nations estimates that gangs control 85% of the capital, Port-au-Prince. A U.N.-backed mission led by Kenyan police to quell gang violence struggles with a lack of funding and personnel, prompting calls for a U.N. peacekeeping mission. The violence comes after a transitional council, tasked with restoring democratic order to Haiti, which hasn't held elections since 2016, decided to fire Conille, who often was at odds with the council during his six months in office. The council rapidly swore in businessman Fils-Aimé as the new interim prime minister. Conille originally called the move illegal, but on Tuesday acknowledged Fils-Aimé's appointment in a post on the social media platform X. '(I) wish him success in fulfilling this mission. At this crucial moment, unity and solidarity are essential for our country. Long live Haiti!' he wrote. Fils-Aimé promised to work with international partners to restore peace and hold long awaited elections, a vow also made by his predecessor. But many Haitians, like 43-year-old Martha Jean-Pierre, have little taste for the political fighting, which experts say only give gangs more freedom to continue expanding their control as Haiti teeters on the brink of famine. Jean-Pierre was among those to brave the streets of Port-au-Prince on Tuesday to sell the plantains, carrots, cabbage and potatoes she carried in a basket on her head. She had no choice, she said — selling was the only way she could feed her children. 'What good is a new prime minister if there's no security, if I can't move freely and sell my goods,' she said, nodding to her basket of vegetables. 'This is my bank account, this is what my family depend on.' It was a frustration that appeared to be international players that have pushed for a peaceful resolution in Haiti like the U.N. and the U.S. On Tuesday, the U.S. State Department lamented that Conille and the council 'were unable to move forward in a constructive manner' and called on Fils-Aimé and the council to provide a clear action plan outlining a joint vision on how to decrease violence and pave the path for elections to be held to 'prevent further gridlock.' 'The acute and immediate needs of the Haitian people mandate that the transitional government prioritize governance over the competing personal interests of political actors,' it wrote in a statement. ___ Associated Press video journalist Pierre-Richard Luxama contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/haiti-violence-gangs-airport-90dc8d26bc58eb9b214385ac10f315a2	2024-11-12T06:26:27-08:00	
UN force says Israeli work on Syrian frontier saw 'severe violations' of cease-fire after AP report	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — United Nations peacekeepers warned Tuesday that the Israeli military has committed 'severe violations' of a cease-fire deal with Syria as its military continues a major construction project along the so-called Alpha Line that separates the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights from Syria. The comments from the U.N. Disengagement Observer Force, which has patrolled the area since 1974, come after an Associated Press report Monday that published satellite imagery showing the extent of the works along the frontier. The work, which UNDOF said began in July, follows the completion by the Israeli military of new roadways and what appears to be a buffer zone along the Gaza Strip’s frontier with Israel. The Israel military also has begun demolishing villages in Lebanon, where other U.N. peacekeepers have come under fire. While such violence hasn't broken out along the Alpha Line, UNDOF warned the work risked further inflaming tensions in the region. 'Such severe violations of the (demilitarized zone) have the potential to increase tensions in the area and is being closely monitored by UNDOF,' it added. The Israeli military did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Syrian officials have declined to comment on the construction, though UNDOF described Syria as having 'strongly protested' the work. High-resolution images taken on Nov. 5 by Planet Labs PBC for the AP show over 7.5 kilometers (4.6 miles) of construction along the Alpha Line, starting some 3 kilometers (1.8 miles) southeast of the Israeli-held Druze town of Majdal Shams. That's the town where a July rocket strike killed 12 children playing soccer. The images appear to show a trench between two embankments, parts of which appear to have been laid with fresh asphalt. There also appears to be fencing running along it as well toward the Syrian side. The construction follows a southeast route before heading due south along the Alpha Line, and then again cutting southeast. The images show excavators and other earth-moving equipment actively digging along the route, with more asphalt piled there. The area is also believed to be littered with unexploded ordnance and mines from decades of conflict. As Israel conducted the construction work, which UNDOF described as 'extensive engineering groundwork activities' and 'ditches,' it has protected earth-moving equipment with armored vehicles and main battle tanks, the peacekeepers said Tuesday. Troops and earth-moving equipment have crossed the Alpha Line into the demilitarized zone in Syria, known to UNDOF as the 'area of separation.' 'Violations of the 1974 Disengagement Agreement have occurred where engineering works have encroached into the AoS,' the peacekeepers said in a statement, using an acronym for the area. 'There have been several violations by (Israel) in the form of their presence in the AoS because of these activities.' UNDOF has repeatedly protested the work, which it described as violating the cease-fire deal over the months of construction so far. 'Based on the engagement, (Israel) has indicated that the current earthworks are being carried out for (a) defensive purpose to prevent unauthorized crossing and violations by civilians,' the peacekeepers added. Israel sent a 71-page letter in June to the U.N. outlining what it described as 'Syrian violations of the Alpha Line and armed presence in the area of separation (that) occur daily.' The letter cited numerous Israeli-alleged violations by Syrian civilians crossing the line. Syria has constantly accused Israel of launching attacks against it from territory it occupies in the Golan Heights. Israel has frequently struck Syria over the years, particularly after the start of the Mideast wars following Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, assault on Israel. Israel seized control of the Golan Heights from Syria in the 1967 Mideast war. The U.N. Secretary Council voted to create UNDOF to patrol a roughly 400-square-kilometer (155-square-mile) demilitarized zone and maintain the peace there after the 1973 Mideast war. A second demarcation, known as the Bravo Line, marks the limit of where the Syrian military can operate. The lines are delineated by barrels. UNDOF has around 1,100 troops, mostly from Fiji, India, Kazakhstan, Nepal and Uruguay, who patrol the area. Israel annexed the Golan Heights in 1981 — a move criticized by a U.N. resolution declaring Israel’s action as 'null and void and without international legal effect.' The territory, some 1,200 square kilometers (460 square miles) in size, is a strategic high ground that overlooks both Israel and Syria. Around 50,000 Jewish settlers and Arabs who are mostly members of the Druze sect of Shiite Islam live there. In 2019, President Donald Trump unilaterally announced that the United States would 'fully recognize' Israel’s control of the territory, a decision that has been unchanged by the Biden administration. However, it's the only other country to do so, as the rest of the world views it as occupied Syrian territory.	https://apnews.com/article/mideast-israel-syria-alpha-line-construction-77b11eb8e82e256eb7abae6678cae492	2024-11-12T05:27:08-08:00	
Church of England head Justin Welby resigns over handling of sex abuse scandal	LONDON (AP) — Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, head of the Church of England and spiritual leader of the global Anglican Communion, resigned Tuesday after an investigation found that he failed to tell police about serial physical and sexual abuse by a volunteer at Christian summer camps as soon as he became aware of it. Pressure on Welby had been building since Thursday, when the archbishop’s refusal to accept responsibility for his failure to report the abuse in England and in Africa in 2013 kindled anger about a lack of accountability at the highest reaches of the church. By Tuesday afternoon, Welby acknowledged that mistake. 'It is very clear that I must take personal and institutional responsibility for the long and retraumatizing period between 2013 and 2024,' Welby said in the statement announcing his resignation. 'I believe that stepping aside is in the best interests of the Church of England, which I dearly love and which I have been honored to serve.' Welby’s resignation will send ripples around the world. The Archbishop of Canterbury is the symbolic head of the Anglican Communion, which has more than 85 million members in 165 countries, including the Episcopal Church in the United States. While each national church has its own leaders, the Archbishop of Canterbury is considered first among equals. Welby, a former oil executive who left the industry in 1989 to study for the priesthood, was a controversial figure even before the scandal. A skilled mediator who has worked to resolve conflicts in Nigeria and elsewhere in Africa, he struggled to unite the Anglican Communion, which has been riven by sharply divergent views on issues such as gay rights and the place of women in the church. The Church of England on Thursday released the results of an independent investigation into the late John Smyth, a prominent attorney who the report said sexually, psychologically and physically abused about 30 boys and young men in the United Kingdom and 85 in Africa from the 1970s until his death in 2018. The 251-page report of the Makin Review concluded that Welby failed to report Smyth to authorities when he was informed of the abuse in August 2013, soon after he became Archbishop of Canterbury. Had he done so, Smyth could have been stopped sooner and many victims could have been spared the abuse, the inquiry found. Welby said he didn’t inform law enforcement agencies about the abuse because he was wrongly told that police were already investigating. Even so, he took responsibility for not ensuring that the allegations were pursued as 'energetically' as they should have been. As late as Monday, Welby’s office said he had decided not to resign, even as he expressed his 'horror at the scale of John Smyth’s egregious abuse.' Helen-Ann Hartley, the bishop of Newcastle, said Welby’s position had become 'untenable' after some members of the General Synod, the Church of England’s national assembly, started a petition calling on him to step down because he had 'lost the confidence of his clergy.' But the strongest outcry came from Smyth’s victims. Andrew Morse, who was repeatedly beaten by Smyth over five years, said resigning was a chance for Welby to start repairing the damage caused by the church’s broader handling of historical abuse cases. 'I believe that now is an opportunity for him to resign,’’ Morse told the BBC before Welby stepped down. Welby’s resignation comes against the backdrop of widespread historical sexual abuse in the Church of England. A 2022 report by the Independent Inquiry Child Sexual Abuse found that deference to the authority of priests, taboos surrounding the discussion of sexuality and a culture that gave more support to alleged perpetrators than their victims helped make the Church of England 'a place where abusers could hide.' Welby’s supporters had argued that he should remain on the job because of his role in changing the culture of the church. Church officials were first made aware of Smyth’s abuse in 1982, when they received the results of an internal investigation into complaints about his behavior at Christian summer camps in England. The recipients of that report 'participated in an active cover-up' to prevent its findings from coming to light, the Makin Review found. Smyth moved to Zimbabwe in 1984 and later relocated to South Africa. He abused boys and young men in Zimbabwe, and there is evidence that the abuse continued in South Africa until he died in August 2018, the investigation found. Smyth’s actions weren't made public until a 2017 investigation by Britain’s Channel 4 television station, which led police in Hampshire to start an investigation. Police were planning to question Smyth at the time of his death and had been preparing to extradite him. Stephen Cherry, dean of the chapel at King’s College Cambridge, said Welby could no longer represent the people. 'There are circumstances in which something happens whereby a person in a position of prominent leadership essentially loses the trust and the confidence and the capacity to do that really wonderful thing that someone like an archbishop does, which is represent everyone at a certain moment publicly,’’ Cherry told the BBC before Welby resigned. 'And the pain in the victim community and the history of not listening to people and not responding to people who are profoundly hurt by those in positions of power means that this is no longer a person who can carry the representative role of that office.' ___ Associated Press Writer Jill Lawless contributed.	https://apnews.com/article/justin-welby-resigns-archbishop-of-canterbury-abuse-2ab9cab63572f5062b5a5588698fe492	2024-11-12T05:13:38-08:00	
Doctor accused of criticizing Russia's war in Ukraine is convicted and given over 5 years in prison	TALLINN, Estonia (AP) — A doctor accused of criticizing the war in Ukraine in front of a patient was convicted Tuesday of spreading false information about the Russian military and sentenced to 5 1/2 years in prison, part of an unrelenting Kremlin crackdown on dissent. Dr. Nadezhda Buyanova, 68, was arrested in February after Anastasia Akinshina, the mother of one of her patients, reported the pediatrician to authorities. Akinshina alleged that Buyanova told her and her son that his father, a Russian soldier who apparently was killed in Ukraine, was a legitimate target for Kyiv’s troops and had blamed Moscow for the war. A video of the outraged Akinshina complaining about Buyanova was widely publicized, and chief of Russia’s Investigative Committee Alexander Bastrykin personally demanded a criminal case be brought against the doctor. Buyanova, who was born in western Ukraine, denied the accusation, insisting she never said what she was accused of saying. In a tearful closing statement to the court last week, she had urged it to acquit her. Her defense argued the prosecution failed to present evidence that the purported conversation took place, including any recordings of it, and alleged that her accuser fabricated the story out of animosity toward Ukrainians, according to the independent news site Mediazona, which reported all of the hearings in the trial. In her closing statement to the court, Buyanova said it was 'painful' to read the accusations in the indictment, and broke down. 'A doctor, especially a pediatrician, is not capable of wishing harm to a child, his mother, or traumatizing the child’s psyche. Only a monster is capable of this -- and of the words that I allegedly said to them,' Mediazona quoted her as saying. Buyanova's case drew national attention, with more than 6,500 people signing an online petition demanding her freedom and supporters regularly attending court hearings. As the judge read out the verdict, they shouted, 'Disgrace!' before bailiffs escorted everyone from the courtroom. Her lawyer, Oscar Cherdzhyev, told reporters afterward that the verdict was 'unexpectedly harsh' and 'monstrously cruel.' 'We didn't expect this,' he said. 'Spreading false information' about the army has been a criminal offense since March 2022, when Russia adopted a series of laws prohibiting any public expression about the invasion that deviated from the official narrative. Authorities started actively using them against critics and protesters. According to OVD-Info, one of Russia’s leading rights groups that tracks political arrests, more than 1,000 people have been implicated in criminal cases on charges related to speaking or acting out against the war.	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-crackdown-0827790d20cc6e57994a6245c0d72b9b	2024-11-12T04:36:18-08:00	
The Latest: More than a dozen races left to be called to determine control of Congress	Control over the U.S. House of Representatives still hangs in the balance, teetering between a Republican or Democratic majority with more than a dozen races left to be called. Follow the AP’s Election 2024 coverage at: https://apnews.com/hub/election-2024. Here’s the latest: Why California takes weeks to count votes, while states like Florida are faster One week after Election Day, control of the U.S. House rests on just over a dozen races where winners haven’t yet been determined. Nine states have at least one uncalled House race, some of which are so close they’re headed to a recount. Then there’s California. About half of the yet-to-be-decided House races are in the state, which has only counted about three-quarters of its votes statewide. This isn’t unusual or unexpected, as the nation’s most populous state is consistently among the slowest to report all its election results. Compare it to a state like Florida, which finished counting its votes four days after Election Day. These differences in how states count — and how long it takes — exist because the Constitution sets out broad principles for electing a national government, but leaves the details to the states. The choices made by state lawmakers and election officials as they sort out those details affect everything from how voters cast a ballot to how quickly the tabulation and release of results takes place. ▶ Read more about how states count votes Trump picks former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee to be ambassador to Israel President-elect Donald Trump will nominate former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee as ambassador to Israel, Trump announced Tuesday. Huckabee is a staunch defender of Israel and his intended nomination comes as Trump has promised to align U.S. foreign policy more closely with Israel’s interests as it wages wars against Iran-backed Hamas and Hezbollah. 'Mike has been a great public servant, Governor, and Leader in Faith for many years,' Trump said in a statement. 'He loves Israel, and the people of Israel, and likewise, the people of Israel love him. Mike will work tirelessly to bring about Peace in the Middle East!' ▶ Read more about Trump’s transition to the White House Vice President Kamala Harris says there’s still work to get done She told a crowd of supporters gathered outside the White House she was grateful for them, as cheers erupted from the staircase at the Eisenhower office building adjacent to the White House. Her arrival for a private lunch with President Joe Biden coincided with Israeli President Isaac Herzog walking out of the West Wing to address reporters and the cheering briefly drowned him out. Harris said: 'Let’s get back to work because we still have work to get done.' She said she was sending 'all my love and thanks.' Trump has promised to ‘save TikTok’. What happens next is less clear After a tumultuous year filled with anxiety and a legal battle about its future in the U.S., TikTok may have just been thrown a lifeline by the man who was once its biggest foe: Donald Trump. President-elect Trump, who tried to ban the social media platform the last time he was in the White House, has repeatedly pledged during his most recent campaign to oppose a ban on the short-form video app, which could happen as soon as mid-January if the company loses a court case that’s currently underway in Washington. For months, TikTok, and its China-based parent company ByteDance, have been embroiled in a legal battle with the U.S. over a federal law that forces them to cut ties for national security reasons or stop operating in one of their biggest markets in the world. The measure, signed by President Joe Biden in April, gives ByteDance nine months to divest its stakes, with a possible three-month extension if a sale was in progress. If that happens, the deadline could be extended into the first 100 days of Trump’s presidency. ▶ Read more about Trump and TikTok Wall Street makes wagers on the likely winners and losers in a second Trump term Wall Street is already making big bets on what take two for a White House led by Donald Trump will mean for the economy. Since Election Day, investors have sent prices zooming for stocks of banks, fossil-fuel producers and other companies expected to benefit from Trump’s preference for lower tax rates and lighter regulation. For retailers, meanwhile, the outlook is murkier because of uncertainty about whether they’ll be able to absorb any of the higher costs created by tariffs. Professional investors are warning about the risk of getting carried away by the momentum. While strong rhetoric on the campaign trail can cause these big swings, not all of the promises turn into actual policy. Plus, the broad U.S. stock market tends to move more on long-term growth in profits than anything else. ▶ Read more about the effect of Trump’s reelection on the stock market Johnson says he expects to be at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate this weekend to talk about a policy roadmap The comment from House Speaker Mike Johnson came in response to a question about whether he’s talked to Trump about funding the federal government beyond the current Dec. 20 deadline. 'My plan is to be at Mar-a-Lago all weekend to iron out details on the plans ahead,' Johnson said. Johnson said it will be an ambitious agenda, but he declined to go into specifics. 'I told President Trump many times, as we’ve all discussed. We believe we could be the most consequential Congress in the modern era, and he’s the most consequential president, because we quite literally have to fix almost every metric of public policy. Everything is a mess. Everything.' Will more House Republicans join Trump’s administration? Speaker Mike Johnson says he doesn’t expect more House Republicans to join President-elect Donald Trump’s administration in the near-term because of the effect it would have on Republicans having enough votes to get priorities passed. But he adds, 'I’ll leave that up to him.' Johnson says he expects Republicans to grow their slim House majority when all the votes are counted, but it would still be a slim one. Johnson addressed the issue after it was disclosed that Trump has asked Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., to be his United Nations ambassador and Michael Waltz, R-Fla., to be his national security adviser. 'Every single vote counts,' Johnson said. Billionaire hedge fund manager John Paulson says he won’t be joining Trump’s administration Paulson said it in a statement Tuesday, nixing speculation that he would serve as Trump’s treasury secretary. 'My complex financial obligations would prevent me from holding an official position,' he said in the statement. 'However, I intend to remain actively involved with the President’s economic team and helping in the implementation of President Trump’s outstanding policy proposals.' Paulson is the founder of the New York-based hedge fund Paulson &amp; Co. The 68-year-old money manager made his fortune betting against subprime mortgages ahead of the Great Recession. He was a major fundraiser for Trump’s latest presidential campaign. Former George Soros money manager Scott Bessent, Cantor Fitzgerald CEO Howard Lutnick and Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin are among other names floated for the treasury secretary role. Trump will meet with Speaker Mike Johnson at the Capitol on Wednesday Johnson says he plans to meet with Trump in the morning before Trump goes to the White House. The visit comes on the same day as House and Senate Republicans each have their own elections to determine their leadership in the next Congress. Johnson has kept in close contact with Trump throughout the election cycle, discussing campaign strategy and efforts Republicans would undertake in the first 100 days of a second Trump presidency. Speaker Mike Johnson: Republicans are ‘ready to deliver’ on Trump’s mandate House Speaker Mike Johnson said Tuesday that Republicans are 'ready to deliver' on President-elect Donald Trump’s mandate, ensuring they’re more prepared for a second-term agenda. Standing on the steps of the U.S. Capitol with the House GOP leadership team, the Republican speaker said there would be no time wasted on Trump’s 'America First' agenda of securing the southern border and other priorities in what he expects will be unified government, even though House control is still too early to call. 'We are ready to deliver on America’s mandate,' said Johnson. ▶ Read more about Congress Judge delays ruling on whether to scrap Trump’s conviction in hush money case A judge is postponing a decision on whether to undo President-elect Donald Trump’s conviction in his hush money case because of a U.S. Supreme Court ruling on presidential immunity. New York Judge Juan M. Merchan had been set to rule Tuesday. Instead, he told Trump’s lawyers Tuesday he’d delay the ruling until Nov. 19. According to emails filed in court, Trump’s lawyers asked for the delay over the weekend, arguing there are 'strong reasons for the requested stay, and eventually dismissal of the case in the interests of justice.' ▶ Read more about Trump’s hush money case Supreme Court rejects push to move Georgia case against ex-Trump chief of staff Mark Meadows The Supreme Court refused Tuesday to let former Trump White House chief of staff Mark Meadows move the election interference case against him in Georgia to federal court. Meadows was one of 19 people indicted in Georgia and accused of participating in an illegal scheme to keep then-president Donald Trump in power after he lost the 2020 election. Trump was also charged, though after he won reelection last week any trial appears unlikely, at least while he holds office. Both men have denied wrongdoing. It’s unclear what affect the election results could have on others charged in the case, which is largely on hold after an appeals court agreed to review whether to remove Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis over her romantic relationship with the special prosecutor she had hired to lead the case. ▶ Read more about Mark Meadows’ case The lesser choices of voters for losing candidates could decide a Maine US House seat A ranked choice tabulation to determine the winner of a House race in Maine was beginning Tuesday, after neither Democratic U.S. Rep. Jared Golden nor Republican Austin Theriault won more than 50% of first-place votes. Maine voters rank candidates in order of preference on ballots, and if necessary to reach a majority, the lesser choices of the last-place finisher’s supporters are reallocated. Ballots from the 2nd Congressional District were brought to a building in the state capital where election workers will scan them and reallocate any valid votes on the more than 12,000 ballots that didn’t name Golden or Theriault. But that won’t be the end of it. A requested recount will begin after the process determines a majority winner. Election workers will try to complete both tasks before the state’s Nov. 25 certification deadline. South Korean president takes up golf again to forge a bond with Trump South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol has dusted off his golf clubs in an attempt to forge a bond with President-elect Donald Trump, an avid golf lover. The presidential office said Tuesday that Yoon began practicing the game for the first time in eight years in preparation for a possible round of golf with Trump. Since his election, Trump’s 'America first' approach has raised concerns it could negatively affect the U.S. defense commitment to South Korea and hurt the trade interests of the Northeast Asian country in various ways, including increased tariffs. Some experts say it’s important to build a close personal friendship with Trump during the transition period before he formally takes office in January. ▶ Read more about South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol Congress returns to unfinished business and a new Trump era Congress returns to a changed Washington as President-elect Donald Trump’s hard-right agenda is quickly taking shape, buoyed by eager Republican allies eyeing a full sweep of power on Capitol Hill while Democrats are sorting out what went wrong. Even as final election results are still being tallied, the House and Senate leadership is pushing ahead toward a second-term Trump White House and what he’s called a 'mandate' for governing, with mass deportations, industry deregulation and wholesale gutting of the federal government. Trump is already testing the norms of governance during this presidential transition period — telling the Senate to forgo its advise-and-consent role and simply accept his Cabinet nominees — and he is staffing his administration and finding lawmakers willing to bend those civic traditions. ▶ Read more about Congress California Gov. Gavin Newsom will spend part of week in DC as he tries to Trump-proof state policies California Gov. Gavin Newsom plans to meet with the Biden administration this week to discuss zero-emission vehicles and disaster relief — issues that have been targeted in the past by President-elect Donald Trump. The Democratic governor is leaving for Washington on Monday and will return home Wednesday, his office said. Newsom will also meet with California’s congressional delegation. He is seeking federal approval for state climate rules, a $5.2 billion reimbursement for emergency funding during the COVID-19 pandemic and updates to the state’s Medicaid program, along with other priorities. The trip comes days after Newsom called for state lawmakers to convene a special session in December to protect California’s liberal policies ahead of Trump’s return to office in January. ▶ Read more about the governor’s upcoming trip Judge set to rule on whether to scrap Trump’s conviction in hush money case A judge is due to decide Tuesday whether to undo President-elect Donald Trump’s conviction in his hush money case because of a U.S. Supreme Court ruling on presidential immunity.

Merchan, who presided over Trump’s historic trial, is now tasked with deciding whether to toss out the jury verdict and order a new trial — or even dismiss the charges altogether. The judge’s ruling also could speak to whether the former and now future commander-in-chief will be sentenced as scheduled Nov. 26. Just over a month after a jury convicted Trump of falsifying business records, the Supreme Court ruled that ex-presidents can’t be prosecuted for actions they took in the course of running the country, and prosecutors can’t cite those actions even to bolster a case centered on purely personal conduct. ▶ Read more about the upcoming ruling	https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-election-kamala-harris-903d0a4532278cace2f4b3c975bb743d	2024-11-12T04:15:02-08:00	
European fake art network involving Banksys, Warhols, Modiglianis uncovered in Italy	ROME (AP) — Italian authorities say a network of European art forgers who painted fake Warhols, Banksys and Picassos and then tried to sell them to unsuspecting buyers with the help of complicit auction houses has been dismantled. Thirty-eight people have been placed under investigation, including six in Spain, France and Belgium. Italian authorities say the network could have done 200 million euros ($212 million) in economic damage by flooding the art market with fake works. Italy’s culture ministry said Monday the seizures in Italy, France, Spain and Belgium netted 2,100 fake works attributed to more than 30 famed artists, including Andy Warhol, Amedeo Modigliani, Banksy, Pablo Picasso, Joan Mirò, Francis Bacon, Wassily Kandinsky, Henry Moore and Gustav Klimt. The operation uncovered a network of forgers in Spain, France and Belgium who produced the works, said Eurojust, the European Union agency for judicial cooperation. Fake Warhols and Banksys were the most commonly forged and the fakes were exhibited at shows in Mestre and Cortona, Italy, with a catalogue published, the authorities said. Eurojust said the network was able to use complicit auction houses in Italy that issued forged certificates and stamps of authenticity, some 500 of which were also seized. The investigation began in March 2023 when Italian authorities discovered 200 fakes during the search of the home of a Pisa businessman that prompted them to monitor e-commerce sites of auction houses to see if others were involved in the network. Those arrested are accused of conspiracy to forge and deal in contemporary art, Eurojust said.	https://apnews.com/article/italy-fake-art-banksy-f655f612e6c2818448f57afb0fc39ab3	2024-11-12T03:12:58-08:00	
Russian parliament advances bill to ban adoptions by gender-transition countries	MOSCOW (AP) — Russia's lower house of parliament on Tuesday passed final reading of a bill to ban adoption of Russian children by citizens of countries where gender transitioning is legal. The measure, which now goes to the upper house of parliament and then to President Vladimir Putin for signing into law, follows an array of measures in recent years suppressing non-traditional sexuality. State Duma Speaker Vyacheslav Volodin, who authored the bill, said on the Telegram messaging app that 'it is extremely important to eliminate possible dangers in the form of gender reassignment that adopted children may face in these countries.' He listed at least 15 countries that the law would apply to, most of them in Europe but including Australia, Argentina and Canada. Adoption of Russian children by U.S. citizens was banned in 2012. Putin and other top officials in recent years have increasingly called for observing so-called 'traditional values' as a counter to Western liberalism characterized as degenerate. Russia last year banned gender-transition medical procedures and its Supreme Court declared the LGBTQ+ 'movement' to be extremist. In 2022, Putin signed a law prohibiting the distribution of LGBTQ+ information to people of all ages, expanding a ban issued in 2013 on disseminating the material to minors. The parliament is also considering a measure that would criminalize 'propaganda' that discourages people from having children.	https://apnews.com/article/russia-lgbtq-adoptions-36c28270553f511aef6ec914642a925c	2024-11-12T03:11:30-08:00

Camilla, 77, plans to attend a reception for the finalists in the annual Booker Prize for fiction writing, but will spend less time with guests than originally planned. She is also scheduled to attend a reception for the television and film industry, but will cut that one short too. The queen has pulled out of an appearance at the premiere of the film 'Gladiator II' on Wednesday night as doctors advise Camilla to focus on her recovery. King Charles III’s spouse was advised against joining other members of the royal family at a 'Festival of Remembrance' on Saturday at London’s Royal Albert Hall in London and the Remembrance Sunday ceremony at the Cenotaph war memorial, a major event for Britain’s royals.

Danish police close investigation into Old Stock Exchange fire	COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) — Danish police said Tuesday that they were closing the investigation into the devastating fire that destroyed more than half of Copenhagen’s Old Stock Exchange, saying nothing points at the blaze being the result of a criminal act. Despite extensive forensic investigations, review of surveillance and the questioning of a large number of witnesses, 'it is not possible to determine the cause of the fire in the historic stock exchange building,' said Brian Belling, the Copenhagen police officer in charge of the investigation. 'Our assessment is that we have explored all relevant investigative possibilities in the case,' Belling told a press conference, adding that no one has been charged in the case. Belling said the video material included hours of footage from inside the Stock Exchange that had not been damaged by the fire. He added that no inflammable liquid has been found. In the early morning of April 16, a violent fire tore through the 400-year-old building, a major tourist attraction. The blaze toppled its green copper roof and iconic dragon-tail spire. Two days later, a large section of the building’s outer wall collapsed inwards. As the fire raged, many, including ordinary people, ventured in to rescue artworks and around 90% of the cultural objects were rescued from the building. One of the hypotheses was that the fire started in connection with the renovation, Belling said. He said that the fire is believed to have started under the roof, which had been wrapped in scaffolding because of ongoing renovation work to be completed for its anniversary in 2024. 'There is guidance regarding listed buildings when renovating them. It is our opinion that they have been followed to the letter,' Tim Ole Simonsen, a senior member of the Greater Copenhagen Fire Department, told the same news conference. 'Then you can discuss whether they are good enough.' On Sept. 24, King Frederik X of Denmark laid the 'foundation stone' within part of a red brick wall that survived the mid-April blaze, marking the commencing of a yearslong reconstruction plan. The owner of the downtown exchange, the Denmark’s Chamber of Commerce, has said that they will rebuild the landmark, which is considered a leading example of Dutch Renaissance style in Denmark. Construction started in 1615 and it first opened in 1624. The fire was reminiscent of the April 2019 blaze at the 800-year-old Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris.	https://apnews.com/article/denmark-old-stock-exchange-fire-investigation-april-c48b64356465e40c74cdaf4b5863728a	2024-11-12T02:57:38-08:00	
Police officer arrested over deadly 2023 suicide bombing at Pakistan mosque	PESHAWAR, Pakistan (AP) — A police officer has been arrested in connection with facilitating a suicide bomb attack at a mosque on the premises of a police compound in northwest Pakistan. Provincial police chief Akhtar Hayyat announced the arrest of police constable Mohammad Wali at a news conference in Peshawar, the capital of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, on Tuesday. Wali, who worked with the Peshawar police, is alleged to have shared a map of the compound with the suicide bomber who carried out an attack on the mosque on Jan. 29, 2023, killing 101 people, mostly police officers, and wounding 250 others. Hayyat said Wali had joined the outlawed Jamaat-ul-Ahrar, a breakaway faction of the Pakistani Taliban, which orchestrated the attack, in 2023. The arrest was made in a raid on Monday and Wali had confessed to his role in the attack, the chief added. Police last year released CCTV images from the blast scene showing the suicide bomber in a police uniform approaching the site pushing a motorcycle, giving the impression it had broken down. Hayyat said it is alleged that the uniform had been provided by Wali. The assault on the mosque inside the police facility was one of the deadliest attacks on security forces in recent years.	https://apnews.com/article/pakistan-arrest-peshawar-suicide-bombing-bc056da2cd2c598b9bf781815a8ea597	2024-11-12T02:28:04-08:00	
Middle East latest: Israeli strikes kill 11 in Gaza, hit Beirut suburbs; US aid deadline expires	Palestinian medical officials said two Israeli strikes in Gaza killed at least 14 people, including two children and a woman. The deaths came as eight international aid groups said in a report on Tuesday that Israel has failed to meet U.S. demands that it allow greater humanitarian access to the war-ravaged Gaza Strip, where conditions are worse than at any point in the 13-month-old war. A late Monday strike hit a cafeteria in the so-called Muwasi humanitarian zone west of the Gaza city of Khan Younis, killing at least 11 people, including two children, according to officials at Nasser Hospital, where the casualties were taken. Another strike early Tuesday hit a house in the urban Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza, killing three people including a woman, according to al-Awda Hospital, which received the casualties. The Biden administration last month called on Israel to 'surge' more food and other emergency aid into Gaza, setting a 30-day deadline that was expiring Tuesday. It warned failure to comply could trigger U.S. laws requiring it to scale back American military support as Israel wages war against Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon. Israel has announced some steps toward improving the situation. But in recent days, U.S. officials signaled Israel still isn’t doing enough, though they have not said if they will take action against it. The Israel-Hamas war began after Palestinian militants stormed into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people — mostly civilians — and abducting 250 others. Israel’s military response in Gaza has killed more than 43,000 people, Palestinian health officials say. The officials do not distinguish between civilians and combatants, but say more than half of those killed were women and children. In Lebanon, to the north, the Iran-backed militant Hezbollah group, began firing into Israel on Oct. 8, 2023, in solidarity with Hamas in the Gaza Strip. Since the conflict erupted, more than 3,200 people have been killed and more than 14,000 wounded in Lebanon, the country's Health Ministry reported. ___ Here's the latest: Israel announces the opening of a fifth crossing point for aid into Gaza TEL AVIV, Israel — The Israeli military announced on Tuesday the opening of a fifth crossing for humanitarian aid into Gaza, one of key demands by the United States for Israel to increase humanitarian aid to Gaza. The crossing, across from Kibbutz Kissufim, and closest to the city of Deir al Balah in Gaza, will allow for the delivery of food, water, medical supplies, and shelter equipment to central and southern Gaza, the military said. The aid will undergo a security check at the Kerem Shalom crossing and then be brought into Gaza via the new crossing. Trucks picking up aid at Kerem Shalom have repeatedly been attacked and supplies stolen as they travel to distribution hubs inside Gaza, according to an Israeli official, who spoke on condition of anonymity in line with military briefing rules. Israel has come under intense criticism from the aid groups and the international community for failing to allow enough aid into Gaza, creating famine conditions in the northern part of the coastal strip. Israel has announced a series of steps toward improving the situation. But U.S. officials have signaled that Israel still is not doing enough, though they have not said if they will take any action against it. —Melanie Lidman in Tel Aviv, Israel; Israeli warplanes strike Beirut's southern suburbs BEIRUT — Israeli airstrikes set off large explosions on Tuesday in Beirut’s southern suburbs — an area known as Dahiyeh where Hezbollah has a significant presence — soon after the Israeli military issued evacuation orders for 11 houses there. There was no immediate word on casualties. The military said the houses contained Hezbollah installations, but the claim could not be independently confirmed. Late Monday night, a strike hit the village of Ain Yaacoub in northern Lebanon, killing at least 16 people, the Lebanese civil defense said. Four of the killed were Syrian refugees, and there were another 10 people wounded. There was no Israeli military comment on the strike. Israel has been carrying out intensified bombardment of Lebanon, vowing to cripple Hezbollah and put a stop to more than year of cross-border fire by the Lebanese militant group onto northern Israel. Israel's military says it delivered aid to northern Gaza on a US-imposed deadline TEL AVIV, Israel — The Israeli military said on Tuesday that hundreds of packages of food and water were brought to a besieged area in northern Gaza where the military has been carrying out a concentrated operation since October. COGAT, the Israeli military body in charge of humanitarian aid to Gaza said aid trucks were brought to the areas of Jabaliya and Beit Hanoun, where the military has carried out an intense operation since Oct. 6. On Monday night, the Israeli security Cabinet approved more aid for Gaza, which will increase the number of trucks that enter the battered enclave each day, according to an official familiar with the matter. At least 700 Palestinians have been killed in northern Gaza since the operation began, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, and tens of thousands have been displaced. The ministry does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in its counts. An Israeli official, who spoke on condition of anonymity in line with military briefing rules, said the army estimates there are approximately 5,000–10,000 Palestinians still living in northern Gaza. The aid was delivered on a U.S.-imposed deadline that called on Israel to 'surge' more food and other emergency aid into Gaza. It warned that failure to comply could trigger U.S. laws requiring it to scale back military support as Israel wages war against Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon. Aid groups have accused Israel of falling short on aid distribution, especially in northern Gaza. —Melanie Lidman in Tel Aviv, Israel; Israel denied or impeded 85% of aid convoys to northern Gaza last month, UN says UNITED NATIONS — The U.N. humanitarian office says 85% of its attempts to coordinate aid convoys and humanitarian visits to northern Gaza — where hunger is acute and Israel is carrying out a major offensive — were denied or impeded last month. The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs made 98 requests to Israeli authorities for authorization to go through the checkpoint along Wadi Gaza but only 15 made it, U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said Monday. The humanitarian office, known as OCHA, 'is worried about the fate of Palestinians remaining in North Gaza, as the siege there continues, and urgently calls on Israel to open up the area to humanitarian operations at the scale needed, given the massive needs.' Dujarric said. In a new report published Monday, OCHA said humanitarian organizations submitted 50 requests to the Israeli authorities to enter North Gaza governorate in October and 33 were rejected while eight were accepted but faced impediments including delays that prevented their completion, he said. Over the past three days, Dujarric said, teams from OCHA, the U.N. human rights and de-mining agencies and other humanitarian groups visited nine sites in Gaza City to assess the needs of hundreds of displaced families, many from North Gaza. The teams say that some were in shelters, abandoned homes, destroyed clinic and some were sleeping in the streets or open fields where they feared stray dogs at night, Dujarric said. In a severely damaged structure, the team found more than a dozen families — including people with disabilities and some in urgent need of medical care — sheltering in the basement which had no electricity and was full of sewage, he said,. ___ For more Middle East news: https://apnews.com/hub/middle-east	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-hezbollah-mideast-latest-12-november-2024-16e57642f460d28e6a5e4f5fe7088a41	2024-11-11T23:49:14-08:00	
For nearly a decade, climate talks have been hashing out so-called Article 6. But what is it?	BAKU, Azerbaijan (AP) — After nearly a decade of negotiations, leaders during the United Nations climate conference's first day decided on some of the finer points of much-debated sticking point aimed at cutting planet-warming emissions from coal, oil and gas. Known as Article 6, it was set up as part of the 2015 Paris Agreement to help nations work together to reduce climate-causing pollution. Part of that was a system of carbon credits, allowing nations to put planet-warming gasses in the air if they offset emissions elsewhere. But the gaveling through of Article 6 late Monday was criticized by climate justice groups, who said carbon markets allow major polluters to keep emitting at the expense of people and the environment. COP29, as this year’s summit is known, has brought together world leaders to discuss ways to limit and adapt to the climate crisis. Scientists agree that the warming of the atmosphere caused primarily by human-burned fossil fuels is fueling deadlier and increasingly catastrophic droughts, flooding, hurricanes and heat. Here's a look at Article 6 and the carbon credits system it aims to implement. What is Article 6? Article 6 first made an appearance at the Paris climate talks in 2015, where world leaders agreed to try to keep global warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) from pre-industrial levels. Its aim is to outline how countries and companies can trade emissions reductions to remove and stop more carbon pollution reaching the atmosphere. The idea is to set up carbon trading markets, allowing higher polluters to offset some of the pollution they produce by buying carbon credits from less polluting countries. Article 6 offers two ways for countries to do this. The first is for two nations to set their own rules and standards for carbon credit trades. Some countries are already signing deals to do this, including Singapore with the Philippines, Costa Rica and Sri Lanka, Switzerland with Ghana, Peru and Ukraine, among others. The second option creates an international, U.N.-governed market that anyone can purchase credits through. Isa Mulder, an expert on global carbon markets with the research group Carbon Market Watch, said the idea behind Article 6 is for countries to find the cheapest way to cut emissions. By trading carbon credits, it makes cutting global pollution cheaper and more efficient. But Article 6 is contentious, leading to years of delays. At COP28, negotiations crumbled after disagreements on transparency, rules on credits that could be traded, and what makes a good carbon removal credit. 'There are other problems like when local communities don't have a say in the project and are forced to resettle,' said Mulder, referring to how some tree-planting carbon credit schemes can happen on inhabited Indigenous lands. 'So there’s a lot of human rights concerns.' United Nations secretary-general Antonio Guterres urged negotiators to 'agree to rules for fair, effective carbon markets' and 'leave no space for greenwashing or land-grabbing.' How might it help red uce carbon pollution? The hope of Article 6 is that it incentivizes countries to collaborate to reach their climate goals. Countries could generate carbon credits based on projects aimed to meet their own climate goals, such as protecting existing forests from development or shutting coal-fired plants. Private-sector players or other high carbon polluter countries could then buy the credits, which would allow them to emit a certain amount of carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gas. Heavy-polluting companies would be important customers. Each credit would equal a ton of CO2 or the equivalent of other greenhouse gases that can be reduced in the air, sequestered, or avoided by using green energies instead. Money from the credits generated would go to local projects. The per-ton price of carbon would fluctuate in the market, meaning that the higher it rises, the more green projects could fetch through new credits generated. Under carbon markets, countries that lower their emissions by installing clean energy projects like solar or wind power or electrifying public transportation systems can sell carbon credits. But critics question whether it will be effective and worry it could lead to similar problems seen with the Kyoto Protocol, a 1997 pact for developed nations to reduce their heat-trapping gas emissions to 1990 levels and below. The deal was dealt a hammer blow when the then U.S. administration withdrew from it. 'There’s a lot of concerns about whether that credit actually represents what it stands for,' said Mulder from Carbon Market Watch. What could happen at Baku climate talks? Monday's decision signaled early momentum on establishing Article 6, which the COP29 presidency said it would prioritize this year. But leaders still need to agree on other sections of the issue, including rules on two-nation carbon credit trading and the final details of the international, U.N.-governed market. Once finalized, Article 6 could reduce the cost of implementing national climate plans by $250 billion annually according to U.N. estimates. The COP29 presidency will then encourage countries to participate in carbon trading. On Monday, COP29 President Mukhtar Babayev said Article 6 'will be a game-changing tool to direct resources to the developing world.' But concerns remain about how it will work, given how it was developed. 'Communities' consent and ownership over these initiatives are not just essential, but also a matter of respect and inclusion,' said David Nicholson, chief climate officer at Mercy Corps, a nonprofit that works on poverty, climate and other issues. 'We are concerned that the agreement lacks adequate protections to human rights and undermines the goals of the Paris Agreement, rather than supporting them. If these concerns aren’t addressed, the decision could allow carbon trading to take the place of genuine, much-needed climate finance commitments,' Nicholson added. ___ AP Science writer Seth Borenstein contributed to this report.

Dutch appeals court overturns landmark climate ruling against Shell	THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — A Dutch appeals court on Tuesday overturned a landmark ruling that ordered energy company Shell to cut its carbon emissions by net 45% by 2030 compared to 2019 levels, while saying that 'protection against dangerous climate change is a human right.' The decision was a defeat for the Dutch arm of Friends of the Earth and other environmental groups, which had hailed the original 2021 ruling as a victory for the climate. Tuesday's civil ruling can be appealed to the Dutch Supreme Court. 'This hurts,' Friends of the Earth director in the Netherlands Donald Pols said. 'At the same time, we see that this case has ensured that major polluters are not immune and has further stimulated the debate about their responsibility in combating dangerous climate change. That is why we continue to tackle major polluters, such as Shell.' Outside court, Pols said the fight against climate change 'is a marathon, not a sprint, and the race has just begun.' The ruling upholding Shell’s appeal came as a 12-day U.N. climate conference was entering its second day in Azerbaijan where countries are discussing how to fund cutting planet-warming emissions and adapt to ever-increasing weather extremes. It marked a stinging defeat for climate activists after several courtroom victories. A court in The Hague in 2015 ordered the government to cut emissions by at least 25% by the end of 2020 from benchmark 1990 levels. The Dutch Supreme Court upheld the ruling five years ago. Earlier this year, a U.N. tribunal on maritime law said that countries are legally required to reduce greenhouse gas pollution. The International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea found that carbon emissions qualify as marine pollution and said that countries must take steps to mitigate and adapt to their adverse effects. And in April, Europe’s highest human rights court ruled that countries must better protect their people from the consequences of climate change. In December the top U.N. legal body, the International Court of Justice, is holding public hearings on climate change after the world body requested a nonbinding advisory opinion on 'the obligations of States in respect of climate change.' Dozens of countries are set to present arguments at two weeks of hearings. In a written summary of Tuesday's ruling, the court said that Shell has a duty of care to limit its emissions, but it annulled the lower court's decision because it was 'unable to establish that the social standard of care entails an obligation for Shell to reduce its CO2 emissions by 45%, or some other percentage. 'There is currently insufficient consensus in climate science on a specific reduction percentage to which an individual company like Shell should adhere.' Shell has emitted 36,528 million tons of carbon dioxide, or CO2, since 1854, which is 2.1% of global emissions, according to an April report by the Carbon Majors Database. Presiding Judge Carla Joustra said that Shell already has targets for climate-warming carbon emissions that are in line with demands of Friends of the Earth — both for what it directly produces and for emissions produced by energy the company purchase from others. The court then ruled that 'for Shell to reduce CO2 emissions caused by buyers of Shell products ... by a particular percentage would be ineffective in this case. Shell could meet that obligation by ceasing to trade in the fuels it purchases from third parties. Other companies would then take over that trade.' Joustra said that, 'The court’s final judgment is that Friends of the Earth's claims cannot be granted. The court therefore annuls the district court’s judgment.' Climate activists sitting outside on the courthouse steps hugged, and some appeared close to tears after the decision. 'To be honest I was just really disappointed,' Neele Boelens said. I was almost crying. I was in there in the court and it was just like... At first it looked really good for us but then it just went down hill.' Shell, meanwhile, welcomed the ruling. 'We are pleased with the court’s decision, which we believe is the right one for the global energy transition, the Netherlands and our company,' Shell plc Chief Executive Officer Wael Sawan said in a written statement. 'Our target to become a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050 remains at the heart of Shell’s strategy and is transforming our business.' ___ Read more of AP’s climate coverage at http://www.apnews.com/climate-and-environment	https://apnews.com/article/shell-climate-court-netherlands-51e84d215df13f9c92edf84f301a673f	2024-11-11T23:09:13-08:00	
A hollow and limited apology.' New Zealand survivors of abuse in care speak in their own words	WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — Hundreds of survivors of abuse in state, foster and faith-based care arrived at New Zealand's Parliament in Wellington on Tuesday, each representing thousands more. They came to hear the government formally apologize for the 'unimaginable' horrors they suffered as children and vulnerable adults, after a long-running inquiry made its final report about the scale of the abuse in July. 'You deserved so much better and I am deeply sorry that New Zealand did not do better by you,' Prime Minister Christopher Luxon told them in Parliament hours later. Many had T-shirts specially printed. Some used canes or wheelchairs because of the abuse they suffered in hospitals, institutions and care homes after they were taken from their families. A few were familiar faces from decades of advocacy and campaigning, mostly ignored until recent years. The public gallery in New Zealand’s Parliament is small — it seats fewer than 200 people — and a total of 500 had been drawn from a ballot to attend. Many were disappointed that details of financial compensation for their suffering weren't divulged on Tuesday. Luxon promised that a redress system will be 'operating next year.' Survivors spoke in their own words about the day: Tu Chapman, a survivor who advised the inquiry 'Right now I feel alone and in utter despair at the way in which this government has undertaken the task of acknowledging all survivors. Once again, like our decades of fight, we are having to validate our care experiences and our existence. 'We continue living with the decimation of our identities, the raping and pillaging of our cultures through incompetent decision-making and the intentional moves to invalidate our experiences. The clear and utter destruction of lives cannot be downplayed, nor can it be swept under the carpet, as the state, churches and faith-based organizations have done for decades. 'I think it was a hollow and limited apology. It feels like they’re just giving consideration to things they can continue tinkering around with. Stop tinkering around and just get on with it.' Helen Beauchamp, who lived in 20 foster homes from age 4 'In my files, they wrote ‘not intelligent enough’ at age 4. My mum was in a hospital institution at age 12, put there by her dad. So it’s been a generational thing. 'Surviving has been a roller coaster and we still don’t have a picture of the outcome. It’s sad that our system is very slow. That makes it really hard for a lot of us, having the anticipation of just a little bit of closure, a little bit of light. This is a long, drawn-out timeline to continue to be put through. It takes a toll. '189 survivors were picked out of the ballot to sit in the public gallery today and I was one, so I was quite fortunate just in that. Coming here is a wider and significant way to apologize to our children, to our own families.' Jazmine Te Hiwi, a survivor of two camps for troubled young people 'Being acknowledged is the hardest part of being here. How do you accept that after being denied for 40 years of your life? It almost feels like you’re forced to accept the apology. 'What gets me is that we have people in high places who still look down on us, they don’t have any real understanding of why we are like this. There’s a reason why some of our youth are doing crimes. I see myself in that. We were just innocent kids that were taken advantage of. 'When I hear about these youth getting in trouble, all they’re looking for is some kind of attention, some kind of love. But nobody sees that and especially not these people. They think ‘the way to fix them up is to send them to boot camp.’ But that’s what they did to us. And that’s why we’re here today. It’s like it went in one ear and out the other side.'	https://apnews.com/article/survivors-zealand-abuse-state-care-church-foster-730c80e263d01fbdebd730b6833a8ba3	2024-11-11T22:49:37-08:00	
Aid groups say Israel misses US deadline to boost humanitarian help for Gaza	JERUSALEM (AP) — Israel has failed to meet U.S. demands to allow greater humanitarian access to the Gaza Strip, where conditions are worse than at any point in the 13-month-old war, international aid organizations said Tuesday. The Biden administration last month called on Israel to 'surge' more food and other emergency aid into the Palestinian territory, giving it a 30-day deadline that expires Tuesday. The administration warned that failure to comply could trigger U.S. laws requiring it to scale back military support as Israel wages offensives against Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon. Israel has announced a series of steps toward improving the situation. But U.S. officials recently signaled that Israel still isn’t doing enough, though they haven't said if they will take any action. Israel’s new foreign minister, Gideon Saar, appeared to downplay the deadline, telling reporters on Monday that he was confident 'the issue would be solved.' The Biden administration may have less leverage after the reelection of Donald Trump, who was a staunch supporter of Israel in his first term. Tuesday's report, authored by eight international aid organizations, listed 19 measures of compliance with the U.S. demands. It said that Israel had failed to comply with 15 and only partially complied with four. An Oct. 13 letter signed by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin called on Israel to, among other things, allow a minimum of 350 truckloads of goods to enter Gaza each day; open a fifth crossing into the besieged territory; allow people in Israeli-imposed coastal tent camps to move inland before the winter; and ensure access for aid groups to hard-hit northern Gaza. It also called on Israel to halt legislation that would hinder the operations of the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, known as UNRWA. After the report was published, the Israeli military announced the opening of a fifth crossing Tuesday close to the city of Deir al Balah in Gaza. It will allow for the delivery of supplies to the territory's central and southern regions. Despite Israeli steps to increase the flow of aid, levels remain far below the U.S. benchmarks. Residents are also still crammed in tent camps, access for aid workers to northern Gaza remains restricted, and Israel has pressed ahead with its laws against UNRWA. 'Israel not only failed to meet the U.S. criteria that would indicate support to the humanitarian response, but concurrently took actions that dramatically worsened the situation on the ground, particularly in Northern Gaza,' the report said. 'That situation is in an even more dire state today than a month ago.' The report was co-signed by Anera, Care, MedGlobal, Mercy Corps, the Norwegian Refugee Council, Oxfam, Refugees International and Save the Children. U.S. State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said last week that Israel had made some progress, but needs to do more to meet the U.S. conditions. 'What's important when you see all of these steps taken is what that means for the results,' he said. Israel launched a major offensive last month in northern Gaza, where it says Hamas militants had regrouped. The operation has killed hundreds of people and displaced tens of thousands. Israel has allowed almost no aid to enter the area, where tens of thousands of civilians have stayed despite evacuation orders. Aid to Gaza plummeted in October, when just 34,000 tons of food entered, or less than half the previous month, according to Israeli data. U.N. agencies say even less actually gets through because of Israeli restrictions, ongoing fighting and lawlessness that makes it difficult to collect and distribute aid on the Gaza side. In October, 57 trucks a day entered Gaza on average, according to Israeli figures, and 81 a day in the first week of November. The U.N. puts the number lower, at 37 trucks daily since the beginning of October. COGAT, the Israeli military body in charge of humanitarian aid to Gaza, said that the drop in the number of aid trucks in October was because of closures of the crossings for the Jewish high holidays and memorials marking the anniversary of the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack that triggered the war. 'October was a very weak month,' an Israeli official said on condition of anonymity in line with military briefing rules. 'But if you look at the November numbers, we are holding steady at around 50 trucks per day to northern Gaza and 150 per day to the rest of Gaza.' Aid distribution is also being hampered by the U.N. and other agencies' failure to collect aid that entered Gaza, leading to bottlenecks, and stealing by Hamas and organized crime families in Gaza, he said. He estimated as much as 40% of aid is stolen on some days. Israel on Monday announced a small expansion of its coastal 'humanitarian zone,' where hundreds of thousands of Palestinians have sought shelter in sprawling tent camps. It also has announced additional steps, including connecting electricity for a desalination plant in the central Gaza town of Deir al Balah, and efforts to bring in supplies for the winter. On Tuesday, COGAT announced a 'tactical' delivery of food and water to Beit Hanoun, one of the hardest-hit towns in northern Gaza. Also on Monday night, the Israeli security Cabinet approved increased aid for Gaza, which will increase the number of trucks that enter Gaza each day, according to an official familiar with the matter. The war began last year when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel, killing around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250 people. Around 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, a third of whom are believed to be dead. Israel's bombardment and ground invasion have killed more than 43,000 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to local health authorities, who don't say how many of those killed were militants. Around 90% of the population has been displaced, often multiple times, and hundreds of thousands are packed into squalid tent camps, with little food, water or hygiene facilities. The United States has rushed billions of dollars in military aid to Israel during the war and has shielded it from international calls for a cease-fire, while pressing it to allow more humanitarian aid into Gaza. The amount of aid entering Gaza increased under U.S. pressure last spring after Israeli strikes killed seven aid workers before dwindling again. Trump has promised to end the wars in the Middle East without saying how. He was a staunch defender of Israel during his previous term, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says they have spoken three times since his reelection last week. Israeli President Isaac Herzog, whose role is mostly ceremonial, is scheduled to meet with U.S. President Joe Biden on Tuesday. Former U.S. State Department official Charles Blaha, who ran the office in charge of ensuring that U.S. military support complies with U.S. and international law, predicted the Biden administration would find that Israel violated U.S. law by blocking humanitarian aid from reaching Palestinians in Gaza. 'It’s undeniable that Israel has done that,' Blaha said. 'They would really have to torture themselves to find that Israel hasn’t restricted ... assistance.' But he said that the administration would likely cite U.S. national security interests and waive restrictions on military support. 'If the past is prologue — no restrictions, and then kick the can down the road to the next administration.' ___ Magdy reported from Cairo.

Israeli strikes set off explosions in Beirut suburbs and kill 14 Palestinians in Gaza, medics say	DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Israeli airstrikes hit a cafeteria and a home in Gaza, killing at least 14 people, medical officials said. In Lebanon, warplanes struck the capital Beirut’s southern suburbs on Tuesday after the military ordered a number of houses there to evacuate. The new bombardment on both fronts comes on the verge of a deadline set by the United States for Israel to dramatically ramp up humanitarian aid allowed in Gaza or risk possible restrictions on U.S. military funding. A group of eight international aid agencies said in a report on Tuesday that Israel has failed to meet the U.S. demands. In Lebanon, large explosions shook Beirut’s southern suburbs — an area known as Dahiyeh where Hezbollah has a significant presence — soon after the Israeli military issued evacuation orders for 11 houses there. There was no immediate word on casualties. The military said the houses contained Hezbollah installations, but the claim could not be independently confirmed. Late Monday night, a strike hit the village of Ain Yaacoub in northern Lebanon, killing at least 16 people, the Lebanese civil defense said. Four of the killed were Syrian refugees, and there were another 10 people wounded. There was no immediate Israeli military comment on the strike. Israel has been carrying out intensified bombardment of Lebanon since late September, vowing to cripple Hezbollah and put a stop to more than year of cross-border fire by the Lebanese militant group onto northern Israel. At the same time, Israel has continued its campaign in Gaza, now more than 13 months old, triggered by Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023 attack on southern Israel. An Israeli strike late Monday hit a makeshift cafeteria used by displaced people in Muwasi, the center of a 'humanitarian zone' that Israel’s military declared earlier in the war. At least 11 people were killed, including two children, according to officials at Nasser Hospital, where the casualties were taken. Video from the scene showed men pulling bloodied wounded from among tables and chairs set up in the sand in an enclosure made of corrugated metal sheets. Another strike early Tuesday hit a house in the urban Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza, killing three people including a woman, according to al-Awda Hospital, which received the casualties. The strike also wounded 11 others, it said. The Israeli military had no immediate comment on the strikes. Hours earlier, the Israeli military announced a small expansion of the humanitarian zone, where it has told Palestinians evacuating from other parts of Gaza to take refuge. Hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians are sheltering in sprawling tent camps in and around Muwasi, a largely desolate area of dunes and agricultural fields with few facilities or services along the Mediterranean coast of southern Gaza. Israeli forces have also been besieging the northernmost part of Gaza since the beginning of October, battling Hamas fighters it says regrouped there. With virtually no food or aid allowed in for more than a month, the siege has raised fears of famine among the tens of thousands of Palestinians believed still sheltering there. An Oct. 13 letter signed by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin gave Israeli 30 days to, among other things, allow a minimum of 350 truckloads of goods to enter Gaza each day. So far, Israel has fallen short. In October, 57 trucks a day entered Gaza on average, and 70 a day in the 10 days of November, according to Israeli figures. The U.N. puts the number lower, at 37 trucks daily since the beginning of October. Israel has announced a flurry of measures in recent days to increase aid, including opening a new crossing into central Gaza. But so far the impact is unclear. The military said Tuesday it had allowed hundreds of packages of food and water into Jabaliya and Beit Hanoun, two areas under siege in the far north of Gaza. The Palestinian civil defense agency said three trucks carrying flour, canned food and water reached Beit Hanoun. It was only the second delivery allowed into the area since the beginning of October; a smaller cargo was let in last week, though not all of it reached shelters in the north, according to the U.N. The military announced Tuesday that four soldiers were killed in Jabaliya, bringing to 24 the number of soldiers killed in the assault there since it began. Palestinian health officials say hundreds of Palestinians have been killed, though the true numbers are unknown as rescue workers are unable to reach buildings destroyed in strikes. Israel has ordered residents in the area to evacuate. But the U.N. has estimated some 70,000 people remain. Many Palestinians there fear Israel aims to permanently depopulate the area to more easily keep control of it. On Tuesday, witnesses told The Associated Press that Israeli troops had encircled at least three schools in Beit Hanoun, forcing hundreds of displaced people sheltering inside to leave. Drones blared announcements demanding people move south to Gaza City, said Mahmoud al-Kafarnah, speaking from one of the schools as sounds of gunfire could be heard. 'The tanks are outside,' he said. 'We don’t know where to go.' Hashim Afanah, sheltering with at least 20 other people in his family home, said the forces were evicting people from houses and shelters. Israel’s campaign in Gaza has killed more than 43,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities that do not distinguish between civilians and militants in their count but say more than half the dead are women and children. Israel says it targets Hamas militants and blames the militant group for civilian deaths, saying it operates in residential areas and infrastructure, and among displaced people. The war in Gaza began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted about 250 as hostages. Around 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, about a third of them believed to be dead. ___ Associated Press reporters Samy Magdy in Cairo and Melanie Lidman in Jerusalem contributed to this report. ___ This story has corrected to show that the span of the war is now 13 months, not 19 months.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-lebanon-hezbollah-iran-news-november-12-2024-095148946dcc1d0dcb75cbd423b1be3a	2024-11-11T21:46:27-08:00	
Theater festival offers solace in Burkina Faso, a nation torn by violence	OUGADOUGOU, Burkina Faso (AP) — The last three years have been tough for Fanta Charlotte Dabone, a mother of three from the conflict-battered West African country of Burkina Faso. She fled her village after it was attacked by extremists, leaving her husband and her farm behind. Since then, she has been moving from place to place, struggling to pay rent and to buy enough food for her children, including a 2-year-old toddler. But last month, she got to be a queen. Every day for a week, together with dozens of other Burkinabe men and women who have been displaced by extremist violence, she swirled, danced and chanted for almost two hours in front of captivated audiences at Recreatrales, an international theater festival held in Ouagadougou, the country's capital. 'I was so happy about it,' she said. 'I don't even know how to explain how it felt.' Burkina Faso, a landlocked nation of 23 million in Sahel, an arid strip of land south of the Sahara, used to be known for its bustling arts scene, including renowned film and theater festivals, and its sophisticated craftsmanship. But in recent years, the country has become the symbol of the security crisis in the region. It has been shaken by violence from extremist groups and the government forces fighting them, much of it spilling over the border with Mali, and by two ensuing military coups. The military junta, which took power by force in 2022, failed to provide the stability it promised. Instead, the situation deteriorated: According to conservative estimates, more than 60% of the country is now outside of government control, more than 2 million people have lost their homes and almost 6.5 million need humanitarian aid to survive. The country's leader, Capt. Ibrahim Traore, installed a system of de-facto censorship, where those critical of the regime disappear or get forcefully drafted into the army, and where even friends are afraid to discuss politics with each other. But against all odds, last month the Bougsemtenga district in the capital turned into a festival grounds to host Recreatrales for the 13th time. Bougsemtenga derives its name from 'bougtenga,' which means 'happiness district' in Moore, one of the local languages. True to its origins, this year its streets were transformed into a dreamy universe, resembling a crossover between a traditional village festival and 'Alice in Wonderland.' More than 150 African and European artists performed and over 4,500 theater lovers were able to escape the country's grim reality, if just for a little while. Improvised theater stages were constructed inside people’s courtyards. The streets were decorated with colorful lights and abstract sculptures made by locals from plastic bottles and scraps of wax-printed fabrics. Residents put up hand decorated stands, selling beer and meat sticks to multinational crowds of theatergoers, ranging from Western diplomats to local mechanics. The ticket booth was a giant frog, its mouth wide open. Aristide Tarnagda, the festival’s artistic director, said he was convinced that regardless of the insecurity engulfing the country, the festival had to take place as planned. Theater is an affirmation of 'the primacy of life over death,' Tarnagda said. He added that getting together to perform and watch theatrical productions is a form of resistance against adversity and violence. This is why this year's theme was 'Turning the face to the sun.' 'Humans are capable of love and freedom, but sometimes they forget it,' he said. 'The role of the theater is to remind them about it.' Held every two years, the festival is the culmination of the yearlong work that the organizers do with residents of the Bougsemtenga district, which was home to two theaters and a theater association even before the first Recreatrales in 2002. They run art workshops, including in writing, theater, dance and scenography, for young people from the district and from all of Africa, and organize mentoring sessions and business skills classes for local women. The goal is to get as many people as possible involved, said Odile Sankara, the festival's director. 'It’s a working class district,' Sankara said. 'We want to encourage people to take an interest in art, to get a taste of it.' She added: 'Art is a powerful weapon to fight for more light, more humanity and more love,' especially while her country and the whole Sahel region were going through a security and humanitarian crisis. Claude Ilboudo, a 30-year-old from Bougsemtenga, has performed in the opening ceremonies of Recreatrales as a dancer since its first edition. He used to work as a glazier, and dancing was just his past time. But Ilboudo's life took a turn when five years ago he severely injured his right hand at work and could no longer do his job. It was then that Ilboudo discovered a passion for theater and started working for the Recreatrales association. 'Theater saved me,' he said. 'It made me discover what I could do.' This year, Ilboudo was part of the team that prepared the opening play with the internally displaced actors from scratch, including the concept, scenario and choreography. It was also the first time he personally interacted with people who had to flee their homes because of extremist violence. For internally displaced people, theater is not just a tool for therapy, helping them to process trauma, said Sankara, the artistic director. It's a way for a group that has been marginalized and isolated in Burkinabe society to be seen by others. During the play, Dabone, the displaced mother of three, stood at center stage with her toddler tied to her back and spit out a long, white paper strip. It symbolized all the haunting thoughts leaving her body, she said. But the question remains — for how long. 'Life is very difficult,' she said. 'But when I am on the stage, I feel joy. It’s when I go back home that all these thoughts are catching up with me.' ___ The Associated Press receives financial support for global health and development coverage in Africa from the Gates Foundation.

North Korea ratifies major defense treaty with Russia	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korea ratified a major defense treaty with Russia stipulating mutual military aid, the North’s state media reported Tuesday, as the U.S., South Korea and Ukraine say North Korea has sent thousands of troops to Russia to support its war against Ukraine. Russia had completed the ratification of the treaty last week after it was signed by Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in June. It is considered both countries’ biggest defense deal since the end of the Cold War. The Comprehensive Strategic Partnership treaty will take effect when both sides exchange documents on the ratification, the state-run Korean Central News Agency said. North Korea ratified the treaty through a decree signed Monday by the country's president of state affairs, KCNA said, using one of Kim's titles. North Korea’s rubber-stamp parliament, the Supreme People’s Assembly, has the right to ratify treaties but Kim can unilaterally ratify major ones, according to South Korea’s Unification Ministry. The treaty requires both countries to use all available means to provide immediate military assistance if either is attacked. It also calls for the two countries to actively cooperate in efforts to establish a 'just and multipolar new world order' and strengthen cooperation on various sectors including peaceful atomic energy, space, food supply, trade and economy. Some observers speculate the treaty’s ratification in both countries could signal North Korea could formally enter the Russia-Ukraine war soon. According to U.S., South Korean and Ukrainian intelligence assessments, up to 12,000 North Korean troops have been sent to Russia likely as part of the June treaty. Last week, Ukrainian officials said Ukraine and North Korean troops engaged in small-scale fighting while Ukraine’s army fired artillery at North Korean soldiers in Russia’s Kursk border region. North Korea’s troop dispatch threatens to escalate the almost three-year war. South Korea, the U.S. and their partners also worry about what Russia could give North Korea in return. Possible Russian transfer of sensitive technology to enhance North Korea’s already-advancing nuclear and missile programs would be an alarming development for the U.S. and its allies. North Korea and Russia have been significantly strengthening their military and other cooperation. South Korea’s spy agency said last month that North Korea had sent more than 13,000 containers of artillery, missiles and other conventional arms to Russia since August 2023 to replenish its dwindling weapons stockpiles.	https://apnews.com/article/north-korea-russia-ukraine-059d73e4c3492c19b555476b2fb45ca9	2024-11-11T18:06:11-08:00

Ishiba survived a rare runoff to remain Japan's prime minister but will face turmoil	TOKYO (AP) — Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, battered in parliamentary elections last month, has survived a rare runoff vote against the opposition to remain the country's leader but he still faces turmoil ahead. One of his top priorities is dealing with the aftermath of a major corruption scandal in the long-ruling Liberal Democratic Party, in which dozens of lawmakers from the party are alleged to have pocketed profits from event ticket sales as kickbacks. Ishiba also now has a much-emboldened, opposition eager to push through policies long stymied by the LDP. Support ratings for his Cabinet have fallen to about 30%. Here is a look at what's happening in Japan's tumultuous politics, and what it might mean for Ishiba and his government as they prepare to navigate a second term of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump. Why did the vote in parliament take place? A parliamentary vote for a new leader is mandatory within 30 days of a general election. In the past that was mostly ignored as the head of the LDP usually enjoyed a majority in the Lower House, the more powerful of Japan’s two-chamber parliament. This time, though, because Ishiba's LDP and its junior coalition partner lost its majority in the recent election, the runoff on Monday couldn't be avoided — the first in 30 years. What's next for the prime minister? Opposition's top leader, Yoshihiko Noda, has noted that nearly half of all lower house steering committees are now headed by the opposition. That’s a huge change from the pre-election domination of the LDP, which controlled all but three of the 27 committees. 'We are going to have a new landscape in Japanese politics,' Noda said. Twelve of the committees in key areas, including budget, political reforms, national security and legal affairs, will be headed by Noda’s Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan and two other main opposition groups. What's certain is that the era of LDP’s one-sided rule is over, for now, and the opposition has a chance to achieve policies long opposed by the ruling conservatives, including on issues like gender equality and diversity. Noda last Friday said a legal committee that is now headed by his party’s gender equality chief, Chinami Nishimura, is aiming to achieve a civil code revision to allow married couples the option of keeping separate surnames. That change has been stalled by LDP conservatives for 30 years despite widespread support by the public and a United Nations panel on discrimination against women. Who is the opposition kingmaker? Yuichiro Tamaki is head of the conservative Democratic Party for the People, which quadrupled its seats to 28 in the election. The vote elevated his party from a fringe group to a major player. He is now being cast as a potential key to Ishiba’s survival. A Harvard-educated former Finance Ministry bureaucrat, the 55-year-old Tamaki has seen success by pushing for the raising of a basic tax-free income allowance and an increase of take-home wages. His messages on social media have appealed to younger voters, who have long been ignored by LDP policies catering to conservative elderly. Ishiba apparently seems to find Tamaki’s 28-member DPP an attractive partner to secure a majority. The two parties, which have common ground in some areas — including support for greater nuclear energy use and a stronger military — have started policy talks. Ishiba met with both Tamaki and Noda on Monday but Tamaki may be cautious about moving too close to a scandal-plagued LDP ahead of another election next year. Noda is struggling to form a unified opposition to force a change of government, which he says is his next goal. What does this mean for Ishiba's government? For Ishiba, the 'hung parliament' requires him to win over opposition forces so he can push his policies. While considered unstable, it might also provide a chance for a more consensus-based policy making process, experts say. 'I’m taking the current situation positively as a chance to get our opposition voice heard more carefully,' Tamaki said. Ishiba also faces challenges of restoring unity in his own party. A number of senior LDP lawmakers are waiting to overthrow Ishiba, though their priority is to resolidify their footholds, not infighting — and nobody is eager to do damage control at this difficult time anyway. 'The (Ishiba) administration is quite unstable. ... He will have to get opposition parties' cooperation every time he wants to get a bill approved, which could stall policies,' said University of Tokyo political science professor Yu Uchiyama. And even if Ishiba survives politically in the coming months, there could be a call for his replacement ahead of next elections. 'Japan is likely to return to a period of short-lived government,' Uchiyama said. How does this affect Japan's diplomacy, security and ties with Trump? Ishiba congratulated Trump hours after his victory and in a brief telephone conversation, they agreed to closely work together to further elevate their alliance. While experts say Trump understands the importance of U.S.-Japan relations, he may — as he did in his first administration — pressure Japan to pay more for the cost of 50,000 U.S. troops in Japan or to buy more expensive American weapons. Trump's possible tariff proposals could also hurt Japanese exporters. Ishiba on Saturday renewed his pledge to pursue an ongoing military buildup plan under a strategy that calls for a counter-strike capability with long-range cruise-missiles. He has long advocated a more equal Japan-U.S. security alliance but could face difficulty pursuing those plans. 'It will be a fantastic experiment to see if a national unity government can get Japan through until the next election,' said Michael Cucek, an expert in Japanese politics at Temple University in Japan. ___ Follow AP's Asia-Pacific coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/asia-pacific	https://apnews.com/article/japan-ishiba-politics-trump-f43d8609e64d42588db7b2b090c54c0c	2024-11-11T16:09:01-08:00	
Trump asks Rep. Mike Waltz, China hawk, to be his national security adviser	WASHINGTON (AP) — President-elect Donald Trump has asked U.S. Rep. Michael Waltz, a retired Army National Guard officer and war veteran, to be his national security adviser, a person familiar with the matter said Monday. The nod came despite simmering concerns on Capitol Hill about Trump tapping members of the House, where the final tally is still uncertain and there are worries about pulling any GOP members from the chamber because that would force a new election to fill the empty seat. The person spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the matter before Trump made a formal announcement. The move would put Waltz at the forefront of a litany of national security crises — ranging from the ongoing effort to provide weapons to Ukraine and escalating worries about the growing alliance between Russia and North Korea to the persistent attacks in the Middle East by Iran proxies and the push for a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas and Hezbollah. Waltz, a three-term GOP congressman from east-central Florida, was the first Green Beret elected to the U.S. House, and easily won reelection last week. He has been chairman of the House Armed Services subcommittee on readiness and a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. Waltz is an ardent Trump advocate who backed efforts to overturn the 2020 election. He is considered hawkish on China, and called for a U.S. boycott of the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing due to its involvement in the origin of COVID-19 and its ongoing mistreatment of the minority Muslim Uighur population. He has been a sharp critic of the chaotic U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan and has called on the U.S. to hold accountable those who bear responsibility for the deaths of the 13 U.S. service members at Abbey Gate and for 'thousands of Americans and allies behind enemy lines.' He has also repeated Trump’s frequent complaints about a so-called 'woke' military that the former president has derided as soft and too focused on diversity and equity programs. In a statement last year, Waltz said that as head of the readiness subcommittee: 'I am ready to get to work to better equip our military and turn our focus away from woke priorities and back to winning wars. Our national security depends on it.' A graduate of Virginia Military Institute, Waltz was a Green Beret. He served in the active-duty Army for four years before moving to the Florida Guard. While in the Guard he did multiple combat tours in Afghanistan, the Middle East and Africa and was awarded four Bronze Stars, including two with valor. He also worked in the Pentagon as a policy adviser when Donald Rumsfeld and Robert Gates were defense chiefs. 'President-Elect Trump will begin making decisions on who will serve in his second Administration soon,' said Karoline Leavitt, a spokesperson for the Trump transition. 'Those decisions will be announced when they are made.' Richard Goldberg, who served at the National Security Council during Trump’s first term, called Waltz an impressive pick whose background as an elite U.S. service member and experience on Capitol Hill will be of great value to Trump. 'With fires raging across the world right now, Waltz is well positioned to help the President put out those fires,' said Goldberg, who is now a senior adviser at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies in Washington. Waltz's selection was first reported by The Wall Street Journal. — AP writers Jill Colvin in New York and Zeke Miller and Aamer Madhani in Washington contributed.	https://apnews.com/article/trump-national-security-adviser-mike-wlatz-0c81d044c9ffe18dfd745202e8351b9c	2024-11-11T15:41:40-08:00	
New Zealand's leader formally apologizes to survivors of abuse in state and church care	WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — New Zealand's Prime Minister Christopher Luxon made a 'formal and unreserved' apology in Parliament on Tuesday for the widespread abuse, torture and neglect of hundreds of thousands of children and vulnerable adults in care. 'It was horrific. It was heartbreaking. It was wrong. And it should never have happened,' Luxon said, as he spoke to lawmakers and a public gallery packed with survivors of the abuse. An estimated 200,000 people in state, foster and faith-based care suffered 'unimaginable' abuse over a period of seven decades, a blistering report released in July said at the end of the largest inquiry ever undertaken in New Zealand. They were disproportionately Māori, New Zealand’s Indigenous people. 'For many of you it changed the course of your life, and for that, the government must take responsibility,' Luxon said. He said he was apologizing for previous governments too. In foster and church care — as well as in state-run institutions, including hospitals and residential schools — vulnerable people 'should have been safe and treated with respect, dignity and compassion,' he added. 'But instead, you were subjected to horrific abuse and neglect and in some cases torture.' The findings of the six-year investigation believed to be the widest-ranging of comparable probes worldwide were a 'national disgrace,' the inquiry's report said. New Zealand's investigation followed two decades of such inquiries around the globe as nations struggle to reckon with authorities’ transgressions against children removed from their families and placed in care. Of 650,000 children and vulnerable adults in New Zealand's state, foster, and church care between 1950 and 2019 — in a country that today has a population of 5 million — nearly a third endured physical, sexual, verbal or psychological abuse. Many more were exploited or neglected. 'We will never know that true number,' Chris Hipkins, the leader of the opposition, told Parliament. 'Many people entering into state and faith-based institutions were undocumented. Records were incomplete, they've gone missing, and in some cases, yes, they were deliberately destroyed.' In response to the findings, New Zealand’s government agreed for the first time that historical treatment of some children in a notorious state-run hospital amounted to torture — a claim successive administrations had rejected. 'I am deeply sorry that New Zealand did not do better by you. I am sorry you were not believed when you came forward to report your abuse,' Luxon said. 'I am sorry that many abusers were not made to face justice which meant that other people experienced abuse that could have been prevented.' His government was working on 28 of the inquiry's 138 recommendations, Luxon said, although he did not yet have concrete details on financial redress, which the inquiry had exhorted since 2021 and said could run to billions of dollars. Luxon was decried by some survivors and advocates earlier Tuesday for not divulging compensation plans alongside the apology. He told Parliament a single redress system would be established in 2025. He did not, however, suggest a figure for the amount the government expected to pay. 'There will be a big bill, but it's nothing compared to the debt we owe those survivors and it must not be the reason for any further delay,' said Hipkins, the opposition leader. Survivors began to arrive at Parliament hours before the apology, having won spots in the public gallery — which only seats about 200 people — by ballot. Some were reluctant to accept the state's words, because they said the scale of the horror was not yet fully understood by lawmakers and public servants. Jeering was so loud during an apology from the country's solicitor-general that her speech was inaudible. Others called out or left the room in tears while senior public servants from relevant health and welfare agencies spoke before Luxon's remarks. Survivors invited to give speeches were required to do so before Luxon's apology — rather than in response to it, said Tu Chapman, one of those asked to speak. 'Right now I feel alone and in utter despair at the way in which this government has undertaken the task of acknowledging all survivors,' she told a crowd at Parliament. The abuse 'ripped families and communities apart, trapping many into a life of prison, incarceration, leaving many uneducated,' said Keith Wiffin — a survivor of abuse in a notorious state-run boys' home. 'It has tarred our international reputation as an upholder of human rights, something this nation likes to dine out on.' The inquiry's recommendations included seeking apologies from state and church leaders, among them Pope Francis. It also endorsed creating offices to prosecute abusers and enact redress, renaming streets and monuments dedicated to abusers, reforming civil and criminal law, rewriting the child welfare system and searching for unmarked graves at psychiatric facilities. Its writers were scathing about how widely the abuse — and the identities of many abusers — were known about for years, with nothing done to stop it. 'This has meant you have had to re-live your trauma over and over again,' said Luxon. 'Agencies should have done better and must commit to doing so in the future.' He did not concede that public servants or ministers in his government who had denied state abuse was widespread when they served in previous administrations should lose their jobs. Luxon has also rejected suggestions by survivors that policies he has enacted which disproportionately target Māori — such as crackdowns on gangs and the establishment of military-style boot camps for young offenders — undermine his government's regret about the abuse. Māori are over-represented in prisons and gangs. In 2023, 68% of children in state care were Māori, although they are less than 20% of New Zealand's population. 'It's not enough to say sorry,' said Fa’afete Taito, a survivor of violent abuse at another state-run home, and a former gang member. 'It's what you do to heal the wounds of your actions and make sure it never happens again that really counts.'	https://apnews.com/article/child-abuse-care-zealand-state-faith-foster-294b014a126cb8c067e1da16a94f4cc7	2024-11-11T13:52:28-08:00	
Amsterdam police warn of fresh calls for unrest a day after rioters torch a tram	THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — A senior police officer warned Tuesday of calls for more rioting in Amsterdam, after dozens of people armed with sticks and firecrackers set a tram on fire Monday night as the city faces tensions following violence last week targeting fans of an Israeli soccer club. Olivier Dutilh, of the Amsterdam police force, told a court hearing that 'we have signals that there are calls for similar' unrest in the west of the city. Police said the fire Monday was quickly extinguished and riot officers cleared the square. Images online showed people damaging property and setting firecrackers. There were no reports of any injuries. Police said it was not clear who started the unrest and whether it was related to what happened last week. Some rioters could be heard on video shared on social media using slurs against Jewish people. Police noted the tense atmosphere since five people were treated in the hospital and dozens detained Thursday following a Maccabi Tel Aviv-Ajax match. Youths on scooters and on foot went in search of Israeli fans, punching and kicking them and then fleeing to evade police, according to Amsterdam’s mayor. Pro-Palestinian demonstrators were banned by local authorities from gathering outside the stadium. Before the match, Maccabi fans also tore a Palestinian flag off a building in Amsterdam and chanted anti-Arab slogans on their way to the stadium. There were also reports of Maccabi fans starting fights. Dutch police announced five new arrests Monday in their investigation into that earlier violence. The suspects are men aged 18 to 37 and are from Amsterdam or surrounding cities. Four are still in custody; the fifth has been released but remains a suspect. Earlier, police said that four other men who had been arrested last week would remain in custody while the investigation continues. Two of those are minors, a 16-year old and a 17-year old from Amsterdam. The other two men are from Amsterdam and a nearby city. Police said they have identified over 170 witnesses and have taken forensics evidence from dozens. Prime Minister Dick Schoof said they were also examining videos posted to social media. Schoof was meeting with community leaders Tuesday afternoon to discuss antisemitism. Reports of antisemitic speech, vandalism and violence have been on the rise in Europe since the start of the war in Gaza, and tensions mounted in Amsterdam ahead of Thursday night’s match. The mayor has banned all demonstrations in the city and declared several parts of Amsterdam risk zones where police can stop and check anyone. D ozens were detained on Sunday for taking part in a pro-Palestinian demonstration in central Amsterdam that had been outlawed. A small demonstration was ended by police Tuesday outside Amsterdam City Hall during a debate about the unrest, Dutch broadcaster NOS reported.	https://apnews.com/article/netherlands-tensions-tram-israeli-fans-20c8af43b8a72fa6bd9bab938ce7bd89	2024-11-11T11:45:20-08:00	
Thousands rally outside Georgian parliament to demand a new election towards European integration	TBILISI, Georgia (AP) — Thousands of opposition supporters rallied Monday in Georgia’s capital in continuing protests against the ruling party's declared victory in the Oct. 26 parliamentary election amid allegations that Russia helped rig the vote. The protesters waved Georgian and European Union flags and gathered outside the Georgian parliament. They demanded a new parliamentary election under international supervision and an investigation into the alleged election fraud. Giorgi Vashadze, leader of Unity National Movement Coalition, vowed that the opposition will 'fight until the end.' 'Elections were massively rigged, that is why we don’t recognize election results,' he said. 'Our goal is new elections, our goal is to form a new government, which will drive Georgia to European integration.' Opposition leaders have vowed to boycott sessions of parliament and hold regular protests until their demands are met. The Central Election Commission said the governing Georgian Dream party won about 54% of the vote. Its leaders have rejected the opposition claims of vote fraud. European election observers said the election took place in a 'divisive' atmosphere marked by instances of bribery, double voting and physical violence. The opposition has accused Georgian Dream, which was established by Bidzina Ivanishvili, a shadowy billionaire who made his fortune in Russia, of becoming increasingly authoritarian and tilted toward Moscow. It has recently adopted laws similar to those used by the Kremlin to crack down on freedom of speech and LGBTQ+ rights. President Salome Zourabichvili, who has rejected the official results, says Georgia has fallen victim to pressure from Moscow against joining the EU. Zourabichvili, who holds a mostly ceremonial position, has urged the United States and EU to support the demonstrations. Officials in Washington and Brussels have urged a full investigation of the election, while the Kremlin has rejected the accusations of interference. Many Georgians viewed the parliamentary election as a pivotal referendum on the country’s effort to join the EU. The EU suspended Georgia’s membership application process indefinitely because of its passage in June of a Russian-style 'foreign influence law.' Lawmakers from several EU nations attended Monday’s rally in a show of solidarity with protesters. 'Somebody is trying to take your freedom, somebody is trying to take your democracy, your country, your membership in EU and NATO,' Zygimantas Pavilionis, a Lithuanian parliament member, said at the rally. 'Don’t give up. Fight for your freedom, fight for your democracy, fight for your country , fight for your membership in EU and NATO.'	https://apnews.com/article/georgia-opposition-protest-election-eu-russia-2ffe964513ec147d6d4e128bd212fd52	2024-11-11T10:51:42-08:00	
Haiti’s main airport shuts down as gang violence surges and a new prime minister is sworn in	PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) — Haiti’s international airport shut down on Monday after gangs opened fire at a commercial flight landing in Port-Au-Prince, prompting some airlines to temporarily suspend operations as the country swore in a new interim prime minister who promised to restore peace. The Spirit Airlines flight headed from Fort Lauderdale, Florida, to Port-Au-Prince was just hundreds of feet from landing in Haiti's capital when gangs shot at the plane striking a flight attendant, who suffered minor injuries, according to the airline, the U.S. Embassy and flight tracking data. The flight was diverted and landed in the Dominican Republic. Photos and videos obtained by The Associated Press show bullet holes dotting the interior of a plane. The shooting appeared to be part of what the U.S. Embassy called 'gang-led efforts to block travel to and from Port-au-Prince which may include armed violence, and disruptions to roads, ports, and airports.' Spirit, JetBlue and American Airlines said Monday they were canceling flights to and from Haiti. In other parts of Haiti’s capital, firefights between gangs and police broke out. Rounds of gunfire echoed through the streets as heavily armed officers ducked behind walls and civilians ran in terror. In other upper class areas, gangs set fire to homes. Schools closed as panic spread in a number of areas. The turmoil comes a day after a council meant to reestablish democratic order in the Caribbean nation fired the interim prime minister Garry Conille, replacing him with businessman Alix Didier Fils-Aimé. The council has been marked by infighting and three members were recently accused of corruption. As he was sworn in, Fils-Aimé said his top priorities were to restore peace to the crisis-stricken nation and hold elections, which haven’t been held in Haiti since 2016. 'There is a lot to be done to bring back hope' he said before a room of suit-clad diplomats and security officials. 'I'm deeply sorry for the people ... that have been victimized, forced to leave everything they own.' The country has seen weeks of political chaos, which observers warned could result in even more violence in a place where bloodshed has become the new normal. The country's slate of gangs have long capitalized on political turmoil to make power grabs, shutting down airports, shipping ports and stirring chaos. The United Nations estimates that gangs control 85% of the capital of Port-au-Prince, while a U.N.-backed mission led by Kenyan police to quell gang violence struggles with a lack of funding and personnel, prompting calls for a U.N. peacekeeping mission. Louis-Henri Mars, executive director of Lakou Lapè, an organization working on peace building in violent areas of Haiti, said the political fighting has 'allowed the gangs to have more freedom to attack more neighborhoods in the city and expand their control of Port-au-Prince.' Civilians, he fears, will suffer the consequences. 'There will be more lives lost, more internal displacement, and more hunger in a country where half the population is on the brink of starvation,' he said. The transitional council was established in April, tasked with choosing Haiti’s next prime minister and Cabinet with the hope that it would help quell violence, which exploded after Haitian President Jovenel Moïse was assassinated in 2021. The council was meant to pave the way to democratic elections, but it has been plagued with politics and infighting, and has long been at odds with Conille, the interim prime minister they hand picked six months ago, who they fired yesterday. Gangs have capitalized on that power vacuum to make their own power grabs. Conille railed against the council's decision to fire him, calling it an illegal overreach of their powers. 'This resolution, taken outside of any legal and constitutional framework, raises serious concerns about its legitimacy and its repercussions on the future of our country,' he wrote in a letter. Organizations including the Organization of American States tried and failed last week to mediate disagreements in an attempt to save the fragile transition. On Monday, U.N. spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric urged all involved in Haiti's democratic transition 'to work constructively together,' although he stopped short of offering an opinion on the move to oust Conille. 'Overcoming their differences and putting the country first remains critical,' he said. 'What is important is that Haitian political leaders put the interests of Haiti first and foremost.' —— Associated Press reporter David Koenig contributed to this report from Dallas and Pierre-Richard Luxama, contributed from Port-au-Prince, Haiti. ——- Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america	https://apnews.com/article/haiti-airport-gang-violence-5a8a96a179f26fb6cde1265483e5f4b5	2024-11-11T10:30:56-08:00	
Italy's plan to screen migrants in Albania hits another snag with 2nd group returning to Italy	MILAN (AP) — Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni’s program to screen asylum seekers outside of European Union borders in Albania hit another snag on Monday when a court in Rome refused to rule on a formal request to detain seven migrants transferred to the Balkan nation last week. The decision means the seven migrants, hailing from Bangladesh and Egypt, will be brought to Italy by naval ship, just days after their arrival in Albania. It is a repeat of what happened with the first 12 migrants in the program, who also were returned to Italy by another court decision last month shortly after the opening of two migrant screening centers in Albania operated by Italy. In both cases, courts referred the cases to the EU court of justice in Luxembourg to rule if the countries of origin for the migrants are considered safe countries for repatriation. The first 12 were also from Egypt and Bangladesh. The courts’ move has raised the ire of Meloni’s far-right-led government, which has been seeking strategies for easing the strain on Italy of the arrival of migrants seeking a better life in Europe. In the latest decision, the court specified that it was seeking clarification on which countries are designated as safe 'only to identify which procedure to apply.' 'The exclusion of a state from the list of safe countries of origin does not prevent the repatriation and/or expulsion of those migrants whose asylum applications has been rejected,’’ the court said in its ruling. Under a five-year deal, Albania would allow Italy to run two migrant centers on its territory with the capacity to screen up to 3,000 migrants a month to be vetted for asylum or returned to their home countries. Human rights groups and nongovernmental organizations active in the Mediterranean have slammed the agreement as a dangerous precedent that conflicts with international laws. So far, Italy has failed to identify anywhere close to that number for possible screening in Albania, despite thousands of arrivals on Italian shores since the centers opened. Migrants sent to Albania must be adult males, traveling without family members, and come from countries deemed safe.	https://apnews.com/article/italy-albania-migrants-meloni-1a5b74afb20cf6db5e2994047d6e5d92	2024-11-11T10:15:05-08:00	
Anti-government protesters blame rampant corruption for roof crash that killed 14 people in Serbia	BELGRADE, Serbia (AP) — Anti-government protesters in Serbia on Monday demanded arrests and the resignations of top officials over the deadly collapse of a concrete roof at a railway station that killed 14 people in a northern city this month. The rally in Belgrade blamed the collapse on rampant corruption and sloppy renovation work on the station building in Novi Sad — part of a wider deal with Chinese state companies involved in a number of infrastructure projects in the Balkan country. Borislav Novakovic, a former mayor of Novi Sad, accused the ruling populists of 'filling their bloody pockets while filling cemeteries in Serbia.' The state was 'responsible for the crime that took 14 lives,' he added. The crowd chanted 'jail' in response. The several thousand protesters demanded that Prime Minister Milos Vucevic and his government step down and that those responsible for the collapse be arrested. Authorities have opened an investigation and Serbia’s construction minister submitted his resignation last week, but no one has been charged or detained in connection with Nov. 1 accident. Monday's rally was peaceful, unlike one last week in Novi Sad when masked people threw rocks, bottles and red paint at City Hall after thousands marched peacefully. Police used tear gas against the rioters. Government officials have promised full accountability, but there is widespread skepticism because the populists control both the police and the judiciary. The train station, originally built in 1964, has been renovated twice in recent years and was inaugurated by Serbia's President Aleksandar Vucic and his populist ally, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, over two years ago as a major stopover for a planned fast train line between Belgrade and Budapest.	https://apnews.com/article/serbia-roof-collapse-protest-vucic-3b095359268663a4ea77eec0cada6e7b	2024-11-11T09:42:10-08:00	
Here are the people Trump has picked for key positions so far	President-elect Donald Trump is starting to fill key posts in his second administration, putting an emphasis so far on aides and allies who were his strongest backers during the 2024 campaign. Here's a look at who he's selected so far. Susie Wiles, chief of staff Wiles, 67, was a senior adviser to Trump's 2024 presidential campaign and its de facto manager. Wiles has a background in Florida politics. She helped Ron DeSantis win his first race for Florida governor. Six years later, she was key to Trump's defeat of him in the 2024 Republican primary. Wiles’ hire was Trump’s first major decision as president-elect and one that could be a defining test of his incoming administration considering her close relationship with the president-elect. Wiles is said to have earned Trump's trust in part by guiding what was the most disciplined of Trump's three presidential campaigns. Wiles was able to help keep Trump on track as few others have, not by criticizing his impulses, but by winning his respect by demonstrating his success after taking her advice. Tom Homan, ‘border czar’ Homan, 62, has been tasked with Trump’s top priority of carrying out the largest deportation operation in the nation’s history. Homan, who served under Trump in his first administration leading U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, was widely expected to be offered a position related to the border, an issue Trump made central to his campaign. Though Homan has insisted such a massive undertaking would be humane, he has long been a loyal supporter of Trump's policy proposals, suggesting at a July conference in Washington that he would be willing to 'run the biggest deportation operation this country’s ever seen.' Democrats have criticized Homan for his defending Trump's 'zero tolerance' policy on border crossings during his first administration, which led to the separation of thousands of parents and children seeking asylum at the border. Elise Stefanik, United Nations ambassador Stefanik is a representative from New York and one of Trump's staunchest defenders going back to his first impeachment. Elected to the House in 2014, Stefanik was selected by her GOP House colleagues as House Republican Conference chair in 2021, when former Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney was removed from the post after publicly criticizing Trump for falsely claiming he won the 2020 election. Stefanik, 40, has served in that role ever since as the third-ranking member of House leadership. Stefanik’s questioning of university presidents over antisemitism on their campuses helped lead to two of those presidents resigning, further raising her national profile. If confirmed, she would represent American interests at the U.N. as Trump vows to end the war waged by Russia against Ukraine begun in 2022. He has also called for peace as Israel continues its offensive against Hamas in Gaza and its invasion of Lebanon to target Hezbollah. Stephen Miller, deputy chief of staff for policy Miller, an immigration hardliner, was a vocal spokesperson during the presidential campaign for Trump's priority of mass deportations. The 39-year-old was a senior adviser during Trump's first administration. Miller has been a central figure in some of Trump's policy decisions, notably his move to separate thousands of immigrant families. Trump argued throughout the campaign that the nation's economic, national security and social priorities could be met by deporting people who are in the United States illegally. Since Trump left office in 2021, Miller has served as the president of America First Legal, an organization made up of former Trump advisers aimed at challenging the Biden administration, media companies, universities and others over issues such as free speech and national security.	https://apnews.com/article/trump-staff-picks-stefanik-wiles-stephen-miller-tom-homan-243d73610b03a3ee18c4d5f68756af7c	2024-11-11T09:18:18-08:00	
The Netherlands follows Germany and others in bringing in extra border checks	THE HAGUE (AP) — The Dutch government said on Monday that it will bring in extra checks at its land borders to combat irregular migration, similar to a policy brought in by Germany in September. It is the latest move by the country’s hard-right government aimed at reining in immigration, as anti-foreigner sentiment surges across Europe. Dutch Migration Minister Marjolein Faber announced the policy in a press release after the move got the green light from the Cabinet. 'It is time to tackle irregular migration and migrant smuggling in a concrete way. That is why we will start reintroducing border controls in the Netherlands from the beginning of December,' she said in a statement. The measure will take effect on Dec. 9. Under European Union law, countries must give Brussels four weeks notice before restricting freedom of movement. Earlier this year, Faber told Brussels the Netherlands also wanted to opt out of EU refugees obligations. Geert Wilders, whose anti-immigration party won the largest share of seats in elections last year, posted on social media that his PVV party 'delivers.' Wilders has been calling for closing Dutch borders for more than a decade. Faber, who represents Wilders’ party in the Cabinet, did not specify how the border controls would be carried out. The move comes with no extra funding for the national policy force response for border checks. The six-month restrictions must be done 'within the existing capacity,' the statement says. The Netherlands has hundreds of land border crossings with neighboring Germany and Belgium. Currently, the police carry out spot checks. Faber says the border controls must be carried out with as little hindrance as possible to traffic. Germany began carrying out similar checks on the border with France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg and Denmark last month following several high-profile attacks by extremists. Germany and the Netherlands are both part of the Schengen area, the border-free travel zone which includes most EU member states, as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland. According to the EU, member states are allowed to temporarily reintroduce controls at the EU’s so-called internal borders in case of a serious threat, such as one to internal security. But it also says border controls should be applied as a last resort in exceptional situations, and must be time-limited.	https://apnews.com/article/netherlands-eu-germany-borders-immigration-schengen-72c920cb3bcbec9890ce2d5215c7c758	2024-11-11T09:11:05-08:00	
35 dead as a driver hits a crowd at sports center in a southern Chinese city	BANGKOK (AP) — A driver killed 35 people and severely injured another 43 when he deliberately rammed his car into people exercising at a sports center in the southern Chinese city of Zhuhai, police said Tuesday. Police had detained a 62-year-old man at the sports center in the southern Chinese city of Zhuhai following the ramming late Monday, on the eve of the country’s premier aviation exhibition by the People’s Liberation Army that's hosted annually in the city. Police identified the man only by his family name of Fan, consistent with the practice by Chinese authorities. Fan was discovered in the car with a knife, with wounds to his neck thought to be self-harm injuries, according to the statement. He is unconscious and receiving medical care. He was dissatisfied with the split of financial assets in his divorce, according to a preliminary investigation, police said. For almost 24 hours after the crime took place, it was unclear what the death or injury toll was. One of the four hospitals that took in people for treatment said it had more than 20 injured, state media reported Monday. AP reporters call to the hospitals in the city were unanswered, or directed towards other hospitals. On Tuesday morning, searches for the incident on Chinese social media were heavily censored on Chinese social media platforms. A search on Weibo for the sports center only turned up a few posts, with only a couple referring to the fact something had happened, without pictures or details. Articles by Chinese media about the incident from Monday night were taken down. Outside of China's Great Firewall, on X, however, videos were able to circulate. They were shared by news blogger and dissident Li Ying, who is better known on X as Teacher Li. His account posts daily news based on user submissions. Dozens of people were lying prone on the running track in the sports center in the videos. In one, a woman says 'my foot is broken.' That same video showed a firefighter performing CPR on a person, as people were told to leave the scene. Chinese internet censors take extra care to scrub social media ahead of and during major events, such as the meeting of the National People’s Congress, where the government announces its major policy initiatives for the coming year. The sports center for the city district of Xiangzhou regularly attracts hundreds of residents, where they can run on the track field, play soccer and social dance. Following the incident, the center announced it would be closed until further notice. China has seen a number of attacks in which suspects appear to target random people such as schoolchildren. In October, a 50-year-old man was detained after he allegedly used a knife to attack children at a school in Beijing. Five people were injured. In September, three people were killed in a knife attack in a Shanghai supermarket. ___ Associated Press reporters Elsie Chen and Didi Tang contributed from Washington, and researcher Yu Bing contributed from Beijing.	https://apnews.com/article/china-crash-crowd-zhuhai-3db25fd49b1313c462bbf4e0214f3834	2024-11-11T08:34:46-08:00	
US top climate negotiator: 'We won't revert back' as Trump prepares to take over	BAKU, Azerbaijan (AP) — No matter what kind of U-turn President-Elect Donald Trump will make on climate change, America's clean energy economy won't reverse into the dirty past, a combative but 'bitterly disappointed' top American climate negotiator said Monday. During the first day of the U.N. climate talks, COP29, Climate Adviser John Podesta struck a defiant but realistic tone in a press conference. He said Trump will likely pull the United States out of the landmark Paris Agreement and try to roll back many of the Biden Administration's signature climate moves, including the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act that included $375 billion in climate spending. 'Are we facing new headwinds? Absolutely. But we won’t revert back to the energy system of the 1950s. No way,' Podesta said. 'Setbacks are unavoidable, but giving up is unforgivable,' Podesta said paraphrasing a Biden speech last week. 'This is not the end of our fight for a cleaner, safer planet. Facts are still facts. Science is still science. The fight is bigger than one election, one political cycle in one country. This fight is bigger, still, because we are all living through a year defined by the climate crisis in every country of the world.' During the campaign, Trump said would pull America from the Paris Agreement, rollback parts of the IRA and increase drilling and oil production. He has called emissions regulations part of a 'green new scam' and claimed, without evidence, that offshore wind turbines harm whales. During Trump's first administration, between 2017 and 2021, many environmental regulations were rolled back, later to be reversed by the Biden administration. The incoming Trump administration has signaled it plans to now undo Biden's changes. During his press conference, Podesta ran through a shopping list of climate disasters, starting with the hottest day recorded, July 22, continuing with floods, hurricanes and droughts. 'None of this is a hoax. It is real. It’s a matter of life and death,' Podesta said. 'Fortunately, many in our country and around the world are working to prepare the world for this new reality and to mitigate the most catastrophic effects of climate change.' Podesta said the Biden administration is still negotiating even as it prepares to leave. 'We are here to work, and we are committed to a successful outcome at COP29,' Podesta said. 'We can and will make real progress on the backs of our climate committed states and cities, our innovators, our companies and our citizens, especially young people who understand more than most that climate change poses an existential threat that we cannot afford to ignore.' Another senior U.S. official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said other countries are still working with American diplomats because they care what the U.S. thinks and any agreement struck here must be by consensus. Outside analysts had speculated the U.S. would be ignored. 'In January, we’re going to inaugurate a president whose relationship to climate change is captured by the words ‘hoax’ and ‘fossil fuels’,' Podesta said. 'He’s vowed to dismantle our environmental safeguards and once again withdraw United States from the Paris Agreement. That is what he said. And we should believe him.' ___ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations. AP is solely responsible for all content.

Israel's military is building along UN-patrolled demilitarized zone in Syria, satellite images show	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Israel has begun a construction project along the so-called Alpha Line that separates the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights from Syria, apparently laying asphalt for a road right along the frontier, satellite photos analyzed by The Associated Press show. Israeli troops have entered the demilitarized zone during the work, the United Nations confirmed to the AP, a violation of the cease-fire rules governing the area. The work, which earlier satellite photos show began in earnest in late September, follows the completion by the Israeli military of new roadways and what appears to be a buffer zone along the Gaza Strip's frontier with Israel. The Israel military also has begun demolishing villages in Lebanon, where United Nations peacekeepers have come under fire. So far, there has been no major violence along the Alpha Line, which delineates the demilitarized zone between Syria and Israeli-occupied territory that U.N. peacekeepers have patrolled since 1974. Syria, which has been at war with Israel since its founding in 1948 and relies on Iran for support, has remained silent regarding the construction. But the Golan Heights remain a flashpoint for the two countries — making any changes along the border potentially that much more sensitive. The Israeli military did not respond to requests for comment and Syrian officials in Damascus declined to comment. High-resolution images taken on Nov. 5 by Planet Labs PBC for the AP show over 7.5 kilometers (4.6 miles) of construction along the Alpha Line, starting some 3 kilometers (1.8 miles) southeast of the Israeli-held Druze town of Majdal Shams, where a July rocket strike killed 12 children playing soccer. The images appear to show a trench between two embankments, parts of which appear to have been laid with fresh asphalt. There also appears to be fencing running along it as well toward the Syrian side. The construction follows a southeast route before heading due south along the Alpha Line, and then again cutting southeast. The images show excavators and other earth-moving equipment actively digging along the route, with more asphalt piled there. The area is also believed to be littered with unexploded ordnance and mines from decades of conflict. The United Nations maintains a peacekeeping force in the demilitarized zone called the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force, or UNDOF. 'In recent months, UNDOF has observed construction activity being carried out by the IDF along the cease-fire line,' U.N. peacekeeping spokesperson Nick Birnback told the AP, using an acronym for the Israeli military. 'In this regard, UNDOF has observed in some instances, IDF personnel, Israeli excavators, other construction equipment and the construction itself encroach into the area of separation.' Birnback added that 'no military forces, equipment or activity by either Israel or Syria are permitted in the area of separation.' While Israel hasn’t acknowledged the construction, it sent a 71-page letter in June to the U.N. outlining what it described as 'Syrian violations of the Alpha Line and armed presence in the area of separation (that) occur daily.' The letter cited numerous Israeli-alleged violations by Syrian civilians crossing the line. 'Syrian violations of that agreement only heighten tensions in our already volatile region,' the letter added. Syria has repeatedly accused Israel of launching attacks against it from territory it occupies in the Golan Heights. Israel has repeatedly struck Syria over the years, particularly after the start of the Mideast wars following Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, assault on Israel. Syrian President Bashar Assad, who has clung to power despite his country's long war stemming from the 2011 Arab Spring protests, criticized Israel during a summit in Saudi Arabia in which leaders discussed Israel's wars in both the Gaza Strip and Lebanon. 'As for the tools, I believe that we possess them collectively, popularly and officially, Arabs and Muslims, countries and people,' Assad said. 'What we need is the decision to use them if the Israeli entity refuses to respond. ... Without that, we are inciting the continuation of the genocide and becoming indirect partners in it.' Israel seized control of the Golan Heights from Syria in the 1967 Mideast war. After the 1973 Mideast war, the U.N. Secretary Council voted to create UNDOF to patrol a roughly 400 square kilometer (155 square mile) demilitarized zone and maintain the peace there. A second demarcation, known as the Bravo Line, marks the limit of where the Syrian military can operate. UNDOF has around 1,100 troops, mostly from Fiji, India, Kazakhstan, Nepal and Uruguay, who patrol the area. Israel annexed the Golan Heights in 1981 — a move criticized by a U.N. resolution declaring Israel’s action as 'null and void and without international legal effect.' The territory, some 1,200 square kilometers (460 square miles) in size, is a strategic high ground that overlooks both Israel and Syria. The population of around 50,000 Jewish settlers and Arabs who are mostly members of the Druze sect of Shiite Islam. In 2019, President Donald Trump unilaterally announced that the United States would 'fully recognize' Israel’s control of the territory, a decision that has been unchanged by the Biden administration.	https://apnews.com/article/mideast-israel-syria-alpha-line-construction-6f1bf012a39f721ab36f33f1c6bea2b6	2024-11-11T07:04:13-08:00	
Kremlin rejects reports of a conversation last week between Putin and Trump	The Kremlin on Monday rejected reports that President Vladimir Putin spoke last week with President-elect Donald Trump about the war in Ukraine, and a spokesman for Trump refused to comment on what he called his 'private calls' with world leaders. The Washington Post first reported on Sunday, citing anonymous sources, that the two spoke on Thursday, with Trump advising Putin not to escalate the war in Ukraine and cited the sizable U.S. military presence in Europe. In a conference call Monday with journalists, Kremlin press secretary Dmitry Peskov said 'there was no conversation' and the report was 'completely untrue, it is pure fiction.' Asked about the report, Trump's communications director Steven Cheung said, 'We do not comment on private calls between President Trump and other world leaders.' Speaking at a foreign policy forum Thursday in Russia's Black Sea resort of Sochi, Putin offered congratulations to Trump on his election victory and praised him for what he said was 'brave' behavior during an assassination attempt on him in July. Peskov said 'there are no specific plans yet' for a conversation between Putin and Trump. He said previously that contacts between the two before Trump's inauguration 'are not ruled out' and pointed to Trump saying that he would call Putin before the inauguration. He denied, however, that Russia's presidential administration or Foreign Ministry had any contacts with Trump's campaign after the election. During his campaign, Trump repeatedly said he could quickly end the fighting in Ukraine but did not offer details of how he would accomplish that. Russia has intensified strikes on civilian areas in Ukraine as the war approaches its 1,000-day mark. For its part, Ukraine over the weekend sent a massive wave of drones that rattled Moscow and its suburbs.	https://apnews.com/article/putin-trump-ukraine-russia-fbd7df1a924cb9c343d426370416086e	2024-11-11T05:44:21-08:00	
Vatican, Microsoft create AI-generated St. Peter's Basilica to allow virtual visits, log damage	VATICAN CITY (AP) — The Vatican and Microsoft on Monday unveiled a digital twin of St. Peter’s Basilica that uses artificial intelligence to explore one of the world’s most important monument’s while helping the Holy See manage visitor flows and identify conservation problems. Using 400,000 high-resolution digital photographs, taken with drones, cameras and lasers over four weeks when no one was in the basilica, the digital replica is going online alongside two new on-site exhibits to provide visitors -- real and virtual -- with an interactive experience. 'It is literally one of the most technologically advanced and sophisticated projects of its kind that has ever been pursued,' Microsoft's president Brad Smith told a Vatican press conference. The project has been launched ahead of the Vatican's 2025 Jubilee, a holy year in which more than 30 million pilgrims are expected to pass through the basilica’s Holy Door, on top of the 50,000 who visit on a normal day. 'Everyone, really everyone should feel welcome in this great house,' Pope Francis told Smith and members of the project's development teams at an audience Monday. The digital platform allows visitors to reserve entry times to the basilica, a novelty for one of the world’s most visited monuments that regularly has an hours-long line of tourists waiting to get in. But the heart of the project is the creation of a digital twin of St. Peter’s Basilica through advanced photogrammetry and artificial intelligence that allows anyone to 'visit' the church and learn about its history. The ultra-precise 3D replica, developed in collaboration with digital preservation company Iconem, incorporates 22 petabytes of data — enough to fill five million DVDs — Smith said. The images have already identified structural damage and signs of deterioration, such as missing mosaic pieces, cracks and fissures invisible to the naked eye, with a speed and precision far beyond human capabilities. Francis has called for the ethical use of AI and used his annual World Message of Peace this year to urge an international treaty to regulate it, arguing that technology lacking human values of compassion, mercy, morality and forgiveness were too great. On Monday, he thanked the Microsoft team and basilica workers responsible for the project and marveled at how modern technology was helping spread an ancient faith and preserve a piece of world patrimony, which celebrates the 400th anniversary of its consecration in 2026. 'This house of prayer for all peoples has been entrusted to us by those who have preceded us in faith and apostolic ministry,' he told Smith and the delegation. 'Therefore, it is a gift and a task to care for it, in both a spiritual and material sense, even through the latest technologies.' Smith declined to give a price tag for Microsoft’s investment in the project, saying only it was 'substantial' and was borne of Francis’ initiative in 2018 to bring tech companies together to promote ethnically minded AI. He said Microsoft had done similar AI projects at Mont Saint-Michel in France and Ancient Olympia, in Greece. ___ Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

Trump chooses New York Rep. Elise Stefanik as ambassador to the United Nations	NEW YORK (AP) — President-elect Donald Trump has chosen Rep. Elise Stefanik to serve as his ambassador to the United Nations, picking a loyal ally with little foreign policy experience to represent the U.S. at the international organization. 'Elise is an incredibly strong, tough, and smart America First fighter,' Trump said in a statement Monday announcing his pick for the role — his first selection that will require Senate confirmation. Stefanik, 40, who serves as House Republican Conference Chair, has long been one of Trump's most loyal allies in the House, and was among those discussed as a potential vice presidential choice. She will be thrown into the world body’s deep divisions from the wars in the Mideast and Ukraine to reining in nuclear programs in North Korea and Iran. She will also come face-to-face almost daily in the U.N. Security Council with the ambassadors of Russia and China whose countries are now strongly allied and looking warily at a second Trump presidency – and sometimes with their counterparts from North Korea and Iran. Stefanik will succeed U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield, a career diplomat and former assistant secretary of state for Africa who has held the job through the entire Biden administration and has been a member of his Cabinet. Stefanik also will be a member of Trump's Cabinet, he said in the statement. In Trump’s first administration, he chose former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley, who had little foreign experience except for some trade missions, for the U.N. post. She resigned after two years and then challenged Trump for the GOP nomination. Haley was succeeded by then U.S. ambassador to Canada Kelly Craft, wife of a Kentucky coal magnate, who in 2023 was unsuccessful in her bid for the GOP nomination for governor of the state. John Bolton, a former U.S. national security adviser under Trump and ambassador to the U.N. during the Bush administration, told The Associated Press that he sees Stefanik as the 2024 version of Haley. 'She wants to run for president in 2028. She realizes she has no foreign policy experience so what better way than to become U.N. ambassador,' Bolton said. 'She stays two years, and then away we go.' Born and raised in upstate New York, Stefanik graduated from Harvard and worked in former President George W. Bush’s White House on the domestic policy council and in the chief of staff’s office. In 2014, at 30, she became the youngest woman ever elected to Congress, representing upstate New York. She later became the youngest woman to serve in House leadership. Stefanik was known early in her tenure as a more moderate conservative voice. But she soon attached herself to the former president, quietly remaking her image into that of a staunch MAGA ally — and seeing her power ascend. She became the House Republican Conference Chair in 2021. Stefanik spent years positioning herself as one of Trump’s most trusted allies and confidants on the Hill. She endorsed him in the 2024 race before he had even launched his bid, and aggressively campaigned on his behalf during the GOP primary. She saw her profile rise after her aggressive questioning of a trio of university presidents over antisemitism on their campuses led to two of their resignations — a performance Trump repeatedly praised. She also defended him vigorously in both of his impeachment trials and railed against his four criminal indictments, including filing an ethics complaint in New York against the judge who heard his civil fraud case. While she is a member of the House Armed Services Committee and serves on the coveted House committee that oversees national intelligence, her pick further solidifies Trump’s preference for unconditional loyalty in his second administration over career experience. One area of foreign policy that Stefanik has been vocal about is Israel. Since the start of the Israel-Hamas war, Stefanik has focused much of her attention on the United Nations, accusing the world body and international organizations of antisemitism for their criticism of Israel’s bombardment of Gaza, which has resulted in the death of more than 43,000 Palestinians, according to their Health Ministry. She has gone as far as calling last month for a 'complete reassessment' of U.S. funding for the United Nations, while helping push for the blocking of American support for the U.N. agency that provides humanitarian aid to Palestinians in the region. Her departure for the United Nations would also mean that Republicans, who are on track to have a razor-thin majority in the House, would be down one crucial vote. But Stefanik’s district is located in a deeply red part of upstate New York, where Republicans are likely guaranteed to win the special election that would take place after she leaves office. 'Republicans will hold this safe Republican seat as part of a Republican majority in the House that will help deliver on President Trump’s historic mandate,' Ed Cox, the chair of the New York Republican party, said in a statement Monday. Trump did not say much about the U.N. during his campaign, but has generally advocated for a less interventionist foreign policy. He also has repeatedly questioned the utility of international alliances, including NATO, and he has threatened allies with higher tariffs and said he will not protect them unless they contribute more to their own defense. Trump also has talked about how he initially wanted to select his eldest daughter, Ivanka Trump, for the role after he was elected the first time. ''You would be a great ambassador to the United Nations, United Nations secretary.' There’d be nobody to compete with her, I tell you,' he said at a Moms for Liberty Summit in August. 'She may be my daughter, but nobody could have competed with her.' ___ Amiri reported from Washington.	https://apnews.com/article/trump-united-nations-elise-stefanik-ambassador-2b482fb39a8d6f03d389d27cc8820056	2024-11-11T04:27:53-08:00	
Today in History: November 17, the NFL’s infamous 'Heidi Game'	Today is Sunday, Nov. 17, the 322nd day of 2024. There are 44 days left in the year. Today in history: On Nov. 17, 1968, the last minutes of a tense NFL matchup on NBC between the New York Jets and the Oakland Raiders were preempted by the children’s film 'Heidi.' The network received thousands of calls from angry viewers and formally apologized. Also on this date: In 1800, Congress held its first session in the partially completed U.S. Capitol building in Washington, D.C. In 1869, the Suez Canal opened in Egypt. In 1973, President Richard Nixon told a gathering of Associated Press managing editors at a televised news conference in Orlando, Florida: 'People have got to know whether or not their president is a crook. Well, I’m not a crook.' In 1989, an estimated 10,000-15,000 Czechoslovakian students demonstrated in Prague against Communist rule; hundreds of thousands joined the protests in the following days. Dubbed the 'Velvet Revolution' for its nonviolent nature, the protests led to the resignation of the Communist Party’s leadership on Nov. 28. In 1997, 62 people, most of them foreign tourists, were killed when militants opened fire at the Temple of Hatshepsut (haht-shehp-SOOT’) in Luxor, Egypt; the attackers were killed by police. In 2003, Arnold Schwarzenegger, the Austrian-born actor who had become one of America’s biggest movie stars of the 1980s and ’90s, was sworn in as the 38th governor of California. In 2020, President Donald Trump fired the nation’s top election security official, Christopher Krebs, who had refuted Trump’s unsubstantiated claims of electoral fraud and vouched for the integrity of the vote. Today’s Birthdays: Film director Martin Scorsese (skor-SEH’-see) is 82. Actor-model Lauren Hutton is 81. Actor-director Danny DeVito is 80. Basketball Hall of Fame coach Jim Boeheim is 80.

Russian glide bombs, drones and a ballistic missile kill 6, injure 30 in Ukraine	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Russian glide bombs, drones and a ballistic missile smashed into cities in southern and eastern Ukraine on Monday, officials said, killing at least six civilians and injuring about 30 others. Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that Russia has recently intensified strikes that have long tormented civilian areas, in an apparent effort to unnerve Ukrainians and wear down their willingness to keep up a war that is approaching its 1,000-day milestone. 'Every day, every night, Russia commits the same terror,' Zelenskyy said in a post on the Telegram messaging app. 'Except that an increasing number of civilian objects are becoming targets.' Both Russia and Ukraine are waiting to see how Washington will change its policy on the war after Donald Trump takes office as the U.S. president in January. The U.S. is the biggest provider of military help to Ukraine, but Trump has chided the Biden administration for giving Kyiv tens of billions of dollars of aid. The Ukrainian army intends to expand its mobile units, which are primarily tasked with shooting down drones, in the regions most frequently targeted by Russian strikes, Zelenskyy said on Telegram. He also said that Ukraine is working on producing its own glide bombs as part of a domestic missile program. Russian glide bombs have significantly impacted the battlefield, as their destructive power reduces settlements to rubble and makes it increasingly difficult for Ukrainian forces to hold their defensive fortifications. Ukrainian forces are being slowly pushed backward in the eastern Donetsk region, where Russia is bringing its greater military might to bear. Zelenskyy said Ukraine would conduct a 'substantial reinforcement' in areas near the Donetsk settlements of Kurakhove and Pokrovsk, where Ukraine’s army is in danger of being overrun. Zelenskyy added that Ukraine is holding its positions in Russia’s Kursk border region, where Western and Ukrainian officials say Russia is being helped by thousands of newly arrived North Korean troops. He said Russia has deployed some 50,000 troops to Kursk. Also in Donetsk, near the recently captured settlement of Hirnyk, the Russians have damaged a dam at the Kurakhove reservoir, regional Gov. Vadym Filashkin said. The local water level in the Vovcha River has risen by 1.2 meters, though no homes have been affected, and possible flooding threatens both the Donetsk and Dnipropetrovsk regions, he said. 'We continue to monitor the water level in the river and are prepared for any developments,' Filashkin said. The development revived memories of the collapse of the Kakhovka dam in southern Ukraine in June 2023, killing hundreds of people. An Associated Press investigation found the collapse was likely caused by Russian forces. The major cities struck Monday by Russia are close to the approximately 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line. Russian drones hammered the southern city of Mykolaiv, killing five people and injuring a 45-year-old woman, local authorities said. Around two dozen people sought psychological help following the attack that damaged houses and stores, officials said. Mykolaiv, about 60 kilometers (40 miles) northwest of the front line in the Kherson region, frequently comes under Russian attack. An overnight attack on Zaporizhzhia, also in the south, with three powerful glide bombs killed one person and injured 21, including a 4-year-old boy, Ukraine’s National Police said. The strikes partially destroyed a two-story apartment building and damaged a dormitory. A five-story apartment building in Kryvyi Rih, Zelenskyy’s hometown in central Ukraine, was hit by a Russian ballistic missile, injuring at least eight people. The missile destroyed all five stories in one part of the building, said Oleksandr Vikul, head of Kryviy Rih Military Administration. Meanwhile, Ukraine’s intelligence agency claimed in a statement it destroyed a Russian Mi-24 assault helicopter parked at the Klin-5 airfield in the Moscow region. The claim could not be independently verified. The Russian Defense Ministry said Monday that 17 Ukrainian drones were destroyed over the Russian regions of Kursk, Belgorod and Voronezh overnight and in the morning. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-drones-bombs-missiles-c10b8419748e8874f331ea185439c8b5	2024-11-11T02:32:35-08:00	
17 Chadian soldiers and 96 rebels killed in a Boko Haram attack, army says	N'DJAMENA, Chad (AP) — Boko Haram insurgents killed 17 Chadian soldiers in a weekend attack on a military post that also left 96 of the assailants dead in the country's west, Chad's army said. The attack in the Lake Chad region happened on Saturday, army spokesperson Gen. Issakh Acheikh said on national television Sunday night. He did not provide details. The Lake Chad region has been plagued this year by frequent attacks from insurgents, including Boko Haram and the Islamic State in West Africa. It has revived fears of violence after a period of peace following a successful operation launched in 2020 by the Chadian army to destroy the extremist groups' bases. Last month, 40 soldiers were killed during an attack on a military base, prompting President Mahamat Deby Itno to launch an operation to dislodge Boko Haram militants from Lake Chad. In March, an attack the government blamed on Boko Haram killed seven soldiers. Boko Haram, which launched an insurgency more than a decade ago against Western education, seeks to establish Islamic law in Nigeria’s northeast. The insurgency has spread to West African neighbors including Cameroon, Niger and Chad. Chad, a country of nearly 18 million people, has been reeling from political turmoil before and after a controversial presidential election that resulted in Deby Itno’s victory. He had led the country as interim president during the period of military rule that followed the death of his father in 2021.	https://apnews.com/article/chad-boko-haram-attack-lake-chad-ab1759cb14e8d0b98d533c60cc6170d5	2024-11-11T00:50:33-08:00	
Remembering Armistice Day: Starmer joins Macron to celebrate Franco-British friendship in Paris	PARIS (AP) — British Prime Minister Keir Starmer is joining French President Emmanuel Macron at a Paris ceremony marking the 106th anniversary of the Armistice on Monday. It's a celebration of their countries' friendship, as nations across the world pay tribute to their fallen soldiers in World War I. This is the first time a British leader has done so since Winston Churchill was hosted by Gen. Charles de Gaulle in 1944, Starmer's office said. The Paris ceremony echoes Franco-British commemorations 80 years ago, when Allied troops liberated most of France's territory from Nazi occupation, Macron's office said. This year also marks the 120th anniversary of the Entente Cordiale, the historic agreement between France and the United Kingdom. On Monday morning, Starmer and Macron will first meet at the Elysee presidential palace, before heading toward the Champs-Elysees avenue to lay wreaths at the nearby statues of Georges Clemenceau, French prime minister at the time of the Armistice, and Churchill. They will then lead the traditional ceremony at the Arc de Triomphe monument where they will relight the flame of the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. The French Army Choir is to sing France’s national anthem, 'La Marseillaise,' and the British anthem, 'God Save the King.' 'I am honored to be in Paris to stand united with President Macron in tribute to the fallen of the First World War who made the ultimate sacrifice for the freedom we enjoy today,' Starmer said. The prime minister also announced that the British government has earmarked more than 10 million pounds for next year’s 80th anniversary of the Allied victory in Europe and the subsequent defeat of Japan ending World War II.	https://apnews.com/article/armistice-wwi-commemorations-france-britain-50917f6b1af41a27cfc84417def76fe8	2024-11-10T23:16:56-08:00	
Middle East latest: Israeli strike kills 3 people in central Gaza, Palestinian officials say	Palestinian medical officials say an Israeli strike hit a tent sheltering a displaced family in the central Gaza Strip, killing at least three people, including the parents of twins. The strike late Sunday in the urban Nuseirat refugee camp wounded the two children, aged 10, who were being treated for serious injuries at the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in the nearby city of Deir al-Balah. The details of the casualties were listed in hospital records and an Associated Press reporter saw two of the bodies. The Israeli military says it only targets militants and accuses them of hiding among civilians. Palestinians reported heavy bombing late Sunday in the western areas of Nuseirat camp, which dates back to the 1948 war surrounding Israel’s creation. At least 24 people were wounded and taken to the Awda hospital in Nuseirat, said Mohamed Muhareb, head of the hospital’s ambulance service. The Israel-Hamas war began after militants stormed into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people — mostly civilians — and abducting 250 others. Israel’s military response in Gaza has killed more than 43,000 people, Palestinian health officials say. They do not distinguish between civilians and combatants, but say more than half of those killed were women and children. Hezbollah began firing into Israel on Oct. 8, 2023, in solidarity with Hamas in the Gaza Strip. Since the conflict erupted, more than 3,100 people have been killed and nearly 13,900 wounded in Lebanon, the Health Ministry reported. ___ Here's the latest: UN says more than 200 children have been killed in war in Lebanon BEIRUT — The United Nations children’s agency says the war between Israel and Hezbollah has killed more than 200 children in Lebanon. They include seven children who were among 23 people killed in an Israeli airstrike in northern Lebanon on Sunday. UNICEF said protecting children from harm during war is a legal obligation and called for a cease-fire. Lebanon’s Health Ministry says at least 3,189 people have been killed and over 14,000 wounded in Lebanon in more than a year of conflict between Israel and the Hezbollah militant group. Some 1.2 million people have been displaced. On the Israeli side, 68 soldiers and 41 civilians have been killed in the fighting since October 2023, according to the prime minister’s office. More than 60,000 people have been displaced from their homes. Hezbollah began firing rockets, missiles and drones into Israel, and drawing retaliatory strikes, the day after Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023 attack out of Gaza ignited the war there. Hezbollah and Hamas are allies backed by Iran. Hezbollah acknowledged the killing of nearly 500 of its fighters in the first 11 months of the conflict but stopped updating that toll after all-out war erupted in September. Yemen's Houthi rebels say they launched a missile targeting Israel DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Yemen’s Houthi rebels on Monday claimed they launched a missile targeting Israel. Houthi military spokesman Brig. Gen. Yahya Saree made the claim in a prerecorded video message, claiming that the rebels launched a Palestine-2 ballistic missile he described as a 'hypersonic' toward a military base. The Israeli military said it 'intercepted one projectile that approached Israel from the direction of Yemen.' The Israelis also said the fire did not enter Israeli territory. The Houthis have launched missiles and targeted ships through the Red Sea corridor over the ongoing Mideast wars. The rebels separately said sites in the country came under attack in likely U.S. airstrikes early Monday morning, something not immediately acknowledged by the Americans. Senior UAE diplomat calls for de-escalation in Mideast wars DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — A senior diplomat for the United Arab Emirates called on the world to focus on the plight of civilians and de-escalate the ongoing Mideast wars. Anwar Gargash’s remarks Monday, made at the Abu Dhabi Strategic Debate, followed the pattern of comments made by the UAE amid the Mideast wars. The UAE, a federation of seven sheikhdoms home to Dubai, diplomatically recognized Israel in 2020. 'The complexities of the region require a steady hand and a clear and consistent vision,' Gargash said. 'The recent cycle of escalation between Israel and Iran cannot become a permanent feature of the strategic landscape of our region. This must be addressed through a political framework.' He called for 'pragmatism' and a 'serious political horizon' to resolve the wider Israeli-Palestinian conflict and reach a two-state solution. He described the war in the Gaza Strip as being 'driven by extremists on both sides, from the Israeli and Arab side.' Yet he also called the 'systemic violence' faced by Palestinians in Gaza 'criminal and unacceptable.' He added: 'At the present time, it is vital to identify that not all crises stem from the Palestinian issue, yet it undeniably remains central to the conflict in our region.' The UAE has provided aid for both the Gaza Strip and Lebanon in the wars, while maintaining its diplomatic ties with Israel. The UAE has, however, strenuously criticized Israel’s conduct at times in public in the wars. Gargash also offered criticism of governance in both the Palestinian territories and Lebanon. 'In both Palestine and Lebanon, a drastic reform is essential for the world to step in and provide considerable support,' Gargash said. ___ For more Middle East news: https://apnews.com/hub/middle-east	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-hezbollah-mideast-latest-11-november-2024-8c59ef1c325baf6267bedd8ca4bf4aa6	2024-11-10T22:11:49-08:00	
Round 2 in the Trump-vs-Mexico matchup looks ominous for Mexico	MEXICO CITY (AP) — Mexico is facing a second Donald Trump presidency, and few countries can match its experience as a target of Trump's rhetoric: There have been threats to close the border, impose tariffs and even send U.S. forces to fight Mexican drug cartels if the country doesn’t do more to stem the flow of migrants and drugs. That’s not to mention what mass deportations of migrants who are in the U.S. illegally could do to remittances — the money sent home by migrants — that have become one of Mexico’s main sources of income. But as much as this second round looks like the first round — when Mexico pacified Trump by quietly ceding to his immigration demands — circumstances have changed, and not necessarily for the better. Today, Mexico has in Claudia Sheinbaum a somewhat stern leftist ideologue as president, and Trump is not known for handling such relations well. Back in 2019, Mexico’s then-President Andrés Manuel Lopez Obrador was a charismatic, plain-spoken, folksy leader who seemed to understand Trump, because both had a transactional view of politics: You give me what I want, I’ll give you what you want. The two went on to form a chummy relationship. But while López Obrador was forged in the give-and-take politics of the often-corrupt former ruling party, the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, Sheinbaum grew up in a family of leftist activists and got her political experience in radical university student movements. 'Claudia is more ideological than López Obrador, and so the problem is that I see her potentially responding to Trumpian policies, whether it’s, you know, organized crime or immigration or tariffs with a much more nationalistic, jingoistic view of the relationship,' said Arturo Sarukhan, Mexico’s former ambassador to the U.S. from 2007 to 2013. Sheinbaum made a point of being one of the first world leaders to call Trump on Thursday to congratulate him after the election, but during the call Trump did two things that may say a lot about how things will go. First, Sheinbaum said, Trump quickly brought up the border to remind her there were issues there. Then he asked Sheinbaum to send his greetings to López Obrador, with whom Trump said he had 'a very good relationship.' That might suggest that Trump believes that López Obrador — the new president's political mentor — is still in charge, a view shared by some analysts. Sarukhan said he believes the fact that Sheinbaum is a woman and is from Mexico will be 'a very important challenge, an issue out there as both of them get going in their relationship.' Not everything has changed for the worse: C ross-border trade has topped $800 billion per year and U.S. companies are more dependent than ever on Mexican plants. But the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement, or USMCA, is coming up for review, and Mexico has made legal changes that Trump could seize on to demand a re-negotiation of parts of the deal. Sheinbaum has suggested Mexico won't give in even if backed into a corner, saying 'we obviously are going to address any problems that come up with dialogue, as a collaborative process, and if not, we are going to stand up, we are prepared to do that with great unity.' Standing up hasn’t worked particularly well before. In 2018, Marcelo Ebrard was Mexico’s top diplomat; former U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Ebrard basically bent to U.S. demands to keep asylum seekers in Mexico and accept migrants back even if they weren’t Mexicans. Ebrard just asked that the deal not be made public to avoid embarrassing López Obrador, Pompeo wrote. (Ebrard later claimed he had avoided signing a much worse ‘safe third country’ agreement.) Today, Ebrard is Mexico’s economy secretary, and would lead Mexico’s delegation in the scheduled 2026 review of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada free trade agreement, something that Trump has greeted with mirth ('I've never seen anybody fold like that,' Trump once said of Ebrard.) Ebrard on Thursday downplayed any risks this time around, saying e conomic ties between the two countries would keep Trump from closing borders or imposing tariffs. 'I am optimistic. Unlike other countries, we are the largest trading partner (of the U.S.), so, if you put up a tariff, that will have repercussions in the United States,' Ebrard said. 'I’m not saying it is going to be easy, because it is not at all easy, but the relationship with President Trump will be good because, what unites us? These numbers, this gigantic economy.' But some former diplomats say any argument that Mexico can avoid friction with the Trump administration is overconfident, and that 2025 is not necessarily going to be like 2019. Martha Bárcena, Mexico’s ambassador to the U.S. from 2018 to 2021, said she doesn't think Trump would back away from campaign promises to deport migrants who are in the country illegally. She said Mexican officials who believe Trump might temper his 'campaign promises because Mexican migrants are necessary for the U.S. economy' are being overly optimistic. 'Mexico is looking at it through the lens of economic logic. The logic that the Trump campaign applies on immigration is a logic of national security and cultural identity issues,' Bárcena said. Some of Trump's biggest policy concerns – restoring U.S. jobs and the increasing rivalry with China — also run through Mexico. U.S. and foreign automakers have set up dozens of plants in Mexico, and some in the U.S. worry that Chinese companies could do the same to take advantage of existing trade rules to export Chinese cars or auto parts to the United States. It doesn’t help that Sheinbaum has pushed through López Obrador’s policies aimed at eliminating independent regulatory and oversight bodies, and laws the U.S. government says could reduce the independence of the judiciary, both of which are required under the USMCA trade agreement. 'If they go ahead with the elimination of independent regulators and autonomous bodies, that’s going to be a further violation of the USMCA,' Sarukhan said. 'And then that’s going to make things even worse. Obviously, the big piece is going to be China and the Chinese footprint in Mexico.' That could lead Trump to demand the re-negotiation of all auto industry agreements under the trade pact. As far as efforts to jointly combat the illegal drug trade — such cooperation fell to historic lows in 2019 and 2020 — there have been some modestly encouraging signs. Last week, Mexico announced the seizure in Tijuana of over 300,000 fentanyl pills after months when t he country’s entire seizures had amounted to as little as 50 grams — a couple of ounces — per week. Sheinbaum, who took office on Oct. 1, also appears to be tacitly abandoning López Obrador’s strategy of not confronting drug cartels. But neither she nor her predecessor and political mentor could ever accept any Trump plan to send U.S. forces to operate independently on Mexican soil. It remains to see how far Trump might go; he often makes only token gestures to carry through on threats. But Sarukhan noted, 'I do think that he will talk loudly and carry a big stick.'	https://apnews.com/article/mexico-donald-trump-threats-tariffs-border-closing-deportations-b9f11e55911613cf72ac1d5695bba5ec	2024-11-10T21:06:10-08:00

Research reveals China has built prototype nuclear reactor to power aircraft carrier	Bangkok (AP) — China has built a land-based prototype nuclear reactor for a large surface warship, in the clearest sign yet Beijing is advancing toward producing the country’s first nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, according to a new analysis of satellite imagery and Chinese government documents provided to The Associated Press. There have long been rumors that China is planning to build a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, but the research by the Middlebury Institute of International Studies in California is the first to confirm it is working on a nuclear-powered propulsion system for a carrier-sized surface warship. Why is China's pursuit of nuclear-powered carriers significant? China’s navy is already the world’s largest numerically, and it has been rapidly modernizing. Adding nuclear-powered carriers to its fleet would be a major step in realizing its ambitions for a true 'blue-water' force capable of operating around the globe in a growing challenge to the United States. Nuclear carriers take longer to build than conventional carriers, but once in operation they are able to stay at sea for much longer because they do not need to refuel, and there is more room on board for fuel and weapons for aircraft, thus extending their capabilities. They are also able to produce more power to run advanced systems. Right now, only the United States and France have nuclear-powered carriers. The U.S. has 11 in total, which allows it to keep multiple strike groups deployed around the world at all times, including in the Indo-Pacific. But the Pentagon is growingly increasingly concerned about China’s rapid modernization of its fleet, including the design and construction of new carriers. China currently has three carriers, including the new Type 003 Fujian, which was the first both designed and built by China. It has said work is already underway on a fourth, but it has not announced whether that will be nuclear or conventionally powered. The modernization aligns with China’s 'growing emphasis on the maritime domain and increasing demands' for its navy 'to operate at greater distances from mainland China,' the Defense Department said in its most recent report to Congress on China’s military. How did researchers conclude China has built a prototype reactor for a carrier? Middlebury researchers were initially investigating a mountain site outside the city of Leshan in the southwest Chinese province of Sichuan over suspicions that China was building a reactor to produce plutonium or tritium for weapons. Instead they said they determined that China was building a prototype reactor for a large warship. The conclusion was based upon a wide variety of sources, including satellite images, project tenders, personnel files, and environmental impact studies. The reactor is housed in a new facility built at the site known as Base 909, which is under the control of the Nuclear Power Institute of China. Documents indicating that China’s 701 Institute, which is responsible for aircraft carrier development, procured reactor equipment 'intended for installation on a large surface warship.' as well as the project’s 'national defense designation' helped lead to the conclusion the sizeable reactor is a prototype for a next-generation aircraft carrier. What does China say? Chinese President Xi Jinping has tasked defense officials with building a 'first-class' navy and becoming a maritime power as part of his blueprint for the country’s great rejuvenation. The country’s most recent white paper on national defense, dated 2019, said the Chinese navy was adjusting to strategic requirements by 'speeding up the transition of its tasks from defense on the near seas to protection missions on the far seas.' Sea trials hadn’t even started for the new Fujian aircraft carrier in March when Yuan Huazhi, political commissar for China’s People’s Liberation Army Navy, confirmed the construction of a fourth carrier. Asked if it would be nuclear-powered, he said at the time that would 'soon be announced,' but so far it has not been. Neither China's Defense Ministry nor Foreign Affairs Ministry responded to requests for comment. Even if the carrier that has been started will likely be another conventionally-powered Type 003 ship, experts say Chinese shipyards have the capability to work on more than one carrier at a time, and that they could produce a new nuclear-powered vessel concurrently. ___ Tang reported from Washington D.C.	https://apnews.com/article/china-nuclear-aircraft-carrier-glance-8863fefa646e4a9d89c45d91c068696d	2024-11-10T20:18:35-08:00	
Satellite images and documents indicate China working on nuclear propulsion for new aircraft carrier	BANGKOK (AP) — China has built a land-based prototype nuclear reactor for a large surface warship, in the clearest sign yet Beijing is advancing toward producing its first nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, according to a new analysis of satellite imagery and Chinese government documents provided to The Associated Press. China’s navy is already the world’s largest numerically, and it has been rapidly modernizing. Adding nuclear-powered carriers to its fleet would be a major step in realizing its ambitions for a true 'blue-water' force capable of operating in seas far from China in a growing global challenge to the United States. 'Nuclear-powered carriers would place China in the exclusive ranks of first-class naval powers, a group currently limited to the United States and France,' said Tong Zhao, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington, D.C. 'For China’s leadership, such a development would symbolize national prestige, fueling domestic nationalism and elevating the country’s global image as a leading power.' Researchers at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies in California said they made the finding while investigating a mountain site outside the city of Leshan in the southwest Chinese province of Sichuan, where they suspected China was building a reactor to produce plutonium or tritium for weapons. Instead they concluded that China was building a prototype reactor for a large warship. The project at Leshan is dubbed the Longwei, or Dragon Might, Project and is also referred to as the Nuclear Power Development Project in documents. Neither China’s Defense Ministry nor Foreign Affairs Ministry responded to requests for comment. Satellite images and public documents helped identify likely carrier project There have long been rumors that China is planning to build a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, but the research by the Middlebury team is the first to confirm that China is working on a nuclear-powered propulsion system for a carrier-sized surface warship. 'The reactor prototype at Leshan is the first solid evidence that China is, in fact, developing a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier,' said Jeffrey Lewis, a professor at Middlebury and one of the researchers on the project. 'Operating a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier is an exclusive club, one that China looks set to join.' Drawing on satellite images and public documents including project tenders, personnel files, environmental impact studies — and even a citizen’s complaint about noisy construction and excessive dust — they concluded a prototype reactor for naval propulsion was being built in the mountains of Mucheng township, some 70 miles (112 kilometers) southwest of Sichuan's provincial capital Chengdu. The reactor, which procurement documents indicate will soon be operational, is housed in a new facility built at the site known as Base 909, which houses six other reactors that are operational, decommissioned or under construction, according to the analysis. The site is under the control of the Nuclear Power Institute of China, a subsidiary of the China National Nuclear Corporation, which is tasked with reactor engineering research and testing. Documents indicating that China’s 701 Institute, formally known as China Ship Research and Design Center, which is responsible for aircraft carrier development, procured reactor equipment 'intended for installation on a large surface warship' under the Nuclear Power Development Project as well as the project’s 'national defense designation' helped lead to the conclusion the sizable reactor is a prototype for a next-generation aircraft carrier. Satellite mages from 2020 to 2023 have shown the demolition of homes and the construction of water intake infrastructure connected to the reactor site. Contracts for steam generators and turbine pumps indicate the project involves a pressurized water reactor with a secondary circuit — a profile that is consistent with naval propulsion reactors, the researchers say. An environmental impact report calls the Longwei Project a 'national defense-related construction project' that is classified 'secret.' 'Unless China is developing nuclear-powered cruisers, which were pursued only by the United States and the Soviet Union during the Cold War, then the Nuclear Power Development Project most certainly refers to a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier development effort,' researchers wrote in a detailed 19-page report on their findings shared exclusively with the AP. Jamie Withorne, an analyst at the Oslo Nuclear Project who was not involved in the research and reviewed the findings, said Middlebury's team made a 'convincing argument.' 'From the identifying reports, co-location with other naval reactor facilities, and correlating construction activity, I think it can be said that it is likely the Longwei Project is housed at Base 909, and it could potentially be located at the identified building,' she said. The research does not, however, provide clues as to when a Chinese nuclear-powered carrier could be built and become operational, she said. Sarah Laderman, a senior analyst with Open Nuclear Network, a program of the U.S.-based NGO PAX sapiens foundation, said the findings were 'carefully conducted and thoroughly researched.' 'Given the evidence presented here, I see a compelling case made that China seems to be working towards building a nuclear propulsion system for its naval surface ships (likely aircraft carriers) at this location,' said Laderman, who is based in Vienna and was not involved in Middlebury’s research. Pursuit of a nuclear-powered carrier China’s first carrier, commissioned in 2012, was a repurposed Soviet ship, and its second was built in China but based upon the Soviet design. Both ships — named the Liaoning and the Shandong — employ a so-called 'ski-jump' type launch method, with a ramp at the end of a short runway to help planes take off. The Type 003 Fujian, launched in 2022, was the country's third carrier and its first to be indigenously designed and built. It employs an electromagnetic-type launch system like those developed and used by the U.S. Navy. All three carriers are conventionally powered. Sea trials hadn’t even started for the Fujian in March when Yuan Huazhi, political commissar for China’s People’s Liberation Army Navy, confirmed the construction of a fourth carrier. Asked if it would be nuclear-powered, he said at the time that would 'soon be announced,' but so far it has not been. There has been speculation that China may begin producing two new carriers at once — one Type 003 like the Fujian and one nuclear-powered Type 004 — something that it has not attempted before but that its shipyards have the capacity to do. Matthew Funaiole, senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies’ China Power Project, said he doubts China's next carrier will be nuclear-powered. Instead, he said, he would expect the People's Liberation Army Navy's fourth carrier to focus on optimizing the existing design of the Fujian carrier with 'incremental improvements.' Nick Childs, senior fellow for naval forces and maritime security at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, said the Chinese 'have taken an incremental approach to their carrier development with a number of ambitions that will evolve over time.' 'For now, their deployments have been relatively cautious, remaining largely within range of shore support, but projecting influence and to some extent coercion within their near waters.' Eventually, however, 'larger carriers more akin to their U.S. counterparts will give them more options to project power,' Childs said. It takes several years to build a carrier and bring it into operation, but developing nuclear propulsion for its next generation of warships would eventually give China more power to run advanced systems, such as electromagnetic launchers, radars and new technology weapons, Childs said. 'As well as obviating the need for the ship to refuel regularly and therefore giving it much greater range, nuclear power means that without the need to carry fuel oil for the ship there will be room aboard for fuel and weapons for its aircraft, extending their capabilities,' Childs said. 'Much will depend on what overall size the next carrier is, but the addition of nuclear power will represent a significant step further in China’s carrier development with a vessel more comparable to the U.S. Navy’s carriers.' Zhao, of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said nuclear-powered carriers would provide the Chinese military 'with greater flexibility and endurance to operate around strategic hotspots, especially along the First Island Chain, where most territories disputed by China are located,' said Zhao. The First Island Chain includes the self-governed island of Taiwan, which China claims as its own and vows to annex it by force if necessary. The U.S. is obligated by a domestic law to supply Taiwan with sufficient weapons to deter invasion, and it could provide assistance to the island from its bases in the Pacific in the event of an invasion or blockade. Tensions also have risen in the South China Sea between China and neighboring nations over territorial disputes and maritime claims. 'These carriers could also extend Chinese operations deeper into the Western Pacific, further challenging the U.S. military’s ability to ‘intervene’ in regional matters that China views as best resolved by countries from the region only,' Zhao said. U.S.-China rivalry Chinese President Xi Jinping has tasked defense officials with building a 'first-class' navy and becoming a maritime power as part of his blueprint for the country’s rejuvenation. The country’s most recent white paper on national defense, dated 2019, said the Chinese navy was adjusting to strategic requirements by 'speeding up the transition of its tasks from defense on the near seas to protection missions on the far seas.' The People's Liberation Army Navy is already the world’s largest navy with more than 370 ships and submarines. The country also boasts powerful shipbuilding capabilities: China’s shipyards are building many hundreds of vessels each year, whereas the U.S. is building five or fewer, according to a U.S. congressional report late last year. However, the Chinese navy lags behind the U.S. Navy in many respects. Among other advantages, the U.S. currently has 11 carriers, all nuclear powered, allowing it to keep multiple strike groups deployed around the world at all times, including in the Indo-Pacific. But the Pentagon is growingly increasingly concerned about China’s rapid modernization of its fleet, including the design and construction of new carriers. That aligns with China's 'growing emphasis on the maritime domain and increasing demands' for its navy 'to operate at greater distances from mainland China,' the Defense Department said in its most recent report to Congress on China's military. And China's 'growing force of aircraft carriers extend air defense coverage of deployed task groups beyond the range of land-based defenses, enabling operations farther from China’s shore,' the report said. ___ Tang reported from Washington D.C.	https://apnews.com/article/china-nuclear-aircraft-carrier-3e693365eb914324cc5e6b7dd33df73b	2024-11-10T20:12:17-08:00	
Traumatized by war, hundreds of Lebanon's children struggle with wounds both physical and emotional	BEIRUT (AP) — Curled up in his father ’s lap, clinging to his chest, Hussein Mikdad cried his heart out. The 4-year-old kicked his doctor with his intact foot and pushed him away with the arm that was not in a cast. 'My Dad! My Dad!' Hussein said. 'Make him leave me alone!' With eyes tearing up in relief and pain, the father reassured his son and pulled him closer. Hussein and his father, Hassan, are the only survivors of their family after an Israeli airstrike last month on their Beirut neighborhood. The strike killed 18 people, including his mother, three siblings and six relatives. 'Can he now shower?' the father asked the doctor. Ten days after surgery, doctors examining Hussein's wounds said the boy is healing properly. He has rods in his fractured right thigh and stitches that assembled his torn tendons back in place on the right arm. The pain has subsided, and Hussein should be able to walk again in two months — albeit with a lingering limp. A prognosis for Hussein's invisible wounds is much harder to give. He is back in diapers and has begun wetting his bed. He hardly speaks and has not said a word about his mother, two sisters and brother. 'The trauma is not just on the muscular skeletal aspect. But he is also mentally hurt,' Imad Nahle, one of Hussein’s orthopedic surgeons, said. Israel said, without elaborating, that the strike on the Mikdad neighborhood struck a Hezbollah target. In the war that has escalated since September, Israeli airstrikes have increasingly hit residential areas around Lebanon. Israel accuses the Lebanese militant group of hiding its capabilities and fighters among civilians. It vows to cripple Hezbollah, which began firing into northern Israel after Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack triggered the war in Gaza. But children have been caught in the midst. With more strikes on homes and in residential areas, doctors are seeing more children affected by the violence. More than 100 children have been killed in Lebanon in the past six weeks and hundreds injured. And of the 14,000 wounded since last year, around 10% are children. Many have been left with severed limbs, burned bodies, and broken families — scars that could last for a lifetime. Ghassan Abu Sittah, a renowned British-Palestinian surgeon who is also treating Hussein, sees that long road ahead. This is his worry: 'It leaves us with a generation of physically wounded children, children who are psychologically and emotionally wounded.' ‘What do they want from us?’ At the American University of Beirut Medical Center, which is receiving limited cases of war casualties, Nahle said he operated on five children in the past five weeks — up from no cases before. Most were referred from south and eastern Lebanon. A few miles away, at the Lebanese Hospital Geitaoui, one of the country’s largest burns centers increased its capacity by nearly 180% since September so it could accommodate more war wounded, its medical director Naji Abirached said. About a fifth of the newly admitted patients are children. In one of the burn center’s ICU units lies Ivana Skakye. She turned 2 in the hospital ward last week. Ivana has been healing from burns she sustained following an Israeli airstrike outside their home in southern Lebanon on Sept. 23. Israel launched hundreds of airstrikes that day in different parts of Lebanon, making it the deadliest day of the war so far. More than 500 people were killed. Six weeks later, the tiny Ivana remains wrapped in white gauze from head to toe except her torso. She sustained third-degree burns over 40 percent of her body. Her hair and head, her left side all the way to her legs, both her arms and her chest were burned. Her family home was damaged, its ceiling set afire. The family’s valuables, packed in their car as they prepared to leave, were also torched. Ivana’s older sister, Rahaf, 7, has recovered faster from burns to her face and hands. Fatima Zayoun, their mother, was in the kitchen when the explosion hit. Zayoun jumped up to grab the girls, who were playing on the terrace. It was, Zayoun said, 'as if something lifted me up so that I can grab my kids. I have no idea how I managed to pull them in and throw them out of the window. She spoke from the ICU burns unit. 'They were not on fire, but they were burned. Black ash covered them. ... (Ivana) was without any hair. I told myself, `That is not her.'' Now, Ivana's wound dressings are changed every two days. Her doctor, Ziad Sleiman, said she could be discharged in a few days. She’s back again to saying 'Mama' and 'Bye — shorthand for wanting to go out. Like Hussein, though, Ivana has no home to return to. Her parents fear collective shelters could cause an infection to return. After seeing her kids 'sizzling on the floor,' Zayoun, 35, said that even if their home is repaired, she wouldn’t want to return. 'I saw death with my own eyes,' she said. Zayoun was 17 last time Israel and Hezbollah were at war, in 2006. Displaced with her family then, she said she almost enjoyed the experience, riding out of their village in a truck full of their belongings, mixing with new people, learning new things. They returned home when the war was over. 'But this war is hard. They are hitting everywhere,' she said. 'What do they want from us? Do they want to hurt our children? We are not what they are looking for.' Attacks at home can be hard for kids to deal with Abu Sittah, the reconstructive surgeon, said most of the children's injuries are from blasts or collapsing rubble. That attack on a space they expect to be inviolable can have lingering effects. 'Children feel safe at home,' he said. 'The injury makes them for the first time lose that sense of security — that their parents are keeping them safe, that their homes are invincible, and suddenly their homes become not so.' One recent morning, children were playing in the courtyard of a vocational school-turned-shelter in Dekwaneh, north of Beirut, where nearly 3,000 people displaced from the south are now living. The parents were busy with an overflowing bathroom that serves one floor in a building that houses nearly 700 people. Only playtime brings the children, from different villages in the south, together. They were divided in two teams, ages ranging between 6 and 12, competing to get the handkerchief first. A tiny girl hugged and held hands with strangers visiting the shelter. 'I am from Lebanon. Don't tell anyone,' she whispered in their ears. The game turned rowdy when two girls in their early teens got into a fist fight. Pushing and shoving began. Tears and tantrums followed. The tiny girl walked away in a daze. Maria Elizabeth Haddad, manager of the psychosocial support programs in Beirut and neighboring areas for the U.S.-based International Medical Corps, said parents in shelters reported signs of increased anxiety, hostility and aggression among kids. They talk back to parents and ignore rules. Some have developed speech impediments and clinginess. One is showing early signs of psychosis. 'There are going to be residual symptoms when they grow up, especially related to attachment ties, to feeling of security,' Haddad said. 'It is a generational trauma. We have experienced it before with our parents. ... They don’t have stability or search for (extra) stability. This is not going to be easy to overcome.' New phases of life begin Children represent more than a third of over 1 million people displaced by the war in Lebanon and following Israeli evacuation notices, according to U.N. and government estimates (more than 60,000 people have been displaced from northern Israel). That leaves hundreds of thousands in Lebanon without schooling, either because their schools were inaccessible or have been turned into shelters. Hussein's father says he and his son must start together from scratch. With help from relatives, the two have found a temporary shelter in a home — and, for the father, a brief sense of relief. 'I thank God he is not asking for or about his mother and his siblings,' said Hassan Mikdad, the 40-year-old father. He has no explanation for his son, who watched their family die in their home. His two sisters — Celine, 10, and Cila, 14 — were pulled out of the rubble the following day. His mother, Mona, was pulled out three days later. She was locked in an embrace with her 6-year-old son, Ali. The strike on Oct. 21 also caused damage across the street, to one of Beirut’s main public hospitals, breaking solar panels and windows in the pharmacy and the dialysis unit. The father survived because he had stepped out for coffee. He watched his building crumble in the late-night airstrike. He also lost his shop, his motorcycles and car — all the evidence of his 16 years of family life. His friend, Hussein Hammoudeh, arrived on the scene to help sift through rubble. Hammoudeh spotted young Hussein Mikdad’s fingers in the darkness in an alley behind their home. At first he thought they were severed limbs — until he heard the boy’s screams. He dug out Hussein with glass lodged in his leg and a metal bar in his shoulder. Hammoudeh said he didn’t recognize the boy. He held the child's almost-severed wrist in place. In the hospital now, Hussein Mikdad sipped a juice as he listened to his father and his friend. His father turned to him, asking if he wanted a Spider-Man toy — an effort to forestall a new outburst of tears. He said he buys Hussein a toy each day. 'What I am living through seems like a big lie. ...The mind can’t comprehend,' he said. 'I thank God for the blessing that is Hussein.'	https://apnews.com/article/lebanon-israel-children-wounded-hezbollah-92c8dc4495304af8125172b28278580c	2024-11-10T20:11:20-08:00	
Stock market today: Most of Wall Street rolls higher as bitcoin bounces above $86,000	NEW YORK (AP) — Most U.S. stocks are rising Monday and adding to the gains made during their best week of the year. The S&amp;P 500 was up 0.1% in afternoon trading, and two out of every three stocks in the index were climbing. It's coming off a 4.7% spurt last week spurred by Donald Trump’s presidential victory and a cut to interest rates by the Federal Reserve to bolster the economy. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 322 points, or 0.7%, as of 1:59 p.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite was 0.1% lower. Tesla was the strongest force pushing the S&amp;P 500 higher after rising 8.1%. Its leader, Elon Musk, has become a close ally of Trump’s, and its stock jumped nearly 15% the day after the election and has kept rising. Several pieces of what’s known as the 'Trump trade' also helped drive the market, as investors try to identify which kinds of companies will be winners under a second Trump term. JPMorgan Chase rose 1.2%, and bank stocks broadly continue to benefit from expectations for stronger economic growth, less regulation from Washington and an increase in mergers and acquisitions. A White House more friendly to big tie-ups has helped Wall Street speculate about a merger between insurers Cigna Group and Humana, for example. It’s been so feverish that Cigna said Monday it isn’t pursuing a deal with Humana. Cigna’s stock rose 7.7%, and Humana’s sank 2%. Stocks of companies more focused on the U.S. economy were also rising more than the rest of the market, including a 1.5% rally for the smaller stocks in the Russell 2000 index, because they’re seen as benefiting more from Trump’s America First policies than big multinational companies. Companies are also continuing to deliver earnings reports showing they made more in profit during the summer than analysts expected. Aramark gained 0.8% after it reported broad-based growth during the latest quarter, including for food at stadiums and among customers around the world. They helped offset a drop of 1.9% for Nvidia, which was the heaviest weight on the market and helped drag the Nasdaq composite in particular. AbbVie tumbled 12% after saying trials investigating its treatment for some adults with schizophrenia failed to show statistically significant improvement compared with a placebo group at week six. Some of the sharpest swings were in the crypto market, where bitcoin rose above $86,000 for the first time. Trump has embraced cryptocurrencies generally and pledged to make his country the crypto capital of the world. Bitcoin hit a record of $86,375, according to CoinDesk. Another Trump trade has been a rise in Treasury yields, as traders anticipate potentially higher economic growth, U.S. government debt and inflation because of Trump’s policies. But trading in the bond market is closed Monday in observance of Veterans Day. Treasury yields been generally climbing since September, in large part because the U.S. economy has remained much more resilient than feared. The hope is that it can continue to stay solid as the Federal Reserve continues to cut interest rates in order to keep the job market humming, now that it’s helped get inflation nearly down to its 2% target. But Trump’s win has scrambled expectations for coming cuts to rates. Traders have already begun paring forecasts for how many the Fed will deliver next year. While lower rates can boost the economy, they can also give inflation more fuel. Stock markets abroad have swung following Trump’s election amid worries about increased tariffs and disruptions to global trade. Indexes were mixed Monday, with European markets rising while South Korea’s and Hong Kong’s sank. __ AP Writer Zimo Zhong in Hong Kong contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/stock-markets-interest-rates-china-inflation-72c7ecb237655a0f88b45ac90643fcd2	2024-11-10T18:47:15-08:00	
Japan's parliament reelects struggling leader Ishiba as prime minister	TOKYO (AP) — Japan's parliament reelected Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba on Monday after his governing coalition suffered the worst election loss in more than a decade, forcing the struggling leader to form his second Cabinet in just over a month since taking office. Ishiba’s ruling Liberal Democratic Party and its junior partner Komeito together lost their majority in the 465-seat Lower House, the more powerful of Japan’s two-house parliament, in the Oct. 27 election due to continued voter outrage over financial misconduct by his party and its lukewarm response. A special parliamentary session convened Monday to pick a new leader in a vote required within 30 days of a general election. Ishiba beat top opposition leader Yoshihiko Noda 221-160 in the first runoff in 30 years. Ishiba reappointed most of his previous Cabinet members, including Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya, Defense Minister Gen Nakatani and Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi, but had to replace three who lost seats or were affected by the election results. Ishiba is expected to hold a news conference to explain his new Cabinet and policies. Ishiba has refused to step down and showed willingness to cooperate with additional coalition partners to boost stability and help him pursue his party’s policies. Ishiba will struggle in the coming months as he must gain consent from the opposition on policies including the budget and other legislation, experts say. He is eyeing a rising smaller, conservative opposition, the Democratic Party for the People, whose seats quadrupled to 28 under its popular leader Yuichiro Tamaki, whose proposal for raising the basic tax-free income allowance and increasing take-home wages garnered support from low income and younger voters. Tamaki only wants to cooperate with Ishiba’s party on policy — not as part of a coalition — since he wants to use his leverage to increase his party’s standing ahead of the next election. However, Tamaki was recently stung by a magazine article exposing an extramarital affair, which he admitted to on Monday. Ishiba’s government is preparing for his trip later this month to Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation and Group of 20 summits, as well as a possible meeting with President-elect Donald Trump on his way home. ___ This story has been corrected to show the summit is Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation, not ASEAN.	https://apnews.com/article/japan-politics-ishiba-cabinet-5945feb06a07730a98ebb3e0b46905bd	2024-11-10T18:38:43-08:00	
Storm-weary Philippines forcibly evacuates thousands of villagers as latest typhoon blows near	MANILA, Philippines (AP) — Thousands of people were being forcibly evacuated from 2,500 villages in the northern Philippines on Monday as another typhoon threatened the region already devastated by floods and landslides from three storms in less than a month. Typhoon Toraji was forecast to blow over the mountainous Luzon region, where President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. — just the day before — inspected the damage from the last storm and led the distribution of food packs to residents. Marcos skipped this week’s Asia-Pacific Cooperation forum in Peru to oversee recovery efforts from back-to-back storms. The fast-moving Toraji was about 100 kilometers (62 miles) east of Casiguran town in northeastern Aurora province Monday morning with sustained winds of up to 130 kilometers (81 miles) per hour and gusts of up to 180 kph (112 mph). It’s expected to barrel northwestward across Luzon, weaken as it crosses a mountain range and then blow into the South China Sea. Interior Secretary Jonvic Remulla on Sunday ordered the forcible evacuation of people in 2,500 villages expected to be lashed by Toraji, locally named Nika, warning that the rain-soaked Luzon mountains, valleys and plains were more susceptible to flash floods and landslides. With the typhoon approaching fast, there was little time to move large numbers of people to safety, he said. 'We understand if some would want to stay, but we have to get them out,' Remulla told reporters. The last two typhoons and a tropical storm caused more than 160 deaths, damaged thousands of houses and farmlands and affected more than 9 million people, including hundreds of thousands who fled to emergency shelters, after dumping from one to two months’ worth of rain in just 24 hours in some cities and towns. Overwhelmed, the Philippines received help from Southeast Asian countries led by Singapore, along with longtime treaty ally the United States, to transport food, water and other aid to hard-hit northern provinces. The Philippine archipelago is often battered by typhoons and earthquakes and has more than a dozen active volcanoes, making it one of the most natural disaster-prone countries in the world. In 2013, Typhoon Haiyan, one of the strongest recorded tropical cyclones, left more than 7,300 people dead or missing, flattened entire villages and caused ships to run aground and smash into houses in the central Philippines.	https://apnews.com/article/philippines-typhoon-toraji-389519dbf4a4aa68223617181f96fda9	2024-11-10T16:38:52-08:00	
Yiannis Boutaris, winemaker and maverick former mayor of the Greek city of Thessaloniki, has died	THESSALONIKI, Greece (AP) — Yiannis Boutaris, a winemaker who served two terms as mayor of Thessaloniki, Greece’s second largest city, and shook its conservative image, died Saturday evening, his company Kir-Yianni announced on social media. No cause of death was given, but his health had been declining. A couple weeks ago he had undergone a hip operation, was discharged but readmitted to hospital a few days before his death. The announcement, written by his two sons, who run the winemaking company, called him 'larger than life, visionary, charismatic, innovator, maverick.' Maverick he undoubtedly was. Politicians across the spectrum paid tribute to Boutaris, emphasizing his passionate and non-conformist personality. Boutaris, a progressive man who eschewed party labels, was involved in local politics late in life, being elected municipal councilor at age 60. He first ran for mayor in 2006, coming third, before running a successful campaign in 2010. His supporters ranged from leftists to moderate conservatives, and he won by a whisker in a city where hardline conservatives had held the mayor’s office for 24 years. In 2014, he won reelection with 58% of the vote. After a four-year hiatus, he was elected municipal councilor again in 2023, serving until his death. 'He was the daring visionary who fought with all his might to bring the city back in touch with its rich multicultural, colorful and cosmopolitan past,' said current Thessaloniki mayor Stelios Angeloudis. As mayor of a city close to other Balkan countries, Boutaris worked on good neighborly relations. He sought to attract Turkish tourists to the city where the Turkish Republic’s founder, Kemal Ataturk, was born. He invited Zoran Zaev, the prime minister of what was then The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, to dinner on New Year’s Day 2017, paving the way for an agreement between the countries that ended a decades-long dispute over the name Macedonia, and after which Greece’s northern neighbor adopted the name North Macedonia. He also emphasized the city’s strong Jewish heritage, playing an important role in building the Holocaust Museum. These moves were sometimes resented by the city’s nationalist element, including the Orthodox Church. Boutaris did not shy from confrontation, leading the city’s archbishop, Anthimos, to name-call him during a church service in October 2010, telling him that without the Church’s support he could not hope to be elected mayor. Nineteen days later, he was. In May 2018, a gang of nationalists attacked Boutaris, slightly injuring him. Nine persons, including a police officer, were convicted for the attack five years later. 'My views on gay pride and North Macedonia caused great enmity and personal hatred,' he had said in an interview. Before he delved into politics, Boutaris had made his name in the winemaking business founded by his grandfather. Business differences with his brother led him to quit the family business in 1996 and start his own, Kir-Yianni ('Mr. Yiannis') winery. Boutaris was also an active environmentalist, founding an NGO, Arktouros, initially aiming to protect the country’s brown bears, but whose sanctuary eventually took on many other species. He was also involved in his beloved Aris Thessaloniki sports club. The club’s professional basketball team said he was a major provider of funds during the club’s golden era in the 1980s and 1990s. In 2021, he published a well-received memoir, '60 Years of Harvests,' in which he was open about his struggles with alcoholism. He had stayed sober since 1991. Besides his two sons, his survivors include a daughter and six grandchildren. His family announced that he will be cremated Tuesday. No religious service will take place. ——— Nellas reported from Athens, Greece	https://apnews.com/article/yiannis-boutaris-mayor-thessaloniki-winemaking-bc705186b303af22599bab61af11313e	2024-11-10T13:38:26-08:00	
Haiti replaces its prime minister, marking more turmoil in the democratic transition process	PORT-AU-PRINCE (AP) — A transitionary council created to reestablish democratic order in Haiti signed a decree Sunday firing interim Prime Minister Garry Conille and replacing him with Alix Didier Fils-Aimé, a businessman who was previously considered for the job. The decree, set to be published on Monday, was provided to The Associated Press by a government source. It marks even more turmoil in an already rocky democratic transition process for Haiti, which hasn’t held democratic elections in years in a large part due to the soaring levels of gang violence plaguing the Caribbean nation. Fils-Aimé is the former president of Haiti’s Chamber of Commerce and Industry and in 2015 ran an unsuccessful campaign for Senate. The businessman studied at Boston University and was previously considered for the position as a private sector candidate for the post before Conille took the seat. Conille, a longtime civil servant who has worked with the United Nations, served as prime minister for only six months. The transitional council was established in April, tasked with choosing Haiti’s next prime minister and Cabinet with the hope that it would help quell turmoil Haiti. But the council has been plagued with politics and infighting, and has long been at odds with Conille. Organizations like the Organization of American States tried and failed last week to mediate disagreements in an attempt to save the fragile transition, according to reporting from The Miami Herald. The process suffered another blow in October when a three of members on the council faced corruption accusations, from anti-corruption investigators alleging that they demanded $750,000 in bribes from a government bank director to secure his job. The report was a significant blow to the nine-member council and is expected to further erode people’s trust in it. Those same members accused of bribery, Smith Augustin, Emmanuel Vertilaire and Louis Gérald Gilles, were among those to sign the decree. Only one member, Edgard Leblanc Fils, did not sign the order. The move by the transitional council came under fire by some in Haiti like former Justice Minister Bernard Gousse, who told local media that Conille's dismissal was 'illegal' because the council was over-extending its powers and because of the corruption allegations levered against them. —— Associated Press reporter Megan Janetsky contributed to this report from Mexico City.	https://apnews.com/article/prime-minister-haiti-alix-didier-fils-aime-garry-conille-bacb06217008ad0c735c22b72fb72235	2024-11-10T12:23:00-08:00	
6.8 magnitude earthquake shakes Cuba after hurricanes and blackouts	HAVANA (AP) — An earthquake with a preliminary magnitude of 6.8 shook eastern Cuba on Sunday, after weeks of hurricanes and blackouts that have left many on the island reeling. The epicenter of the quake was located about 25 miles (40 kilometers) south of Bartolome Maso, Cuba, according to a report by the U.S. Geological Survey. Rumbling was felt across the eastern stretch of Cuba, including in bigger cities like Santiago de Cuba, as well as Holguin and. Guantanamo. Local media in Jamaica also reported that the island felt the tremors. There were no immediate reports of major damage or injuries in Cuba. Residents in Santiago, Cuba's second-largest city, were left shaken on Sunday. Yolanda Tabío, 76, said that people in the city flocked to the streets and were still nervously sitting in their doorways. She said that she felt at least two aftershocks following the quake, but that among friends and family she hadn't heard of any damages. 'You had to see how everything was moving, the walls, everything,' she told The Associated Press. Others reported hearing screams, adding that the quake was strong and stretched on. On social media, residents in the small town of Pilon reported minor damage, posting photos of crumbling roofs and cracks on building walls, not uncommon in Cuba where many structures are older and in need of repair. The earthquake comes during another tough stretch for Cuba. On Wednesday, Category 3 Hurricane Rafael ripped through western Cuba, with strong winds knocking out power island-wide, destroying hundreds of homes and forcing evacuations of hundreds of thousands of people. Days after, much of the island was still struggling without power. Weeks before in October, the island was also hit by a one-two punch. First, it was hit by island-wide blackouts stretching on for days, a product of the island’s energy crisis. Shortly after, it was slapped by a powerful hurricane that struck the eastern part of the island and killed at least six people. The blackouts and wider discontent among many struggling to get by has stoked small protests across the island.	https://apnews.com/article/cuba-earthquake-hurricanes-natural-disaster-c28bbf4496a1bbe27a39f80728d63b2d	2024-11-10T09:02:58-08:00	
Alitalia will lay off over 2,000 remaining employees as liquidation nears	ROME (AP) — Italy’s former national carrier Alitalia has started procedures for the collective dismissal of its remaining 2,059 employees, its administrators told unions. The move comes as the successor to bankrupt Alitalia, ITA Airways, faces hurdles in its merger plans with German Lufthansa. According to Italian media reports, merger talks stalled after the Italian Economy Ministry refused Lufthansa’s suggestions to adjust the price for a 41% stake in ITA Airways. Lufthansa is arguing that the government-owned Italian airline would lose value due to its poor performance in the fourth quarter of the year. Lufthansa said it would adhere to the 2023 terms of the contract for its investment in ITA, adding it 'had signed the necessary remedy package by the agreed deadline.' Meanwhile, Alitalia, which is under the special administration and moving toward final liquidation, plans to fire its remaining employees until the end of the year. The final cuts include more than 1,100 flight attendants and 82 pilots and become effective in January, according to a letter sent this past week by the administration to the airline unions.	https://apnews.com/article/italy-alitalia-layoffs-ita-airways-lufthansa-2bcec35d566b19f7022281e23cd94fa4	2024-11-10T07:50:20-08:00	
Taylor Swift wins big and Rita Ora pays tribute to Liam Payne at the MTV EMAs	MANCHESTER, England (AP) — Taylor Swift came out on top at the 2024 MTV EMAs on Sunday, walking away with best artist, best U.S. act, best live act and best video for 'Fortnight' (featuring Post Malone). Swift, who is finishing up her Eras tour on the other side of the Atlantic, thanked the fans for the bounty of prizes via video message. The U.K. show opened with an acrobatic Benson Boone suspended in the air on a gold grand piano performing his viral hit 'Beautiful Things' and latest release 'Slow it Down.' Boone also accepted his first EMA for best new act. South African newcomer Tyla gave Swift a run for her money picking up three awards for best afrobeats, best R&amp;B and best African act. Tyla performed her smash hit 'Water' for the EMA audience at the Co-op Live, Manchester, flanked by a host of dancers, as well as singing energetic new track 'Push 2 Start.' British singer Rita Ora, who hosted the show for a record third time, paid tribute to former One Direction star Liam Payne, who died last month after falling from a balcony in Buenos Aires. Ora had a close relationship with the singer and the pair recorded a song together in 2018, 'For You (Fifty Shades Freed).' She addressed the audience saying, 'I want to take a moment to remember someone. Liam Payne was one of the kindest people I knew.' Her voice broke as she asked the crowd to take a moment to remember Liam saying, 'He had the biggest heart and he left such a mark on this world.' Hip-hop legend Busta Rhymes was awarded the EMAs global icon award from British rapper Little Simz telling the crowd that in 34 years of professionally recording this was his first award from MTV and it felt incredible. The 12-time Grammy Award nominee, who has more than 10 million album sales under his belt, performed a mega medley of his greatest hits 'Break ya Neck,' 'Touch it' and 'Put Your Hands Where the Eyes can See' accompanied by dancers wearing tracksuits with giant dragon heads. Shawn Mendes gave an intimate and heartfelt performance and also received the award for best Canadian act. Sabrina Carpenter picked up the honors for best song for her hit 'Espresso,' while Ariana Grande was crowned best pop act and Eminem took away best hip hop act.

Paris to deploy 4,000 police officers for France-Israel soccer match following violence in Amsterdam	PARIS (AP) — Paris police said Sunday that 4,000 officers and 1,600 stadium staff will be deployed for a France-Israel soccer match to ensure security in and around the stadium and on public transportation a week after violence against Israeli fans in Amsterdam. France and Israel are playing in a UEFA Nations League match on Thursday that French President Emmanuel Macron will attend, the Elysee presidential palace said. 'There's a context, tensions that make that match a high-risk event for us,' Paris police chief Laurent Nuñez said on French news broadcaster BFM TV, adding authorities 'won't tolerate' any violence. Nuñez said that 2,500 police officers would be deployed around the Stade de France stadium, north of the French capital, in addition to 1,500 others in Paris and on public transportation. 'There will be an anti-terrorist security perimeter around the stadium,' Nuñez said. Security checks will be 'reinforced,' he added, including with systematic pat-downs and bag searches. Nuñez said that French organizers have been in contact with Israeli authorities and security forces in order to prepare for the match. Israeli fans were assaulted last week after a soccer game in Amsterdam by hordes of young people apparently riled up by calls on social media to target Jewish people, according to Dutch authorities. Five people were treated at hospitals and dozens were arrested after the attacks, which were condemned as antisemitic by authorities in Amsterdam, Israel and across Europe. On Sunday, Dutch police detained several people for taking part in a demonstration in central Amsterdam that had been outlawed following the violence targeting Israeli fans, a local broadcaster reported. French Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau confirmed Friday that the France-Israel match would go ahead as planned. 'I think that for a symbolic reason we must not yield, we must not give up,' he said, noting that sports fans from around the world came together for the Paris Olympics this year to celebrate the 'universal values' of sports. Macron’s expected attendance not only is a show of support for the French team, but also aims as sending 'a message of fraternity and solidarity following the intolerable antisemitic acts that followed the match in Amsterdam,' an official in Macron's entourage said. The official couldn't be named in line with the Elysee's customary practices.	https://apnews.com/article/france-israel-soccer-match-police-violence-amsterdam-b8af08c49988d19eb1daa7ae935f0597	2024-11-10T06:25:05-08:00	
Amsterdam police detain pro-Palestinian protesters at banned demonstration	THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — Police detained dozens of people Sunday for taking part in a demonstration in central Amsterdam that had been outlawed following violence targeting fans of an Israeli soccer club, local media reported. Amsterdam Mayor Femke Halsema banned all demonstrations over the weekend in the aftermath of the grim scenes of youths on scooters and on foot attacking Maccabi Tel Aviv supporters on Thursday and Friday in what was widely condemned as a violent outburst of antisemitism in the Dutch capital. Late Sunday afternoon, the municipality, together with Amsterdam police and public prosecutor's office, extended the ban on demonstrations until Thursday morning. Israel’s ambassador to the Netherlands said that 2,000 Israelis were brought home on special flights from Amsterdam over the past few days. Before the match against Ajax, Maccabi fans also tore a Palestinian flag off a building in Amsterdam and chanted anti-Arab slogans on their way to the stadium. There were also reports of Maccabi fans starting fights. Amsterdam newspaper Het Parool reported that about 100 people were detained, and media said they were taken away in buses. Police confirmed they were detaining demonstrators, but didn't give numbers. The protesters yelled slogans including 'Free, free Palestine.' Amsterdam Municipality said on X that police had begun arresting demonstrators who refused to leave the square, which is in the heart of the city's downtown shopping area and close to the historic canal network. Organizers of the protest went to court on Sunday morning seeking an injunction to allow the demonstration, but a judge upheld the ban imposed by the municipality. At the hearing, senior Amsterdam police officer Olivier Dutilh said that there were again incidents overnight targeting people thought to be Jewish, including some being ordered out of taxis and others being asked to produce their passports to confirm their nationality. Police launched a large-scale investigation Friday after gangs of youths conducted what Amsterdam’s mayor called 'hit and run' attacks on fans that were apparently inspired by calls on social media to target Jewish people. Five people were treated at hospitals and more than 60 suspects were arrested. Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar rushed to the Netherlands on Friday and offered Israel’s help in the police investigation. He met on Saturday with Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof and said in a statement that the attacks and demands to show passports 'were reminiscent of dark periods in history.' In France, Paris police said Sunday that 4,000 officers and 1,600 stadium staff will be deployed for a France-Israel soccer match on Thursday to ensure security in and around the stadium and on public transportation.	https://apnews.com/article/amsterdam-israel-palestinians-violence-demonstration-1d38014f40c0bc04250113add3ca9cbf	2024-11-10T05:44:42-08:00	
Opponents of ousted Bangladesh ex-premier Sheikh Hasina foil attempts to hold rally in Dhaka	DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) — Rival political groups of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on Sunday thwarted a plan by her Awami League party to hold a rally in Bangladesh’s capital, seen as a potential first effort to make a comeback on the streets since she fled the country in August amid a mass uprising. The rally in Dhaka by Hasina’s party was to commemorate the death of a party activist on Nov. 10, 1987, which had sparked a mass protest against former military dictator H.M. Ershad. He was eventually ousted from office, ending his nine-year rule in 1990. The day is commemorated as 'democracy day.' In 1991, Bangladesh switched to a parliamentary democracy from a presidential form of government, and since then Hasina and her rival, former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, became the most powerful political figures in the country. On Sunday, activists of the party headed by Zia, Hasina’s main rival, and also members of the conservative Jamaat-e-Islami party took to the streets of Dhaka, filling up much of the area where the rally was scheduled to take place. Others, including hundreds of student protesters, also announced that they wouldn't allow Hasina’s supporters to stand on the streets and hold the rally. The protesters said that they think Hasina’s party was trying to make a comeback by holding a rally on the streets on Sunday. The protesters from the Anti-discrimination Student Movement, a group that led the mass uprising in July-August, aggressively hunted for supporters of Hasina. Groups of people surrounded the Awami League party’s headquarters near the Noor Hossain Square in Dhaka where Hasina’s supporters were supposed to gather to hold the rally. Security was tight in the area, but witnesses and local media said that the protesters attacked several supporters of Hasina when they attempted to reach there and chanted slogans in favor of the fallen leader. The Awami League party said that many of their activists were detained by police as they came under attacks. Tensions ran high throughout Sunday with the anti-Hasina protesters saying that they wouldn't allow the party to hold any public rally under any circumstances. The Awami League party posted a number of videos on Facebook on Sunday showing its supporters being manhandled. Its party headquarters had earlier been vandalized following Hasina’s fall on Aug. 5, and on Sunday it was empty and there were signs of destruction. Outside, control was in the hands of Hasina’s opponents. The political chaos in the South Asian nation went on as Zia’s party was seeking quick reforms and a new election from an interim government headed by Nobel Peace laureate Muhammad Yunus. The party believes it will be able to form the new government in the absence of Hasina’s party, while its other allies are also struggling. The Yunus-led government said it would seek extradition of Hasina and her close associates as they face charges of crimes against humanity involving deaths of hundreds of protesters during the uprising.	https://apnews.com/article/bangladesh-sheikh-hasina-khaleda-zia-muhammad-yunus-3e022c6bd6939bb13f0e93e49781268f	2024-11-10T04:44:17-08:00	
FIFA and IOC hold different track records with Trump ahead of World Cup and Olympics in US	GENEVA (AP) — The two biggest events in world sports are coming to America. And if President-elect Donald Trump is not thinking about them yet, organizers of the 2026 World Cup and 2028 Los Angeles Olympics certainly are. The World Cup and the Summer Games are rare globally shared cultural moments with potential for unifying people. But there are questions around issues like granting visas and providing security that will cross Trump's desk. And that requires diplomacy. Soccer body FIFA seems in a better place to resume warm relations with Trump from his first administration compared to the International Olympic Committee based on public reactions this week and previous interactions. FIFA President Gianni Infantino used his Instagram account to congratulate Trump even before the Electoral College win early Wednesday. There has been a public silence from the IOC, though it follows a more formal protocol code. IOC President Thomas Bach made one visit to the White House in June 2017 that is part of Olympic lore for how badly it went. 'Pray for our world,' Bach was heard to say on a cellphone call later that day in Washington D.C. This summer, at a campaign rally, Trump falsely labeled two female Olympic champion boxers as men and pledged to ' keep men out of women’s sports.' It's the type of issue that could arise from the Trump administration despite top-tier Olympic sports track and field, swimming and cycling already excluding from women's competitions any athletes who went through male puberty. FIFA, meanwhile, seems to have an open line of communication with Trump to talk through potential challenges such as Iran's probable qualification to the men's World Cup and the political implications it may bring. Trump called Infantino ' my great friend ' at the World Economic Forum in Davos in January 2020. Infantino also recently moved to Miami, just 70 miles south of Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate. The tradition for the head of state of a host nation is to present the trophy at the World Cup final and formally open the Summer Games. Ceremonial duties for Trump at the World Cup — which the US is co-hosting with Mexico and Canada — and LA Olympics — held after Bach leaves office — in moments watched by hundreds of millions of viewers worldwide, are in some ways the easy bit. 'My personal view would be that Trump has a very astute appreciation of being on the world stage,' Michael Payne, an IOC insider since the 1984 LA Summer Games as a marketing executive and consultant, told The Associated Press. 'The challenge will be the year counting down to the events — how that doesn’t compromise the agenda of everybody turning up,' Payne said in a telephone interview. Asking for and getting permission from the IOC and FIFA to host their sprawling, multi-billion dollar events requires federal government guarantees on security and letting athletes, team officials and fans enter the country. Trump’s first administration was involved in the bid campaigns — won in 2017 by LA and in 2018 by U.S. soccer officials bidding jointly with Canada and Mexico — and likely was made aware that FIFA, the IOC and fans see the events as belonging to everyone. 'The World Cup and the Olympics, I was responsible for getting both of them, actually,' Trump told Bill Belichick this month on the Let's Go podcast. During those campaigns, when both American bid teams faced questions about a backlash by global voters against Trump’s rhetoric, U.S. soccer and Olympic bid officials noted he wasn’t expected to be in office when the sports events opened. Even Trump, in a meeting with Infantino at the White House in August 2018, didn’t factor in the possibility of losing the 2020 election, which opened the door for him to run again four years later and return to office in time for the 2026 World Cup. '2026, I won’t be here,' said at the time. Hosting games and races that make the world stop to watch, that create a rare sense of shared global experience, is seen as a privilege. Even when the athletes and teams come from countries that were insulted by President Trump, whose politics include travel bans and deportations. 'That responsibility extends to making people feel welcome and that the visa regime is open,' said Piara Powar, executive director of anti-discrimination group Fare that works with FIFA to monitor offensive incidents at World Cup games. Iran, a power in Asian soccer, is on track to qualify in March for its fourth straight World Cup. The Palestinian national team is still contesting one of the eight guaranteed places from Asia in the 48-nation tournament lineup. Trump has a history of support for Israel though has vowed to bring peace to the Middle East. Africa, demeaned by Trump in his first term, has nine guaranteed entries. Track records 'Congratulations Mr President!' Infantino wrote about the man he visited twice at the White House, and also joined in Davos for a dinner event at the high-end Swiss ski resort. The post predicted 'a great FIFA World Cup. Football Unites the World!' In contrast to Trump's kind words for Infantino at Davos, there was no such public warmth exchanged with Olympic leader Bach. Trump and Bach met once at the White House just over seven years ago. Then, the IOC was moving toward making winners of both 2024 Olympics bid rivals Los Angeles and Paris by bringing 2028 into play. The meeting did not go well. That was suspected at the time but only confirmed years later in private conversations. No photos, nor a readout, ever were published of Trump hosting the Olympic delegation that came from Switzerland, Los Angeles and Colorado Springs. The U.S. president was apparently dismissive of Paris and questioned why the IOC wanted the city, which hosted an acclaimed Olympics this year. Asked why there was no formal acknowledgment of Trump's win this week, the IOC cited its tradition of neutrality and not taking political sides. Still, in May 2017, within days of French President Emmanuel Macron first being elected, his telephone call with Bach was reported by the IOC to have included praise for a 'brilliant' win. Macron was on the field in Moscow in July 2018 for the World Cup-winning France team to receive the trophy in torrential rain. Only one umbrella was provided, held over the head of Russian President Vladimir Putin. The next day, Putin met with Trump in Helsinki in neighboring Finland. Infantino was closely tied to Putin ahead of and during that World Cup and they were in an iconic photograph at the opening game, Russia’s 5-0 win over Saudi Arabia. The other man in the photo, Crown Prince Mohamed bin Salman, also is now close with Infantino and Saudi Arabia’s hosting of the 2034 World Cup will be confirmed in Zurich on Dec. 11. When a Middle East diplomatic deal, known as the Abraham Accords, was signed at the Trump White House in September 2020, Infantino was there on the South Lawn during the COVID-19 pandemic. 'If FIFA and Gianni Infantino have a good relationship with Donald Trump then we hope that could be used for the good of the World Cup,' the London-based Powar said in a telephone interview, 'and to ensure that it’s an open and inclusive World Cup. That is the risk at the moment.' At the past two World Cups a match ticket counted as a visa and, Powar noted, in Qatar in 2022 'everybody did have the opportunity to travel there with a ticket, there were no restrictions.' Russia and Qatar — and 2022 Winter Olympics host China — know well that sports fans, administrators and media often see domestic events and legislation through their own lens. 'It puts a magnifying glass on the issues,' said Payne, a close-up observer of Olympic Games for 40 years. 'They take on a profile and political dimension with greater impact because everyone is watching.' ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer	https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-fifa-ioc-world-cup-olympics-7601f2041ff5e75afeae1f43b88dc958	2024-11-10T04:31:14-08:00	
UN nuclear head to visit Iran for talks on country's nuclear program as next Trump presidency looms	VIENNA (AP) — The head of the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog said Sunday he will travel to Iran in the coming days to hold talks regarding the country's nuclear program. The visit comes amid wider tensions gripping the Mideast over the Israel-Hamas war and uncertainty over how U.S. President-elect Donald Trump will approach Iran after his inauguration in January. Specifically, the Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mariano Grossi, will have high level meetings with the Iranian government and will hold technical discussions on all aspects related to the joint statement agreed with Iran in March 2023. It is intended as a path forward for cooperation between the IAEA and Iran on how to expand inspections of the Islamic Republic’s rapidly advancing atomic program. The 2023 statement included a pledge by Iran to resolve issues around sites where inspectors have questions about possible undeclared nuclear activity, and to allow the IAEA to 'implement further appropriate verification and monitoring activities.' The meetings in Tehran will build on Grossi's discussions with Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in September, a statement by the IAEA said. 'It is essential that we make substantive progress in the implementation of the joint statement agreed with Iran in March 2023,' Grossi said. 'My visit to Tehran will be very important in that regard.' Iran is rapidly advancing its atomic program and continues to increase its stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels in defiance of international demands, according to recent reports by the IAEA. Grossi, has warned that Tehran has enough uranium enriched to near-weapons-grade levels to make 'several' nuclear bombs if it chose to do so. He has acknowledged the U.N. agency cannot guarantee that none of Iran’s centrifuges may have been peeled away for clandestine enrichment. Iran’s 2015 landmark nuclear deal with world powers had put limits on its nuclear program — which the West fears could be used for making nuclear weapons although Tehran insists is only for peaceful purposes — while lifting punitive economic sanctions imposed on Iran. But the deal collapsed after the Trump administration in 2018 pulled the United States out of the agreement, leading Iran to abandon all limits the deal had put on its program and enrich uranium to up to 60% purity. That is just a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels of 90%. By IAEA’s definition, around 42 kilograms (92.5 pounds) of uranium enriched to 60% is the amount at which creating one atomic weapon is theoretically possible. As Trump is to take office again in a few weeks, Iranians are divided on what his next presidency will bring. Some foresee an all-out war between Tehran and Washington, particularly as other conflicts rage in the region. Others hold out hope that America’s 47th president might engage in unexpected diplomacy as he did with North Korea.	https://apnews.com/article/iaea-grossi-iran-nuclear-negotiations-efa8ad94a3424135eb21261cccaf4641	2024-11-10T02:38:32-08:00	
The Taliban will attend a UN climate conference for the 1st time	KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) — The Taliban will attend a U.N. climate conference for the first time since their takeover of Afghanistan in 2021, the country's national environment agency said Sunday. The conference, known as COP29, begins Monday in Azerbaijan and is one of the most important multilateral talks to include the Taliban, who do not have official recognition as the legitimate rulers of Afghanistan. The National Environmental Protection Agency posted on social media platform X that a technical delegation had gone to Baku to participate. Matiul Haq Khalis, the agency’s head, said the delegation would use the conference to strengthen cooperation with the international community on environmental protection and climate change, share Afghanistan’s needs regarding access to existing financial mechanisms related to climate change, and discuss adaptation and mitigation efforts. Experts told The Associated Press that climate change has led to numerous and negative impacts on Afghanistan, creating serious challenges because of the country’s geographical location and weak climate policies. ' Climate change has resulted in higher temperatures, which reduce water sources and cause droughts, significantly affecting agricultural activities,' said Hayatullah Mashwani, professor of environmental science at Kabul University. 'The reduction in water availability and frequent droughts pose severe threats to agriculture, leading to food insecurity and challenges to livelihoods.' In August, the international aid agency Save the Children published a report saying that Afghanistan is the sixth most vulnerable country to the impacts of climate change and that 25 of its 34 provinces face severe or catastrophic drought conditions, affecting more than half the population. Afghanistan also had the highest number of children made homeless by climate disasters of any country as of the end of 2023, according to the report. Professor Abid Arabzai, from Kabul University, said the climate conference would help to secure international assistance and funding to address Afghanistan’s climate challenges. 'Afghanistan can clarify its climate actions and commitments to the global community, enhancing its international reputation,' said Arabzai.	https://apnews.com/article/afghanistan-taliban-climate-un-cop29-6695d30562689e0eac0f537818f12992	2024-11-10T01:47:24-08:00	
Drones strike Moscow as top UK official highlights Russian casualties in Ukraine	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — A massive drone strike rattled Moscow and its suburbs overnight into Sunday, injuring several people and temporarily halting traffic at some of Russia's busiest airports, officials reported. Meanwhile, a huge nighttime wave of Russian drones targeted Ukraine. This came after Russian President Vladimir Putin signed into law a pact with North Korea Saturday night, obliging the two countries to provide immediate military aid using 'all means' if either is attacked. The agreement marks the strongest link between Moscow and Pyongyang since the end of the Cold War. Earlier this week, Ukraine reported that its troops engaged for the first time with North Korean units. U.S. officials earlier confirmed the deployment of at least 3,000 North Korean troops to Russia, while Kyiv has repeatedly said the number is far higher. This has fueled concerns of a marked escalation in Moscow's war on Ukraine, and tensions spilling over into the Asia-Pacific. U.K. estimates Russian troop losses at 700,000 Both Moscow and Kyiv have kept a tight lid on casualty figures since the start of the full-scale war despite regular reports of Russian forces taking huge losses following 'human wave' attacks that aim to exhaust Ukrainian defenses. However, the chief of the U.K. defense staff, Tony Radakin, told the BBC that Russian forces had suffered their worst month of casualties in October since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. He said Moscow’s troops suffered an average of 1,500 dead and wounded per day, bringing their total losses in the war to 700,000. According to Radakin, ordinary Russians were paying 'an extraordinary price' for the war, even as a grueling, monthslong Russian offensive in Ukraine’s industrial east continues to eke out gains. He did not say how U.K. officials had calculated the Russian casualty figures. 'There is no doubt that Russia is making tactical, territorial gains and that is putting pressure on Ukraine,' he said. But he added that they were 'tiny increments of land,' and Moscow’s mounting defense and security spending was putting an increasing strain on the country. Radakin insisted that Ukraine’s Western partners should stand by it for 'as long as it takes' to beat back Russian aggression, even as allies of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump have signaled that Kyiv may have to cede territory to seek peace. Russia is cautiously optimistic about Trump’s forthcoming presidency On Sunday, the Kremlin’s official spokesman voiced cautious optimism about Trump’s upcoming presidency, saying: 'At least he talks about peace. … He does not talk about confrontation.' 'The signals are positive. Trump, during his election campaign, said that he perceives everything through deals, that he can make deals that will lead everyone toward peace,' Dmitry Peskov told reporters at a briefing. 'He does not talk about a desire to inflict a strategic defeat on Russia, and this favorably distinguishes him from the current (U.S.) administration,' Peskov said. But Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Sunday insisted that 'strong decisions' from Kyiv’s Western partners are needed to stop the 'terror' of Russian drone and missile strikes, and secure 'reliable peace' for Ukraine. 'The killing of children, the loss of family members cannot simply be forgotten,' Zelenskyy said in a post on the Telegram messaging app. 'Without strong decisions, there is no security from terror, and this is equally clear in every country. There is no reliable peace without justice,' he said. Continuing fighting causes damage and casualties on both sides Fierce fighting has continued near the eastern Ukrainian cities of Toretsk and Kurakhove, Ukraine’s General Staff reported Sunday. Between 700 and 1,000 residents remain in Kurakhove, a front-line city surrounded on three sides and battered into ruin. Most of them live underground with no running water, heating or electricity. Meanwhile, Russia’s Defense Ministry said a total of 84 Ukrainian drones were shot down overnight in Russian territory, following what it called a 'mass strike on civilian infrastructure.' A man died under rubble after drones struck his apartment block in Russia’s Belgorod region, just kilometers from the Ukrainian border, local Gov. Vyacheslav Gladkov reported. Five other people were injured in the Moscow suburb of Ramenskoe and a nearby village, according to local officials. Russian channels on the messaging app Telegram carried eyewitness reports of drone debris setting fire to suburban homes. Russia's aviation authority said flights were briefly grounded at major international airports including Sheremetyevo and Domodedovo. At least 14 flights bound for Moscow were rerouted to Nizhnyi Novgorod, a city over 490 kilometers (300 miles) east, airport representatives there reported. Ukraine’s General Staff claimed on Sunday that Ukrainian drones caused a fire at an arms depot in Russia’s southern Bryansk region, near Ukraine and Belarus. The online update featured a photo showing thick plumes of reddish smoke rising into the night sky. The AP could not verify the circumstances in which it was taken, and there was no immediate comment from Russia. Separately, Russia’s emergencies ministry on Sunday said that a major fire broke out at a warehouse outside of Moscow. There were no immediate reports of casualties, and it was not clear whether the blaze was linked to the Ukrainian drone strikes. Russia overnight launched a 'record' 145 drones at Ukrainian territory, according to Ukraine’s air force, 62 of which were shot down. A further 67 were 'lost,' the air force said, a likely reference to electronic jamming that caused the drones to veer off course. At least one person was injured as Russian drones struck residential areas in Ukraine’s southern port of Odesa, local Gov. Oleh Kiper reported. And at least five civilians, including a 17-year-old girl and 10-year-old boy, were injured by falling drone debris and shelling in Ukraine’s northeastern Kharkiv region Sunday, its Gov. Oleh Syniehubov and local prosecutors said. Russia later on Sunday said that it had struck a large deployment of Ukrainian soldiers in the Kharkiv province with thermobaric rockets, but didn't immediately provide evidence. ___ Joanna Kozlowska reported from London. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-moscow-drones-204fd4df47c4fa4be50441f5e9c047c3	2024-11-10T00:47:28-08:00	
As Russian forces close in on Kurakhove, hundreds of residents remain in the front-line city	KURAKHOVE, Ukraine (AP) — Set on Ukraine's eastern front, Kurakhove is surrounded on three sides, with Russian forces just under 2 miles (3 kilometers) from the devastated city center. Yet between 700 and 1,000 local residents remain, most of them living in the basements of apartment buildings, without running water, heating or electricity. The only place to charge phones is in the basement of the building now housing the city administration. The exact number of people is impossible to determine because, since mid-October, no humanitarian volunteers have come to Kurakhove. Under attack from artillery, multiple rocket launchers, aerial bombs and drones, Kurakhove has become the new Bakhmut, as Russia continues its drive westward to capture all of the Donbas region. On Friday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called the situation in Kurakhove, as well as the key city of Pokrovsk, 'the most challenging.' The hospital, schools, kindergartens, water treatment plant, refugee center, post office, technical school and cultural center have all been destroyed. Smoke hangs in the air as bombed-out apartment buildings burn against a backdrop of artillery fire and drones. Artillerymen of the 33rd Brigade say they are firing around 50 shells per day on the Kurakhove front, indicating critical activity in the Russian army’s offensive operations and the brigade's desperate attempts to stop Russian forces from encircling the city. Local authorities remain in the city, as well as representatives of the police and local Territorial Defense Forces. For Artem Shchus, head of police in Kurakhove, there is little hope of defending the city if it becomes surrounded. 'I don’t think it is possible, considering the reality of modern war and modern technologies. In that case, the logistics could be performed only by drones,' he says. Shchus calls the road to Kurakhove, which is lined with burned-out civilian vehicles, the 'road of death,' due to persistent Russian drone attacks. Five civilians have been killed while trying to leave. The road of death No supplies would enter the city without the 'White Angels' evacuation group, made up of local police officers and volunteers. They provide first aid to the wounded and remove the bodies of those killed in shelling, all while operating the city's only functioning food store. The White Angels bring in vital supplies in an armored vehicle kitted out with electronic warfare equipment — the only way to enter the city, and still a journey fraught with risk. 'Without REB (jammers) it is just a lottery. With it, you might still have a chance to survive,' Shchus says. The only way to escape the city is to travel with the White Angels. Each day, they risk their lives to evacuate between six and 12 people from different parts of the city and surrounding villages. Although children are meant to have been evacuated, parents often hide them, both from the bombs and from law enforcement officers. Among the White Angels' key missions is to find children and persuade their parents to evacuate. When this mission is successful and children are removed from the basements, many are shocked by the state of the destroyed city, suggesting that they have been hiding underground for quite some time. After dressing the children in bulletproof vests and helmets, the White Angels take them to the nearby city of Kostiantynopil, from where other volunteers transport them to refugee registration points in the regional centers of Dnipro or Zaporizhzhia. 'We evacuate people every day without stopping. We just dropped people off in Kostiantynopil, and we still have addresses to go through today,' Shchus explains. Asked about adapting to work in such challenging and dangerous conditions, the police chief worries about the impact on his team. 'I think everyone has already adapted. I wouldn’t even call it ‘adaptation.’ It's more like an unhealthy state of mind. I don’t know how this will influence them socially in the future,' he says. 'These people are living in inhumane conditions, and they're surviving on adrenaline. The war is their life. These are hard conditions to work in, but everyone is working.' ___ Associated Press writers Yehor Konovalov in Kyiv and Elise Morton in London also contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/kurakhove-donbas-drones-evacuation-offensive-afb121bfbb276f8bb3789960f7076331	2024-11-10T00:37:25-08:00	
Israeli strikes kill dozens in Lebanon and isolated northern Gaza while Netanyahu and Trump speak	DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Israeli strikes killed dozens of people including children on Sunday in Lebanon and isolated northern Gaza, as the world watched for signs of how the U.S. election might affect the war against Iranian-backed militant groups Hamas and Hezbollah. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he has spoken three times with Donald Trump since Tuesday’s election and they 'see eye-to-eye regarding the Iranian threat and all of its components.' Israel’s president, Isaac Herzog, is scheduled to meet with U.S. President Joe Biden on Tuesday. The Israeli airstrike in Lebanon killed at least 23 people including seven children in Aalmat village north of Beirut, far from the areas in the east and south where Hezbollah militants have a major presence. Lebanon's Health Ministry said another six people were wounded. There was no Israeli evacuation warning. There was no immediate Israeli comment. Hezbollah began firing rockets, drones and missiles into Israel after war broke out in Gaza, in solidarity with the Palestinians and Hamas. Israel retaliated, and a series of escalations have led to all-out war. In northern Gaza, an Israeli strike on a home sheltering displaced people in the urban refugee camp of Jabaliya killed at least 17 people including nine women, according to Dr. Fadel Naim, director of Al-Ahly Hospital in Gaza City. Israel's military said it targeted a site where militants were operating, without providing evidence. It said the details of the strike are under review. A separate strike hit a house in Gaza City, killing Wael al-Khour, a minister in the Hamas-run government, as well as his wife and three children, according to the Civil Defense, first responders who operate under the government. Israel strikes deeper into Lebanon Israel has struck deeper inside Lebanon since September, when it killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah as well as most of his top commanders. Hezbollah has expanded its rocket fire from northern to central Israel. The fighting has killed over 3,000 people in Lebanon, according to the Health Ministry, and more than 70 people in Israel. After Israel's strike in Aalmat, some 40 kilometers (25 miles) north of Beirut, legislator Raed Berro denied that any Hezbollah personnel or assets were in the building that was hit, adding: 'The important people are on the front line resisting … It is impossible for them to be among people in civilian life.' Hassan Ghaddaf, who lived next door and was lightly wounded, said displaced people were in the house that was struck. 'I had seen them and got to know them the other day,' Ghaddaf said. 'They were peaceful. On the contrary, they had someone from the Lebanese Internal Security Forces that works for the state, and we saw their garb and clothes in the rubble.' In Syria, an Israeli airstrike hit a residential building in the Damascus suburb of Sayyida Zeinab and the Defense Ministry said seven civilians were killed, state news agency SANA reported. Britain-based opposition war monitor The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights suggested Hezbollah was targeted. Israel did not immediately comment. Fears of famine in northern Gaza The mid-month deadline is approaching for an ultimatum the Biden administration gave Israel to allow more aid into Gaza or risk possible restrictions on U.S. military funding. Israeli forces have encircled and largely isolated Jabaliya and the nearby northern Gaza towns of Beit Lahiya and Beit Hanoun for the past month, allowing only a trickle of humanitarian aid. Experts from a panel that monitors food security say famine is imminent or may already be happening. The northern third of Gaza, including Gaza City, has suffered the heaviest destruction of the 13-month war that was triggered by Hamas' attack into southern Israel. Israel has sent forces back in after repeated operations, saying Hamas has regrouped. Israeli strikes often kill women and children. The military says it only targets militants, whom it accuses of hiding among civilians. Also Sunday, Israel's military released what it said was video footage of Hamas abusing detainees. The soundless footage, dated from 2018 to 2020, appears to show hooded detainees chained in stress positions. In some clips, men beat or poke them with batons. It was not possible to independently verify the videos, which the military said it recovered during operations in Gaza. Rights groups have long accused the Hamas-run government in Gaza and the Western-backed Palestinian Authority in the occupied West Bank of abusing detainees and violently quashing dissent. Israel has been accused of similar abuses, especially since the start of the war. Israeli prison authorities say they follow relevant laws and investigate any allegations of wrongdoing. The toll of war The war in Gaza began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. They killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted around 250. Some 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, about a third believed to be dead. Israel's offensive has killed over 43,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities who do not distinguish between civilians and militants in their count but say over half the dead were women and children. Israeli bombardment and ground invasions have left vast areas of Gaza in ruins and displaced around 90% of the population of 2.3 million people, often multiple times. Hundreds of thousands of people live in tent camps with few if any services. Cease-fire talks mediated by the United States, Qatar and Egypt have repeatedly stalled, as have parallel efforts by the U.S. and others to halt the fighting between Israel and Hezbollah. Qatar, a key mediator with Hamas, said Saturday it had suspended its efforts and would resume them when 'the parties show their willingness and seriousness to end the brutal war.' ___ Magdy reported from Cairo and Chehayeb from Beirut.

King Charles III and Kate attend remembrance event as both slowly return to duty	LONDON (AP) — King Charles III led the nation Sunday in a two-minute silence in remembrance of fallen service personnel in central London as the Princess of Wales looked on, a further sign that the royal family is slowly returning to normal at the end of a year in which two of the most popular royals were sidelined by cancer. Remembrance Sunday is a totemic event in the U.K., with the monarch leading senior royals, political leaders, including Prime Minister Keir Starmer and his eight living predecessors, and envoys from the Commonwealth countries in laying wreaths at the Cenotaph, the Portland stone memorial that serves as the focal point for honoring the nation’s war dead. The service is held on the second Sunday of November to mark the signing of the armistice to end World War I 'on the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month' in 1918. Across the U.K., services are conducted at the same time in memory of the dead. After the two-minute silence, buglers from the Royal Marines played the 'Last Post,' and Charles led the wreath-laying part of the service. The 75-year-old king, dressed in his Royal Navy uniform of the Admiral of the Fleet, laid a wreath of poppies at the base of the Cenotaph in recognition of the fallen from conflicts dating back to World War I. His eldest son and the heir to the throne, Prince William, left his own floral tribute — featuring the Prince of Wales’ feathers and a new ribbon in Welsh red. Dressed in somber black, his wife, Kate, watched on from a balcony of the nearby Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office, as is tradition. Queen Camilla, who would normally be standing next to the princess, wasn't present as she recovered from a chest infection. It's the first time since the start of the year that Kate carried out two consecutive days of public official engagements. On Saturday, she attended the Royal British Legion Festival Of Remembrance at the Royal Albert Hall. Following the wreath-laying, around 10,000 veterans, including those who have fought in wars this century, notably in Afghanistan and Iraq, marched past the Cenotaph. With the passage of time, there were only a handful of World War II veterans present. 'It’s always a great honor to be back on occasions like this, but I remember the guys that never came home on my ship when it was torpedoed,' said 99-year-old Stan Ford, who has had to walk with leg calipers ever since the ship that he was serving on — HMS Fratton — was sunk off France's Normandy coast in August 1944 at the cost of 31 lives. 'They never came home, and I always feel it’s my duty to put in an appearance and thank God for those that did survive, and to pray for the ones who didn’t,' said Ford, who was one of 38 survivors. Charles’ ceremonial role as commander in chief of the armed forces is a holdover from the days when the monarch led his troops into battle. But the link between the monarchy and the military is still very strong, with service members taking an oath of allegiance to the king and members of the royal family supporting service personnel through a variety of charities. Charles and William served on active duty in the military before taking up full-time royal duties. Charles was diagnosed with an undisclosed form of cancer in February, forcing him to step away from public appearances for two months as he focused on his treatment and recovery. Just a few weeks later, Kate announced her own cancer diagnosis, which sidelined her for much of the year as she underwent chemotherapy. The king has been in good form in recent months and recently completed a taxing trip to Australia and Samoa. Kate, who made her first post-diagnosis public appearance during the monarch's birthday parade in June, is slowly returning to public duties. Prince William reflected this week on the strain that the cancer scare has placed on the royal family. 'I’m so proud of my wife, I’m proud of my father, for handling the things that they have done,' William told reporters on Thursday as he wrapped up a four-day trip to South Africa. 'But from a personal family point of view, it’s been, yeah, it’s been brutal.' While the Cenotaph was the focus of the national remembrance service, communities throughout the U.K. held their own ceremonies on Sunday. Needham-Crofton, who served with the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers before a truck accident ended his military career, planned to attend a local service in Eastbourne on the south coast of England. He has spent much of his time honoring veterans and trying to help them, including 20 years as a volunteer for the Taxi Charity for Military Veterans. Like some of his army tasks, raising cash was rather grueling as it involved standing in front of London subway stations collecting coins to help fund the group’s efforts. 'I like to respect all the veterans and do what I can for them,' he told The Associated Press. 'It’s a brotherhood really. Even if you don’t know a veteran that you meet, you feel a kinship toward them. That is very important to me. I shall be like that for the rest of my life.'	https://apnews.com/article/britain-remembrance-sunday-veterans-kate-king-charles-670d06dfdda6fb32a1725980932e3870	2024-11-09T20:39:39-08:00	
Soldier with Yemen's exiled government opens fire, killing 2 Saudi troops and wounding another	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — A soldier for Yemen’s exiled government opened fire on Saudi troops as they exercised in eastern Yemen, killing two of them and wounding another in a rare insider attack during the kingdom's nearly decadelong war there, officials said Saturday. The assault in eastern Hadramawt province comes as a yearslong cease-fire between Saudi Arabia and Yemen's Houthi rebels largely has held despite the militants' ongoing attacks against shipping in the Red Sea corridor. While the Houthis did not claim the attack, at least one Houthi official praised it as being 'the beginning and an indication of a harsh future awaiting the invaders.' Meanwhile, U.S. warplanes carried out new strikes targeting Houthi positions that lasted into early Sunday morning, the American military said. The strikes come after the militants likely shot down yet-another American reconnaissance drone over the country. The attack on the Saudi troops took place Friday night in Seiyun, a city some 500 kilometers (310 miles) east of Sanaa. As troops worked out at a Saudi-led base there, the soldier opened fire, killing an officer and a noncommissioned officer, the state-run Saudi Press Agency said, citing a military statement. 'The Joint Forces Command underscores that this ‘Lone Wolf’ cowardly attack does not represent the honorable members of the Yemeni Ministry of Defense,' the statement added. The dead and the other wounded Saudi solider have been brought back to the kingdom, it added. Aidarous al-Zubaidi, the leader of Yemen's successionist Southern Transitional Council, identified the soldier who carried out the attack as belonging to the First Military Region, which is based out of Seiyun. Police in the area published pictures of the soldier, saying there was a 30-million-Yemeni-rial reward for information leading to the soldier's arrest. That's worth around $15,000 on the black market. Authorities offered no motive for the attack. Al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, the militant group's Yemen branch, long has operated around Hadramawt. However, the group did not immediately claim the attack. A recent United Nations expert report has said that the al-Qaida group and the Houthis have begun to 'coordinate operations directly with each other.' The Houthis meanwhile did not claim the attack either. However, Houthi official Hamid Rizq praised the attack in a message on the social platform X, claiming it came from 'the feeling of oppression' over Saudi troops being stationed in the area. 'The heroic operation is the beginning and an indication of a harsh future awaiting the invaders,' Rizq wrote. Yemen has been mired in a decadelong war since the Houthis swept into Sanaa from their northern strongholds in September 2014. A Saudi-led coalition entered the war on behalf of Yemen's exiled government in 2015. The war further internationalized, with Iran backing the Houthis with weapons and support that cemented the conflict into a yearslong stalemate. The war has killed more than 150,000 people, including fighters and civilians, and created one of the world’s worst humanitarian disasters, killing tens of thousands more. A cease-fire that expired in October 2022 largely has held in the time since, however, even as the Houthis have seized on the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip and Israel's invasion of Lebanon. On Saturday night, Houthi-run media reported U.S. airstrikes targeting areas around Sanaa. The airstrikes continued into Sunday morning and also included sites in Amran province just outside of the capital, the Houthis said. The rebels offered no immediate damage assessment from the strikes. The U.S. military later told The Associated Press on Sunday it conducted airstrikes 'on numerous Iran-backed Houthi weapons storage facilities within Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen.' It described the sites as housing advanced conventional weapons used to target military and civilian ships in the Red Sea corridor, but offered no other immediate details. The U.S. military has targeted radar stations, military bases and drone and missile launch sites since beginning its ongoing airstrike campaign against the Houthis in January. ___ Associated Press writer Baraa Anwer in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/yemen-saudi-arabia-soldiers-killed-houthis-war-79eb16222c28985a98b77995b4a30149	2024-11-09T17:32:57-08:00	
Mexico and US reach agreement to address Mexico's habit of falling behind in water-sharing payments	MEXICO CITY (AP) — Mexico and the U.S. said they reached an agreement they hope will address Mexico’s habit of falling behind on water-sharing payments in the Rio Bravo watershed, also known as the Rio Grande. The agreement announced Saturday provides Mexico with tools and flexibility to deliver water earlier in a five-year cycle under the 1944 U.S.-Mexico water treaty, according to the bilateral International Border and Water Commission. The proposed tools include better coordination on water conservation, re-use, alternative water sources and other measures. The treaty moves in five-year cycles and allows Mexico to run a water debt in the first four years, if it can make it up in the fifth. That has led Mexico to fall behind, hoping a hurricane or other heavy rains will dump water in the border area. That has frustrated Texas farmers, who need a predictable supply of water. When a hurricane or tropical storm hits the region, Mexico can play catch-up but at that point, the water isn't needed, and that doesn't always happen. Mexico has long used that wait-and-hope strategy, but it has led to problems in the past, both at home and in the U.S. Mexico is obliged to deliver 350,000 acre-feet (430 million cubic meters) of water per year, or about 1.75 million acre-feet (2.15 billion cubic meters) over 5 years. An acre-foot of water is enough to flood a field with one foot of water. The United States, in return, gives Mexico even more water from other water sources farther west. But in the current cycle which began in 2020, Mexico has so far delivered only about 425,000 acre-feet (525 million cubic meters) overall, only about one quarter of what it owes for the five-year period, which ends in October 2025. Mexico has to release water from dams on tributaries feeding into the Rio Grande but that angers Mexican farmers, who want it for themselves and call it 'our water.' The treaty gives the United States rights to one-third of the flows from six Mexican tributaries. In 2020, a dispute over water payments to the United States boiled over into violence, with angry farmers pushing back National Guard troops guarding a dam, because Mexico had fallen behind on payments in that cycle and had to deliver water quickly to the United States. Mexico dispatched National Guard officers to protect the La Boquilla dam in that 2020, but hundreds of farmers pushed and shoved them back hundreds of yards in a failed bid to take over the dam’s control room. Before that, farmers took over another dam near the border town of Ojinaga. Both dams are located near the Texas border, west of the Big Bend area. During the 2020 conflict, Mexican farmers also burned vehicles and blocked railway lines. In the end, the United states allowed Mexico to transfer rights to water held in joint international reservoirs, in a face-saving solution.	https://apnews.com/article/mexico-us-rio-bravo-water-agreement-payments-7c67f8fb669b7fa64e29a1f2eb299ea5	2024-11-09T11:45:35-08:00	
Tens of thousands of Spaniards demand the resignation of Valencia leader for bungling flood response	VALENCIA, Spain (AP) — Tens of thousands of Spaniards marched in the eastern city of Valencia on Saturday to demand the resignation of the regional president in charge of the emergency response to last week’s catastrophic floods that left more than 200 dead and others missing. A group of protestors clashed with riot police in front of Valencia's city hall, where the protestors started their march to the seat of the regional government. Police used batons to beat them back. Regional leader Carlos Mazón is under immense pressure after his administration failed to issue flood alerts to citizens’ cellphones until hours after the flooding started on the night of Oct. 29. Many marchers held up homemade signs or chanted 'Mazón Resign!' Others carried signs with messages like 'You Killed Us!' Upon arrival at the regional government seat, some protesters slung mud on the building and left handprints of the muck on its facade. Earlier on Saturday, Mazón told regional broadcaster À Punt that 'there will be time to hold officials accountable,' but that now 'is time to keep cleaning our streets, helping people and rebuilding.' He said that he 'respected' the march. Mazón, of the conservative Popular Party, is also being criticized for what people perceive as the slow and chaotic response to the natural disaster. Thousands of volunteers were the first boots on the ground in many of the hardest hit areas on Valencia’s southern outskirts. It took days for officials to mobilize the thousands of police reinforcements and soldiers that the regional government asked central authorities to send in. In Spain, regional governments are charged with handling civil protection and can ask the national government in Madrid, led by the Socialists, for extra resources. Mazón has defended his handling of the crisis saying that its magnitude was unforeseeable and that his administration didn’t receive sufficient warnings from central authorities. But Spain’s weather agency issued a red alert, the highest level of warning, for bad weather as early as 7:30 a.m. on Tuesday morning as the disaster loomed. Some communities were flooded by 6 p.m. It took until after 8 p.m. for Mazón’s administration to send out alerts to people’s cellphones. Mazón was with Spain’s royals and Socialist prime minister when they were pelted with mud by enraged residents during their first visit to a devastated area last weekend. Sara Sánchez Gurillo attended the protest because she had lost her brother-in-law, 62-year-old Candido Molina Pulgarín. She said his body was found in a field of orange trees after he was trapped by the water in his home in the town of Cheste, west of Valencia. She wanted Mazón to go, but also had harsh words for the country's leaders. 'It’s shameful what has happened,' Sánchez said. 'They knew that the sky was going to fall and yet they didn’t warn anyone. They didn’t evacuate the people. We want them to resign!' 'The central government should have taken charge. They should have sent in the army earlier. The king should have made them send it in. Why do we want him as a symbolic figure? He is worthless. The people are alone. They have abandoned us.' The death toll stood at 220 victims on Saturday, with 212 coming in the eastern Valencia region, as the search for bodies goes on. Thousands more lost their homes and streets are still covered in mud and debris 11 days since the arrival of a tsunami-like wave following a record deluge. ___ Joseph Wilson reported from Barcelona.	https://apnews.com/article/spain-floods-protest-valencia-897877bed9379462c06ea00ec24b7fd7	2024-11-09T09:51:34-08:00	
Rafael weakens to tropical storm over Gulf of Mexico after barreling through Cuba as a hurricane	MEXICO CITY (AP) — Rafael weakened Saturday to a tropical storm and was expected to dissolve over the Gulf of Mexico in the coming days after barreling across Cuba as a Category 3 hurricane. Rafael was located 290 miles (470 km) north-northwest of Progreso, Mexico on Saturday. It had maximum sustained winds of 50 mph (85 kph) and was moving west-northwest at 6 mph (9 kph), according to the National Hurricane Center in Miami. It was forecast to continue moving south toward southern Mexico in the coming days as it weakens. Forecasters warned that swells from the storm were likely to cause 'life-threatening surf and rip current conditions' in that region. The hurricane tore through Jamaica and the Cayman Islands earlier in the week, knocking out power and fueling mudslides. On Wednesday evening, it barreled into Cuba, causing yet another headache for the island. Rafael’s fierce winds knocked out Cuba’s electric grid, forced the evacuation of 283,000 people and collapsed 461 homes. It also left trees, power lines and rubble strewn across flooded streets. Many were still without power over the weekend, though Cuba's government said it was working to restore power to homes. On Friday, state media in Cuba reported that Russia said it would donate 80,000 tons of diesel to Cuba, and offered a shipment of equipment for $62 million as the communist-led government struggled to pick up the pieces after the hurricane. Rafael followed a rocky few weeks in the Caribbean nation, after island-wide blackouts stretching on for days and another powerful hurricane that killed at least six people.	https://apnews.com/article/rafael-tropical-storm-gulf-of-mexico-cuba-85ac970fc741696609cfea4e78665918	2024-11-09T09:31:12-08:00	
While Syrian refugees don't want to return, officials in Lebanon and Syria see exodus as opportunity	BEIRUT (AP) — Hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees have returned to their country since Israel launched a massive aerial bombardment on wide swathes of Lebanon in September. Many who fled to Lebanon after the war in Syria started in 2011 did not want to go back. But for officials in Lebanon, the influx of returnees comes as a silver lining to the war between Israel and Hezbollah that has killed more than 3,000 people and displaced some 1.2 million in Lebanon. Some in Syria hope the returning refugees could lead to more international assistance and relief from western sanctions. 'I wasn't thinking at all about returning' Nisreen al-Abed returned to her northwest Syrian hometown in October after 12 years as a refugee in Lebanon’s Bekaa Valley. The airstrikes had been terrifying, but what really worried her was that her 8-year-old twin daughters need regular transfusions to treat a rare blood disorder, thalassemia. 'I was afraid that in Lebanon, in this situation, I wouldn’t be able to get blood for them,' al-Abed said. During their dayslong journey, Al-Abed and her daughters were smuggled from government-held to opposition-held territory before reaching her parent’ house. Her husband remained in Lebanon. 'Before these events, I wasn’t thinking at all about returning to Syria,' she said. According to the U.N. refugee agency, more than 470,000 people — around 70% of them Syrian — have crossed the border since the escalation in Lebanon began in mid-September. Lebanon's General Security agency estimates more than 550,000 people have fled, most of them Syrian. Most of the returnees are in government-controlled areas of Syria, according to UNHCR, while tens of thousands have made their way to the Kurdish-controlled northeast and smaller numbers to the opposition-controlled northwest. Political leaders in Lebanon, which was hosting an estimated 1.5 million Syrian refugees before the recent wave of returns, have been calling for years for the displaced to go home, and many don't want the refugees to return. Lebanon's caretaker Minister of Social Affairs Hector Hajjar told Russia's Sputnik News last month that the war in Lebanon could yield 'a positive benefit, an opportunity to return a large number of displaced Syrians to their country, because the situation there is now better than here.' A political opening for Syria? Officials in Damascus point to increasing economic pressure from the masses fleeing Lebanon as an argument for loosening western sanctions on President Bashar Assad's government. Syria was already suffering from spiraling inflation, and the sudden influx of refugees has driven prices up even more, as have Israeli strikes on border crossings that have slowed legal cross-border trade and smuggling. 'Everyone knows that Syria is suffering from difficult economic conditions: hyperinflation, import inflation, and an economic blockade,' said Abdul-Qader Azzouz, an economic analyst and professor at Damascus University. The influx of refugees just 'increases the economic burden,' he said. Alaa al-Sheikh, a member of the executive bureau in Damascus province, urged the U.S. to lift sanctions on Syria because of the huge number of arrivals. 'The burden is big and we are in pressing need of international assistance,' she said. Rights groups have raised concerns about the treatment of returning refugees. The Jordan-based Syrian think tank ETANA estimates at least 130 people were 'arbitrarily arrested at official border crossings or checkpoints inside Syria, either because they were wanted for security reasons or military service,' despite a government-declared amnesty for men who dodged the draft. Joseph Daher, a Swiss-Syrian researcher and professor at the European University Institute in Florence, noted the number of arrests is small and that Assad's government might not view the returnees as a threat because they are mostly women and children. Still, Daher labeled government attempts to show the returning refugees are welcome as 'propaganda,' saying, 'they’re unwilling and not ready in terms of economics or politics to do it.' UNHCR head Filippo Grandi said this week that his agency is working with the Syrian government 'to ensure the safety and security of all those arriving,' and he urged donors to provide humanitarian aid and financial assistance to help Syria recover after 13 years of war. A temporary return UNHCR regional spokeswoman Rula Amin said if people leave the country where they are registered as refugees, they usually lose their protected status. Whether and how that will be applied in the current situation remains unclear, Amin said, underscoring the exodus from Lebanon took place 'under adverse circumstances, that is under duress.' 'Given the current situation, the procedure will need to be applied with necessary safeguards and humanity,' she said. Jeff Crisp, a visiting research fellow at the University of Oxford’s Refugee Studies Center and a former UNHCR official, said he believes Syrians are entitled to continued international protection 'because of the grave threats to their life and liberty in both countries.' Some refugees have entered Syria via smuggler routes so their departure from Lebanon is not officially recorded, including Um Yaman, who left Beirut's heavily bombarded southern suburbs with her children for the city of Raqqa in eastern Syria. 'When I went to Syria, to be honest, I went by smuggling, in case we wanted to go back to Lebanon later when things calm down, so our papers would remain in order in Lebanon,' she said. She asked to be identified only by her honorific ('mother of Yaman') to be able to speak freely. If the war in Lebanon ends, Um Yaman said, they may return, but 'nothing is clear at all.' ___ Associated Press writer Albert Aji in Damascus, Syria, contributed.	https://apnews.com/article/lebanon-syria-refugees-9a88483256c625661acfadbaac66cbf5	2024-11-09T09:17:07-08:00	
Ecuador's VP suspended for 150 days deepening rift with president as February election looms	QUITO (AP) — Ecuador's Vice President Veronica Abad was suspended Saturday for 150 days accused of 'unjustified abandonment' of her duties. It comes during a public rift between Abad and President Daniel Noboa that could have implications for Ecuador 's February elections. Abad's suspension without pay came at midnight, her lawyer Dominique Dávila told The Associated Press. Dávila called the move 'extremely serious' and claimed it may not have any legal backing. Abad was accused by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of not following an order in September to temporarily transfer her from Israel — where she also serves as ambassador — to Turkey due to the conflict, arriving eight days after the order. Abad had argued that she was not 'properly prepared' for the trip to Turkey and that Ecuador's government suggested 'that I leave my children in Israel to go to Turkey alone.' The move comes at a time of deep tensions between Abad and Noboa who, despite running the government together, have clashed for years establishing a sort of feud, the origins of which are unknown. In August, Abad filed a legal complaint accusing Noboa and other officials of gender-based violence. The suspension was the second sanction against Abad in less than a week. Abad was also fined $8,500 on Tuesday by Ecuador’s Electoral Disputes Tribunal for early election campaigning in 2023 when she was a candidate for mayor of the city of Cuenca. The vice president has previously cited the Israel case and other incidents as government measures to pressure her to resign, while the president has called her 'disloyal.' Dávila, Abad's lawyer, said the suspension was the latest attempt to push Abad out, calling it a 'trick to prevent the presidential succession' and something they planned to appeal. Abad’s fate has special importance for Noboa, who hopes to run for reelection in February 2025, and will have to request a leave of absence to carry out the campaign, according to experts. In that case, Abad would take over the presidency, but with the recent sanctions, the pathway to her taking the reigns would be blocked, according to constitutional lawyer André Benavides. The expert said that while the suspension lacks strong legal backing, any appeals process to reverse the 150 day suspension would take longer than the suspension period.	https://apnews.com/article/ecuador-daniel-noboa-elections-abad-israel-turkey-8016799ca759405486a4889e12359b46	2024-11-09T09:16:53-08:00	
Family of 31-year-old American tourist killed in Hungary's capital mourns loss, suspect in custody	BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) — Family members of a 31-year-old American tourist who was killed while on vacation in Hungary’s capital mourned their loss while a 37-year-old suspect was in custody Saturday. The victim, Mackenzie Michalski from Portland, Oregon, was reported missing on Nov. 5 after she was last seen at a nightclub in central Budapest. Police launched a missing person investigation and reviewed security footage from local nightclubs where they observed Michalski with a man later identified as the suspect in several of the clubs the night of her disappearance. The man was detained on Nov. 7 and questioned by police, and later confessed to the killing. Before the confession, Michalski's family and friends had launched an effort to find her, starting a Facebook group to gather tips on her whereabouts. Her parents traveled to Hungary to assist in the search, but while en route learned that she had been killed. At a candlelight vigil in Budapest on Saturday night, the victim's father, Bill Michalski, told The Associated Press that he was 'still overcome with emotion' at the death of his daughter. 'There was no reason for this to happen,' he said. 'I’m still trying to wrap my arms around what happened ... I don’t know that I ever will.' Police detained the suspect, an Irish citizen, on the evening of Nov. 7. Investigators said that Michalski and the suspect met at a nightclub and danced before leaving for the man's rented apartment. The man killed Michalski while they were engaged in an 'intimate encounter,' police said. The suspect, whom police identified by the initials L.T.M., confessed to the killing, but said it had been an accident. Police said that he had attempted to cover up his crime by cleaning the apartment and hiding Michalski's body in a wardrobe before purchasing a suitcase and placing her body inside. He then rented a car and drove to Lake Balaton, around 90 miles (150 kilometers) southwest of Budapest, where he disposed of the body in a wooden area outside the town of Szigliget. Video released by police showed the suspect guiding authorities to the location where he had left the body. Police said the suspect had made internet searches before being apprehended on how to dispose of a body, police procedures in missing person cases, whether pigs really eat dead bodies, and the presence of wild boars in the Lake Balaton area. He also made an internet search inquiring on the competence of Budapest police. Crime scene photographs released by police showed a rolling suitcase, several articles of clothing including a pair of fleece-lined boots, and a small handbag next to a credit card bearing Michalski's name. According to a post by an administrator of a Facebook group called 'Find Mackenzie Michalski,' which was created on Nov. 7, Michalski, who went by 'Kenzie,' was a nurse practitioner who 'will forever be remembered as a beautiful and compassionate young woman.'

5 siblings, some of them deaf, among those killed in Israeli strikes in Lebanon	TYRE, Lebanon (AP) — An Israeli airstrike on the southern Lebanese port city of Tyre left at least seven people dead, among them five siblings, three of whom were deaf and mute, officials and a resident said Saturday. Elsewhere in Lebanon, Israeli airstrikes killed 31 people. The rise in Tyre’s death toll came as Israel’s air force carried out airstrikes on different parts of southern and eastern Lebanon on Saturday hours after Beirut’s southern suburbs were pounded by jets, destroying several buildings, state media reported. The Health Ministry said late Saturday that the airstrikes on towns and villages in the eastern Bekaa Valley and Baalbek-Hermel province left 20 people dead while those in two villages in south Lebanon killed 11 people, including five paramedics. Lebanon’s Hezbollah group said it fired dozens of rockets on northern Israel and shot down a drone over south Lebanon. The group said that Israel’s air force struck the area where the drone crashed. There was no immediate confirmation from the Israeli military. The Health Ministry said the strikes on Tyre late Friday night also wounded 46 people. It added that remains also were found in rubble and DNA tests will be used to identify the victims. Youssef Jundi, a Tyre resident, told The Associated Press that the airstrikes destroyed several buildings in the coastal city. He said that his long-time neighbor and friend, Ghazwa Dabouk, was among those killed. Dabouk’s sisters Elissar, Rabab and Fidaa, who were deaf and mute, were also killed in the airstrike, together with Dabouk's brother Ali, who had autism. The Israeli military said it attacked the Tyre offices of Hezbollah’s intelligence department as well as a command and control center for the group in the city. More than 3,000 people were killed in Lebanon during the 13 months of the Israel-Hezbollah war. Hezbollah began firing rockets into northern Israel the day after Hamas’ surprise attack into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, ignited the war in Gaza. Hezbollah and Hamas are both allied with Iran. For nearly a year, the conflict was mostly contained to the areas along the border between Israel and Lebanon. The conflict dramatically escalated on Sept. 23 with intense Israeli airstrikes on south and east Lebanon as well as Beirut’s southern suburbs, leaving hundreds dead and leading to the displacement of nearly 1.2 million people. Israel began a ground invasion of south Lebanon on Oct. 1, causing wide destruction in border villages but making little advances on the ground inside Lebanon. Israel says it is destroying Hezbollah weapons and command centers near the border, including an extensive tunnel system built by Hezbollah. ____ Mroue reported from Beirut. ___ Follow AP’s war coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war	https://apnews.com/article/lebanon-israel-tyre-hezbollah-airstrikes-4670246c9bcb30a5eff31b9575e19ac9	2024-11-09T07:04:35-08:00	
Iranian American human rights activist expresses defiance over Iranian plots to kill her and Trump	BERLIN (AP) — In the middle of a Berlin hotel cafe, Masih Alinejad raises her voice and starts singing at the top of her lungs in Farsi, as waiters turn to watch along with the three German government bodyguards assigned to protect her. 'I blossom through my wounds and my scars,' she translates the lyrics as. 'Because I am a woman. I am a woman. I am a woman.' Alinejad was expressing her defiance and asserting her right to express herself following the news of Iranian murder-for-hire plots to kill her and Donald Trump that were disclosed by the U.S. Justice Department. She said that some Iranian women had been jailed for singing. The Iranian American human rights activist, who was in Berlin on Saturday to celebrate the 35th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall together with other human rights activists from around the globe, told The Associated Press in an interview that despite the shock of the news, she felt more determination than ever to continue fighting for women's rights in Iran. 'They want to get rid of me. When they want me dead, it means that I’m doing something. I’m hurting them so bad,' Alinejad, 48, said, referring to the Iranian government. 'I’m echoing the voice of powerful women and that scares them.' She raised her hand in a defiant fist repeatedly during the interview. On Friday, the U.S. Justice Department said that it was charging a man who said he had been tasked by a government official before this week’s election with planning the assassination of Trump. Investigators were told of the plan by Farhad Shakeri, an accused Iranian government asset who spent time in American prisons for robbery and who authorities say maintains a network of criminal associates enlisted by Tehran for surveillance and murder-for-hire plots. Shakeri is at large and remains in Iran. Two other men — identified as Jonathan Loadholt and Carlisle Rivera by the U.S. Justice Department — were arrested on charges that Shakeri recruited them to follow and kill Alinejad, who has endured multiple Iranian murder-for-hire plots foiled by law enforcement. The Justice Department alleges that the two men spent months conducting surveillance on her and, during their efforts to locate and kill her, shared messages about their progress and photographs. Around February, they traveled to Fairfield University in Connecticut, where Alinejad was scheduled to appear and took photos of the campus. Around April, Shakeri sent Rivera a series of voice notes discussing their efforts to locate and kill her, the Justice Department said in a statement Friday. In one voice note, Shakeri told Rivera that 'you gotta wait and have patience to catch her either going in the house or coming out, or following her out somewhere and taking care of it,' the statement said. 'It’s scary. But at the same time, I was very pleased that the U.S. law enforcement is protecting me,' Alinejad said, recounting her call with American security officials. 'The same person who was trying to kill President Trump was assigned to kill me as well. I mean, that’s a badge of honor,' she added. In Tehran, Esmail Baghaei, an Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman, rejected the report and called it a plot by Israel-linked circles to make Iran-U.S. relations more complicated, the official IRNA news agency reported. Alinejad is a prominent figure on Farsi-language satellite channels abroad that critically view Iran, and she has worked as a contractor for U.S.-funded Voice of America’s Farsi-language network since 2015. She fled Iran following the country’s disputed 2009 presidential election and became a U.S. citizen in October 2019. Alinejad accused the Iranian government of continuing to oppress women in Iran and make them wear the mandatory headscarf, or hijab, even two years after the death of Mahsa Amini that sparked weekslong mass protests. The fact that the Iranian government has repeatedly tried to kill her, she said, 'makes me more determined to give voice to powerful women inside Iran who are facing the same killers every single day.'	https://apnews.com/article/germany-us-iran-murder-plot-masih-alinejad-72e20558d5f3c2b78e16188c85a88d8d	2024-11-09T06:59:44-08:00	
Tens of thousands celebrate fall of the Berlin Wall 35 years ago with concerts and art installations	BERLIN (AP) — Tens of thousands of people celebrated the fall of the Berlin Wall 35 years ago in Germany's capital on Saturday with open-air concerts, art installations and official events commemorating one of the country's most historic days on Nov. 9, 1989. It was 'a lucky day for which we Germans are still grateful today,' Chancellor Olaf Scholz said. Built in 1961, the Berlin Wall stood for 28 years at the front line of the Cold War between the Americans and the Soviets. It was built by communists to cut off East Germans from the supposed ideological contamination of the West and to stem the tide of people fleeing East Germany. It had carved a 156.4-kilometer (97.2-mile) swath through Berlin’s heart and the surrounding countryside, and through the hearts of many of its people. However, when the border was opened 35 years ago, it took less than a year until the country’s reunification on Oct. 3, 1990. Today only a few stretches of the wall remain, mostly as a tourist attraction. For the anniversary celebrations on Saturday, event organizers created a temporary wall of 5,000 posters designed by children and adults under the motto 'We uphold freedom,' which attracted a steady flow of visitors, including many foreign tourists. It stands along a four-kilometer (2.5-mile ) stretch of the former wall in downtown Berlin. The posters combine the demands of East German protesters against the communist authorities in autumn 1989, such as freedom of expression, freedom of the press and freedom to travel, with current day wishes and were created as part of workshops in schools, church parishes, local art groups and cultural projects. 'Uphold freedom, because without freedom everything else is nothing,' Berlin Mayor Kai Wegner said at an official anniversary event with President Frank-Walter Steinmeier at the Berlin Wall Memorial. 'Freedom and democracy have never been a matter of course,' the mayor said, warning that both were currently under attack from many sides. For Saturday night, 700 professional and amateur musicians were expected to synchronously play songs on different stages along the path of the former wall. Among other songs, they were planning to perform Heroes' by David Bowie and 'Freiheit,' or freedom, by German rockstar Marius Müller-Westernhagen. The lyrics will be shown on screens so that the audience can sing along. The Russian dissident band 'Pussy Riot' is expected to perform on Sunday as the highlight and conclusion of the anniversary celebrations.	https://apnews.com/article/germany-fall-of-berlin-wall-35th-anniversary-6b58354d28bc3a727ccc4334c395e7b7	2024-11-09T06:29:28-08:00	
Tourists in Rome now have a walkway to visit the Trevi Fountain but can't toss coins	ROME (AP) — Tourists in Rome won’t be allowed to toss coins over their shoulders into the Trevi Fountain, following tradition, though an elevated walkway now gives limited access to the monument during maintenance work. Rome Mayor Roberto Gualtieri inaugurated the steel walkway on Saturday, saying it will provide tourists with a close-up view of the fountain and calling it a 'unique experience' that won’t be ruined by overcrowding. The walkway over the fountain’s basin will be able to accommodate about 130 people at a time. But tourists won’t be allowed to toss coins from there, as the fountain is currently drained, and could face a 50-euro fine if they do, the mayor warned. City lore has it that tossing a coin into the Baroque fountain will ensure a return trip to Rome. Gualtieri said a small pool has been set up next to the walkway to collect the coins, which are donated to the Caritas charity to fund meals for people in need. The walkway will remain until the end of the maintenance work, which is expected to finish by year's end. Rome city officials are devising a plan to block off the area around the fountain. Under the plan, visitors will be required to book online and pay 2 euros ($2.20). Once inside, they will have 30 minutes to enjoy the fountain.	https://apnews.com/article/italy-trevi-fountain-coins-tourists-36b23e5dcca6dae53dcf59fcd6b7d5fa	2024-11-09T06:27:34-08:00	
Attacks on Israeli fans in the Netherlands prompts prime minister to cancel climate talks trip	THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof on Saturday canceled a trip to United Nations climate talks in Azerbaijan so he can stay in the Netherlands to deal with the fallout from assaults on fans of Maccabi Tel Aviv soccer team in Amsterdam that authorities condemned as antisemitic. The government will discuss the Thursday night violence at a Cabinet meeting on Monday, Schoof posted on X, saying that he would hold talks on tackling antisemitism on Tuesday. Police launched a large-scale investigation after gangs of youths conducted what Amsterdam's mayor called 'hit and run' attacks on fans that were apparently inspired by calls on social media to target Jewish people. Five people were treated at hospitals and more than 60 suspects were arrested. Amsterdam police said that four of the suspects remained jailed Saturday. In addition to the police investigation and an independent inquiry announced by Amsterdam's mayor, Dutch Justice and Security Minister David van Weel said in a letter to lawmakers that the government is investigating whether warnings of possible violence from Israel were overlooked in the lead up to the Europa League match between Ajax and Maccabi. Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar rushed to the Netherlands on Friday and offered Israel's help in the police investigation. He met Saturday with Dutch counterpart Caspar Veldkamp. Amsterdam Mayor Femke Halsema said that the Netherlands' counterterror watchdog had reported before the match there was no 'concrete threat' to Israeli fans, and the match wasn't considered a high risk. Even so, Amsterdam authorities banned a pro-Palestinian demonstration outside the Johan Cruyff Arena where Thursday night’s match was played. Video also showed a large crowd of Israeli fans chanting anti-Arab slogans on their way to the game. Afterward, youths on scooters and on foot went in search of Israeli fans, punching and kicking them and then fleeing quickly to evade hundreds of police officers deployed around the city, Halsema said. Schoof returned early from a European Union summit in Hungary and met Friday night with representatives of the Jewish community in the Netherlands. 'It was a compelling conversation about the sadness and uncertainty experienced in the Jewish community. Every day they experience the consequences of growing antisemitism in the Netherlands,' Schoof said on X. A ban on demonstrations was in place throughout Amsterdam over the weekend, and security was beefed up at Jewish sites in the city, which has a large Jewish community and was home to Jewish World War II diarist Anne Frank and her family as they hid from Nazi occupiers.	https://apnews.com/article/amsterdam-soccer-violence-israel-palestinians-bece8281ad2d653e95cb1b3dc0f527cc	2024-11-09T05:40:42-08:00	
Queen Camilla has a chest infection and will miss the UK's annual Remembrance Sunday events	LONDON (AP) — Queen Camilla will miss Britain's annual remembrance weekend events to honor fallen service personnel while she recovers from a chest infection, Buckingham Palace said Saturday. The wife of King Charles III, was due to join the royal family at a 'Festival of Remembrance' at London's Royal Albert Hall on Saturday night. The 77-year-old was also scheduled to honor the war dead at the Remembrance Sunday ceremony at the Cenotaph war memorial, a major event for Britain's royals, the next day. 'Following doctors’ guidance to ensure a full recovery from a seasonal chest infection, and to protect others from any potential risk, Her Majesty will not attend this weekend’s Remembrance events,' the statement said, adding that she was greatly disappointed. Charles and his daughter-in-law Kate, the Princess of Wales, who both announced earlier this year that they had been diagnosed with cancer, are expected to attend the twin events. The king was diagnosed with an undisclosed form of cancer in February but he has gradually returned to public duties after receiving treatment, and recently completed a trip to Australia and Samoa. Kate underwent her own treatment for an unspecified type of cancer that was detected after abdominal surgery earlier in the year. She said in September that it has been a difficult year but expressed relief that she has completed chemotherapy.	https://apnews.com/article/britain-royals-camilla-remembrance-sunday-25831084b44ec868dd84654d712fa7ad	2024-11-09T05:38:36-08:00	
One of 8 migrants sent to Albania returned to Italy	ROME (AP) — One of the eight migrants brought for processing in an Albanian center after being intercepted in international waters has returned to Italy after being deemed 'vulnerable,' a delegation of Italian activists and lawmakers visiting the center said on Saturday. The Egyptian man was diagnosed with 'psychic problems,' which made it impossible for him to remain at the Gjadër reception center, one of the activists said. Currently only seven migrants – five from Bangladesh and two from Egypt – remain at the Albanian center. The group represented the second transfer of migrants since two processing centers started operating in October under a deal sealed between Italy and Albania. Human rights groups and nongovernmental organizations active in the Mediterranean have slammed the agreement as a dangerous precedent that conflicts with international laws. The agreement allows up to 3,000 migrants intercepted by the Italian coast guard in international waters each month to be sheltered in Albania, and vetted for possible asylum in Italy or be sent back to their countries. Italy has agreed to welcome those migrants who are granted asylum, while those whose applications are rejected face deportation directly from Albania. The first group of 16 migrants from Bangladesh and Egypt was transferred to Albania on Oct. 16. Four were taken to Italy the same day because they were minors or had health issues. Twelve others were brought back to Italy three days later, following a ruling by Rome judges who rejected their detention because their countries of origin weren’t safe enough for them to be sent back. The court ruling had shortened the list of countries considered 'safe' by law, meaning that Rome can repatriate migrants from those countries who didn’t win asylum using a fast-track procedure. Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni slammed the decision, noting that deeming countries such as Bangladesh and Egypt unsafe means that virtually all migrants would be barred from the Albania program. On Oct. 21, Italy’s far-right government approved a new decree aimed at overcoming those judicial hurdles that risked derailing the contentious five-year migration deal with Albania. A decision by Rome judges on the detention of the seven migrants currently in Albania is expected for Monday. ___ Follow AP’s global migration coverage at: https://apnews.com/hub/migration	https://apnews.com/article/italy-albania-centers-migrants-f514411c7bef176d1ff2d8dc68caf983	2024-11-09T03:49:11-08:00	
Hungry Palestinians in north Gaza search for food, sealed off from aid for a month by Israeli siege	JERUSALEM (AP) — With virtually no food allowed into the northernmost part of Gaza for the past month, tens of thousands of Palestinians under Israeli siege are rationing their last lentils and flour to survive. As bombardment pounds around them, some say they risk their lives by venturing out in search of cans of food in the rubble of destroyed homes. Thousands have staggered out of the area, hungry and thin, into Gaza City, where they find the situation little better. One hospital reports seeing thousands of children suffering from malnutrition. A nutritionist said she treated a pregnant woman wasting away at just 40 kilograms (88 pounds). 'We are being starved to force us to leave our homes,' said Mohammed Arqouq, whose family of eight is determined to stay in the north, weathering Israel’s siege. 'We will die here in our homes.' Medical workers warn that hunger is spiraling to dire proportions under a monthlong siege on north Gaza by the Israeli military, which has been waging a fierce campaign since the beginning of October, saying it's rooting out militants. Hamas, who are still holding hostages inside Gaza, have regrouped in the area and have been carrying out hit-and-run attacks from tunnels and bombed-out buildings. The military has severed the area with checkpoints, ordering residents to leave. Many Palestinians fear Israel aims to depopulate the north long term. On Friday, experts from a panel that monitors food security said famine is imminent in the north or may already be happening. The growing desperation comes as the deadline approaches next week for a 30-day ultimatum the Biden administration gave Israel: raise the level of humanitarian assistance allowed into Gaza or risk possible restrictions on U.S. military funding. The U.S. says Israel must allow a minimum of 350 trucks a day carrying food and other supplies. Israel has fallen far short. In October, 57 trucks a day entered Gaza on average, according to figures from Israel's military agency overseeing aid entry, known as COGAT. In the first week of November, the average was 81 a day. The U.N. puts the number even lower — 37 trucks daily since the beginning of October. It says Israeli military operations and general lawlessness often prevent it from collecting supplies, leaving hundreds of truckloads stranded at the border. U.S. State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said Israel had made some progress by announcing the opening of a new crossing into central Gaza and approving new delivery routes. But he said Israel must do more. 'It’s not just sufficient to open new roads if more humanitarian assistance isn’t going through those roads,' he said. A desperate daily struggle Israeli forces have been hammering the towns of Beit Lahiya, Beit Hanoun and Jabaliya refugee camp. Witnesses report intense fighting between troops and militants. A trickle of food has reached Gaza City, but as of Thursday, nothing entered the towns farther north for 30 days, even as an estimated 70,000 people remain there, said Louise Wateridge, spokesperson for the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, speaking from Gaza City. The government acknowledged in late October that it hadn't allowed aid into Jabaliya because of military 'operational constraints' in response to a petition by Israeli human rights groups. On Saturday, COGAT said it allowed 11 trucks of food and supplies into Beit Hanoun and Jabaliya. But Alia Zaki, a spokeswoman for the WFP, said Israeli troops at a checkpoint forced the convoy to unload the food before it could reach shelters in Beit Hanoun. It was not clear what then happened to the supplies. Palestinians in the north described to The Associated Press a desperate daily struggle to find food, water and safety, as strikes level buildings, sometimes killing whole families. Arqouq said he goes out at night to search bombed-out buildings: 'Sometimes you find a half-empty package of flour, canned food and lentils.' His family relies on help from others sheltering at a Jabaliya school, he said — but their food, too, is running low. 'We are like dogs and cats searching for their food in the rubble,' said Um Saber, a widow. She said she and her six children had to flee a school-turned-shelter in Beit Lahiya when Israel struck it. Now they live in her father-in-law's home, stretching meager supplies of lentils and pasta with 40 others, mostly women and children. Ahmed Abu Awda, a 28-year-old father of three living with 25 relatives in a Jabaliya house, said they have a daily meal of lentils with bread, rationing to ensure children eat. 'Sometimes we don’t eat at all,' he said. Lubna, a 38-year-old mother of five, left food behind when fleeing as strikes and drone fire pummeled the street in Jabaliya. 'We got out by a miracle,' she said from Beit Lahiya, where they're staying. She spoke on condition her family name not be used for fear of her safety. Her husband scavenged flour from destroyed homes after Israeli forces withdrew around nearby Kamal Adwan hospital, she said. It's moldy, she said, so they sift it first. Her young daughter, Selina, is visibly gaunt and bony, Lubna said. Surrender or starve The offensive has raised fears among Palestinians that Israel seeks to empty northern Gaza and hold it long term under a surrender-or-starve plan proposed by former generals. The Israeli military has denied receiving such orders, but the government hasn't denied the plan outright. Witnesses report Israeli troops going building-to-building, forcing people to leave toward Gaza City. On Thursday, the Israeli military ordered new evacuations from several Gaza City neighborhoods, raising the possibility of a ground assault there. The U.N. said some 14,000 displaced Palestinians were sheltering there. Food and supplies are stretched for the several hundred thousand people in Gaza City, too. Much of the city has been flattened by months of Israeli bombardment and shelling. Dr. Rana Soboh, a nutrition specialist at Gaza City’s Patient Friend Benevolent Hospital, said she sees some 350 cases of moderate to severe acute malnutrition daily, most from the north but also Gaza City. 'The bone of their chest is showing, the eyes are protruding,' she said, and many have trouble concentrating. 'You repeat something a number of times, so they can understand what we are saying.' She cited a 32-year-old woman shedding weight in her third month of pregnancy — when they put her on the scale, she weighed only 40 kilograms (88 pounds). 'We are suffering, facing the ghost of famine that is hovering over Gaza,' Soboh said. A problem long in the making Even before the siege in the north, the Patient Friend hospital saw a flood of children suffering from malnutrition — more than 4,780 in September compared with 1,100 in July, said Dr Ahmad Eskiek, who oversees hospital operations. Soboh said staff get calls from Beit Lahiya and Jabaliya pleading for help: 'What can we do? We have nothing.' She had worked at Kamal Adwan Hospital in the north but fled with her family to Gaza City. Now they stay with 22 people in her uncle's two-bedroom apartment. Thursday, she had had a morsel of bread for breakfast and later a meal of yellow lentils. As winter rains near, new arrivals set up tents wherever they can. Some 1,500 people are in a U.N. school already heavily damaged in strikes that 'could collapse at any moment,' UNRWA spokesperson Wateridge said. With toilets destroyed, people try to set aside a corner of a classroom to use, leaving waste 'streaming down the walls of the school,' she said. Others in Gaza City move into the rubble of buildings, draping tarps between layers of collapsed concrete, she said. 'It’s like the carcass of a city,' she said. ___ Magdy reported from Cairo.

Russia open to hearing Trump's proposals for ending the war, an official says	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Russia is open to hearing President-elect Donald Trump’s proposals on ending the war, an official said, as a Russian drone killed one person and wounded 13 in the Ukrainian port city of Odesa and the European Union foreign policy chief held talks in Kyiv on support for Ukraine after the change in U.S. leadership. Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said Moscow and Washington were 'exchanging signals' on Ukraine via 'closed channels.' He did not specify whether the communication was with the current administration or Trump and members of his incoming administration. Russia is ready to listen to Trump’s proposals on Ukraine provided these were 'ideas on how to move forward in the area of ​​settlement, and not in the area of ​​further pumping the Kyiv regime with all kinds of aid,' Ryabkov said Saturday in an interview with Russian state news agency Interfax. Odesa regional Gov. Oleh Kiper said high-rise residential buildings, private houses and warehouses in the Black Sea port city were damaged by the 'fall' of a drone. He did not specify whether the drone had been shot down by air defenses. A further 32 Russian drones were shot down over 10 Ukrainian regions, while 18 were 'lost,' according to Ukraine’s air force, likely having been electronically jammed. A Russian aerial bomb struck a busy highway overnight in the northeastern Kharkiv province, Kharkiv Mayor Ihor Terekohov said. No casualties were reported. Russia is mounting an intensified aerial campaign that Ukrainian officials say they need more Western help to counter. However, doubts are deepening over what Kyiv can expect from a new U.S. administration. Trump has repeatedly taken issue with U.S. aid to Ukraine, made vague vows to end the war and has praised Russian President Vladimir Putin. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell, however, reassured Ukraine of European support during a visit to Kyiv on Saturday. 'EU support to Ukraine has been my personal priority during my mandate and will remain on top of the EU’s agenda,' he wrote on X. In Russia, the Defense Ministry said 50 Ukrainian drones were destroyed over seven Russian regions — more than half over the Bryansk region, bordering Ukraine. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-odesa-borrell-drone-a16db37ffa75c3cc92c01a6e9d79142f	2024-11-09T01:22:38-08:00	
Israeli strikes in Gaza kill at least 16 people as aid arrives in the north after weeks of hunger	DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Three separate Israeli strikes killed at least 16 people, including women and children, in Gaza on Saturday, Palestinian medical officials said, while Israel announced the first delivery of humanitarian aid in weeks to hungry, devastated northern Gaza. There continued to be no end in sight to Israel's campaigns against Hamas militants in Gaza or Hezbollah in Lebanon, where Israel's military said that it struck command centers and other militant infrastructure overnight in Beirut's southern suburbs. One of the strikes in Gaza hit a school-turned-shelter in Gaza City’s eastern Tufah neighborhood, killing at least six people, the territory's Health Ministry said. Two local journalists, a pregnant woman and a child were among the dead, it said. The Israeli army said the strike targeted a militant belonging to the Palestinian Islamic Jihad group, offering no evidence or details. Seven people were killed when an Israeli strike hit a tent in the southern city of Khan Younis where displaced people were sheltering, according to Nasser Hospital. It said the dead included two women and a child. The Israeli army didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. And Palestinian medical officials said an Israeli strike hit tents in the courtyard of central Gaza’s main hospital, including one serving as a police point. At least three people were killed and a local journalist was wounded, Al-Aqsa Martyrs hospital in Deir al-Balah said. It was the eighth Israeli attack on the compound since March. Israel says aid trucks reach northern Gaza The Israeli military body in charge of humanitarian aid to Gaza, COGAT, said Saturday that 11 aid trucks containing food, water and medical equipment reached the enclave's far north on Thursday. It's the first time any aid has reached the far north since Israel began a new military campaign there last month. But not all the aid reached the agreed drop-off points, according to the the U.N. World Food Program, which was involved in the delivery process. In the urban refugee camp of Jabaliya, Israeli troops stopped one convoy bound for nearby Beit Lahiya and ordered the supplies to be offloaded, WFP spokesperson Alia Zaki said. Israel’s offensive has focused on Jabaliya, where Israel says Hamas had regrouped. Other areas affected include Beit Lahiya and Beit Hanoun just north of Gaza City. U.S. deadline is looming for Israel The aid announcement came days before a U.S. deadline demanding that Israel improve aid deliveries across Gaza or risk losing access to U.S. weapons funding. The U.S. says Israel must allow a minimum of 350 trucks a day carrying food and other supplies. Meanwhile, a report by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, or IPC, issued Thursday said there's a strong likelihood that famine is imminent in parts of northern Gaza, the territory's most isolated area. COGAT rejected the IPC's finding and said the report relied 'on partial, biased data and superficial sources with vested interests.' No emergency services functioning north of Gaza City The U.N. estimates that tens of thousands of people remain in northern Gaza. Earlier this week, the Health Ministry said there were no ambulances or emergency crews operating north of Gaza City. The conflict has left 90% of Palestinians in Gaza displaced, according to U.N. figures. Israel's army has struck several schools and tent camps packed with tens of thousands of Palestinians driven from their homes by Israeli offensives and evacuation orders. The military has accused Hamas of operating from within civilian infrastructure in Gaza, including schools, U.N. facilities and hospitals. More than a year of war in Gaza has killed more than 43,000 people, Palestinian health officials say. They don't distinguish between civilians and combatants, but say more than half of those killed were women and children. The war began after Palestinian militants stormed into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing around 1,200 people — mostly civilians — and abducting 250 others. ___ Samy Magdy reported from Cairo.

100-year-old Royal Air Force veteran will join UK memorial service for the first time	LONDON (AP) — Michael Woods has visited his wife, Mary, every day since she moved into a nursing home two years ago. But on Sunday, the 100-year-old Royal Air Force veteran will skip the daily get-together so he can fulfill another duty — honoring the men he served with during World War II. For the first time since he left the RAF in 1947, Woods will take part in Britain’s national Remembrance Day service, joining thousands of veterans as they march past the Cenotaph war memorial in central London to honor those who died during the world wars and all the conflicts that followed. 'It’s a great privilege for me to do this,' said Woods, a mechanic who kept Lancaster bombers flying during the war. 'And I suppose I’ll never do it again.' The annual ceremony is a solemn event marked every year when the king and envoys from the Commonwealth nations that fought alongside Britain in the two world wars lay wreaths at the Cenotaph. It culminates when up to 10,000 veterans, many with medals gleaming on their chests and regimental berets on their heads, parade past the memorial. Until now, Woods has watched on television from his home in Dunstable, 30 miles (50 kilometers) away. Mary always watched with him. Woods had a lot on his mind before. For many years, he was busy with his family: two daughters, a son, eight grandchildren and nine great-grandchildren. And, more recently, he was looking after Mary, his wife of 68 years. But there was something else holding him back as well. He didn’t feel he deserved the honor, as he was 'just' a mechanic working on the 12-cylinder Rolls-Royce Merlin engines that powered the Lancaster bombers. He changed his mind after he connected with other ex-service members through Blind Veterans UK, the charity that has helped him deal with macular degeneration and glaucoma. He felt it was time to remember the men who didn’t come home after they roared into the sky aboard planes he had certified as airworthy. Each Lancaster carried a crew of seven, most in their early 20s, so the losses — so many at once — were hard to bear. 'It’s very, very upsetting when a Lancaster takes off and it doesn’t return,' Woods told The Associated Press. 'I couldn’t forget it if I wanted to,' he added. 'It’s just imprinted on your mind, you know.' The RAF’s Bomber Command had the highest attrition rate of any Allied unit during World War II, with 44% of aircrew members killed in action, according to the International Bomber Command Centre. Some 55,573 of the 125,000 who served on the aircrews died during the war. Adrian Bell, CEO of Blind Veterans UK, said he’s met many World War II veterans who describe themselves as mere cogs in a massive machine. But that’s what it took to defeat fascism. Everyone was needed. So come Sunday, Woods will be marching. With the stubbornness to retain his independence that seems to have come with turning 100, Woods insists he won’t use a wheelchair because he has never used one before and isn’t going to start now. Besides, his son, Eddie, will be there to act as a guide and his buddies from the charity will be nearby to offer emotional support. He will be an inspiration, Bell said. 'I think the most important thing is the fortitude of a man who is 100 years old, who fought in the Second World War and beyond, who is going to be there physically on Sunday and marching as a tribute to those who lost their lives and as a sort of a sign of hope and a sign ... that there is life after all of these things,' Bell said. 'That’s the embodiment of something that I think is really important.'	https://apnews.com/article/remembrance-sunday-veteran-wwii-michael-woods-raf-efec864aac454949ada2d74f80401b4a	2024-11-08T20:13:50-08:00	
Death toll rises to 20 in a powerful bombing at a Quetta rail station in southwestern Pakistan	QUETTA, Pakistan (AP) — The death toll from a powerful bombing at a Quetta rail station in restive southwestern Pakistan on Saturday rose to at least 20, officials said. The attack also left more than 40 others wounded, some critically. The bomb exploded when nearly 100 passengers were waiting for a train to travel to the garrison city of Rawalpindi from Quetta, the capital of the restive Balochistan province, said Mohammad Baloch, a senior police officer. A separatist group, the Balochistan Liberation Army, claimed the attack in a statement, saying a suicide bomber targeted troops present at the railway station. The outlawed BLA has long waged an insurgency seeking independence from Islamabad. Shahid Rind, a government spokesperson said the bombing seemed to have been a suicide attack, but an investigation was still ongoing to confirm the BLA's claim TV footage showed the steel structure of the platform's roof blown apart and a tea stall destroyed as luggage littered the place. Ayesha Faiz, a Quetta police official, said some of the critically wounded passengers died at a hospital, raising the deaths. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif denounced the bombing in a statement, saying those who orchestrated the attack 'will pay a very heavy price for it,' adding that security forces were determined to eliminate 'the menace of terrorism.' The oil- and mineral-rich Balochistan is Pakistan’s largest but also least populated province. It is also a hub for the country’s ethnic Baloch minority whose members say they face discrimination and exploitation by the central government. Along with separatist groups, Islamic militants also operate in the province. BLA often targets security forces and foreigners, especially Chinese nationals who are in Pakistan as part of Beijing’s multibillion-dollar Belt and Road Initiative, which is building major infrastructure projects. Last month, BLA claimed responsibility for a suicide bombing that targeted a convoy with Chinese nationals outside the Karachi airport, killing two. Since then, Beijing has asked Pakistan to ensure the safety of its citizens working on multiple projects in Balochistan and other parts of the country. ___ Associated Press writer Asim Tanveer contributed to this story from Multan, Pakistan,	https://apnews.com/article/quetta-railway-bombing-pakistan-30457309ca4b4c29bd3a5149509acb2e	2024-11-08T20:03:40-08:00	
UN sanctions 2 generals from Sudan's paramilitary force for key roles in war against the military	UNITED NATIONS (AP) — The United Nations Security Council imposed sanctions Friday on two generals in Sudan’s paramilitary force for their key roles in the war against the country’s military that has seen ethnically motivated attacks and atrocities. Sudan plunged into conflict in mid-April 2023, when long-simmering tensions between its military and paramilitary leaders broke out in the capital, Khartoum, and spread to other regions, including Darfur. The U.N. says over 14,000 people have been killed and 33,000 injured, and recently warned that the country has been pushed to the brink of famine. The council’s sanctions committee added Maj. Gen. Osman Mohamed Hamid Mohamed, head of the Rapid Support Forces' operations department, and Maj. Gen. Abdel Rahman Juma Barkalla, the RSF commander in West Darfur, to the sanctions blacklist. Britain’s U.N. Mission tweeted on X that the two generals were added for threatening the peace, security and stability of Sudan, 'including acts of violence and human rights abuses.' The U.N. sanctions order all countries to freeze the asses and impose a travel ban on the generals. The United States Treasury imposed sanctions on both generals earlier in the year, freezing any assets in the U.S. and banning all financial transactions with them. Two decades ago, Darfur became synonymous with genocide and war crimes, particularly by the notorious Janjaweed Arab militias, against populations that identify as Central or East African. Up to 300,000 people were killed and 2.7 million were driven from their homes. That legacy appears to have returned, with the International Criminal Court’s prosecutor, Karim Khan, saying in January there were grounds to believe both sides may be committing war crimes, crimes against humanity, or genocide in Darfur. The RSF was born out of the Janjaweed. Human Rights Watch said in a report in May that attacks by the paramilitary force and its allied militias, which killed thousands in Darfur in 2023, constituted a campaign of ethnic cleansing against the area’s non-Arab population. The rights group said the RSF and its militias targeted the ethnic Masalit and other non-Arab groups in El Geneina, the capital city of West Darfur state. Masalit who were captured were tortured, women and girls were raped and entire neighborhoods were looted and destroyed, Human Rights Watch said. Its report is entitled 'The Massalit Will Not Come Home: Ethnic Cleansing and Crimes Against Humanity in El Geneina, West Darfur, Sudan.' The RSF controls the capitals of four of the five states in Darfur and has intensified its military campaign for control of the lone holdout, North Darfur capital El Fasher.	https://apnews.com/article/un-sudan-sanctions-paramilitary-force-war-darfur-7a4c4cf64f64030e3ca27a591591c610	2024-11-08T19:24:18-08:00	
North Korean GPS manipulation disrupted dozens of planes and vessels, South Korea says	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea’s military said North Korea disrupted GPS signals from border areas for the second-straight day on Saturday, affecting an unspecified number of flights and vessel operations. Tensions between the rival Koreas have escalated as North Korean leader Kim Jong Un flaunts his advancing nuclear and missile program and engages in electronic and psychological warfare, such as flying thousands of balloons to drop trash and anti-South Korean propaganda leaflets in the South. South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said North Korean operations to manipulate GPS signals were detected from around the western border city of Kaesong and the nearby city of Haeju on Friday and Saturday, and said the activities disrupted dozens of civilian aircraft and several vessels. While warning aircraft and vessels near western border areas, South Korea’s military did not specify how North Korea was interfering with GPS signals or detail the extent of disruptions. 'We urge North Korea to stop GPS interference provocations immediately and strongly warn that it will be held fully accountable for any resulting consequences,' the South’s joint chiefs said in a statement. North Korea’s GPS signal disruptions and balloon campaigns highlight the vulnerability of South Korea’s Incheon International Airport, its main transportation gateway, analyst Sukjoon Yoon recently wrote on the North Korea-focused 38 North website. The airport, which carries 56 million people and 3.6 million tons of cargo annually, is less than 100 kilometers (62 miles) from North Korea. 'No major aviation incidents have resulted to date, but GPS interference can endanger commercial airlines flying in poor visibility, and it is a violation of international conventions on navigational safety,' Yoon wrote. He said that in 2024, North Korean trash balloons halted the airport’s runway operations 12 different times for a total of 265 minutes. Kim has shown more hostility this year toward Seoul’s conservative government — which maintains a hard line on Pyongyang — with the North abandoning its long-standing goals of reconciliation with its war-divided rival and rewriting its constitution to cement South Korea as a permanent adversary. North Korea also blew up sections of its unused road and rail routes linked with the South in October in a symbolic display of anger toward Seoul, and opened November with a flight-test of a new intercontinental ballistic missile to dial up pressure on Washington. South Korean officials say North Korean activities to disrupt GPS signals from western border regions increased as the country began launching trash-carrying balloons toward the South in late May, which the North described as a retaliation against South Korean civilian activists flying anti-North Korean propaganda leaflets across the border. Aside from North Korea’s weapons demonstrations and non-conventional provocations, there’s growing concern over its reported provision of military equipment and troops to Russia to support President Vladimir Putin’s war on Ukraine. South Korean officials say the deepening military alignment between Moscow and Pyongyang could possibly result in Russian technology transfers that increases the threat posed by Kim’s military nuclear program.	https://apnews.com/article/north-korea-gps-interference-jamming-aircraft-nuclear-2f6a345ffd3bcf2875b04a758658c9c7	2024-11-08T18:44:20-08:00	
Trump's deportation plan a key focus for Canada's Cabinet committee on US-Canada relations	TORONTO (AP) — President-elect Donald Trump’s promise to launch a mass deportation of millions of undocumented people is a top focus for Canada, its deputy prime minister said Friday, as the country plans to deal with a possible influx north. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau re-established a special Cabinet committee on Canada-U.S. relations to address his administration’s concerns about another Trump presidency this week. Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland, who is chair of the revived committee, said what Trump's deportation plan would mean for Canada is a key priority for the committee. 'I do want Canadians to know it is one of our two central points of focus,' Freeland said after the group met for the first time since Trump's first term in office. Freeland said controlling Canada's border is fundamental. 'Canadians are right to be concerned about it,' she said. Freeland said Canada has a plan, but she did not share any details. She said she spoke to the leaders to Canada's provinces about the issue this week and said it is intentional that the country's immigration and public safety ministers are members of the committee. The deputy prime minister said the committee will meet often including early next week again. Canada saw an increase in the number of irregular border crossings between 2016 and 2023, which the the Royal Canadian Mounted Police attributes in part to the first Trump presidency. The national police service has said they have been working through multiple scenarios in case there is a change in irregular migration - which is trending down this year Trump has talked about creating 'the largest mass deportation program in history.' And Trump has called for using the National Guard and empowering domestic police forces in the effort. Trudeau and U.S. President Joe Biden announced last year a plan to close a loophole to an immigration agreement that allowed thousands of asylum-seeking immigrants to move between the two countries along a back road linking New York state to the Canadian province of Quebec. The policy says asylum seekers without U.S. or Canadian citizenship who are caught within 14 days of crossing anywhere along the 3,145-mile (5,061-kilometer) border will be sent back.	https://apnews.com/article/canada-us-trump-deportations-freeland-faabd10473a10c7ab3a369234334741a	2024-11-08T13:39:38-08:00	
1 killed and 3 wounded after gunmen open fire at Brazil’s largest international airport	SAO PAULO (AP) — Brazilian police said that unidentified gunmen in a black car opened fire at Sao Paulo’s International Airport in Guarulhos on Friday afternoon, killing one person and injuring three others. Police identified the fatal victim as Antônio Vinícius Lopes Gritzbach, who had previously received death threats from the First Command of the Capital, a powerful international criminal group. Gritzbach, who had cryptocurrency businesses, had recently entered into a plea bargain with local prosecutors to speak about his ties to the criminal organization, police said. Police have not yet determined the number of gunmen involved in the attack. Social media footage shows two individuals who appear to have been shot at the airport. One victim is seen lying on the ground at Terminal 2, primarily used for domestic flights, while the other is seen stranded on an access road outside the terminal. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america	https://apnews.com/article/gunmen-brazil-international-airport-ae6601775a0adfea0fa17a2f4bfec56c	2024-11-08T13:07:24-08:00	
The Pentagon is letting a small number of U.S. defense contractors fix weapons in Ukraine	WASHINGTON (AP) — The Pentagon is easing restrictions to allow a small number of private American defense contactors to work inside Ukraine, helping repair and maintain equipment, U.S. officials said Friday. The contractors will be far away from the front lines during Russia's invasion and will not be taking part in combat, the officials said. The department is soliciting bids now, said the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal decisions. Ukraine has been receiving billions of dollars worth of American weapons and equipment over the past two years, including a number of sophisticated systems. For much of that time, U.S. and allied troops have been providing real-time maintenance advice using phones and tablets to communicate in encrypted chatrooms with Ukrainian forces. Officials said the Pentagon is allowing the contractors to go because some equipment — including F-16 fighter jets and air defense systems — requires high-tech expertise to repair. Using the contractors, they said, will ensure the weapons are fixed quickly so Ukrainian forces can continue to use them in combat. The decision expands the footprint of U.S. government contractors working in Ukraine. The State Department already has contracted with U.S. companies to work inside the country, including on the energy grid. In addition, a number of American companies have workers in Ukraine under contracts with the Kyiv government. Officials said the companies will be responsible for the safety of their employees.	https://apnews.com/article/ukraine-contractors-pentagon-weapons-repair-c59260ab3db7514dd8930823e0b5adf3	2024-11-08T12:38:23-08:00	
Spanish phone company subsidiary to pay $85M to resolve US probe of Venezuelan bribery scheme	WASHINGTON (AP) — A Venezuelan subsidiary of a Spanish phone company will pay more than $85 million to resolve a U.S. Justice Department investigation into a scheme to bribe Venezuelan government officials, the department said Friday. Telefónica Venezolana, a subsidiary of Telefónica S.A., bribed Venezuelan officials to participate in an auction that allowed it to get U.S. dollars in exchange for Venezuelan bolivars, Justice Department officials said. Telefónica Venezolana bought equipment at inflated prices from suppliers, who then paid the bribes on its behalf in an attempt to hide the illegal scheme, prosecutors said. 'Telefónica Venezolana chose to support a corrupt regime to circumvent the difficulties of conducting legal business in Venezuela,' said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Nicole Argentieri, who leads the Justice Department’s Criminal Division. The subsidiary is charged in U.S. federal court with conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act but will avoid prosecution under an agreement with the Justice Department if it follows certain conditions. Telefónica S.A. officials did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment Friday.	https://apnews.com/article/venezuela-bribery-scheme-phone-company-justice-department-fbb571ecd3cf1ce7c9d023a37fdec4b6	2024-11-08T12:35:35-08:00	
Trump put Elon Musk on phone with Ukraine's Zelenskyy during congratulatory call, official says	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — President-elect Donald Trump put billionaire Elon Musk on the line with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy when the Ukrainian leader called to congratulate the incoming U.S. president, according to a Ukrainian official with direct knowledge of the phone call. The person, who was not authorized to comment on the matter publicly, confirmed that Zelenskyy and Musk spoke during the call with Trump, but that Musk did not appear to be on the line for the entire conversation on Wednesday. Trump seemingly handed his phone over to Musk, the person said, and the Ukrainian president thanked the SpaceX owner for assisting his country with access to the Starlink satellite internet platform. The presence of Musk on the call highlights his influence in the president-elect’s circle. Trump has mused that Musk could have a formal role in his administration that focuses on government efficiency, raising questions about potential conflicts of interest given SpaceX’s lucrative government contracts. Trump’s interactions with Zelenskyy are being closely watched as he prepares to take over the presidency on Jan. 20 and has signaled a shift in Washington’s steadfast support for Ukraine against Russia’s nearly three-year-old invasion. Trump has promised to swiftly end the war and suggested that Kyiv should agree to cede some territory to Moscow in return for peace, a condition Zelenskyy has rejected. It was under Trump that the United States first sent weapons to Ukraine in its fight against Russia, in 2017. Those Javelin anti-tank missiles were crucial to Ukraine’s initial ability to fend off the full-scale invasion in 2022. President Joe Biden's administration has sent tens of billions of dollars in military and economic assistance to Ukraine, drawing criticism from Trump and Vice President-elect JD Vance, who are wary of U.S. involvement in foreign conflicts and suggested the money could better be spent domestically. Trump has promoted his good relationship with President Vladimir Putin and called the Russian leader 'pretty smart' for invading Ukraine. He characterized Zelenskyy as 'the greatest salesman on earth' for winning U.S. aid. Zelenskyy is one of dozens of world leaders, business executives and political leaders to speak with Trump, who has been at his private club and residence in Florida, in the days since he won the White House. The Trump transition said it would not comment on private meetings. Axios was first to report on Musk's presence on the Trump-Zelenskyy call. ___ Gomez Licon reported from West Palm Beach, Fla. and Miller reported from Washington.	https://apnews.com/article/trump-ukraine-elon-musk-zelenskyy-starlink-f6ab0c5e1c5de1262ae2a1747247819c	2024-11-08T12:32:40-08:00	
International court to launch external probe into misconduct accusations against top prosecutor	THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — The International Criminal Court will launch an external probe into sexual misconduct accusations against its top prosecutor, The Associated Press has learned, keeping alive a case that the court’s internal watchdog had closed within five days. Karim Khan has categorically denied the accusations that he tried to coerce a female aide into a sexual relationship, and the claims come amid reports of an ongoing Israeli intelligence campaign to discredit the court’s prosecution of Benjamin Netanyahu for alleged war crimes in Gaza. The external investigation was approved this week at a meeting of the court's oversight body, the Assembly of States Parties to the Rome Statute, according to three people familiar with the matter who spoke to AP on condition of anonymity to discuss the closed-door deliberations. It was unclear exactly who would conduct the probe, the people said, noting that possibilities included law enforcement officials from Europe and a law firm. The United Nations’ internal watchdog has also been discussed for such a probe but that could be fraught with conflict-of-interest concerns because Karim’s wife, a prominent human rights attorney, had previously worked at the agency in Kenya investigating sexual harassment. Neither Päivi Kaukoranta, a Finnish diplomat currently heading the ICC’s oversight body, nor Khan's attorney immediately responded to requests for comment. An AP investigation found that two court employees in whom the alleged victim confided came forward with the accusation in May, a few weeks before Khan sought arrest warrants against Netanyahu, his defense minister and three Hamas leaders on war crimes charges. A three-judge panel is now weighing that request. AP reported that Khan traveled frequently with the woman after transferring her to his office from another department at the ICC’s headquarters in The Hague. During one foreign trip, Khan allegedly asked the woman to rest with him on a hotel bed and then 'sexually touched her,' according to whistleblower documents shared with the court’s watchdog and seen by the AP. Later, he came to her room at 3 a.m. and knocked on the door for 10 minutes. Other allegedly nonconsensual behavior cited in the documents included locking the door of his office and sticking his hand in her pocket. He also allegedly asked her on several occasions to go on a vacation together. After the two co-workers reported the alleged behavior, the court's internal watchdog interviewed the woman but she opted against filing a complaint due to her distrust of the watchdog, according to the AP investigation. Khan was never questioned and the watchdog's inquiry was closed within five days. While the court’s watchdog could not determine wrongdoing, it nonetheless urged Khan in a memo to minimize contact with the woman to protect the rights of all involved and safeguard the court’s integrity. Under Khan, the ICC has become more assertive in combating crimes against humanity, war crimes and related atrocities. Along the way, it has added to a growing list of enemies. Last September, following the opening of a probe into Russian atrocities in Ukraine, the court suffered a debilitating cyberattack that left staff unable to work for weeks. It also hired an intern who was later criminally charged in the U.S. with being a Russian spy. Israel has also been waging its own influence campaign ever since the ICC recognized Palestine as a member and in 2015 opened a preliminary investigation into Israel's actions. London’s The Guardian newspaper and several Israeli news outlets reported this summer that Israel’s intelligence agencies for the past decade have allegedly targeted senior ICC staff, including putting Khan’s predecessor under surveillance and showing up at her house with envelopes stuffed with cash to discredit her. An external probe would go further than what Khan proposed when, following the AP report, he called on the ICC's internal watchdog to investigate the matter and said he would fully cooperate. ___ Goodman reported from Miami.

Father and daughter win $58,000 in lawsuit against man who claimed Manchester Arena bombing was hoax	LONDON (AP) — A father and daughter crippled by a suicide bomber who killed 22 people after an Ariana Grande concert in England in 2017 were awarded 45,000 pounds ($58,000) Friday in a case against a former television producer who claimed the tragedy was a hoax. Martin Hibbert and his daughter, Eve, won their harassment suit in the High Court in London last month against Richard Hall for videos, a film and a book he produced that falsely claim the Manchester Arena bombing was staged using actors and no one was wounded or killed. Hall, an independent producer, had claimed 'millions of people have bought a lie' about the attack and defended his work, including surreptitiously filming the daughter, as journalism in the public's interest. Justice Karen Steyn called Hall’s conduct a 'negligent, indeed reckless, abuse of media freedom.' She said he used the 'flimsiest of analytical techniques' to dismiss 'the obvious, tragic reality to which so many ordinary people have attested.' Salman Abedi blew himself up with a bomb hidden in a knapsack as fans were leaving the Grande concert on May 22, 2017. In addition to those killed, more than 260 people were wounded and hundreds of others were left with 'deep psychological injuries,' police said. Martin Hibbert was paralyzed from the waist down and his daughter, who was 14 at the time, nearly died and has severe brain damage. The Hibbert's also won an injunction preventing Hall from further harassment, and Hall will have to pay 90% of their legal costs that are currently estimated at 260,000 pounds ($335,000). The award, however, is meager compared to many won in U.S. lawsuits. In a case that also involved denying a major tragedy, conspiracy theorist Alex Jones was ordered to pay $1.5 billion to parents of children killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut in 2012 for falsely claiming it was a hoax. Martin Hibbert said that he never expects to see a penny of the award, but the victory wasn't about money. 'What this was about was bringing him down in public, in front of his own followers, that’s what I’ve done,' he said outside court. Hall said the trial was unfair and continued to insist the bombing didn't happen as he left the court.	https://apnews.com/article/manchester-bombing-lawsuit-fake-claims-hoax-harassment-1b61ec8d880b4a8ac5051f1402f0cf39	2024-11-08T09:24:53-08:00

Justice Department brings criminal charges in Iranian murder-for-hire plan targeting Donald Trump	WASHINGTON (AP) — The Justice Department on Friday disclosed an Iranian murder-for-hire plot to kill Donald Trump, charging a man who said he had been tasked by a government official before this week's election with planning the assassination of the Republican president-elect. Investigators were told of the plan to kill Trump by Farhad Shakeri, an accused Iranian government asset who spent time in American prisons for robbery and who authorities say maintains a network of criminal associates enlisted by Tehran for surveillance and murder-for-hire plots. Shakeri told the FBI that a contact in Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard instructed him this past September to set aside other work he was doing and assemble a plan within seven days to surveil and ultimately kill Trump, according to a criminal complaint unsealed in federal court in Manhattan. The official was quoted by Shakeri as saying that 'We have already spent a lot of money' and that 'money’s not an issue.' Shakeri told investigators the official told him that if he could not put together a plan within the seven-day timeframe, then the plot would be paused until after the election because the official assumed Trump would lose and that it would be easier to kill him then, the complaint said. Shakeri is at large and remains in Iran. Two other men were arrested on charges that Shakeri recruited them to follow and kill prominent Iranian-American journalist Masih Alinejad, who has endured multiple Iranian murder-for-hire plots foiled by law enforcement. 'I’m very shocked,' said Alinejad, speaking by telephone to The Associated Press from Berlin, where she was about to attend a ceremony to mark the anniversary of the tearing down of the wall. 'This is the third attempt against me and that’s shocking.' In a post on the social media platform X, she said: 'I came to America to practice my First Amendment right to freedom of speech — I don’t want to die. I want to fight against tyranny, and I deserve to be safe. Thank you to law enforcement for protecting me, but I urge the U.S. government to protect the national security of America.' Lawyers for the two other defendants, identified as Jonathan Loadholt and Carlisle Rivera, did not immediately return messages seeking comment. Iran's U.N. Mission declined to comment. Shakeri, an Afghan national who immigrated to the U.S. as a child but was later deported after spending 14 years in prison for robbery, also told investigators that he was tasked by his Revolutionary Guard contact with plotting the killings of two Jewish-Americans living in New York and Israeli tourists in Sri Lanka. Officials say he overlapped with Rivera while in prison as well as an unidentified co-conspirator. The criminal complaint says Shakeri disclosed some of the details of the alleged plots in a series of recorded telephone interviews with FBI agents while in Iran. The stated reason for his cooperation, he told investigators, was to try to get a reduced prison sentence for an associate behind bars in the U.S. According to the complaint, though officials determined that some of the information he provided was false, his statements regarding a plot to kill Trump and Iran's willingness to pay large sums of money were determined to be accurate. The plot, announced by the Justice Department just days after Trump's defeat of Democrat Kamala Harris, is part of what federal officials have described as ongoing efforts by Iran to target U.S. government officials, including Trump, on U.S. soil. Last summer, for instance, the Justice Department charged a Pakistani man with ties to Iran in a murder-for-hire plot targeting American officials. 'There are few actors in the world that pose as grave a threat to the national security of the United States as does Iran,' Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement Friday. FBI Director Christopher Wray said the case shows Iran's 'continued brazen attempts to target U.S. citizens,' including Trump, 'other government leaders and dissidents who criticize the regime in Tehran.' Iranian operatives also conducted a hack-and-leak operation of emails belonging to Trump campaign associates in what officials have assessed was an effort to interfere in the presidential election and harm Trump's campaign. Intelligence officials have said Iran opposed Trump’s reelection, seeing him as more likely to increase tension between Washington and Tehran. Trump’s administration ended a nuclear deal with Iran, reimposed sanctions and ordered the killing of Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani, an act that prompted Iran’s leaders to vow revenge. Trump spokesman Steven Cheung said the president-elect was aware of the assassination plot and nothing will deter him 'from returning to the White House and restoring peace around the world.' ____ Neumeister reported from New York.

Pompeii archaeological park sets daily visitors' limit to combat over-tourism	ROME (AP) — The Pompeii archaeological park plans to limit visitor numbers to 20,000 a day and introduce personalized tickets starting next week in a bid to cope with over-tourism and protect the world heritage site, officials said Friday. The move comes after what authorities called a record summer that saw over 4 million people visiting the world-famous remains of the ancient Roman city, buried under ash and rock following the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 A.D. The park's director Gabriel Zuchtriegel said visitors to the main archaeological site now exceed an average of 15,000 to 20,000 every day, and the new daily cap will prevent the numbers from surging further. 'We are working on a series of projects to lift the human pressure on the site, which could pose risks both for visitors and the heritage (that is) so unique and fragile,' Zuchtriegel said. Starting Nov. 15 tickets to access the park will be personalized to include the full names of visitors. A maximum of 20,000 tickets will be released each day, with different time slots during the peak summer season. The park’s management is also trying to attract more tourists to visit other ancient sites connected to Pompeii by a free shuttle bus under the 'Greater Pompeii' project, including Stabia, Torre Annunziata and Boscoreale sites. 'The measures to manage flows and safety and the personalization of the visits are part of this strategy,' Zuchtriegel said. 'We are aiming for slow, sustainable, pleasant and non-mass tourism and above all widespread throughout the territory around the UNESCO site, which is full of cultural jewels to discover,' he added.	https://apnews.com/article/pompeii-ancient-site-park-tourists-overtourism-tickets-limit-visits-fe569aba8ba48f5b5d7ca64b53f313cd	2024-11-08T07:34:10-08:00	
A Ukrainian medic fell in love with a soldier on the front. They died together in a Russian attack	A crowd of mourners lit torches and intoned a military chant to honor a Ukrainian medic and a soldier who fell in love on the frontline and died together in a Russian shell attack. Valentyna Nahorna, whose call sign was Valkyrie, volunteered as a medic at the start of the war in Ukraine. She and Daniil Liashkevych, known as Berserk, fell in love just a few months ago, their friends and comrades say, but it helped them endure the war. They both worked in the 3rd Assault Brigade, and were killed Nov. 4. Their funerals were held on Friday at Kyiv ’s crematorium, a cavernous and grimly modern building often used for funerals of the war dead. Those gathered gave the chant that Ukrainian soldiers learn by heart when they first start training: 'Burn with fire, life-giving, the weakness in my heart. Let me know no fear, nor doubt.' Kostyl, who like many Ukrainian soldiers agreed to be identified only by his call sign, said meeting Valkyrie helped Berserk emerge from a dark time in his life. 'He finally had a soulmate who also wanted to fight with him and be as close to the war as possible, But this was their last time together, and no one is safe from that,' Kostyl said. Dvyetshnik, a 3rd Brigade soldier who knew the medic better than her soldier companion, described her as fearless and willing to learn anything. 'If Valkyrie was very sincere in her emotions and thus added a beautiful chaos, Berserk was a real warrior,' he said. 'They were a perfect complement to each other.'	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-ed6d9e89978bba75b1bc487d9fa881db	2024-11-08T07:29:38-08:00	
Rafael weakens into a tropical storm as it swirls over the Gulf of Mexico after lashing Cuba	HAVANA (AP) — Hurricane Rafael weakened into a tropical storm Friday as it swirled through the Gulf of Mexico where it was expected to break apart after plowing through Cuba, knocking out the country's power grid and collapsing hundreds of houses. On Friday night, the tropical storm was located 240 miles (390 kms) north of Progreso, Mexico. It had maximum sustained winds of 70 mph (110 kph) and was moving west-northwest at 5 mph (7 kph), according to the National Hurricane Center in Miami. It was forecast to move westward toward Mexico in the coming days and forecasters warned that swells from the hurricane were likely to cause 'life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.' Mexico's government on Friday warned of powerful rain, winds and waves up to 8 feet (2.5 meters) high in the Campeche, Quintana Roo and Yucatan states in the coming hours, asking citizens to take care. Forecasters said they expected the storm to weaken and 'meander' over the center of the Gulf through early next week. The hurricane tore through Jamaica and the Cayman Islands earlier in the week, knocking out power and fueling mudslides. On Wednesday evening, it barreled into Cuba, causing yet another headache for the island. Rafael's fierce winds knocked out Cuba's electric grid, forced the evacuation of 283,000 people and collapsed 461 homes. It also left trees, power lines and rubble strewn across flooded streets. On Friday, the Cuban government said it was able to restore power to approximately 143,000 homes in Havana, though many people were still without power. Rafael followed a rocky few weeks in the Caribbean nation. First, it was hit by island-wide blackouts stretching on for days, a product of the island’s energy crisis. Shortly after, it was slapped by powerful hurricane that struck the eastern part of the island and killed at least six people.	https://apnews.com/article/hurricane-rafael-gulf-of-mexico-cuba-natural-disaster-rip-currents-bace6e930c5b530eadf7f1dce7009ab9	2024-11-08T06:30:06-08:00	
Weather extremes influence illegal migration and return between the U.S. and Mexico, study finds	Extreme weather is contributing to undocumented migration and return between Mexico and the United States, suggesting that more migrants could risk their lives crossing the border as climate change fuels droughts, storms and other hardships, according to a new study. People from agricultural areas in Mexico were more likely to cross the border illegally after droughts and were less likely to return to their original communities when extreme weather continued, according to research this week in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Across the globe, climate change — caused by burning fossil fuels such as coal and natural gas — is exacerbating extreme weather. Droughts are longer and drier, heat is deadlier and storms are rapidly intensifying and dumping record-breaking rain. In Mexico, a country of nearly 130 million people, drought has drained reservoirs dry, created severe water shortages and drastically reduced corn production, threatening livelihoods. Researchers said Mexico is a notable country for studying the links between migration, return and weather stressors. Its mean annual temperature is projected to increase up to 3 degrees Celsius (5.4 degrees Fahrenheit) by 2060, and extreme weather is likely to economically devastate rural communities dependent on rain-fed agriculture. The U.S. and Mexico also have the largest international migration flow in the world. Scientists predict migration will grow as the planet gets hotter. Over the next 30 years, 143 million people worldwide are likely to be uprooted by rising seas, drought, searing temperatures and other climate catastrophes, according to a U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report. The new migration research comes as Republican Donald Trump was reelected to the U.S. presidency this week. Trump has called climate change a 'hoax' and promised mass deportations of an estimated 11 million people in the U.S. illegally. Researchers said their findings highlight how extreme weather drives migration. Filiz Garip, a study researcher and professor of sociology and international affairs at Princeton University, said advanced nations have contributed far more to climate change than developing countries that are bearing the brunt. Migration 'is not a decision that people take up lightly ... and yet they’re being forced to make it more, and they’re being forced to stay longer in the United States' as a result of weather extremes, Garip said. The researchers analyzed daily weather data along with survey responses from 48,313 people between 1992 and 2018, focusing on about 3,700 individuals who crossed the border without documents for the first time. They looked at 84 agricultural communities in Mexico where growing corn was dependent on weather. They correlated a person's decision to migrate and then return with abnormal changes in temperature and rainfall in their origin communities during the May-to-August corn growing season. The study found communities experiencing drought had higher migration rates compared to communities with normal rainfall. And people were less likely to return to Mexico from the U.S. when their communities were unusually dry or wet. That was true for recent U.S. arrivals and people who had been there longer. People who were better off financially were also more likely to migrate. So were people from communities with established migration histories where friends, neighbors or family members who previously migrated could offer information and help. These social and economic factors that influence migration are well understood, but Garip said the study's findings underscore the inequities of climate adaptation. With extreme weather events, not everybody is impacted or responds in the same way, she said, 'and the typical social and economic advantages or disadvantages also shape how people experience these events.' For Kerilyn Schewel, codirector of Duke University's Program on Climate, Resilience and Mobility, the economic factors highlight that some of most vulnerable people aren't those displaced by climate extremes, but are rather 'trapped in place or lacking the resources to move.' Schewel, who was not involved in the study, said analyzing regions with migration histories could help predict where migrants will come from and who is likelier to migrate because of climate shocks. In 'places where people are already leaving, where there’s a high degree of migration prevalence, ... that’s where we can expect more people to leave in the future,' she said. The survey data used from the Mexican Migration Project makes this study unique, according to Hélène Benveniste, a professor in Stanford University’s department of environmental social sciences. Migration data of its scale that's community specific is 'rarely available,' she said in an email. So is information about a person's full migration journey, including their return. The finding that return migration decisions were delayed by weather stress in origin communities is 'important and novel,' said Benveniste, who studies climate-related human migration and was not involved in the study. 'Few datasets enable an analysis of this question.' But increased surveillance and enforcement along the U.S.-Mexico border make returning home — and moving back and forth — more difficult, said Michael Méndez, assistant professor of environmental policy and planning at the University of California, Irvine. And once undocumented migrants are in the U.S., they often live in dilapidated housing, lack health care or work in industries such as construction or agriculture that make them vulnerable to other climate impacts, he said. Méndez was not involved in the study. As climate change threatens social, political and economic stability around the world, experts said the study highlights the need for global collaboration around migration and climate resilience. 'So much of our focus has been, in a way, on the border and securing the border,' said Schewel from Duke. 'But we need much more attention to not only the reasons why people are leaving, but also the demand for immigrant workers within the U.S.' ——— The Associated Press receives support from the Walton Family Foundation for coverage of water and environmental policy.

The Latest: House remains in the balance as world reaction to Trump victory keeps pouring in	Republican leaders are projecting confidence that they will keep control of the U.S. House as more races were decided in their favor Thursday, while Democrats insist they still see a path toward the majority and sought assurances every vote will be counted. The Republicans won control of the U.S. Senate early Wednesday. Follow the AP’s Election 2024 coverage at: https://apnews.com/hub/election-2024. Here’s the latest: Trump speaks with the leader of the Palestinian Authority The office of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas says the leader of the Palestinian Authority has spoken with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump for the first time since his victory in the 2024 campaign. In a statement Friday, Abbas’ office in the occupied West Bank city of Ramallah said that the president congratulated Trump on his victory and wished him success in his upcoming term. It said that Abbas told Trump he was ready to work with him in pursuit of peace and that Trump, in turn, 'emphasized his commitment to the stop the war.' The phone call follows months of resistance by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to the Biden administration’s push for a cease-fire that would see Israel end the war against Hamas in Gaza. Over 43,000 people have been killed, according to the Gaza-based Health Ministry, which doesn’t distinguish between militants and civilians. Trump and Abbas had a particularly rocky relationship during Trump’s first term, when his administration reduced outreach to the Palestinians and reversed decades of U.S. policy in the Mideast in Israel’s favor. As right-wing commentators move mainstream, Alex Jones’ Infowars is up for grabs Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones’ Infowars broadcasts could end next week as he faces a court-ordered auction of his company’s assets to help pay the more than $1 billion defamation judgment he owes families of victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. Or maybe not. Both opponents and supporters of the bombastic internet show and radio host have expressed interest in bidding on the Infowars properties he has built over the past 25 years. They include Roger Stone, an ally of Jones and Donald Trump, and anti-Jones progressive media groups. If Jones supporters buy the assets, he could end up staying on Infowars. Jones and other right-wing commentators once on the fringe have catapulted in popularity as many people have moved away from traditional news sources. Trump elevated them further during his 2024 campaign by repeating some of their conspiracy theories and appearing on several of their podcasts and shows. On Thursday, Jones, a long-time Trump supporter, even accepted proposals, some perhaps tongue-in-cheek, by Donald Trump Jr. and other conservatives to be the president-elect’s press secretary. ▶ Read more about the possible fate of Infowars How Trump’s victory changed the calculation for migration Trump’s victory instantly changed calculations for millions of migrants or potential migrants across the globe. But perhaps not in the way Trump imagined. Trump has pledged to reduce immigration. But by narrowing the already limited legal pathways into the U.S., migrants will just recalibrate their plans and resort in greater numbers to hiring smugglers, experts say. In many cases that will mean turning to organized crime groups that increasingly profit from migrant smuggling. ▶ Read more about how Trump’s win spurs worry among migrants — but isn’t expected to stop migration What will US leadership look like under Trump on the world stage? U.S. presidents usually pay lip service at least to being leaders of the free world, at the helm of a mighty democracy and military that allies worldwide can rally around and reasonably depend upon for support in return. Not so under President-elect Donald Trump, a critic of many existing U.S. alliances, whose win of a second term this week had close European partners calling for a new era of self-reliance not dependent on American goodwill. 'We must not delegate forever our security to America,' French President Emmanuel Macron said at a European summit Thursday. Based on Trump’s first term and campaign statements, the U.S. will become less predictable, more chaotic, colder to allies and warmer to some strongmen, and much more transactional in picking friends globally than before. America’s place in world affairs and security will fundamentally change, both critics and supporters of Trump say. ▶ Read more about what the U.S. role on the world stage might look like A guide to the key figures in Donald Trump’s orbit Donald Trump will return to the White House accompanied by a crew of longtime friends and aides as well as newfound, splashy allies. The Republican president-elect has barely begun naming key figures in his administration, but he has kept a rotation of associates with him on and off the campaign trail in recent weeks who joined him on stage early Wednesday as he declared victory. ▶ Read more about these key figures Judge cancels court deadlines in Trump’s 2020 election case The judge overseeing Trump’s 2020 election interference case canceled any remaining court deadlines Friday after prosecutors said they need time to assess 'the appropriate course going forward' after the Republican’s presidential victory this week. Special Counsel Jack Smith charged Trump last year with plotting to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election and illegally hoarding classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate. But Smith’s team has been evaluating how to wind down the two federal cases before the president-elect takes office in light of longstanding Justice Department policy that says sitting presidents cannot be prosecuted, a person familiar with the matter told The Associated Press. Trump’s victory over Vice President Kamala Harris means that the Justice Department believes he can no longer face prosecution in accordance with department legal opinions meant to shield presidents from criminal charges while in office. In a court filing Friday in the 2020 election case, Smith’s team said it needs 'time to assess this unprecedented circumstance and determine the appropriate course going forward consistent with Department of Justice policy.' Smith’s team said it would inform the judge of 'the result of its deliberations' by Dec. 2. Expect leadership change at the FBI Donald Trump lavished Christopher Wray with praise when he named him FBI director in 2017, introducing him as an 'impeccably qualified individual' and a 'model of integrity.' So much has changed in the seven years since. With Trump poised to reclaim the White House, Wray’s days as director are likely numbered. Though the director’s job carries a 10-year term, Trump’s blistering and repeated criticism of his own appointee throughout his time as president raises the likelihood that Trump would either replace Wray upon taking office or that Wray would leave on his own to avoid being fired. Such a move would give Trump a chance to reshape the FBI’s leadership in his own image at a time when he’s threatened to pursue his own political adversaries. Trump’s transition office did not return an email seeking comment. An FBI official said Wray was continuing to lead the bureau on a day-to-day basis — including visiting the FBI’s election command post multiple times this week — and was planning with his team to lead the bureau into the next year. The official, an executive who interacts with Wray on a day-to-day basis, was not authorized to discuss the details publicly and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity. ▶ Read more about the future of the FBI under Trump The election was largely trouble-free, but a flood of misinformation raises future concerns A relatively trouble-free presidential election was good news for those working to restore faith in the system. Less encouraging was a flood of misinformation that sought to undermine trust in voting and sow chaos, something experts say is likely to get worse in the years ahead. The most significant test for officials on Election Day was a series of bomb threats reported in five battleground states, some of which forced polling places to be evacuated temporarily. ▶ Read more about election misinformation FBI thwarts Iranian murder-for-hire plan targeting Donald Trump The Justice Department unsealed criminal charges Friday in a thwarted Iranian plot to kill President-elect Donald Trump before this week’s presidential election.

AP VoteCast: Trump boosted his level of support among Catholic voters Among several blocs of religious voters, including his loyal evangelical base, Donald Trump fared roughly as well in his victory over Kamala Harris as he did in his loss to Joe Biden four years ago. One notable difference: He did better this year among Catholic voters, according to AP VoteCast, a survey of more than 120,000 voters. In 2020, the Catholic electorate — one the biggest religious blocs in the nation — was almost evenly split, with 50% backing Trump and 49% favoring Biden, a longtime member of the faith. This year, according to VoteCast, 54% of Catholic voters supported Trump and 44% backed Harris — a shift that was particularly notable in North Carolina, Florida and Texas. VoteCast documented a racial divide. About 6 in 10 white Catholics supported Trump, and about 4 in 10 supported Harris. By contrast, about 6 in 10 Latino Catholics supported Harris, and about 4 in 10 supported Trump. ▶ Read more about AP VoteCast’s findings on religion Trump 2.0 will alter global climate fighting efforts. Will others step up? Global efforts to fight climate change stumbled but survived the last time Donald Trump was elected president and withdrew the United States from an international climate agreement. Other countries, states, cities and businesses picked up some of the slack. But numerous experts worry that a second Trump term will be more damaging, with the United States withdrawing even further from climate efforts in a way that could cripple future presidents’ efforts. With Trump, who has dismissed climate change, in charge of the world’s leading economy, those experts fear other countries — especially top polluting nation China — could use it as an excuse to ease off their own efforts to curb carbon emissions. Trump’s reelection comes as the world is on track to set yet another record hot year, and has been lurching from drought to hurricane to flood to wildfire. ▶ Read more about the future of global climate action Leonard Leo says there’s no rush to replace Alito and Thomas Trump’s election could give him a chance to nominate up to two more Supreme Court justices if Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas retire, but a prominent conservative legal activist says there’s no rush. 'No one other than Justices Thomas and Alito knows when or if they will retire, and talking about them like meat that has reached its expiration date is unwise, uninformed, and, frankly, just crass,' said Leonard Leo, who serves as co-chair of the conservative Federalist Society and has been a driving force in securing nominations of conservative justices. His comments come after Republican judicial advocate Mike Davis, a Trump ally who runs The Article III Project, speculated online that Alito could be 'gleefully packing up his chambers.' Trump rebuilds ‘blue wall’ with red bricks Republicans landed historic victories in Pennsylvania this week, winning the battleground state’s valuable presidential electoral votes, posting a two-seat gain in its U.S. House delegation and sweeping all four statewide offices on the ballot, including a U.S. Senate seat. The strong performance means Donald Trump has won Pennsylvania in two out of three tries, after Republicans had lost six straight presidential elections there. Something similar happened in the other 'blue wall' states of Michigan and Wisconsin, Rust Belt states where Trump prevailed again after losing in 2020. Still, Democrats held on in key Senate races in Wisconsin and Michigan, if just barely, and the results played out differently in each state. ▶ Read more about how Democrats’ 'blue wall' states were painted Republican red Jeffries predicts a closely divided House Hakeem Jeffries, who leads the House Democratic Caucus, is preparing for another narrowly divided Congress, no matter which party wins the majority. In an interview on New York’s Spectrum News, Jeffries insisted that Democrats 'still have a pathway to taking back the majority' if the party can flip a series of seats in Arizona, Oregon and California where votes are still being counted. 'Whatever happens with the majority in the next Congress, Democrats will be no shorter than 212 to 214 votes,' Jeffries said. He added that the race for control will come down to eight seats that Republicans currently hold. However, it has been extraordinarily difficult for either party to flip seats in this election. Across the country, Republicans and Democrats have been able to flip just three seats each so far. Still, Jeffries led House Democrats through an election where they did not suffer the same degree of loss as their counterparts in presidential and Senate races. 'We’ve been able to withstand that presidential wave that broke against us,' he said. House Democratic leader says party should be ‘proud’ of Biden administration’s legislative accomplishments House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries, who has led the House caucus through an election where Democrats have not suffered the same degree of loss as their counterparts in presidential and Senate races, said Friday that his party should be 'proud' of the legislative accomplishments of the Biden administration. 'It’s a record that both progressives and centrist members of both the House and the Senate supported,' Jeffries said on New York’s Spectrum News, listing legislation like the American Rescue Plan, a largescale infrastructure deal and legislation to address climate change. 'More needs to be done to meet the needs of the American people, to build an economy that works for everyday Americans because there are far too many people that are struggling to live paycheck to paycheck,' Jeffries added. Democrats retain control of Pennsylvania’s House despite banner year for Republicans Democrats retained majority control of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives on Friday by holding onto a Johnstown area district, giving them just enough votes to keep the speakership and determine the chamber’s voting agenda. The win by incumbent Rep. Frank Burns is the final House race to be called in a year when none of the 203 districts are changing hands. It gave Democrats a 102-101 margin and dashed Republican hopes of returning to control after two years in the minority. Burns’ win is some consolation to Democrats in what has otherwise been a banner electoral year in Pennsylvania for the Republican Party. Former President Donald Trump won in the state, Dave McCormick beat Democratic U.S. Sen. Bob Casey, two Democratic congressional seat were flipped and Republican candidates won all three of the state row offices. ▶ Read more about the one-seat majority. AP VoteCast: How Donald Trump built a winning 2024 coalition Big shifts within small groups and small shifts within big groups helped propel Donald Trump’s return to the White House. The Republican candidate won by holding onto his traditional coalition — white voters, voters without a college degree and older voters — while making crucial gains among younger voters and Black and Hispanic men, according to AP VoteCast, a far-reaching survey of more than 120,000 voters nationwide. His Democratic opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris, made small gains — most significantly with white urban men with a college degree — but it wasn’t enough to offset her losses elsewhere. ▶ Read more about the coalition. Borrowers hoping for student loan forgiveness in limbo Savannah Britt owes about $27,000 on loans she took out to attend college at Rutgers University, a debt she was hoping to see reduced by President Joe Biden’s student loan forgiveness efforts. Her payments are currently on hold while courts untangle challenges to the loan forgiveness program. But as the weeks tick down on Biden’s time in office, she could soon face a monthly payment of up to $250. 'With this new administration, the dream is gone. It’s shot,' said Britt, 30, who runs her own communications agency. 'I was hopeful before Tuesday. I was waiting out the process. Even my mom has a loan that she took out to support me. She owes about $18,000, and she was in the process of it being forgiven, but it’s at a standstill.' President-elect Donald Trump and his fellow Republicans have criticized Biden’s loan forgiveness efforts, and lawsuits by GOP-led states have held up plans for widespread debt cancellation. Trump has not said what he would do on loan forgiveness, leaving millions of borrowers facing uncertainty over their personal finances. ▶ Read more about the fate of student loan borrowers. The view from an Israeli settlement named after Trump Israeli residents of 'Trump Heights' are welcoming the election of their namesake, hoping Donald Trump’s return to the U.S. presidency will breathe new life into this tiny, remote settlement in the central Golan Heights. During his first term, Trump became the first and only foreign leader to recognize Israel’s control of the Golan, which it seized from Syria in the 1967 Mideast war. Israel thanked him by rebranding this outpost after him. But a large-scale influx of new residents never materialized after that 2019 ceremony, and just a couple dozen families live in Trump Heights, or 'Ramat Trump' in Hebrew. Job opportunities are limited, and Israel’s more than yearlong war against Hezbollah militants in nearby Lebanon has added to the sense of isolation. Trump’s election has inspired hope in the community that it will attract more members and also more funding for security improvements. 'President Trump’s return to the White House definitely puts the town in the headlines,' Ori Kallner, head of the Golan’s regional council, said. ▶ Read more from Ramat Trump. How Trump went from diminished ex-president to victor As he bid farewell to Washington in January 2021, deeply unpopular and diminished, Donald Trump was already hinting at a comeback. 'Goodbye. We love you. We will be back in some form,' Trump told supporters at Joint Base Andrews, where he’d arranged a 21-gun salute as part of a military send-off before boarding Air Force One. 'We will see you soon.' Four years later, he’s fulfilled his prophecy. ▶ Read more about his path back to the presidency. Judge strikes down Biden administration program shielding immigrant spouses from deportation A federal judge on Thursday struck down a Biden administration policy that aimed to ease a path to citizenship for some undocumented immigrants who are married to U.S. citizens. The program, lauded as one of the biggest presidential actions to help immigrant families in years, allowed undocumented spouses and stepchildren of U.S. citizens to apply for a green card without first having to leave the country. The short-lived Biden administration initiative known as 'Keeping Families Together' would have been unlikely to remain in place after Donald Trump took office in January. But its early termination creates greater uncertainty for immigrant families as many are bracing for Trump’s return to the White House. ▶ Read more about the decision. Hungary’s Orbán predicts Trump will end support for Ukraine Donald Trump’s biggest European fan, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, is predicting that his administration will cease providing support to Ukraine in its fight against Russia’s full-scale invasion. Orbán’s comments were a signal that Trump’s election could drive a wedge among EU leaders on the question of the war. Hungary’s leader is hosting the second of two days of summits Friday in the capital, Budapest. The war in Ukraine will be high on the agenda for a gathering of the EU’s 27 leaders, most of whom believe continuing to supply Ukraine with weapons and financial assistance are key elements for the continent’s security. The nationalist Hungarian leader has long sought to undermine EU support for Kyiv, and routinely blocked, delayed or watered down the bloc’s efforts to provide weapons and funding and to sanction Moscow for its invasion. 'If Donald Trump had won in 2020 in the United States, these two nightmarish years wouldn’t have happened. There wouldn’t have been a war,' Orbán said. 'The situation on the front is obvious, there’s been a military defeat. The Americans are going to pull out of this war.' ▶ Read more about the comments. Turkey’s president praises Trump Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan praised Donald Trump over his election victory and expressed optimism for stronger relations between Turkey and the United States during his second term. In comments made late Thursday, Erdogan also voiced hope that conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine could come to an end through collaboration with Trump. Erdogan said Trump had won the election despite facing significant challenges, including an assassination attempt and criminal charges. 'Despite this, he continued his election campaign with much strength, tirelessly and with resilience,' Hürriyet newspaper and other media quoted Erdogan as telling journalists during a flight back from trips to Kyrgyzstan and Hungary. Erdogan has said that in the upcoming period, he would raise the issue of a possible withdrawal of U.S. troops from Syria with Trump. Election officials say key Maine race must go to ranked choice counting Maine election officials say a pivotal congressional race in the state must go to ranked choice counting to determine a winner. Maine Democratic Rep. Jared Golden, a moderate known for defying his party, led by a thin margin over Republican Austin Theriault on Friday in a race that was still too early to call days after voting ended. Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows said late Thursday that neither candidate broke 50% of the total vote, and that means ranked ballots must be counted. The Associated Press has not called the race. Ranked voting typically comes into play in races with more than two candidates on the ballot. Golden and Theriault were the only candidates in the 2nd Congressional District race, but writing in candidates was an option, and some voters used it. Theriault said on Thursday that he was requesting a recount in the election, although the results were not tabulated yet at that time. A spokesperson for the Golden campaign said the recount is reasonable but the ranked counting is unnecessary. 'State Rep. Theriault has asserted his right to a recount by hand and Congressman Golden agrees to it. So let’s just do it, rather than incur the delays and expenses of a ranked-choice run-off,' the campaign said in a statement. The Theriault campaign signaled Friday that it was supportive of the ranked count. 'There is a process in place and we look forward to the process unfolding according to the law,' campaign manager Shawn Roderick said. In ranked choice voting, the second choices of voters who picked a losing candidate are redistributed to the higher finishers. Election night television viewership drops sharply from 2020 and 2016 The idea of grabbing some popcorn and watching television to see who America has chosen for its next president was far less appealing this year than in the past. The Nielsen company said that 42.3 million people watched election night returns between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump pour in Tuesday night. That’s down sharply from the 56.9 million who watched in 2020, when Trump competed against Joe Biden, and the 71.4 million who tuned in on election night 2016, Nielsen said. Election night is often known as the Super Bowl for TV news, but this year even the NFL’s conference championship games were watched by more people. ▶ Read more about election night television viewership Who is Susie Wiles, Donald Trump’s new White House chief of staff?

With tens of thousands of ballots potentially still left to count in the state’s two biggest counties, the races are too early to call. Arizona: Another day of vote counting in Arizona added tens of thousands of votes to the tally on Thursday, but there remain hundreds of thousands of ballots left to count — including nearly half a million in Maricopa County. Officials there are still working their way through advance votes that arrived in October. The races for president and U.S. Senate remain too early to call. GOP picks up more key House seats while Democrats insist they still have a path to a majority Republican leaders projected confidence Thursday that they will keep control of the U.S. House as more races were decided in their favor, while Democrats insisted they still see a path toward the majority and sought assurances every vote will be counted. The GOP picked up two more hard-fought seats in Pennsylvania, which became a stark battlefield of Democratic losses up and down the ticket. Democrats notched another win in New York, defeating a third Republican incumbent in that state. Both parties in the House huddled privately on conference calls to assess the political landscape as Congress prepared to return next week to a changed Washington, where a sweep of MAGA-infused GOP power is within reach for President-elect Donald Trump. ▶ Revisit Thursday’s House calls	https://apnews.com/26e5d077f122ddcc56484437e476df42	2024-11-08T04:13:44-08:00	
Italian President Mattarella meets Chinese leader Xi in Beijing amid complex ties	BEIJING (AP) — Italian President Sergio Mattarella met with Chinese leader Xi Jinping Friday on an official visit to China that came as Russia’s full-on invasion of Ukraine pitted Rome's NATO allies against Beijing's support for Moscow. The two exchanged greetings following a ceremony with full military honors at the Great Hall of the People in the heart of Beijing. In his opening remarks, Xi referred to the 700th anniversary of Italian adventurer and trader Marco Polo's journey to China that encouraged cultural, economic and religious links between Europe and East Asia. Italy is heavily reliant on foreign trade such as luxury products that have a large market in China. It is also a member of NATO, which China has blamed for provoking the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Beijing has provided Moscow with assistance by purchasing its energy exports while selling it technology that can be used in drones and other armaments. Any differences on political issues were not raised in front of the media and the two leaders later oversaw the signing of a series of agreements on matters from culture to technology and trade. Italy has withdrawn from Xi's signature global Belt and Road Initiative that seeks to deepen China's relations with countries in Africa, Asia, Latin American and the Middle East through infrastructure investments. Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni had declined to renew the agreement, but nevertheless visited China in July. Italy became the first G7 country to sign on to the initiative in 2019, when the populist, anti-establishment Five Star Movement party-led government promoted it as a way of increasing trade with China while getting investments in major infrastructure projects. But neither appeared, and investments in Italian ports that were trumpeted in newspaper headlines were never achieved.	https://apnews.com/article/china-italy-trade-president-visit-19737c9fa96d08f0eba6148a0cd2f1e1	2024-11-08T04:07:47-08:00	
Indonesia's Mount Lewotobi Laki Laki continues to unleash towering column of hot clouds	MAUMERE, Indonesia (AP) — Indonesia’s Mount Lewotobi Laki Laki volcano continued to spew towering columns of hot ash high into the air on Friday following the huge eruption that killed nine people and injured dozens of others. Activity at the volcano on the remote island of Flores, in East Nusa Tenggara province, has increased since Monday’s initial eruption, forcing the authorities on Thursday to expand the danger zone. The latest activity has seen the largest column of ash so far recorded at 10 kilometers (6.2 miles) high, Hadi Wijaya, the head of the Center for Volcanology and Geological Disaster Mitigation, told a news conference. Wijaya said volcanic materials, including smoldering rocks, lava and hot, thumb-size fragments of gravel and ash, were thrown up to 8 kilometers from the crater on Friday. There were no casualties reported from the latest eruption. The volcano monitoring agency has increased Lewotobi Laki Laki’s alert status to the highest level. Wijaya said authorities on Thursday expanded the danger zone to a radius of 8 kilometers on the northwest and southwest of the mountain slope as hot clouds of ash 'are currently spreading in all directions.' 'We are still evaluating how far the (danger zone) radius should be expanded,' he said. The volcanic activity has damaged schools and thousands of houses and buildings, including convents, churches and a seminary on the majority-Catholic Island. Experts at the scene have found craters from rocks falling from the eruptions up to 13 meters (43 feet) wide and 5 meters deep. Authorities have warned the thousands of people who fled the area not to return home, as the government planned to evacuate about 16,000 residents out of the danger zone. The series of eruptions this week have already affected more than 10,000 people in 10 villages, with more than half moving into makeshift emergency shelters. A total of 2,384 houses and public facilities were damaged and collapsed after tons of volcanic materials hit the buildings and destroyed a main road connecting East Flores district where the mountain is located to neighboring Larantuka district, said Kanesius Didimus, head of a local disaster management agency. Rescue workers, police and soldiers on Friday continued to search devastated areas to ensure all residents had been moved out from the danger zone, as logistic and relief supplies were provided to nearly 6,000 displaced people in three evacuation sites. The National Disaster Management Agency has said residents of the hardest-hit villages would be relocated within six months, with each family waiting to be rehoused set to receive compensation of 500,000 rupiah ($32) per month. About 6,500 people were evacuated in January after Mount Lewotobi Laki Laki began erupting, spewing thick clouds and forcing the government to close the island’s Fransiskus Xaverius Seda Airport. No casualties or major damage were reported, but the airport has remained closed due to seismic activity. Three other airports in neighboring districts of Ende, Larantuka and Bajawa have been closed since Monday after Indonesia’s Air Navigation issued a safety warning due to volcanic ash. Lewotobi Laki Laki is one of a pair of stratovolcanoes in the East Flores district of East Nusa Tenggara province, known locally as the husband-and-wife mountains. 'Laki laki' means man, while its mate is Lewotobi Perempuan, or woman. The 1,584-meter (5,197-foot) volcano is one of the 120 active volcanoes in Indonesia, an archipelago of 280 million people. The country is prone to earthquakes, landslides and volcanic activity because it sits along the 'Ring of Fire,' a horseshoe-shaped series of seismic fault lines around the Pacific Ocean. ____ Karmini reported from Jakarta, Indonesia.	https://apnews.com/article/indonesia-mount-lewotobi-laki-laki-volcano-eruption-bdf2e898b600b2568cd1ada25c0a3c1b	2024-11-08T03:55:54-08:00	
Middle East latest: Israeli defense minister officially steps down	Israeli defense minister Yoav Gallant officially stepped down Friday in a ceremony that replaced him with Israel Katz, the former foreign minister, after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu fired Gallant earlier this week. Israel has been rocked by Gallant’s dismissal, with the news setting off mass protests across the country. Many in Israel view Gallant as the sole moderate voice in a far-right government, and see his removal as a sign that the far-right government of Benjamin Netanyahu has lost interest in returning hostages still held in Gaza. Israel Katz, his replacement, currently serves as foreign minister and is a longtime Netanyahu loyalist and veteran Cabinet minister. The United Nations humanitarian office says Israel's monthlong offensive in northern Gaza is preventing the estimated 75,000 to 95,000 Palestinians in the north from receiving essential items for their survival. On Thursday, the Israeli military says it will allow 300 truckloads of humanitarian aid supplied by the United Arab Emirates to enter the Gaza Strip in the coming days. That’s less than the 350 trucks per day that the United States said it wants to see enter the war-ravaged territory. The Israel-Hamas war began after militants stormed into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people — mostly civilians — and abducting 250 others. Israel’s military response in Gaza has killed more than 43,000 people, Palestinian health officials say. They do not distinguish between civilians and combatants, but say more than half of those killed were women and children. Hezbollah began firing into Israel on Oct. 8, 2023, in solidarity with Hamas in the Gaza Strip. Since the conflict erupted, more than 3,100 people have been killed and some 13,800 wounded in Lebanon, the health ministry reported. ___ Here’s the latest: Israeli defense minister officially steps down JERUSALEM — Israeli defense minister Yoav Gallant officially stepped down Friday in a ceremony that replaced him with Israel Katz, the former Foreign Minister, after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu dismissed Gallant earlier this week. Israel has been rocked by Gallant’s firing, with the news setting off mass protests across the country. Many in Israel view Gallant as the sole moderate voice in a far-right government, and see his dismissal as a sign that the far-right government of Benjamin Netanyahu has lost interest in returning hostages still held in Gaza by Hamas militants. Gallant thanked the military and warned that the war’s 'mission is not yet complete; we must meet our moral and traditional obligation, and the war’s objective is to bring home the remaining 101 hostages who haven’t yet seen their families and homes.' Israel Katz, his replacement, currently serves as foreign minister and is a longtime Netanyahu loyalist and veteran Cabinet minister. Katz thanked Gallant and said the war’s objectives were to 'stop Iranian aggression and deny its capabilities, continue dismantling Hamas as a governing and military force, and defeat Hezbollah.' He added that returning the hostages was a top 'moral priority.' 'Yoav, we were friends and will remain friends because we believe in the same things that will secure Israel’s security and future, the Jewish state,' he said. 'I promise that the entire State of Israel will emerge from this war and from the pain to much higher places.' Turkey's Erdogan hopes Trump will fulfil promises to end Middle East conflicts ANKARA, Turkey - Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan says he hopes US President-Elect Donald Trump will fulfil promises to end the conflict in the Middle East and tell Israel to 'stop' its aggression. Speaking to a group of journalists on a return flight from Hungary, Erdogan also said that cutting off U.S. arms support to Israel 'would be a good start' toward ending the conflict in Lebanon and the Palestinian territories. 'We want that promise to be fulfilled and for Israel to be told to ‘stop,’' Hurriyet newspaper and other media quoted Erdogan as saying on Friday. Turkey has become one of Israel’s most vocal critics, accusing the country of committing genocide in Gaza and strongly criticizing Western nations for backing Israel. ___ For more Middle East news: https://apnews.com/hub/middle-east	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-hezbollah-mideast-latest-8-november-2024-27eb23b8d7aa72ba06ca5ec8c6ba711a	2024-11-08T02:55:57-08:00	
Trump 2.0 will alter global climate fighting efforts. Will others step up?	WASHINGTON (AP) — Global efforts to fight climate change stumbled but survived the last time Donald Trump was elected president and withdrew the United States from an international climate agreement. Other countries, states, cities and businesses picked up some of the slack. But numerous experts worry that a second Trump term will be more damaging, with the United States withdrawing even further from climate efforts in a way that could cripple future presidents' efforts. With Trump, who has dismissed climate change, in charge of the world's leading economy, those experts fear other countries — especially top polluting nation China — could use it as an excuse to ease off their own efforts to curb carbon emissions. 'There's no hope of reaching a safe climate without substantive action from the United States, from China, from Europe,' said Stanford University climate scientist Rob Jackson, who chairs the Global Carbon Project, a group of scientists that tracks countries' carbon dioxide emissions, which have been rising globally. He said he's certain the world is shooting past the internationally accepted threshold of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius since pre-industrial times. That's just a couple tenths of a degree away. Others believe the goal is alive. Trump's reelection comes as the world is on track to set yet another record hot year, and has been lurching from drought to hurricane to flood to wildfire. 'An emboldened Trump would be terrible,' European Climate Foundation CEO Laurence Tubiana said in August. On Wednesday, Tubiana, the former French official who helped forge the landmark 2015 Paris Agreement that Trump pulled out of, called the election result a setback for global climate action. But she added: 'The Paris Agreement has proven resilient and is stronger than any single country’s policy.' The United Nations’ annual climate negotiations to follow on the Paris accord start next week in Baku, Azerbaijan. In the months after, all countries including the U.S. must issue national plans showing how they will increase efforts to limit heat-trapping emissions from coal, oil and natural gas. 'Baku will be the earliest test of the resilience of the global climate regime,' said Asia Society Policy Institute Director Li Shuo, who foresees the European Union and China stepping up to fill the U.S. leadership void, especially economically. 'It should also unite other countries.' It sort of did that in 2017, when Trump announced that the U.S. would abandon the Paris climate agreement. 'Not a single country followed the U.S. out the door,' said Alden Meyer, a longtime climate negotiations analyst with the European think tank E3G. 'We saw the birth and launch of the We Are Still In movement of subnational actors, investors, businesses, governors, mayors and others here in the U.S.' Meyer and others said a more serious step than withdrawing from Paris is possible. That would be pulling out of an underlying treaty from 1992 that set curbing climate change and saving biodiversity as part of global environmental goals for the 21st century, as well as withdrawing from the United Nations climate change fighting system that fosters negotiations, records emissions and what's being done about them. Project 2025, a conservative post-election blueprint that the Trump campaign distanced itself from but was written by his allies, called for withdrawing from both that U.N. framework and the Paris Agreement. In 1992, then-President George H.W. Bush signed the Rio conventions, which set up the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. That eventually led to agreements in Kyoto and Paris. The Rio agreement was unanimously approved by the U.S. Senate, but senators soundly rejected the 1997 Kyoto Protocol and President George W. Bush pulled the U.S. out of it. When negotiators were crafting the 2015 Paris deal, they made it voluntary and made it part of the Rio treaty so no Senate approval was needed. That allowed President Joe Biden in 2021 to immediately rejoin the Paris Agreement without Senate approval. It's not straightforward, but an exit from Rio and the UNFCCC could make it nearly impossible for the U.S. to get back into climate negotiations, Meyer said. David Waskow, international climate director for World Resources Institute, agreed. He said withdrawal from the U.N. agreement 'would not only place the U.S. on the sidelines of international climate discussions but would be like ejecting itself from the stadium.' The Paris agreement calls for nations to submit new and more aggressive plans to reduce emissions of heat-trapping gases every five years. Those are due next February and the Biden administration has promised to submit one before it ends 'to show what should be done, what can be done,' Meyer said. But the assumption is that the new Trump administration won't honor it, he said. Meyer said the United States pulling out of climate agreements in Republican administrations and then trying to lead the world in Democratic ones is like the Peanuts cartoon when Lucy keeps pulling the football away from Charlie Brown. 'The world has gotten tired of this routine,' Meyer said. Joanna Depledge, a historian of international climate negotiations, said she expected Trump's new term will mean four lost years for U.S. climate action. But she added: 'The rest of the world is used to U.S. flip-flopping now and will not be diverted from their own efforts.' Because of the 2020 pandemic and the timing of deadlines created by the Paris Agreement, the three United Nations climate negotiations that took place during the first Trump administration weren’t as ambitious as they could have been. Now, urgent action is needed at the summit this year and next, Depledge and others said. U.N. climate chief Simon Stiell said negotiations continue because 'the fundamental facts remain unchanged: global heating is already hammering every nation, hitting national and households budgets harder every year.' The Biden administration will still represent the United States next week, when crucial negotiations will address financial help that poor nations need to cope with and fight climate change. But Harris' loss undercuts negotiations because 'everyone there knows' the U.S. is unlikely to follow through on any agreement it signs, Stanford's Jackson said. One of the dynamics of past negotiations during Democratic regimes was that any U.S.-China deal usually led to a global one. Usually the United States 'is able to nudge' a more reluctant China to be more ambitious about fighting climate change, Asia Society's Li Shuo said. 'Beijing will read the air in Washington and their conclusion is climate does not enjoy the same level of momentum it had a couple of years ago,' Li said. But despite all this, many in the insular world of climate negotiations somehow keep optimistic. 'There is an antidote to doom and despair,' said former U.N. climate chief Christiana Figueres said. 'It's action on the ground and it's happening in all corners of the Earth.' __ Read more of AP’s climate coverage at http://www.apnews.com/climate-and-environment ___ Follow Seth Borenstein on X at @borenbears ___ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Philippine president angers China with new laws to demarcate South China Sea territories	MANILA, Philippines (AP) — Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. signed two laws on Friday reaffirming the extent of his country’s maritime territories and right to resources, including in the South China Sea, angering China, which claims the hotly disputed waterway almost in its entirety. China’s foreign ministry said it summoned the Philippines ambassador to China to lodge a 'stern protest.' The ministry condemned the move as an attempt to 'solidify the illegal ruling of the South China Sea arbitration case through domestic legislation.' Confrontations between Chinese and Philippine coast guard and naval forces in the disputed sea passage have spiked alarmingly since last year. That has sparked fears that the United States — Manila’s longtime treaty ally — may get drawn in a major conflict. The laws, called the Philippine Maritime Zones act and the Philippine Archipelagic Sea Lanes act, were signed by Marcos in a nationally televised ceremony attended by top military and national security officials. They further cement Manila’s rejection of China’s claims to virtually the entire sea passage, and stipulate jail terms and stiff fines for violators. 'These signal our resolve to protect our maritime resources, preserve our rich biodiversity and ensure that our waters remain a source of life and livelihood for all Filipinos,' Marcos said. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said the move 'seriously infringes on China’s territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests in the South China Sea.' 'China strongly condemns and firmly opposes it,' she said. In a new national map it released last year the Chinese government demarcated its claim to virtually the entire South China Sea with vague dash lines that drew protests and rejections from rival coastal states and government, including Malaysia, Vietnam, Taiwan, Indonesia and the Philippines. The maritime zones act demarcates key parts of the Philippine archipelago’s territory and outlying waters where it has full sovereignty and sovereign rights under international law and the 1982 U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea, Philippine officials said. Those zones include the country's Exclusive Economic Zone, a 200-nautical-mile (370-kilometer) stretch of water, where a coastal state like the Philippines has exclusive rights to tap energy and other resources. Foreign ships and aircraft have an internationally recognized right known as 'innocent passage' to pass through such a zone, as long as the coastal state’s security would not come under threat. The archipelagic sea lanes act allows the Philippines to designate sea lanes and air routes in the archipelago where foreign ships and aircraft could transit under its regulation and in compliance with international law. 'These legal instruments solidify our territory and enhances our ability to protect our country against any infringement,' National Security Adviser Eduardo Ano said. Marcos said the laws comply with international law and the UNCLOS, but many of their provisions stand in stark contrast to Beijing’s claims in the South China Sea and would likely be rejected and defied by China. It’s unclear how the Philippines could enforce the laws, which take effect 15 days after their publication in the government’s official gazette or in a newspaper, given China's increasingly aggressive actions to push its claims. Copies of the laws signed by Marcos were not immediately available but a final version of the maritime zones bill stated that 'all artificial islands constructed within the Philippine EEZ belong to the Philippine government.' China has transformed seven disputed reefs into what are now missile-protected island bases, including the Mischief Reef, which lies within the Philippines’ Exclusive Economic Zone. The law based the Philippines’ maritime rights on UNCLOS, Philippine laws and a 2016 international arbitration ruling that invalidated China’s extensive territorial claims based on historical grounds. China refused to participate in that arbitration, rejected the ruling and continues to defy it. Its massive coast guard, navy, air force and suspected militia fleets have used water cannons, military grade lasers and dangerous sea and air maneuvers to intimidate rival forces it accuses of straying into what Beijing calls its territory. Washington has repeatedly warned that it's obligated to defend the Philippines, its oldest treaty ally in Asia, if Filipino forces, aircraft or ships come under an armed attack in the disputed waters.	https://apnews.com/article/philippine-maritime-zones-act-archipelagic-sea-lanes-act-south-china-sea-4ecec3f00ab9367d948e5af3959aea21	2024-11-08T00:54:31-08:00	
As EU leaders meet, Hungary's Orbán predicts Trump's administration will end support for Ukraine	BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) — A new U.S. administration under Donald Trump will cease providing support to Ukraine in its fight against Russia's full-scale invasion, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán said ahead of a European Union summit on Friday, signaling that Trump's recent election could drive a wedge among EU leaders on the question of the war. Orbán is hosting the second of two days of summits Friday in the Hungarian capital, Budapest, on the heels of Trump's election victory. The war in Ukraine will be high on the agenda for a gathering of the EU's 27 leaders, most of whom believe continuing to supply Ukraine with weapons and financial assistance are key elements for the continent's security. The nationalist Hungarian leader has long sought to undermine EU support for Kyiv, and routinely blocked, delayed or watered down the bloc’s efforts to provide weapons and funding and to sanction Moscow for its invasion. He has sought to use the summits to make his case to other leaders that they should rethink their commitments to Ukraine. In comments to state radio ahead of Friday's summit, Orbán, who is close to both Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, reiterated his long-held position that an immediate cease-fire should be declared, and suggested that Ukraine has already lost its fight. 'If Donald Trump had won in 2020 in the United States, these two nightmarish years wouldn’t have happened. There wouldn’t have been a war,' Orbán said. 'The situation on the front is obvious, there’s been a military defeat. The Americans are going to pull out of this war.' Russian forces have recently made modest gains in the east of Ukraine, although positions on the front lines have remained relatively stable for months. Still, as the duration of the war approaches 1,000 days, Ukraine’s forces are struggling to match Russia’s military, which is much bigger and better equipped. Western support is crucial for Ukraine to sustain the costly war of attrition, and uncertainty over how long that aid will continue deepened this week with Trump's presidential election victory. The Republican has repeatedly taken issue with U.S. aid to Ukraine and declared he would bring a quick end to the conflict without detailing how. At a gathering on Thursday of European leaders in Budapest, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy objected to Trump's claim that Russia’s war with Ukraine could be ended in a day, something he and his European backers fear would mean peace on terms favorable to Putin and involving the surrender of territory. 'If it is going to be very fast, it will be a loss for Ukraine,' Zelenskyy said. EU leaders have largely found workaround solutions to any obstruction to providing Zelenskyy with assistance, and have been able to signal their commitment to supporting Ukraine in its fight, regardless of who occupies the White House. Arriving at Friday's summit, Italy's hard-right Premier Giorgia Meloni, who is aligned with Orbán on many issues but breaks with him sharply on Russia's war, said: 'As long is there is a war, Italy is on the side of Ukraine.' European Council President Charles Michel said the EU must strengthen and support the war-ravaged country, 'because if we do not support Ukraine, this is the wrong signal that we send to Putin, but also to some other authoritarian regimes across the world.' But Orbán has cast himself as the exemplar of some in the EU who are skeptical of providing indefinite support to Ukraine, especially in light of uncertainty over whether U.S. assistance could evaporate under Trump. 'This is a new situation,' he said of Trump's reelection. 'If this is what's going on across the pond, then this is going to affect us Europeans too. Europe cannot finance this war alone.'	https://apnews.com/article/orban-predicts-trump-end-us-support-ukraine-b9ccaa5241410550763a29eaf38b3d20	2024-11-08T00:50:50-08:00	
Greece and Turkey press ahead with talks in effort to smooth often volatile relations	ATHENS, Greece (AP) — Recent efforts to smooth the frequently volatile ties between neighbors and regional rivals Greece and Turkey are bearing fruit, their foreign ministers said Friday, although significant differences remain between the two countries as they seek ways to prevent spats from escalating dangerously. Despite both being members of NATO, Greece and Turkey have been at loggerheads for decades over a long series of issues, including complex maritime boundary disputes that led them to the brink of war in 1987 and in 1996. In 2020, tension over drilling rights led to Greek and Turkish warships shadowing each other in the eastern Mediterranean. Over the past 16 months, the two sides have made concerted efforts to reduce tensions, with the Greek and Turkish leaders meeting six times. Last December, the two countries signed more than a dozen cooperation deals during a meeting in Athens between Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis. 'I am not claiming that through the dialogue we have developed, all the problems in the two countries' relations have been magically resolved,' Greek Foreign Minister George Gerapetritis said in statements to the media after a meeting with his Turkish counterpart, Hakan Fidan, in Athens. The ministers didn't take any questions. 'There were indeed difficult moments during the past year,' Gerapetritis said. 'But in all cases, there was an immediate and honest channel that prevented escalation.' With two brutal conflicts raging in the wider region, in Ukraine and in the Middle East, mending ties and preventing flare-ups in tension between the two neighbors has become all the more essential. 'We are working to understand each other better on critical issues. The region we are in has many problems,' Fidan said. 'Turkey and Greece need to be able to act with mutual trust in this difficult geography. Through a win-win approach, we can contribute to the prosperity and peace of our people.' Despite the positive climate, the two sides remain far apart on some of the thornier issues, notably on territorial rights in the Aegean Sea. The two disagree on the delineation of the continental shelf and exclusive economic zone, which determines exploitation rights for resources, as well as on the extent of territorial waters. Turkey has said that any move by Greece to extend its territorial waters around its islands in the Aegean Sea from six nautical miles to 12 nautical miles, which Greece insists it has the right to do at any time, would be a cause for war. Turkey also doesn’t recognize that Greek islands off its borders have a continental shelf, while Greece insists that position is in contravention of international law. Athens insists the issue of the continental shelf and exclusive economic zone is the only dispute it has with Turkey and is willing to bring it to the International Court of Justice in The Hague. Friday’s talks 'included the evaluation of the conditions for the start of a fundamental discussion for the delineation of the continental shelf and the Exclusive Economic Zone in the Aegean and the eastern Mediterranean,' Gerapetritis said. 'It is an initial, honest approach of a difficult but also crucial issue.' Fidan stressed that all areas of disagreement connected to the Aegean, the sea that lies between the two countries, must be tackled. 'There are many problems that are interconnected in the Aegean. These disputes cannot be reduced to the issues of the continent shelf and exclusive economic zones,' Fidan said. 'We must address all issues that have the potential to create tensions and crises on the basis of mutual respect and cooperation.' 'As Turkey, we continue to defend the principle of equitable sharing in the eastern Mediterranean,' he added. Migration has been a source of tension between the two countries for years. Tens of thousands of people make their way each year from Turkey to nearby Greek islands, using European Union-member Greece as a gateway to more prosperous countries in the 27-nation bloc. While thousands of migrants continue to arrive in Greece, risking sometimes fatal sea crossings, the two ministers stressed the need to crack down on illegal migration and smuggling networks. The two 'emphasized the importance of acting together to combat irregular migration,' Fidan said. ___ Suzan Fraser in Ankara, Turkey, and Derek Gatopoulos in Athens, contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/greece-turkey-foreign-minister-meetings-fbaffa28b733d2896aa178f803ac4103	2024-11-08T00:22:24-08:00	
European countries are spending more on defense, a think tank says	PRAGUE (AP) — European nations boosted their defenses in response to the annexation of the Crimea Peninsula in 2014 and Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, a London-based think tank said Friday, but much remains to be done for them to be ready to face threats from Russia. That’s the conclusion of a report released by the International Institute for Strategic Studies released as it opened a three-day gathering in the Czech capital to discuss European and transatlantic military capabilities. 'NATO has not just significantly increased its ambitions regarding its deterrence and war-fighting posture, but European members have sought to address critical capability and readiness shortfalls,' the report said. 'Unsurprisingly, however, after decades of neglect and underinvestment, much remains to be done and progress has been mixed.' It was released as European leaders, including NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte, were reassessing their trans-Atlantic relations in Budapest, Hungary in the hope that Donald Trump’s second U.S. presidency will avoid the strife of his first administration and maintain a strong common stance on Russia. During his election campaign, Trump threatened actions that could have groundbreaking consequences for nations across Europe, from a trade war with the EU to a withdrawal of NATO commitments and a fundamental shift of support for Ukraine in its war with Russia. During his first 2017-2021 term, Trump pushed NATO's European members to spend more on defense, up to and beyond 2% of gross domestic product, and to be less reliant on U.S. military cover. In that respect, some progress has been made, with 2024 defense spending by NATO’s European members states 50% higher than it was 10 years ago, the report said. But problems remain, the IISS said, naming a lack of stability in public financing that 'ultimately limits (the defense) industry’s ability to invest with confidence.' Moreover, 'regulatory hurdles and application of environmental, social and governance standards will continue to act as barriers to investment,' it said. Europe’s defense industry managed to increase output of some products after 2022, especially those with high demand from Ukraine, such as air defense and artillery. But European countries also donated their own weapons to Ukraine, including F-16 fighter jets, and 'remain dependent on the U.S. for some important aspects of their military capability,' looking also to Brazil, Israel and South Korea to meet their needs due to a lack of their production capacity. Competition with civilian industries for raw materials and skilled professionals makes things harder for the defense industry, the report said. It also warned that many European armies don’t have enough military personnel. A lesson learned from Russia’s war against Ukraine is 'that countries need significant troops to engage with and defeat enemy attack, but also enough forces to regenerate after combat attrition.' By that standard, 'key European armed forces remain under-strength.' Europeans have a long way to go to renovate their defense capabilities, the report said.

Ship suspected of carrying toxic waste docks in Albania, where its contents will be checked	TIRANA, Albania (AP) — A ship suspected of carrying a large amount of hazardous waste docked Friday at Albania’s main port, where prosecutors have ordered that its contents be tested. The Turkish-flagged Moliva XA443A was kept at an anchorage about 1.5 kilometers (a mile) from the port of Durres, 33 kilometers (20 miles) west of the capital, until authorities found a spot out of the port to store the containers, port and prosecutor's office officials said. The containers are expected to be sent to an agency in Porto Romano, 6 kilometers (4 miles) away. Ten days ago, prosecutors ordered the containers to be seized and stored 'at an environmentally and physically safe place' for monitoring. The prosecutor's office has asked different institutions to conduct lab tests of the material in the containers. Media coverage showed that the containers being unloaded from the ship and headed to the quarantine area. 'The case is under investigation from the Durres prosecutor's office and the Ministry of Tourism and Environment is cooperating for anything that the justice institution asks for,' ministry spokesperson Erjon Uka told The Associated Press. The Seattle-based non-government organization Basel Action Network, or BAN, which focuses on environmental issues, flagged the ship to authorities in August after receiving information from a whistleblower that the containers on board are suspected to be carrying an estimated 2,100 tons of toxic dust from pollution control filters from the steel industry. BAN said the containers left Durres on July 4 on two Maersk-chartered ships with the intended destination of Thailand. The group said it alerted several transit countries and collaborated with EARTH, a Thai environmental organization, and together raised the alarm about the shipment. Thailand refused to accept the shipment, asking authorities in Singapore to stop it. The ships then docked at a Turkish port and the containers were loaded on the Turkish-flagged ship, which briefly stopped at the Italian port of Gioia Tauro before going to Albania, BAN said. The customs documentation stated the containers contained iron oxide, according to local reports. Albania's opposition accused the government in August of taking part in illegally trafficking hazardous material. Prime Minister Edi Rama said in Parliament in September that the shipment’s documents were verified and that iron oxide is 'not considered as toxic waste in the European catalogs on which the environmental and customs procedure of our country is based.' BAN has called on authorities to have a public opening and sampling of the containers to ensure transparency. It is suspected the containers have toxic steel furnace dust collected from pollution control filters at an Albanian company and also illegally smuggled from Kosovo and Germany. Ban said that while Albania is looking to join the European Union and the government has been eager to align its hazardous waste policy with that of the 27-nation bloc, it should ban 'the export of hazardous wastes, household wastes, electronic wastes and plastic wastes to developing countries.' ___ Follow Llazar Semini at https://x.com/lsemini	https://apnews.com/article/albania-toxic-waste-ship-environment-73c1e21858443c6da9f6490f426184f2	2024-11-07T23:01:44-08:00	
Italy sends another 8 migrants to Albania, despite failing to process the first group	SHENGJIN, Albania (AP) — An Italian navy ship docked Friday at the Albanian port of Shengjin with eight migrants who will be processed there after they were intercepted in international waters, a month after another group was turned away for failing the vetting process. It is only the second transfer of migrants since two migrant processing centers started operating in October. The same ship transferred to Albania the first 16 migrants from Bangladesh and Egypt. Four were taken to Italy the same day because they were minors or had health issues. Twelve others were brought back to Italy three days later, following a ruling by Rome judges who rejected their detention because their countries of origin — Bangladesh and Egypt — were not safe enough for them to be sent back. The naval ship Libra, which can carry 200 people besides crew, left Italy’s southernmost island of Lampedusa on Wednesday with eight men on board, according to the Italian media. Italian Interior Ministry spokesperson Francesco Kamel had confirmed the Libra was heading to Albania, but declined to give out any further information until the operation was complete. He didn't say when it would arrive, nor how many people were on board. The Italian media reported that, out of 1,200 migrant arrivals on Lampedusa over the past two days, just eight male adults traveling without families met Albania's screening criteria, including that they come from countries deemed 'safe' for repatriation. The number of people reaching Italy along the central Mediterranean migration route — mainly from Bangladesh, Syria, Tunisia and Egypt — has fallen by 60% in 2024 compared to 2023. As of Nov. 7, according to the Italian Interior Ministry, 57,767 migrants have arrived by sea in 2024. A court ruling out of Rome had shortened the list of countries considered 'safe' by law, meaning that Rome can repatriate migrants from those countries who didn’t win asylum using a fast-track procedure. Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni slammed the Rome court ruling, and said that deeming countries such as Bangladesh and Egypt unsafe means that virtually all migrants would be barred from the Albania program, making it unworkable. On Oct. 21, Italy’s far-right government approved a new decree aimed at overcoming those judicial hurdles that risked derailing a controversial five-year migration deal with Albania, signed in 2023 by Meloni and her Albanian counterpart, Edi Rama. Under the deal, up to 3,000 migrants intercepted by the Italian coast guard in international waters each month will be sheltered in Albania, and vetted for possible asylum in Italy or be sent back to their countries. Italy has agreed to welcome those migrants who are granted asylum, while those whose applications are rejected face deportation directly from Albania. The agreement to outsource the housing of asylum-seekers to a non-European Union member country, defended by Meloni as a new model to handle illegal migration, has been hailed by some countries that, like Italy, are experiencing a high level of migrant arrivals. Visiting Albania in October, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen refused to give her opinion of the agreement, saying only that it was being closely monitored. Human rights groups and non-governmental organizations that are active in the Mediterranean have slammed the agreement as a dangerous precedent that conflicts with international laws. ___ Semini reported from Tirana; Colleen Barry contributed from Milan. ___ Follow Llazar Semini at: https://x.com/lsemini Follow AP’s global migration coverage at: https://apnews.com/hub/migration	https://apnews.com/article/albania-italy-migrant-processing-de9379f062f00b96aac6837ea3283bfe	2024-11-07T22:29:31-08:00	
2 suspected rebels and 2 members of government-run militia are killed in Indian-controlled Kashmir	NEW DELHI (AP) — Two suspected militants were killed in a gunfight with government forces in Indian-controlled Kashmir, officials said Friday, while assailants killed two members of a government-sponsored militia elsewhere in the disputed region. The region, divided between India and Pakistan but claimed by both in its entirety, has experienced an increase in violence in recent months. The Indian military said a joint team of soldiers and police raided a village near northwestern Sopore town late Thursday following a tip about the presence of a group of militants. The militants 'fired indiscriminately' at the troops, leading to a gunbattle in which two were killed, the military said in a statement. Troops were continuing to search the area, it said. There was no independent confirmation of the incident. Meanwhile, assailants killed two members of a government-run militia called the 'Village Defense Group' in the remote southern Kishtwar area late Thursday, officials said. Police blamed rebels fighting against Indian rule in Kashmir for the killings. The two, one of them a Hindu and another Muslim, were abducted from a forested area where they had gone to graze cattle on Thursday. On Friday, hundreds of people at several places in Kishtwar and Jammu district took to the streets in protest at the killings, demanding the authorities arrest the culprits. Kishtwar also observed a shutdown on the instruction of a Hindu group, the Sanatan Dharam Sabha. The Village Defense Group was initially formed in the 1990s to protect remote Himalayan villages against anti-India insurgents when government forces could not reach them quickly. As the insurgency waned in their areas and as some militia members gained notoriety for brutality and rights violations, the militia was largely disbanded. However last year, after the killing of seven Hindus in two attacks in a remote mountainous village near the highly militarized Line of Control that divides Kashmir between India and Pakistan, authorities revived the militia and began rearming and training thousands of villagers, including some teenagers. The Kashmir Tigers, which Indian officials say is an offshoot of the Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammad militant group, claimed responsibility for the killings of the two in a statement on social media. The insurgent group also released photos of the two bloodied bodies. The statement could not be independently verified. Chief Minister Omar Abdullah condemned the attack. 'I expect the security forces to move quickly to plug any gaps in our counter-terror grid &amp; ensure that attacks like this stop completely,' he wrote on social medial platform X. Militants in the Indian-controlled portion of Kashmir have been fighting New Delhi’s rule since 1989. Many Muslim Kashmiris support the rebels’ goal of uniting the territory, either under Pakistani rule or as an independent country. India insists the Kashmir militancy is Pakistan-sponsored terrorism. Pakistan denies the charge, and many Kashmiris consider it a legitimate freedom struggle. Tens of thousands of civilians, rebels and government forces have been killed in the conflict.	https://apnews.com/article/kashmir-india-pakistan-fighting-killings-rebels-0347955ec25638af367b0fcd4bea0d6a	2024-11-07T22:19:20-08:00	
AP PHOTOS: Tens of thousands of Hindu devotees flock to rivers for prayers to the sun god	NEW DELHI (AP) — Tens of thousands of Hindu devotees flocked to rivers and bodies of water across India to pray to the sun god as part of the Chhath festival this week. In Noida, on the outskirts of the capital New Delhi, families gathered at the Yamuna river, which is covered with white toxic foam as a result of pollutants discharged from nearby industries. Women in brightly colored saris waded into the knee-deep water flecked with blobs of white foam. Some carried a coconut or other fruits as an offering to thank Lord Surya, the god of the sun, for sustaining life on earth as they sought divine blessings. The Yamuna is considered one of India’s most sacred rivers, and Hindu devotees have continued to use it despite warnings about the toxic foam. A court in Delhi on Wednesday forbade worshipers from performing rituals on the bank of the heavily polluted river over health and safety concerns, local media reported, yet thousands gathered on Thursday and Friday at the river banks to immerse themselves in the river and drinks it water. From the financial capital Mumbai to Hyderabad in the south and Guwahati in the east, thousands of men, women and children did the same. The Chhath festival, celebrated after the Hindu festival of Diwali, originated in the country's eastern states, with large celebrations in Bihar and Jharkand, and extends to Nepal. Over the years, it has grown more popular across India, often introduced as migrants from eastern states mark the festival away from home. The rituals, which stretch over four days, include a holy dip in the river and a period of fasting and abstaining from drinking water. On the last two days, devotees stand in the waters to pray to the sun as it rises and sets, with some families camping out overnight along the banks.	https://apnews.com/article/india-hindu-chhath-sun-festival-yamuna-river-21c03117b6906667a4a7d2654dd429d1	2024-11-07T21:45:18-08:00	
The Berlin Wall: A divide that once shaped German women's lives still echoes today	BERLIN (AP) — Like many other young women living in communist East Germany, Solveig Leo thought nothing about juggling work and motherhood. The mother of two was able to preside over a large state-owned farm in the northeastern village of Banzkow because childcare was widely available. Contrast that with Claudia Huth, a mother of five, who grew up in capitalist West Germany. Huth quit her job as a bank clerk when she was pregnant with her first child and led a life as a traditional housewife in the village of Egelsbach in Hesse, raising the kids and tending to her husband, who worked as a chemist. Both Leo and Huth fulfilled roles that in many ways were typical for women in the vastly different political systems that governed Germany during its decades of division following the country’s defeat in World War II in 1945. As Germany celebrates the 35th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall on Nov. 9, 1989 — and the country’s reunification less than a year later on Oct. 3, 1990 — many in Germany are reflecting on how women’s lives that have diverged so starkly under communism and capitalism have become much more similar again — though some differences remain even today. 'In West Germany, women — not all, but many — had to fight for their right to have a career,' said Clara Marz, the curator of an exhibition about women in divided Germany for the Federal Foundation for the Study of the Communist Dictatorship in Germany. Women in East Germany, meanwhile, often had jobs — though that was something that 'they had been ordered from above to do,' she added. Built in 1961, the Wall stood for 28 years at the front line of the Cold War between the Americans and the Soviets. It was built by the communist regime to cut off East Germans from the supposed ideological contamination of the West and to stem the tide of people fleeing East Germany. Today only a few stretches of the 156.4-kilometer (97.2-mile) barrier around the capitalist exclave of West Berlin remain, mostly as a tourist attraction. 'All the heavy industry was in the west, there was nothing here,' Leo, who is now 81 years old, said during a recent interview looking back at her life as a woman under communism. 'East Germany had to pay war reparations to the Soviet Union. Women needed to work our own way out of that misery.' By contrast, Leo said, women in the West didn't need to work because they were 'spoiled by the Marshall Plan' — the United States’ generous reconstruction plan that poured billions of dollars into West Germany and other European countries after the war. In capitalist West Germany, the economy recovered so quickly after the total devastation of WWII that people soon started talking of a Wirtschaftswunder, or 'economic miracle,' that brought them affluence and stability less than 10 years after the war. That economic success, however, indirectly hampered women’s quest for equal rights. Most West German women stayed at home and were expected to take care of their household while their husbands worked. Religion, too, played a much bigger role than in atheist East Germany, confining women to traditional roles as caregivers of the family. Mothers who tried to break out of these conventions and took on jobs were infamously decried as Rabenmütter, or uncaring moms who put work over family. Not all West German women perceived their traditional roles as restrictive. 'I always had this idea to be with my children, because I loved being with them,' said Huth, now 69. 'It never really occurred to me to go to work.' More than three decades after Germany’s unification, a new generation of women is barely aware of the different lives their mothers and grandmothers led depending on which part of the country they lived in. For most, combining work and motherhood has also become the normal way of life. Hannah Fiedler, an 18-year-old high school graduate from Berlin, said the fact that her family lived in East Germany during the decades of the country's division has no impact on her life today. 'East or West — it's not even a topic in our family anymore,' she said, as she sat on a bench near a thin, cobble-stoned path in the capital's Mitte neighborhood, which marks the former course of the Berlin Wall in the then-divided city. She also said that growing up, she had not experienced any disadvantages because she's female. 'I'm white and privileged — for good or worse — I don't expect any problems when I enter the working world in the future,' she said. Some small differences between the formerly divided parts of Germany linger on. In the former East, 74% of women are working, compared to 71.5% in the West, according to a 2023 study by the Hans-Böckler-Stiftung foundation. Childcare is also still more available in the former East than in the West. In 2018, 57% of children under the age of 3 were looked after in a childcare facility in the eastern state of Saxony. That compares with 27% in the western state of North Rhine-Westphalia and 44% in Hamburg and Bremen, according to Germany's Federal Statistical Office. Germany as a whole trails behind some other European countries when it comes to gender equality. Only 31.4% lawmakers in Germany's national parliament are female, compared to 41% in Belgium's parliament, 43.6% in Denmark, 45% in Norway and 45.6% in Sweden. Nonetheless, Leo, the 81-year-old farmer from former East Germany, is optimistic that eventually women all over the country will have the same opportunities. 'I can’t imagine that there are any women who don’t like to be independent,' she said. ___ Jan M.

AP Photos: 35 years after the Berlin Wall opened, fragments of East Germany's border remain	BERLIN (AP) — Most of communist East Germany's heavily fortified border was torn down quickly after it was opened in 1989, but there are still places where visitors can see the remains of the Berlin Wall and other sections of the frontier. East Germany closed the border in Berlin on Aug. 13, 1961, and expanded the Wall into an increasingly elaborate fortification snaking through the city and around the capitalist enclave of West Berlin. The Wall plugged the last gap in the border between east and west. East Germany's leadership had already sealed off the country's main frontier with West Germany, snaking from the Baltic Sea to Czechoslovakia, in 1952. It stayed that way until the border was opened on Nov. 9, 1989. The Bornholmer Strasse crossing in Berlin was the first to open that night. Border guards, who hadn't received orders to let anyone pass, gave way under pressure from a large crowd demanding to be let through after an off-handed announcement of new regulations by Politburo spokesperson Günter Schabowski. Today, a section of Wall slabs with photos of those events and a series of plaques marking the night's main developments — including an alert sent by The Associated Press’ German service — stands at the former crossing. The longest section of Wall remaining in Berlin is the East Side Gallery, where the once-gray concrete slabs are covered with murals that were painted by 118 artists after the opening of the border. Otherwise, the Wall has largely disappeared now and much of the former 'death strip' — between the exterior wall that faced West Berlin and an interior wall that faced east — has been built over. Among the exceptions is a strip of the former border at the Bernauer Strasse memorial site in downtown Berlin, and there are fragments dotted around elsewhere in the city and on its edges. In most cases, the main East-West German border outside Berlin consisted of heavily fortified fences rather than walls. There were a few exceptions, however: most famously in the village of Moedlareuth, divided between Bavaria and the eastern region of Thuringia, which earned the nickname 'Little Berlin.' Part of Moedlareuth's border can still be seen today. Germany was reunified on Oct. 3, 1990, less than a year after the border opened.	https://apnews.com/article/germany-berlin-wall-35th-anniversary-photos-638cb701a1405edd8bea7cd3059d2a0e	2024-11-07T20:12:47-08:00	
In an Israeli settlement named after Trump, residents see opportunity after the election	RAMAT TRUMP, Golan Heights (AP) — Israeli residents of 'Trump Heights' are welcoming the election of their namesake, hoping Donald Trump's return to the U.S. presidency will breathe new life into this tiny, remote settlement in the central Golan Heights. During his first term, Trump became the first and only foreign leader to recognize Israel’s control of the Golan, which it seized from Syria in the 1967 Mideast war. Israel thanked him by rebranding this outpost after him. But a large-scale influx of new residents never materialized after that 2019 ceremony, and just a couple dozen families live in Trump Heights, or 'Ramat Trump' in Hebrew. Job opportunities are limited, and Israel’s more than yearlong war against Hezbollah militants in nearby Lebanon has added to the sense of isolation. Trump’s election has inspired hope in the community that it will attract more members and also more funding for security improvements. 'Maybe it can raise more awareness and maybe some support to help here and help our kids here,' said Yarden Freimann, Trump Heights’ community manager. Ori Kallner, head of the Golan’s regional council, showed off dozens of plots of land, replete with new asphalt roads, lampposts and utility lines, that residents have prepared for future housing developments. 'President Trump’s return to the White House definitely puts the town in the headlines,' he said. Hanging on while war rages nearby Kallner stood next to a metal statue of an eagle and a menorah, symbolizing the United States and Israel, as Israeli warplanes flew overhead. Two explosions from rockets fired from Lebanon punched the hills nearby, and just across the border in Lebanon, plumes of smoke rose into the air from Israeli airstrikes. An enormous sign with the settlement’s name in Hebrew and English gleamed in the sun, while two large sunbaked metal flags of Israel and the United States were faded almost beyond recognition. Surrounded by ashen ruins of villages fled by Syrians in the 1967 war, the town is perched above the Hula Valley, where Israel has amassed tanks, artillery and troops for its fight in Lebanon. Most towns in the valley have been evacuated. Trump Heights sends its kids to a makeshift daycare in a nearby settlement after the government shuttered all schools in the region in the wake of the Oct. 1 invasion of Lebanon. 'We find ourselves hanging by our fingernails to be in our own community, not be evacuated, and on the other hand, we cannot work, we cannot send our kids to any kind of an education system,' said Freimann. Trump Heights is only about 7 miles (12 kilometers) from Lebanon and Syria. Alerts for incoming fire gives residents about 30 seconds' head start to get to a bomb shelter. Trump broke with other leaders on the Golan Heights Israel annexed the Golan, a strategic plateau overlooking northern Israel, in 1981 in a move that is not internationally recognized. That changed in March 2019 when Trump, without notice, tweeted that the U.S. would 'fully recognize' Israel’s control of the territory. His announcement drew widespread condemnation from the international community, which considers the Golan to be occupied Syrian territory and Israel’s settlements to be illegal. The Biden administration left the decision intact, but the U.S. remains the lone country to recognize the Israeli annexation. Kallner said he hopes Trump will now persuade European countries to recognize Israeli sovereignty there. According to Israeli figures, the Golan is home to about 50,000 people — roughly half of them Jewish Israelis and the other half Arab Druze, many of whom still consider themselves Syrians under occupation. Israel has encouraged and promoted settlements in the Golan, and the Druze residents operate farms and a tourism and restaurant sector popular with Israelis. But the area has struggled to develop because of its remoteness, several hours from Israel’s economic center in Tel Aviv. That economic hardship has only worsened during the war as the hospitality sector cratered. On July 28, a rocket killed 12 Druze children on a soccer field in the city of Majdal Shams, about 12 miles (20 kilometers) away. Israel invaded Lebanon months later. In June 2019, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu led an inauguration ceremony for Trump Heights. The U.S. ambassador at the time, David Friedman, noted that the ceremony came days after Trump’s birthday and said: 'I can’t think of a more appropriate and a more beautiful birthday present.' As president, Trump was close with Netanyahu The Golan recognition was among a series of diplomatic gifts that Trump delivered to Israel during his first term. They included recognizing Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and moving the American embassy to the contested city, and a series of diplomatic agreements with Arab countries known as the Abraham Accords. He has vowed to bring peace to the tumultuous region during his second term, but has not said how. Netanyahu enjoyed a close relationship with Trump during his first term but ran afoul of the former president when he congratulated Joe Biden on his 2020 victory. The Israeli prime minister announced Tuesday that he was one of the first foreign leaders to call the president-elect and congratulate him on his victory. An official in his office, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss internal communications, said aides were upbeat and giddy. 'Congratulations on history’s greatest comeback!' the Israeli leader said in a statement. 'Your historic return to the White House offers a new beginning for America and a powerful recommitment to the great alliance between Israel and America.' At Trump Heights, Kallner was optimistic too: 'The Golan community is strong and resilient, and people that want to come and live here are from the same material. I believe we will overcome these challenging times and won’t stop growing.'	https://apnews.com/article/trump-heights-golan-settlement-israel-syria-lebanon-e0ca8d2720524d92f423fbe212354909	2024-11-07T20:04:54-08:00	
Trump victory spurs worry among migrants abroad, but it's not expected to halt migration	MEXICO CITY (AP) — Donald Trump's victory in the U.S. presidential election instantly changed calculations for millions of migrants or potential migrants across the globe. But perhaps not in the way Trump imagined. Trump has pledged to reduce immigration. But by narrowing the already limited legal pathways into the U.S., migrants will just recalibrate their plans and resort in greater numbers to hiring smugglers, experts say. In many cases that will mean turning to organized crime groups that increasingly profit from migrant smuggling. Those potentially affected come from dozens of countries and many have already sold their homes and their possessions to fund the trip. Venezuelans continue arriving at the U.S. southern border in reduced, but still large numbers. Mexicans made up half of U.S. Border Patrol arrests in September. Chinese come through Ecuador and make their way up through the Americas. Senegalese buy multi-stop flights to Nicaragua, then move north. The U.N.’s International Organization for Migration estimates there are around 281 million international migrants in the world, or 3.6% of the global population. An increasing number of people will be displaced for political, economic and violence reasons, and more migrants will seek asylum, according to its annual report. It warns that when people cannot find regular pathways, they start looking for 'irregular channels that are extremely hazardous.' During Trump's first administration, Mexican border cities were saturated with migrants. Cartels preyed on them, kidnapping them, extorting their families for ransoms and forcibly recruiting them into their ranks. There were hundreds of arrivals every day, as well as thousands who were made to wait out the potentially yearslong U.S. asylum application process in Mexico. A U.S. program called CBP One brought some order after it was introduced by the Biden administration in early 2023. Migrants no longer have to come to the border to schedule an appointment and can do it on their smartphones. Once overflowing border shelters have emptied and many families are making every effort to go the legal route. Trump has pledged to end CBP One. He also wants to again restrict refugee resettlement and warned throughout his campaign of mass deportations. While his victory was deflating and worrisome to those en route to the United States, it was not a deal-breaker. On Tuesday night, Bárbara Rodríguez, a 33-year-old Venezuelan, should have been sleeping after walking more than eight miles through southern Mexico's tropical heat with some 2,500 others from at least a dozen countries. Instead, she was watching U.S. election results on her cellphone. Back in Caracas, Rodríguez helped monitor a polling place for the opposition during Venezuela's July election. After President Nicolas Maduro claimed reelection, his supporters began to harass her family. 'Either my family’s lives were going to be at risk or I had to leave the country,' she said. In September, she sold her house and left her three children with her mother. Now her plan of waiting for a CBP One appointment to request asylum at the U.S. border has an expiration date. 'Plans changed. We have until Jan. 20,' she said, referring to inauguration day. She has not ruled out hiring a smuggler, she added. Martha Bárcena, Mexico’s former U.S. ambassador during most of Trump’s first administration, said migrants were the losers from his immigration policies and that could happen again. 'Organized crime is the big beneficiary, because the income from illegal human trafficking is already equal to or greater than the income from drugs,' she said. Estefanía Ramos of Guatemala woke up worried Wednesday in a Ciudad Juarez shelter across from El Paso, Texas. 'We’re trying to figure out what’s going to happen to us,' the 19-year-old said. 'This wasn’t the plan.' She and her husband left Guatemala after a gang threatened to harm him and kidnap her, she said. They have been waiting for three months for a CBP One appointment. Two months ago they had a baby girl. 'If we can keep waiting for an appointment we will,' Ramos said, adding that she doesn’t want to risk an illegal crossing with the baby. On Wednesday in Ciudad Juarez, a few dozen asylum seekers with appointments waited patiently to be called across the international bridge. Gretchen Kuhner, director of IMUMI, a nongovernmental legal services organization in Mexico, was in the southern Mexican city of Tuxtla Gutierrez last week, where she found migrant families with young children living in the streets waiting for CBP One appointments. 'They are getting their cellphones charged every day at some makeshift place on the street so they can check their CBP One appointments ... while they’re breastfeeding and sleeping in a tent without any water,' she said. 'People who need protection are really trying to do it the right way.' Further restrictions on the already difficult process would leave vulnerable populations with few options, said Mark Hetfield, CEO of the U.S.-based refugee support organization HIAS. 'It would mean they have no place to go because there are many, many countries in the hemisphere where there is effectively no asylum system or where even if you could get asylum, you’re not necessarily safe,' he said. And then there's the specter of massive deportations. Trump made a similar threat before and didn't deliver, but there's real concern. Deportations to countries like Cuba and Venezuela could be complicated by icy relations, though Venezuela’s Maduro issued a conciliatory message congratulating Trump Wednesday. Advocates in Haiti on Thursday demanded countries, including the U.S., halt deportations because of the country's domestic crisis. And no country stands to be more impacted than Mexico. There are some 11 million Mexicans living in the U.S., about 5 million of whom don’t have legal status. Mexicans sent home more than $63 billion in remittances last year, mostly from the United States. Mass deportations would shake the finances of millions of families and the Mexican economy would struggle to absorb them. Migrant advocates and shelter directors in Mexico said they've heard of no government plans to deal with large numbers of deportees. Mexican aid groups are 'not in a position to receive that quantity of people and let's be honest, it's civil society that carries on its shoulders most of the humanitarian response toward those who are deported or in transit,' said Rafael Velásquez García, Mexico director for the International Rescue Committee. Mexico needs to prepare itself for all manner of pressures coming from a Trump administration, said Carlos Pérez Ricart, a professor of international relations at Mexican public research center CIDE. 'What Mexico has to accept is that our country is going to be a holding country for migrants, whether they want it or not,' he said. 'Trump is going to deport thousands, if not millions of people and he's going to impede the flow of migrants.' ___ Pesce reported from Ciudad Juarez, Mexico.

Leader of the free world has never been a role Trump has embraced. The world has gotten the message	WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. presidents usually pay lip service at least to being leaders of the free world, at the helm of a mighty democracy and military that allies worldwide can rally around and reasonably depend upon for support in return. Not so under President-elect Donald Trump, a critic of many existing U.S. alliances, whose win of a second term this week had close European partners calling for a new era of self-reliance not dependent on American goodwill. 'We must not delegate forever our security to America,' French President Emmanuel Macron said at a European summit Thursday. Based on Trump’s first term and campaign statements, the U.S. will become less predictable, more chaotic, colder to allies and warmer to some strongmen, and much more transactional in picking friends globally than before. America’s place in world affairs and security will fundamentally change, both critics and supporters of Trump say. His backers say he simply will be choosier about U.S. alliances and battles than previous presidents. When it comes to the U.S. role on the world stage, no more talk of the country as leader of the free world, said Fiona Hill, a former Russia adviser to Trump and preceding U.S. presidents. Maybe 'the free-for-all world, his leadership?' Hill suggested in a recent European Council for Foreign Relations podcast. 'I mean, what exactly is it that we’re going to be leading here?' Trump, with varying degrees of consistency, has been critical of NATO and support for Ukraine and Taiwan, two democracies under threat that depend on U.S. military support to counter Russia and China. Trump has shown little interest in the longstanding U.S. role as anchor of strategic alliances with European and Indo-Pacific democracies. Before the election, partners and adversaries already were reevaluating their security arrangements in preparation for Trump's possible return. European allies in particular bolstered efforts to build up their own and regional defenses, rather than rely on the U.S. as the anchor of NATO, the mutual-defense pact both Trump and running mate JD Vance have spoken of scathingly. Within hours of Trump’s win over Vice President Kamala Harris this week, defense chiefs of France and Germany scheduled talks to address the impact. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Russian President Vladimir Putin have appeared to shape war strategies with hopes that Trump could allow them freer rein. Victoria Coates, a security adviser to Trump in his first term, rejects any portrayal of him as isolationist. 'I think he is extremely judicious about the application of the American military, and about potentially getting embroiled in conflicts we can’t resolve,' she said recently on a security podcast. As evidence of his engagement globally, Coates pointed to Trump's support of Israel as it wages wars against Iranian-backed militant groups in Gaza and Lebanon. She called Iran's nuclear program the 'greatest concern' abroad and suggested its progress toward the possibility of nuclear weapons meant Trump might have to act more forcefully than in his first term, when he surged sanctions on Iran in what he called a 'maximum pressure' campaign. Trump, long an open admirer of Putin, has been most consistent in pointing to U.S. support of Ukraine for possible policy change. Philip Breedlove, a former Air Force general and top NATO commander, said he can see both positive expectations and deep concerns for Ukraine and NATO in the next four years under Trump. While Trump’s NATO rhetoric during his first administration was often harsh, it didn’t lead to any actual U.S. troop reductions in Europe or decreased support for the alliance, Breedlove said. And 23 NATO nations are spending at least 2% of their gross domestic product on defense, compared with 10 in 2020 — a showing that now negates a persistent Trump complaint. More concerning, Breedlove said, is Trump’s vow to end the war in Ukraine right away. While that goal is noble, 'ending wars on terms that are appropriate is one thing. Capitulating to an enemy in order to stop a conflict is a different thing. And that’s what worries me,' Breedlove said. He and others have warned that an end to the war that gives Russia additional territory in Ukraine will set a bad precedent. European nations fear it will embolden Putin to come after them. So do supporters of Taiwan, a democratically run island that China has said it will one day annex, by force if necessary. Trump has ranged from saying Taiwan should pay the U.S. for its defense support to claiming he could charm Chinese President Xi Jinping out of threatening Taiwan. 'One thing that does make me nervous about Trump vis-à-vis the Taiwan Strait is his reliance on unpredictability, his reliance on being something of a chaotic actor in a situation that is finely balanced,' said Paul Nadeau, an assistant professor of international affairs and political science at Temple University's Japan campus. The situation is one 'that requires a profound reading of very subtle signals between Taiwan, between the United States, between China,' Nadeau said. The world that Trump will face has changed, too, with Russia, North Korea, Iran and China further consolidating in a loose, opportunistic alliance to counter the West, and particularly the U.S. In places where the U.S. has withdrawn, Russia, China and at times Iran have been quick to extend their influence, including in the Middle East. During his first term, Trump repeatedly vowed to pull all U.S. forces out of Iraq and Syria, at times blindsiding Pentagon officials with sudden statements and tweets that left officials fumbling for answers. A backlash from some Republican lawmakers and counterproposals by U.S. military leaders slowed those plans, including suggestions that some U.S. troops should remain in Syria to protect oil sites. The U.S. still has about 900 troops in Syria, which could plunge under Trump. The number of U.S. forces in Iraq is already dwindling based on a new agreement between the Biden administration and Baghdad. The plan would wrap up the U.S.-led coalition’s mission to fight the Islamic State group by next year but likely shift at least some U.S. troops to northern Iraq to support the fight against IS in Syria. Trump's first term — followed by Joe Biden's foreign policy increasingly becoming consumed by unsuccessful efforts to reach cease-fires in the Middle East — already have spurred allies to speak of building up their own military strength and that of smaller regional alliances for security. 'Factored into calculations is there’s going to be less United States than before' on the world stage, Hill said. 'There can’t be this dangerous dependency on what happens in Washington, D.C.' ___ AP reporters Didi Tang and Tara Copp in Washington and Ayaka McGill in Tokyo contributed.	https://apnews.com/article/trump-foreign-alliances-russia-ukraine-china-b2ec5e845db76eaadba0abd3bf61cc50	2024-11-07T20:01:15-08:00	
Runway fire breaks out at Sydney Airport after emergency landing	WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — An engine failure on a passenger plane taking off from Sydney, Australia on Friday prompted the aircraft to circle before a safe emergency landing, the airline Qantas said. At the same time, a grass fire broke out along one side of a runway, Sydney Airport said in a statement. It was not known if the two events were linked. The fire has been brought under control, but flight delays are expected. Qantas did not say how many passengers were on board the twin jet Boeing 737-800 bound for Brisbane when the engine failed with a loud bang. No injuries were reported. 'We understand this would have been a distressing experience for customers and we will be contacting all customers this afternoon to provide support,' Qantas Chief Pilot Captain Richard Tobiano said in a statement. 'We will also be conducting an investigation into what caused the engine issue.' Sydney Airport said its main runway was still in service. The grass fire broke out along the side of a parallel runway which was being inspected before it could be used again, the airport said in a statement. It said delays were expected and advised travelers to check their flight's status with the airline. Mark Willacy, an Australian Broadcasting Corp. reporter, told the news outlet that an off-duty pilot who was a passenger on the plane had helped the Qantas pilot during the emergency landing. A flight tracking website shows the aircraft was airborne for about 20 minutes, flying in circles above the airport.	https://apnews.com/article/sydney-airport-fire-qantas-plane-engine-failure-australia-fd1e7095e0242073de7f272da5106ec7	2024-11-07T19:47:51-08:00	
The Temple of Satan gains ground in Chile as faith in traditional religions wanes	SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) — It’s Friday night in Downtown Santiago, the capital of Chile, and a group of 15 people gather around a table, sharing a bottle of wine as the smell of tobacco and incense fill the air. Black candles burn on top of an altar decorated with chalices and knives. The members of the Temple of Satan are about to start a ritual. Five years after the Satanic Temple of the United States made headlines — and unleashed a wave of panic — when it was designated a church, a similar organization in Chile, a conservative country where half of its population of 18 million identifies as Catholic, is asking the government to recognize them legally as a religious association. Scholars, believers and residents consulted by The Associated Press note that Chile, where a long-lasting tradition of Catholicism has played a leading role in public discussions, is experiencing a crisis of faith, following revelations of multiple sexual abuse scandals within the Catholic church over the years. 'These types of organizations now feel that they have greater support to challenge what was virtually impossible before,' said Luis Bahamondes, a professor at the Center for Judaic Studies at the University of Chile. And that’s because, 'until very recently, the Catholic Church enjoyed an unprecedented power. It had an opinion on everything: politics, economics, geopolitics, sexuality and education.' Despite its name, The Temple of Satan: Satanists and Luciferians of Chile does not embark on sacrifices nor asks its congregants to worship the devil. Among its 100 members are people who work as publicists, firefighters, police officers, lawyers and psychologists, who have found in the organization a way to defy moral norms, dogmas and religious impositions. While they embrace the term Satanist, they don’t revere or believe in Satan. Instead, they worship rationality, individualism, pleasure and the mundane life. Rather than gods, they praise humankind. 'You are the owner of your present and future, there is no God that makes decisions for you,' said Haborym, a spokesperson for the group, during a walk through tombs and mausoleums at the General Cemetery of Santiago. He notes that the figure of Satan is purely symbolic and their rituals are performed 'to bring out the emotions and leave the intellect aside.' Haborym and other members of the Temple of Satan in Chile spoke on condition their real names not be used, particularly with many hold public-facing jobs, citing growing threats. While Hollywood movies like 'Rosemary’s Baby' and TV series such as 'True Detective' helped to portray the idea of Satanists as linked to sacrifice, evil, pain and death, modern groups like Chile’s Temple of Satan are strongly against animal abuse, prohibit the affiliation of people with criminal records, see pleasures as a delight rather than a sin, and do not express their opinions unless asked. 'We don’t want people killing in the name of Satan,' said Haborym. In order to join Chile’s Temple of Satan, applicants are requested to go through a lengthy process that includes filling out a form, showing proof of not having a criminal record, being interviewed by a special commission and, finally, being evaluated by a psychologist. Once they are accepted, members can choose a new name — normally that of a demon or fallen angel — with which they will be identified inside the Temple and among other associates. Founded in 2021, Chile’s Temple of Satan has 100 members, and more than 400 people applied to join in the past few weeks, said Haborym. The interest spiked at the end of July, when the group formally requested the country’s Ministry of Justice to legally recognize it as a religious association. A media frenzy followed, unleashing a heated debate and causing a stir among Chile’s main religious denominations. 'The history of Satanism is well known (and) it has often been the cause of tragedies,' the leaders of several churches in Chile, including the Catholic, Anglican, Jewish and Evangelical, said in a joint statement. Following the steps of the Church of Satan founded in 1966 by Anton Szandor LaVey, modern Satanists praise skepticism and logic over celestial or supernatural beings. Its followers are free to formulate their own beliefs, rites and spiritual practices. Many self-described Satanists and Luciferians are atheists, others are witches or believe in the power of magic. 'We do accept that there are certain bases, both academic and esoteric, that give meaning to our existence and reality,' said Azazel, who quit Judaism four years ago and, one year later, founded the Temple of Satan of Chile. His words resonate in the darkness of the chamber and are interspersed with chants, clapping, mantras and readings of passages from the Satanic Bible and the Bible of the Adversary, the main guidelines of the group. Just like Azazel, others have turned to the Temple of Satan out of disappointment with traditional religions. The new congregants include not only occultists and esotericists, but also Catholics, Jews, Protestants and Evangelicals. 'In Satanism there are no solutions or absolute truths. You are your own god and you create your own reality,' said Kali Ma, a dentistry student who was born and raised in a Jehovah’s Witness family. 'If we compare both, Jehovah’s Witnesses are the real sect,' she said. 'They don’t let you do certain things, they tell you how to dress, what to do, how to behave, whether or not to grow a beard.' Néstor da Costa, an expert in secularism and religion at the Catholic University of Uruguay, said the influx of people seeking answers through different perspectives might be linked to the search for less dogmatic approaches. 'It may be a readjustment of the religious side of people who leave Catholicism but continue to believe in something,' he said. It is unclear if the Chilean government will legally recognize the Temple of Satan as a legitimate religious association, but its very existence has already helped to spark a discussion that until recently was unthinkable in this conservative society. Demanding recognition is the ultimate expression of everything praised by Satanic aesthetics: the rebellion against the status quo and the breakup with deep-rooted traditions. 'We comply with everything that is requested of us as a religious entity,' says Haborym. 'So there would be no reason to reject us beyond the fact that we’re a controversial figure.' ___ Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america	https://apnews.com/article/chile-satan-temple-religious-recognition-2bf57ed268b6f9d3056e20ccab985a6e	2024-11-07T19:36:35-08:00	
Typhoon floods villages, rips off roofs and damages 2 domestic airports in northern Philippines	MANILA, Philippines (AP) — Typhoon Yinxing battered the northern Philippines with floods and landslides before blowing away from the country on Friday, leaving two airports damaged and aggravating a calamity caused by back-to-back storms that hit in recent weeks. There were no immediate reports of casualties from Yinxing, the 13th major storm to hit the disaster-prone Southeast Asian archipelago this year. The typhoon, locally called Marce, was last tracked over the South China Sea about 100 kilometers (62 miles) west of the northern Philippine province of Ilocos Norte with sustained winds of up to 150 kilometers (93 miles) per hour and gusts of up to 205 kph (127 mph), according to government forecasters. It is expected to weaken further before hitting Vietnam. The typhoon flooded villages, toppled trees and electricity poles, and damaged houses and buildings in Cagayan province, where Yinxing made landfall Thursday afternoon, provincial officials said. More than 40,000 villagers were evacuated to safer ground in the province. In the northernmost island province of Batanes, Gov. Marilou Cayco said Yinxing’s fierce winds and rain blew away roofs of houses and damaged seaports and two domestic airport terminals. More details of damage, including in two northern mountain towns hit by landslides, were expected after provinces battered by the typhoon complete an assessment, officials said. The new damage will complicate recovery efforts from two powerful storms that lashed the northern region in recent weeks. Tropical Storm Trami and Typhoon Kong-rey left at least 151 people dead in the Philippines and affected nearly 9 million others, mostly in the northern and central provinces. More than 14 billion pesos ($241 million) in rice, corn and other crops and infrastructure were damaged. Trami dumped one to two months’ worth of rain in just 24 hours in some regions. In the hardest-hit province of Batangas, south of Manila, at least 61 people died in floods and landslides. More than 630,000 people were still displaced due to Trami and Kong-rey as of Thursday, officials said, including 172,000 who remained in emergency shelters as Yinxing blew across the country's mountainous north. President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. decided not to attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Peru next week to focus on recovery efforts, Communications Secretary Cesar Chavez said. In 2013, Typhoon Haiyan, one of the strongest recorded tropical cyclones, left more than 7,300 people dead or missing, flattened entire villages and caused ships to run aground and smash into houses in the central Philippines. The archipelago also lies in a region often hit by earthquakes and has more than a dozen active volcanoes, making it one of the most disaster-prone countries in the world.	https://apnews.com/article/philippines-typhoon-yinxing-51b689a712c6bb793cc7d08929eb3143	2024-11-07T19:31:38-08:00	
Why people with disabilities in Nairobi are looking beyond public transport to navigate busy city	NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) — Caroline Mwikali lost her ability to walk at age 13 after an illness. She quickly learned how difficult it is to get around in Kenya’s busy capital, Nairobi. Mwikali, who now works at a car financing company, said public transport is not designed to accommodate wheelchair users like her. Nairobi's most popular modes of transport include motorbikes along with minivans and minibuses that are not fitted with ramps. They also are not designed to fit wheelchairs in their aisles, so users must be hoisted up the stairs and placed on regular seats while their wheelchairs are put with luggage. 'In most cases, the people manning the bus terminals have to lift you off the wheelchair to help you board the buses. This is not only uncomfortable but leaves you attracting unnecessary attention from the public,' Mwikali told The Associated Press. She is among 2.2% of Kenya’s population, or about 900,000 people, who live with a disability. The most common type of disability is mobility-related at 42%. One entrepreneur, Daniel Gatura, founded Ace Mobility in Nairobi in 2021. Its vehicles are modified with ramps and swivel seats to accommodate people with disabilities and anyone else who needs support commuting. Gatura said he was inspired by a personal experience growing up. 'My father sustained a spinal cord injury in an accident that left him in a wheelchair when he was just 5 years old. I witnessed the challenges my father faced, including losing his job due to transportation issues,' Gatura said. Users can book rides through the Ace Mobility app. Drivers are trained as caregivers, ensuring they understand how to provide respectful and appropriate assistance to passengers with disabilities. Gatura said they have 5,000 users. 'We are changing the narrative around disability and reduced mobility. Just because you have a disability doesn’t mean you cannot earn for yourself; it doesn’t mean you are a nobody in the society,' he said. The transport is more expensive than public transport, charging the equivalent of $1 per kilometer (0.6 miles). The same amount can be used to pay for a 40-kilometer (24-mile) ride in public transport vehicles. But Gatura noted it delivers people directly to their homes. 'I find the charges quite fair considering the convenience that it offers. I get to travel comfortably and without necessarily moving from my chair. It also somehow preserves my dignity,' said Mwikali, who has used the service for four months after a referral from a former classmate. But others like Cindy Cherotich can't afford the service. She must jostle for space on minibuses while on crutches. 'When I go to the bus station sometimes the public vehicles do not allow me to board,' she said. 'When they see my crutch and (see) somebody who is OK without crutches, they will let them in and I will be left.' Lucy Nkatha, a disability advocate and coordinator of Kiengu Women Challenged to Challenge Group, an NGO, said she had never heard of Ace Mobility and called for marketing support for such companies. 'It should also be made affordable,' she said. Sandra Nyawira, the disability inclusion adviser at United Disabled Persons of Kenya, noted that Kenya has a number of policies in place to address accommodations for people with disabilities, but implementation is rare. She called for more political will. 'It’s one thing to have a policy that speaks to your issues, but then it’s another to implement them,' she said. ___ The Associated Press receives financial support for global health and development coverage in Africa from the Gates Foundation.

Myanmar's conflict-torn Rakhine state could face an imminent acute famine, UN report warns	UNITED NATIONS (AP) — Myanmar’s Rakhine state, home to the Rohingya minority and engulfed in conflict between government forces and a powerful ethnic group, could face an imminent acute famine, the United Nations development agency warned in a new report. The U.N. Development Program said in the report issued Thursday that 'a perfect storm is brewing' which has put western Rakhine 'on the precipice of an unprecedented disaster.' It pointed to a chain of interlinked developments including restrictions on goods from elsewhere in Myanmar and neighboring Bangladesh, the absence of income for residents, hyperinflation, significantly reduced food production, and a lack of essential services and social safety net. As a result, UNDP said, 'an already highly vulnerable population may be on the brink of collapse in the coming months.' Buddhist-majority Myanmar has long considered the Rohingya Muslim minority to be 'Bengalis' from Bangladesh even though their families have lived in the country for generations. Nearly all have been denied citizenship since 1982. In August 2017, attacks by a Rohingya insurgent group on Myanmar security personnel triggered a brutal campaign by the military which drove at least 740,000 Rohingya to Bangladesh. The military is accused of mass rape, killings and burning thousands of homes. Since Myanmar’s military seized power in 2021 from the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi, pro-democracy guerillas and ethnic minority armed forces have been attempting to oust the military from power. Last November, the Arakan Army, which is seeking autonomy from Myanmar’s central government, began an offensive against the military in Rakhine and has gained control of more than half of its townships. The Arakan Army, which is the well-armed wing of the Rakhine ethnic minority movement, is also a member of the armed ethnic group alliance trying to topple the military. The UNDP report said that based on data the agency collected in 2023 and 2024, 'Rakhine’s economy has stopped functioning, with critical sectors such as trade, agriculture, and construction nearly at a standstill.' With domestic and international markets no longer accessible because of blockades, UNDP said people’s incomes are collapsing because they can’t export goods, and that agricultural jobs are disappearing for the same reason. In addition, it said, imports of cement have stopped, leading to 'an exorbitant price increase' and shutting down the construction industry, a major employer. The report, titled 'Rakhine: A Famine in the Making,' said, 'Rakhine could face acute famine imminently.' 'Predictions indicate that domestic food production will only cover 20% of its needs by March-April 2025,' UNDP said. 'Internal rice production is plummeting due to a lack of seeds, fertilizers, severe weather conditions, a steep rise in the number of internally displaced people who can longer engage in cultivation, and escalating conflict,' the U.N. agency said. 'This, along with the near-total cessation of internal and external trade, will leave over 2 million people at risk of starvation.' UNDP called for immediate action to allow goods and humanitarian aid into Rakhine, enable unimpeded access for aid workers and ensure their safety, and urgently provide financial resources to enable the agricultural sector to recover. 'Without urgent action, 95% of the population will regress into survival mode, left to fend for themselves amid a drastic reduction in domestic production, skyrocketing prices, widespread unemployment, and heightened insecurity,' UNDP warned. 'With trade routes closed and severe restrictions on aid, Rakhine risks becoming a fully isolated zone of deep human suffering,' the U.N. agency said.	https://apnews.com/article/un-myanmar-rakhine-rohingya-famine-f5aa6bd4c3b73b60b850f48c8ea495d2	2024-11-07T19:01:37-08:00	
Stock market today: World shares are mostly lower after US Fed cuts interest rates	HONG KONG (AP) — European markets opened higher on Friday while Asian shares ended mixed after the Federal Reserve cut interest rates again to ease pressure on the U.S. economy. Germany’s DAX slipped 0.1% to 19,362,32. In Paris, the CAC 40 edged 0.1% lower to 7,417.13. Britain’s FTSE 100 also fell 0.1%, to 8,132.48. The futures for the S&amp;P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average were virtually unchanged. Markets in Hong Kong and Shanghai fell as investors awaited much-anticipated steps by Beijing to rev up the slowing Chinese economy following a meeting of the legislature’s Standing Committee. 'If Beijing delivers, we might see a powerful rally ripple through the region as investors gear up for a fresh surge in market momentum,' Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management said in a commentary. Officials announced a 6 trillion yuan ($839 billion), three-year plan to help local governments refinance their many trillions of debt that has ballooned during the COVID-19 pandemic and a collapse of the property market. Hong Kong's Hang Seng erased early gains, falling 1.1% to 20,728.19. The Shanghai Composite index dropped 0.5% to 3,452.30. Japan's Nikkei 225 index gained 0.3% to 39,500.37. Shares in Japanese automaker Nissan Motor Corp. plummeted 6% on Friday after the company on Thursday announced that it will dismiss 9,000 workers and slash its global production capacity by 20% due to falling sales and rising costs and inventory. In South Korea, the Kospi shed 0.1% to 2,561.15, while Australia’s S&amp;P/ASX 200 gained 0.8% to 8,295.10. On Thursday, the S&amp;P 500 climbed 0.7%, adding to its surge from the day before following Donald Trump’s presidential victory. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was virtually unchanged, while the Nasdaq composite rallied 1.5%. The Fed’s announcement that it was easing its main interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point caused few ripples in the market because even the precise size of it was so well anticipated by investors. The central bank began easing rates in September and indicated more cuts were likely to come, as it focuses more on keeping the job market humming after helping get inflation nearly down to its 2% target. What’s less certain in the minds of investors now is how much Trump’s victory may upset the Fed’s plans. Trump is pushing for tariffs and other policies that economists say could drive inflation higher, along with the economy’s growth. Traders have already begun paring forecasts for how many cuts to rates the Fed will deliver next year because of that. While lower rates can boost the economy, they can also give inflation more fuel. For now, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said, nothing is changing. 'In the near term, the election will have no effects' on interest-rate policy, he said. At this point, Powell said it’s still not clear what the policies will be after Trump returns to the White House. 'We don’t guess, we don’t speculate and we don’t assume,' he said. The yield on the 10-year Treasury bond eased to 4.33% from 4.44% late Wednesday. A report on Thursday showed slightly more U.S. workers applied for unemployment benefits, though the number remains relatively low. A separate report suggested U.S. workers improved their productivity during the summer, which can help keep a lid on inflation, but not by quite as much as economists expected. In other dealings early Friday, U.S. benchmark crude oil lost 89 cents to $71.47 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude, the international standard, gave up 88 cents to $74.75 per barrel. The dollar fell to 152.61 Japanese yen from 152.94 yen. The euro slipped to $1.0770 from $1.0804.	https://apnews.com/article/stock-markets-rates-china-af8eff52e0a9c9252b5f654b0bbaa0bf	2024-11-07T18:29:55-08:00	
Yemen's Houthi rebels shoot down what witnesses say was a US drone as American military investigates	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Yemen's Houthi rebels shot down what bystanders described as an American drone early Friday, potentially the latest downing of a U.S. spy drone as the militants continue their attacks on the Red Sea corridor. The U.S. military acknowledged the videos circulating online showing what appeared to be a flaming aircraft dropping out of the sky and a field of burning debris in what those off-camera described as an area of Yemen's al-Jawf province. The military said it was investigating the incident, declining to elaborate further. It wasn't immediately clear what kind of aircraft was shot down in the low-quality night video. The Houthis have surface-to-air missiles capable of downing aircraft such as the Iranian missile known as the 358. Iran denies arming the rebels, though Tehran-manufactured weaponry has been found on the battlefield and in seaborne shipments heading to Yemen for the Shiite Houthi rebels despite a United Nations arms embargo. The Houthis have been a key component of Iran's self-described 'Axis of Resistance' during the Mideast wars that includes Lebanon's Hezbollah, Hamas and other militant groups. The Houthis did not immediately claim responsibility for downing the aircraft. However, it can take their fighters hours or even days after an incident before they acknowledge it. Since Houthis seized the country’s north and its capital of Sanaa in 2014, the rebels have shot down MQ-9 Reaper drones in Yemen in 2017, 2019, 2023 and 2024. The U.S. military has declined to offer a total figure for the number of drones it has lost during that time. Reapers, which cost around $30 million apiece, can fly at altitudes up to 50,000 feet (15,240 meters) and have an endurance of up to 24 hours before needing to land. The aircraft have been flown by both the U.S. military and the CIA over Yemen for years. The Houthis have targeted more than 90 merchant vessels with missiles and drones since the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip started in October 2023. They seized one vessel and sank two in the campaign that has also killed four sailors. Other missiles and drones have either been intercepted by a U.S.-led coalition in the Red Sea or failed to reach their targets, which have included Western military vessels as well. The rebels maintain that they target ships linked to Israel, the U.S. or the U.K. to force an end to Israel’s campaign against Hamas in Gaza. However, many of the ships attacked have little or no connection to the conflict, including some bound for Iran. The tempo of the Houthi sea attacks also has waxed and waned over the months. In October, the U.S. military unleashed B-2 stealth bombers to target underground bunkers used by the Houthis.	https://apnews.com/article/mideast-wars-yemen-houthi-drone-shot-down-73c12a2bfd3a882ef29dbe1b3fef4997	2024-11-07T16:48:31-08:00	
Biden will visit the Amazon rainforest as part of six-day trip to Latin America	WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden will become the first sitting president to visit the Amazon rainforest later this month when he travels to Brazil as part of a six-day trip to Latin America for a pair of international summits, the White House said Thursday. Biden will start his trip with a Nov. 14-16 visit to Lima, Peru, where he will meet with President Dina Boluarte and attend the annual Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit. From there, he will travel to Manaus and Rio de Janeiro in Brazil from Nov. 17-19. In Manaus, Biden will visit the rainforest and see local, indigenous and other leaders who are working to preserve the region, the first such visit by a U.S. president. In Rio de Janeiro, Biden will meet with Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva to promote workers' rights and clean economic growth, the White House said. He will also attend the Group of 20 summit of world leaders to discuss global challenges like hunger, poverty and climate change. Biden spoke earlier Thursday with Lula to discuss the upcoming G20 summit. It may have also been an opportunity for Biden to commiserate with a sympathetic world leader. The left-leaning Lula made clear his preference for Democrat Kamala Harris ahead of the U.S. election. Lula in 2022 defeated the far right former President Jair Bolsonaro, who was known as 'Trump of the Tropics.' Biden is in the final months of his presidency and will be handing off the Oval Office to Republican Donald Trump. The two summits will offer Biden one of his last chances as president to meet with heads of state he’s worked with over the years. ___	https://apnews.com/article/biden-peru-brazil-g20-apec-rainforest-d430cb932d9ff8c065196c0f8003cbcd	2024-11-07T14:13:11-08:00	
France condemns a spat between Israeli police and French consulate staff at a Jerusalem church	JERUSALEM (AP) — Armed Israeli police forced their way into a French-owned church compound in the contested city of Jerusalem on Thursday, the French foreign ministry said, briefly detaining two consulate employees and prompting the top French diplomat to abandon his planned visit to the site. The unusual incident threatened to further strain relations between Israel and France weeks after French President Emmanuel Macron’s call for an arms embargo on Israel prompted backlash from right-wing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The French Foreign Ministry said it would summon the Israeli ambassador in protest in the coming days. A strongly worded statement from France said Israeli security forces had intruded on the courtyard of the Church of the Pater Noster, angering French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot and prompting him to abandon his scheduled visit there. The ministry said Israeli police detained two staff members of the French Consulate in Jerusalem despite their diplomatic status, adding that the employees were released only after Barrot intervened. 'This attack on the integrity of a domain placed under the responsibility of France is likely to weaken the bonds I have, in fact, come to cultivate with Israel at a time when we all need to make progress in the region on the road to peace,' Barrot told reporters in Jerusalem. Barrot was meeting with Israeli officials Thursday in the city, where he pleaded for a cease-fire to stop the Israeli bombardment of Gaza and called for a diplomatic solution in Lebanon — a former French protectorate that Israel invaded last month in its broadening military campaign against the Iran-backed Hezbollah militant group. 'These actions are unacceptable,' the French Foreign Ministry statement said of Thursday's fracas between Israeli security forces and French diplomatic staffers. 'France condemns (these actions) all the more vigorously as they come at a time when it is doing everything it can to work towards de-escalating the violence in the region.' Israeli police portrayed the controversy as a misunderstanding, saying that two church workers who declined to identify themselves had refused entry to Israeli security guards accompanying Minister Barrot on his church visit. Israeli police said they held the men for some 20 minutes and released them once they were identified as employees of the French Consulate in Jerusalem, which is the protector of French religious communities and four holy sites in the city. The Israeli police said all foreign ministers on official visits to Israel are assigned Israeli security guards for their trips. It said the logistics of Barrot's visit were worked out beforehand with the French Embassy in Israel, warning the public against contributing to 'misleading narratives' about the altercation. The compound that Barrot had planned to visit — on the Mount of Olives overlooking the Old City of Jerusalem — holds a church originally built by Crusaders that believed the site to be where Jesus taught the Pater Noster, or Lord’s Prayer. It was later acquired by Princess Héloïse de la Tour d’Auvergne, who had the prayer written in calligraphy in numerous languages on the walls of the cloisters and courtyard, also home to the the ruins of the Byzantine Eleona Church. The site was entrusted to French Carmelite nuns in 1874. 'This domain is not only one that has belonged to France for over 150 years,' Barrot said. 'It's one where France has ensured security and maintenance with enormous care.' Thursday's incident was reminiscent of several others skirmishes over the years between irritated French officials and assertive Israeli bodyguards. In 2020, President Macron lost his temper at Israeli security officers who had insisted on accompanying him inside another French church in Jerusalem. In 1996, then-French President Jacques Chirac accused Israeli security forces of pushing and shoving his entourage in a spat that even drew an apology from a young Prime Minister Netanyahu during his first year in office. Such stand-offs take on symbolic significance in Jerusalem, among the most fiercely contested swaths of real estate on earth. Israel has viewed Jerusalem as its 'unified, eternal' capital since capturing east Jerusalem, which includes the Old City, in the 1967 Mideast war, along with the West Bank and Gaza. Palestinians want those territories for their future state, with east Jerusalem serving as their eventual capital. Israel annexed the eastern part of the city in a move not recognized internationally. Since the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks on Israel more than a year ago, President Macron has stressed his support of Israel and its right to defend itself. But tensions have escalated in recent weeks as Macron has demanded that Israel do more to avoid the rapidly mounting civilian casualties in its campaigns in Gaza and Lebanon. Later Thursday, Minister Barrot held talks on the conflict with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in Ramallah, in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-france-netanyahu-war-gaza-lebanon-macron-church-3f14d060106160b10cbc8abbd3825f7a	2024-11-07T10:50:22-08:00	
Putin congratulates Trump on his election victory in his first public comments on the US vote	MOSCOW (AP) — Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday congratulated Donald Trump on his election victory in his first public comment on the U.S. vote, and he praised the president-elect's courage during the July assassination attempt. 'His behavior at the moment of an attempt on his life left an impression on me. He turned out to be a brave man,' Putin said at an international forum following a speech in the Black Sea resort of Sochi. 'He manifested himself in the very correct way, bravely as a man,' he added. Putin also said that what Trump has said 'about the desire to restore relations with Russia, to help end the Ukrainian crisis, in my opinion, deserves attention at least.' The Kremlin earlier welcomed Trump’s claim that he could negotiate an end to the conflict in Ukraine 'in 24 hours' but emphasized that it will wait for concrete policy steps. ″I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate him on his election as president of the United States of America,' Putin said in a question-and-answer session at the conference. As to what he expects from a second Trump administration, Putin said, 'I don’t know what will happen now. I have no idea.' 'For him, this is still his last presidential term. What he will do is his matter,' added Putin, who this year began a fifth term that will keep him in power until 2030 and could seek six more years in office after that. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Thursday the Kremlin is not ruling out the possibility of contact between Putin and Trump before the inauguration, given that Trump 'said he would call Putin before the inauguration.' Peskov has emphasized that Moscow views the U.S. as an 'unfriendly' country that is directly involved in the Ukrainian conflict. He dismissed arguments that Putin’s failure to reach out quickly to Trump could hurt future ties, saying that Moscow's relations with Washington already are at the 'lowest point in history' and arguing that it will be up to the new U.S. leadership to change the situation. The Kremlin’s cautious stand reflected its view of the U.S. vote as a choice between two unappealing possibilities. While Trump is known for his admiration of Putin, the Russian leader has repeatedly noted that during Trump’s first term, there were 'so many restrictions and sanctions against Russia like no other president has ever introduced before him.'	https://apnews.com/article/putin-trump-russia-us-election-6f388707c132bdf6554ee4e615f894ad	2024-11-07T10:06:31-08:00	
Canada's Trudeau revives a Cabinet-level panel to address concerns about a Trump presidency	TORONTO (AP) — Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Thursday he is re-establishing a special Cabinet committee on Canada-U.S. relations to address his administration's concerns about another Donald Trump presidency. Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland, who is also the country's finance minister, will chair the committee, which also will include other top officials including ministers of foreign affairs, public safety and industry. 'Following the election of President Donald Trump for a second term, the Cabinet Committee will focus on critical Canada-U.S. issues,' Trudeau's office said in a statement Thursday. Canada is one of the most trade-dependent countries in the world, and 75% of Canada’s exports go to the U.S. During Trump's first time, his move to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA, and reports that he was considering a 25% tariff on the auto sector were considered an existential threat in Canada at the time. Trudeau called Trump on Wednesday to congratulate him and the two discussed the new free trade deal Trump reached during his first term with Canada and Mexico, the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which replaced NAFTA. Although Trump once called Trudeau 'weak' and 'dishonest' during his first term, ties between the two countries have remained among the closest in the world. Freeland addressed reporters twice on Wednesday in an effort to reassure Canadians. 'I know a lot of Canadians are anxious. I want to say with utter sincerity and conviction to Canadians that Canada will be absolutely fine,' Freeland said. 'We have a strong relationship with the United States. We have a strong relationship with President Trump and his team. Let’s remember that our trading relationship today is governed by the trade deal concluded by President Trump himself and his team,' Freeland said. During the recent election campaign, Trump has proposed tariffs of 10% to 20% on foreign goods — and in some speeches has mentioned even higher percentages. Nelson Wiseman, a political science professor at the University of Toronto, said Canada should expect new tariffs and pressure to increase its military budget. According to NATO figures, Canada was estimated to be spending 1.33% of GDP on its military budget in 2023, below the 2% target that NATO countries have set for themselves. Trump has urged NATO countries to boost their own defense spending to ease the burden on the U.S. to deter the alliance's enemies. 'I expect that the free trade deal will be slightly modified as it was during Trump’s first presidency and not dramatically,' Wiseman said. 'Tariffs will hurt the Canadian economy economy but not cripple it. Canada has some cards to play in negotiations including countervailing tariffs, the concerns of American business leaders, and Canada’s storehouse of critical minerals.' The Canadian government notes that the U.S. and Canada are each other’s largest trade partners with nearly $3.6 billion Canadian (US$2.7 billion) worth of goods and services crossing the border each day in 2023. The ties between the two countries are without parallel anywhere in the world. There is close co-operation on defense, border security and law enforcement, and a vast overlap in culture, traditions and pastimes — with shared baseball, hockey, basketball and soccer leagues. About 400,000 people cross the world’s longest international border each day and about 800,000 Canadians live in the U.S. Robert Bothwell, a professor of Canadian history and international relations at the University of Toronto, said Canadians should be worried about potential rash actions on tariffs and trade. 'How would you feel if old Uncle Donald was feeling whimsical one morning and decided to do … oh, whatever he’d just heard on Fox News?,' Bothwell said.	https://apnews.com/article/canada-trump-trudeau-us-trade-075ccb2e68238c3b00c4b5cd24a19b4e	2024-11-07T09:56:57-08:00	
Belarus' hardline president releases 31 political prisoners but crackdown persists	TALLINN, Estonia (AP) — Belarus's authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko, who has led a harsh crackdown on opposition, pardoned and released 31 political prisoners, his office announced Thursday. The names of those released were not announced, but Lukashenko's office said three of them are invalids and 17 have chronic illnesses. Human rights activists and former prisoners say medical care and health conditions in Belarusian prisons are poor. The announcement said the freed prisoners had been convicted of 'crimes of an extremist nature,' a description widely used for opposition figures and people arrested in the mass protests that arose in 2020 after the disputed results of a presidential election gave Lukashenko a sixth term in office. The crackdown forced many opposition members to flee the country, while major activists who stayed in the country have been imprisoned. Lukashenko has released a total of 115 political prisoners this year, even while continuing the crackdown. The intention of the releases, which come ahead of new presidential elections in January, is unclear. 'Lukashenko is giving very contradictory signals — he has released 30 political prisoners, but at the same time arrested more than 100 people in the last week alone,' Pavel Sapelka of the human rights group Viasna told The Associated Press. 'We are seeing an escalation of fear and increased repression in Belarus on the eve of the presidential elections, and it is not entirely clear to whom and what signals Minsk is giving.' Viasna counts 1278 political prisoners in Belarus, including its Nobel Peace Prize-winning founder Ales Bialiatski.	https://apnews.com/article/lukashenko-belarus-crackdown-political-prisoners-released-b2a052cb791bce83ccc4f34827ece970	2024-11-07T09:50:52-08:00

Why Mozambique's election has sparked weeks of protests and a violent crackdown by police	CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) — Thousands protested in Mozambique's capital on Thursday and security forces responded by firing tear gas and rubber bullets, as weeks of post-election unrest continued in the southern African country. The protests were sparked by a vote last month that will keep the ruling party in power for more than a half-century amid allegations of rigging. Opposition parties and many citizens have rejected the results of the Oct. 9 presidential election as fraudulent and growing protests in the capital, Maputo, and other cities have been met by deadly force from police. Thursday's protest was the biggest yet. International rights groups say at least 20 people have been killed by police since the unrest began nearly a month ago, while local groups say the death toll is more than 50. Authorities are threatening to deploy the army as protesters set fires on the streets and burn ruling party offices. The internet is being restricted and social media sites have been blocked, according to Human Rights Watch. Neighboring South Africa has shut its border post with Mozambique and heightened security around it. What happened in the election? The candidate for the ruling Front for the Liberation of Mozambique, Daniel Chapo, was declared the winner of the presidential election on Oct. 24. That keeps the party that has governed Mozambique since independence from Portugal in 1975 in power for another five years. Even before the results were announced, opposition parties claimed fraud, accusing the ruling party, known as Frelimo, of ballot stuffing, manipulating voter lists and staffing polling stations with officials loyal to it. Frelimo has long been accused of rigging elections in the country of around 34 million. The European Union's observer team said there were irregularities in the election, including the altering of some results. Mozambican media has reported that the Constitutional Council, the supreme body for election law, has asked the commission that ran the election to explain discrepancies. Senior opposition figures killed Independent candidate Venancio Mondlane, who was second behind Chapo in the official results, has led criticism of the vote. He called for a national strike and for people to stay at home in the days after the election in protest at the alleged tampering. But the mood changed when two senior opposition figures were killed in their car in a late-night shooting by unidentified gunmen on Oct. 18. The men who were killed were the lawyer for Mondlane and the official spokesperson for the political party that supported Mondlane in the election. Mondlane said they were assassinated and he and opposition supporters gathered near the site of the killings the day after to protest. Police fired tear gas canisters at Mondlane, his aides and journalists who were interviewing him, forcing them to flee. Growing protests Since then, there have been waves of protests across the country. In one city, protesters toppled and cut the head off a statue of current President Filipe Nyusi, who is stepping down after serving a maximum two terms. Mondlane said on social media that he had gone into exile in fear for his life after the killing of his lawyer. His whereabouts are unknown, but he has called on social media for more protests 'so that we can then be freed from these shackles that have held us up for 50 years.' Authorities have said little other than the protests have been violent and needed to be quelled. They have not given information on the number of people killed or injured in the protests. Rights groups accused the police of shooting at peaceful protests in the days after the election and said children were among the victims. Anger among opposition supporters has swelled. The presidential palace is under heavy guard. A history of civil war and violence Mozambique is still in the shadow of a bloody 15-year civil war the leftist Frelimo fought against rebel group Renamo after independence. The country only held its first elections in 1994 and this was the first vote where there were no armed groups connected to political parties after a process to disarm militias. The country, which has rich natural resources including large, newly discovered natural gas fields, was already struggling with a yearslong insurgency by an Islamic State-affiliated group in the northern province of Cabo Delgado. Mondlane, who broke away from Renamo, has support among Mozambique's disaffected youth and he and the new Podesa party that is backing him have become the biggest challenge to Frelimo's long rule. ___ AP Africa news: https://apnews.com/hub/africa	https://apnews.com/article/mozambique-election-protests-violence-unrest-frelimo-e732c78af8f39f89862c85f408d40975	2024-11-07T08:27:46-08:00	
Notre Dame marks arrival of Paris Olympics’ iconic trackside bell as cathedral reopening nears	PARIS (AP) — Paris’s Notre Dame cathedral, whose historic bells were silenced following 2019’s devastating fire, will soon echo again with fresh chimes. On Thursday, the Gothic landmark took delivery of three new bells, including one that was used in the city’s Stade de France stadium during this year’s Paris Olympic Games. The Olympic bell, a gift from the Paris 2024 organizing committee, will be installed alongside two smaller bells, named Chiara and Carlos, above the altar where they will be rung during Mass, officials said. Their arrival ahead of Notre Dame's reopening on Dec. 8 marks a milestone in the painstaking restoration and modernization of the 861-year-old cathedral, made famous around the world by Victor Hugo's 'The Hunchback of Notre Dame.' Olivier Ribadeau Dumas, rector of Notre Dame, expressed gratitude for the bells’ arrival during a ceremony. 'What a joy it is,' he said. 'At the most important moment of the Mass these bells will ring, just as they did when the victor of a competition could celebrate their victory.' During the Paris 2024 Games, the iconic Olympic bell was rung by each track and field winner. It bears the mark 'Paris 2024,' while the two others are adorned with a round symbol combining the image of Notre Dame’s iconic rosary window with a monstrance, a religious vessel central to the cathedral’s altar. Crafted by the renowned Cornille Havard foundry, in Villedieu-les-Poêles, Normandy, the bells embody France’s distinguished bell-making tradition. In a solemn moment, Dumas consecrated the bells with holy water and a tree branch. Standing on the square outside the cathedral, he and Tony Estanguet, head of the Paris 2024 organizing committee, struck the bells with a wooden mallet to mark the occasion. 'What a powerful symbol it is to see this second life given to the Paris 2024 bell, which brought us so many emotions during these Games,' Estanguet said. The bells replace three that were previously positioned near Notre Dame’s 19th-century spire, which dramatically collapsed during the fire which ripped through the cathedral’s rafters and roof. The new bells will be placed in a different location within the cathedral, officials said, where their return will add to the soundscape of Notre Dame’s daily life. They join the eight historic bells from the cathedral’s north tower that were reinstalled in September after being cleaned and renovated. Those bells—Gabriel, Anne-Geneviève, Denis, Marcel, Étienne, Benoît-Joseph, Maurice, and Jean-Marie—were originally cast in 2013 for Notre Dame’s 850th anniversary. The cathedral’s two larger bells remain intact on the south tower and were unaffected by the blaze, officials added. The reconstruction of Notre Dame has involved more than 250 companies and hundreds of skilled craftsmen. The Olympic bell isn't the only symbol of old meeting new in Notre-Dame’s evolving restoration. Perched atop the newly designed spire, a golden rooster, reimagined by chief architect Philippe Villeneuve, marks a blend of the cathedral’s ancient spirit with a modern touch. The weathervane, which resembles a phoenix with flames licking its wings, is described as a testament to hope and revival.	https://apnews.com/article/notre-dame-bells-restoration-22c181d4a67556e96378acc618d9adfe	2024-11-07T05:02:15-08:00	
For many Iranians, Trump’s return intensifies worries about war. Yet some see reasons for hope	TEHRAN, Iran (AP) — Iranians, like many around the world, are divided on what Donald Trump's next presidency will bring: Some foresee an all-out war between Tehran and Washington, particularly as other conflicts rage in the region. Others hold out hope that America's 47th president might engage in unexpected diplomacy as he did with North Korea. But nearly all believe something will change in the U.S.-Iran relationship. 'Trump will use tougher levers against Iran,' warned Ahmad Zeidabadi, a political analyst. 'Iranian officials will keep rejecting him and that could make him escalate his pressure.' And while Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has final say on all matters of state, has repeatedly expressed his own disgust with Trump, Iran’s new reformist president has kept the door open to talks with Trump to seek relief from international sanctions to buoy a cratering economy. The Iranian rial, in a free fall for years, hit its lowest value against the dollar on Wednesday before slightly recovering. The U.S. and Iran have had an adversarial relationship since Iran’s 1979 Islamic Revolution and the takeover of the U.S. Embassy and 444-day hostage crisis that followed. Trump’s first term in office was marked by a particularly troubled period, when he pursued a policy of 'maximum pressure' against Tehran. He unilaterally withdrew America from Iran’s nuclear deal with world powers, leading to the sanctions hobbling the economy, and ordered the killing of the country's top general. Confirmation of Trump’s reelection came too late for most Wednesday papers. On Thursday, hewing to the official line, many decried the victory. The newspaper Hamshahri put an artist’s rendering of Trump in an orange prison jumpsuit and handcuffs under the headline: 'Return of the murderer.' The hard-line Javan newspaper said it was 'back to the crime scene.' On the streets of Tehran, opinions varied more. Some feared a return to the low points of Trump's first presidency. Others expressed joy. 'I’m very happy that Trump has won because he is really a powerful man,' said Fatemeh Kaveh, 40. 'I see him as a role model in terms of personality, and I always watch his stories (on social media), and I believe in him. I’m very happy he won.' But the one opinion that matters above all in Iran’s theocracy is that of Khamenei, who has been the country’s paramount ruler for six American presidencies. He has made his views on Trump clear. 'I do not consider Trump as a person worth exchanging any message with and I have no answer for him, nor will I respond to him in the future,' Khamenei told the late Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in 2019. Those comments came a year after Trump withdrew the U.S. from the nuclear accord, which offered Iran relief from international sanctions in return for restrictions meant to prevent it from building an atomic bomb. Then came Trump’s decision to assassinate Revolutionary Guard Gen. Qassem Soleimani, a prominent figure within Iran, in a 2020 drone strike in Baghdad. Khamenei’s personal website still hosts a video that imagines Trump being killed in an Iranian drone strike as he plays golf with former U.S. Secretary of State and CIA chief Mike Pompeo. Both men have received additional protection over Iranian threats to their lives — and the country has been accused of hacking Trump campaign associates in hopes of hurting his prospects. Iranians have also not forgotten Soleimani’s killing. 'It is a good time for Iran to retaliate — the murderer of our hero has come back,' said Tehran resident Reza Solatani, 39. 'He should eventually pay for his crime.' The question now is how that hard-line approach will fare amid the economic crisis and other challenges. A string of mass protests have escalated in the last few years, most recently with the 2022 death of Mahsa Amini and women rejecting the state-mandated headscarf, or hijab. Iran remains locked in the Mideast wars roiling the region, and its leaders have threatened a retaliatory strike after Israel’s Oct. 26 attack. It allies are battered, including the militant groups of its self-described 'Axis of Resistance,' like Hamas, Lebanon’s Hezbollah and Yemen’s Houthi rebels. Support for those groups while Iranians struggle economically has been a protest cry. Trump's election means 'peace will return to Lebanon and Gaza and Iran will not spend our money there,' said Zohreh Naghavi, a 36-year-old who works in a clothing store. 'It is good news.' Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian, who will mark his first 100 days in office next week, campaigned on a promise of outreach to the West to lift sanctions over Iran’s nuclear program — which now enriches uranium to near weapons-grade levels. On Thursday, Pezeshkian appeared to remain open to talks with Washington — even in the wake of Trump's victory — saying that 'it doesn’t matter who has won the U.S elections.' 'We will in no way have a closed and limited approach in the expansion of ties with other countries,' he said, according to the state-run IRNA news agency. That leaves open the possibility for negotiations. Trump in his first term famously courted North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Some Iranians have imagined the president-elect doing the same in Tehran. 'Because Trump is a showman he might announce that he wants to talk to Pezeshkian in person,' said Zeidabadi, the analyst. 'Unfortunately, the problem is that (the government) can’t accept that. Even if some people in the government are interested in doing that, the majority of hard-liners won’t let that happen and this can make Trump more angry too.' Still, some feel Iran already is at its breaking point. 'I think Iran has no choice but to make peace with Trump, considering the situation of the dollar (exchange rate) and the livelihoods of people and the high prices,' said Sina Khaledian, a 32-year-old nurse. 'There is lack of medicine and health care. They have to do this. I think the country’s capacity to endure has been exhausted.' ___ Gambrell reported from Dubai, United Arab Emirates.

The Latest: Biden guarantees a ‘peaceful transfer of power,’ House control hangs in the balance	President Joe Biden delivered remarks to the nation midday Thursday in his first appearance on camera in the aftermath of Donald Trump ’s decisive victory over Kamala Harris. Control over the U.S. House of Representatives hangs in the balance, teetering between a Republican or Democratic majority with dozens of races left to be called. The Republicans won control of the U.S. Senate early Wednesday. Follow the AP’s Election 2024 coverage at: https://apnews.com/hub/election-2024. Here’s the latest: State Department prepares for the presidential transition The State Department says it has begun to take steps to ease the transition from the Biden administration to Trump’s incoming administration. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has directed all department employees to work with incoming staffers to ensure a peaceful and orderly transition that protects U.S. national security. Department spokesman Matthew Miller said that retired senior diplomat Stephen Mull, a former ambassador who is currently a vice provost at the University of Virginia, has been tasked with leading the effort to work with Trump’s team. Miller said though that the department has not yet been contacted by the Trump team, which is being led by Brian Hook, a former special representative for Iran during the Trump administration, and Joel Rayburn, a former special envoy for Syria. Miller said the department will put together information on policy and procedures and be ready to answer any questions. ‘The Handmaid’s Tale’ is selling again Since former President Trump clinched his return to the White House, Margaret Atwood’s dystopian classic about a country where women are brutally repressed has been high on the Amazon bestseller list. 'The Handmaid’s Tale' was popular throughout Trump’s first term, along with such dark futuristic narratives as George Orwell’s '1984' and Ray Bradbury’s 'Fahrenheit 451,' both of which were back in the Amazon top 40 as of Thursday afternoon. Another best-seller from Trump’s previous time in office, Timothy Snyder’s 'On Tyranny: Twenty Lessons from the Twentieth Century,' was in the top 10. Pro-Trump books also were selling well. Former first lady Melania Trump’s memoir, 'Melania,' was the No. 1 seller, and Vice President-elect JD Vance’s 'Hillbilly Elegy' was in the top 10. Donald Trump’s photo book, 'Save America,' was in the top 30. Federal Reserve Chair says Trump has no legal authority to fire him At a press conference today, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said he would not resign if President-elect Donald Trump asked him to, and underscored that in his view, the president wouldn’t have the legal authority to fire him, as Trump reportedly sought to do the last time he was in the White House. 'Not permitted under the law,' Powell said, when asked if he was worried that Trump could demote him or other Fed officials, such as Michael Barr, the Fed’s top banking regulator, who has sought to tighten financial regulations. Most experts agree that a president generally doesn’t have the authority to fire a member of the Fed’s governing board, but there is more ambiguity about whether Trump could remove Powell as chair while leaving him as a member of the board. Democrat Steven Horsford wins reelection to US House in Nevada’s 4th Congressional District Democratic Rep. Steven Horsford won reelection to a U.S. House seat representing Nevada on Thursday. Horsford, a four-term congressman, became the first Black person to represent Nevada in Congress when he was first elected to the House. This year, he defeated former North Las Vegas Mayor John Lee. The district stretches north from Las Vegas, toward Nye County in the west and along the Utah border in the eastern portion of the district. The Associated Press declared Horsford the winner at 2:36 p.m. EST. Democrat Kim Schrier wins reelection to US House in Washington’s 8th Congressional District Democratic Rep. Kim Schrier won reelection to a U.S. House seat representing Washington on Thursday. She defeated Republican Carmen Goers, who works in financial services. Schrier, a pediatrician, first won her seat in 2018, becoming the first Democrat to represent the district. Of the seven Washington state congressional districts Democrat Joe Biden carried in 2020, the 8th district had the smallest margin. The district covers much of the middle of the state, from the eastern suburbs of Seattle to the Columbia River. The Associated Press declared Schrier the winner at 2:10 p.m. EST. Democrat Don Davis wins reelection to US House in North Carolina’s 1st Congressional District Democratic Rep. Donald Davis won reelection to a U.S. House seat representing North Carolina on Thursday. Davis ran in territory that became less favorable to Democrats in 2023 after North Carolina passed new maps that brought more Republican-leaning voters into the 1st District. President Joe Biden still narrowly carried areas in 2020 that make up the district’s current configuration. Davis defeated Army veteran Laurie Buckhout. The Associated Press declared Davis the winner at 2:03 p.m. EST. Russian President Vladimir Putin congratulates Donald Trump on his election victory Putin’s congratulations were the Russian leader’s first public comment on the outcome of the U.S. balloting and came after a speech during an international forum conference in the Black Sea resort of Sochi. ″I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate him on his election as president of the United States of America,' Putin said in a question-and-answer session. Canada’s Trudeau revives a Cabinet-level panel to address concerns about a Trump presidency Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Thursday he is re-establishing a special Cabinet committee on Canada-U.S. relations to address his administration’s concerns about another Donald Trump presidency. Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland, who is also the country’s finance minister, will chair the committee, which also will include other top officials including ministers of foreign affairs, public safety and industry. 'Following the election of President Donald Trump for a second term, the Cabinet Committee will focus on critical Canada-U.S. issues,' Trudeau’s office said in a statement Thursday. ▶ Read more about what the committee will focus on White evangelical voters show steadfast support for Donald Trump’s presidency After Donald Trump gave his victory speech early Wednesday at the Palm Beach Convention Center, dozens of his supporters gathered in a lobby to sing 'How Great Thou Art,' reciting from memory the words and harmonies of a classic hymn, popular among evangelical Christians. It was a fitting coda to an election in which Trump once again won the support of about 8 in 10 white evangelical Christian voters, according to AP VoteCast, a sweeping survey of more than 120,000 voters. That margin — among a group that represented about 20% of the total electorate — repeats similarly staggering margins of evangelical support that Trump received in 2020. Evangelicals said they believed Trump would implement their policy priorities on religious as well as general issues such as immigration and the economy. But critics fear Trump’s administration will implement Christian nationalist policies that will give Christianity a privileged status in public life, rather than maintaining a separation of church and state and treating people of all beliefs equally. ▶ Read more about Evangelicals’ support of Trump Republican Scott Perry wins reelection to US House in Pennsylvania’s 10th Congressional District Republican Rep. Scott Perry won reelection to a U.S. House seat representing Pennsylvania on Thursday. The former Freedom Caucus chairman found himself in an expensive race against Janelle Stelson, a longtime local TV news anchor, in a Harrisburg district that Republican Donald Trump carried in the 2020 presidential election. Perry, a four-term congressman, was the only lawmaker to have his cellphone seized by FBI agents investigating the web of Trump loyalists who were central to the former president’s bid to remain in power after his 2020 election loss. The Associated Press declared Perry the winner at 1:47 p.m. EST. Republican Robert Bresnahan wins election to US House in Pennsylvania’s 8th Congressional District, beating incumbent Matt Cartwright Republican Rob Bresnahan won election to a U.S. House seat representing Pennsylvania on Thursday, defeating Democratic Rep. Matt Cartwright. Republicans have long sought to unseat Cartwright in this Scranton-based seat that Republican Donald Trump carried in the 2020 presidential election. Bresnahan is a first-time candidate and the CEO of an electrical contracting company founded by his grandfather. Cartwright has represented the district for six terms. The Associated Press declared Bresnahan the winner at 1:46 p.m. EST. Republican Ryan Mackenzie wins election to US House in Pennsylvania’s 7th Congressional District, beating incumbent Susan Wild Republican Ryan Mackenzie won election to a U.S. House seat representing Pennsylvania on Thursday, defeating Democratic Rep. Susan Wild in the highly competitive district. Mackenzie represents parts of Lehigh County in the state House. While Democrat Joe Biden carried the Allentown district in 2020, Republican Donald Trump won it in 2016. Wild, a three-term congresswoman, is a perennial Republican target in her eastern Pennsylvania district and had staved off the challenges until now. The Associated Press declared Mackenzie the winner at 1:44 p.m. EST. Rioters who stormed the Capitol after Trump’s 2020 defeat toast his White House return As it became clear Donald Trump was returning to the White House, the Florida man who posed for photos with then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s lectern during the Capitol riot popped a bottle of Trump-branded sparkling wine. 'Y’all are in trouble,' he said after taking a sip in a video shared on social media. Rioters who stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, are celebrating Trump’s victory and hoping he makes good on his campaign trail promise to pardon them. Trump didn’t mention the Jan. 6 defendants, whom he’s called 'hostages' and 'patriots,' during his victory speech Wednesday. But his defeat of Vice President Kamala Harris throws into doubt the future of the largest prosecution in Justice Department history over the unprecedented assault on a seat of American democracy. More than 1,500 people have been charged with federal crimes stemming from the riot that left more than 100 police officers injured and sent lawmakers running into hiding as they met to certify Joe Biden’s 2020 victory. Trump hasn’t explained how he’ll decide who gets pardoned. But he’s suggested he would consider granting them even for those accused of assault as well as the former Proud Boys leader convicted of orchestrating a violent plot to keep Trump in power. ▶ Read more about Trump and the Capitol rioters Democrat Laura Gillen wins election to US House in New York’s 4th Congressional District, beating incumbent Anthony D’Esposito Democrat Laura Gillen won election to a U.S. House seat representing New York on Thursday, defeating Republican Rep. Anthony D’Esposito. Gillen is a former town supervisor who campaigned on supporting law enforcement and border security, an issue many Democrats blame for their losses in New York in 2022. She lost to D’Esposito by just over 3 percentage points last cycle. Gillen is one of several Democrats running against a New York Republican congressman in a district that Democrat Joe Biden carried in 2020. The district falls just outside the New York City borough of Queens. The Associated Press declared Gillen the winner at 12:39 p.m. EST. California’s governor calls special session to protect liberal policies from Trump presidency California’s Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, a fierce critic of President-elect Donald Trump, on Thursday called for lawmakers to convene a special session later this year to safeguard the state’s progressive policies on climate change, reproductive rights and immigration ahead of another Trump presidency. The move — a day after the former president resoundingly defeated Vice President Kamala Harris in the presidential race — effectively reignited California’s resistance campaign against conservative policies that state Democratic leaders started during the first Trump administration. The move is also part of a growing discussion among Democratic state officials across the country seeking to protect policies that face threats under Trump’s leadership. ▶ Read more about what California and other blue states are doing Republican Jeff Hurd wins election to US House in Colorado’s 3rd Congressional District Republican Jeffrey Hurd won election to a U.S. House seat representing Colorado on Thursday, maintaining Republican control of the 3rd District seat now represented by GOP Rep. Lauren Boebert. Boebert, who nearly lost her seat to Democrat Adam Frisch in 2022, decided this year to run for former Republican Rep. Ken Buck’s vacant seat in territory that’s even friendlier to Republicans. The victory by Hurd, an attorney seen as a moderate alternative to Boebert, marked the second loss in a row for Frisch, a former City Council member from Aspen, who campaigned as a pragmatic businessman. The Associated Press declared Hurd the winner at 12:10 p.m. EST. Democrat Dina Titus wins reelection to US House in Nevada’s 1st Congressional District Democratic Rep. Dina Titus won reelection to a U.S. House seat representing Nevada on Thursday. The Las Vegas district picked up Republican-leaning suburban areas after redistricting, turning it into a target for the GOP. But for the second election in a row, Titus defeated Republican Mark Robertson, a retired Army colonel. She has served seven terms in Congress. The Associated Press declared Titus the winner at 12:04 p.m. EST. House Democratic leader says ‘we must count every vote’ in the tight race for House control Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, the House Democratic leader, issued a statement Thursday thanking the Harris-Walz campaign for running 'an inspired and positive campaign focused on lifting people up.' But the New York lawmaker issued caution on the status of the House races, saying 'we must count every vote' in outstanding states like Arizona and California. 'I am proud that the Democratic Party does not believe in election denial,' Jeffries said. 'Our Democracy is precious and it involves elevating public trust in our system of free and fair elections, not undermining it.' He also quoted President Joe Biden, adding 'We cannot love America only when we win.' Wisconsin Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin pledges to work with Trump and calls for less division Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin pledged during her reelection victory speech Thursday to work with President-elect Donald Trump when possible, but she also vowed to fight him to protect the national health care law and abortion rights. Baldwin narrowly won reelection to a third term over Republican businessman Eric Hovde, who was endorsed by Trump. Hovde has yet to concede in a race where the margin is so close he could seek a recount. 'We deserve a politics with less vitriol, less division, less hatred and fewer lies. Actually, no lies,' Baldwin said to a room of supporters at a steamfitters union training center. Baldwin defeated Hovde by just under 29,000 votes, a margin of 0.9%, based on unofficial results. State law allows for the race losers within 1 percentage point of the winner to seek a recount, but Hovde hasn’t yet said whether he’ll do that. Hovde’s campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday. ▶ Read more about Wisconsin’s Senate race Biden delivers remarks following Trump's victory over Harris President Joe Biden delivered remarks to the nation Thursday in what was his first appearance on camera following Donald Trump’s decisive victory over Kamala Harris. 'In a democracy, the will of the people always prevails,' he said near the beginning. Biden said he had spoken with Trump and assured him that he would direct his administration to ensure a 'peaceful and orderly transition,' because that’s what the people deserve. Biden was subtly nodding to how Trump, in 2020, refused to accept he lost the election. Trump was reelected this week. Biden spoke from the Rose Garden at the White House after Democrat Kamala Harris lost this week to Donald Trump, speaking to his supporters and Americans. The president reiterated that the U.S. election system 'is honest, it is fair, and it is transparent. And it can be trusted, win or lose.' He closed by saying that defeat doesn't mean one is defeated. 'America endures,' he said. 'We’re going to be ok, but we need to stay engaged.' Democrat Val Hoyle wins reelection to US House in Oregon’s 4th Congressional District Democratic Rep. Val Hoyle won reelection to a U.S. House seat representing Oregon on Thursday. Hoyle, a first-term congresswoman, defeated Republican Monique DeSpain, an Air Force veteran. Hoyle succeeded longtime Democratic U.S. Rep. Peter DeFazio in 2022. The 4th District runs along the western portion of the state and includes Eugene. The Associated Press declared Hoyle the winner at 10:38 a.m. EST. Independent Angus King wins reelection to the US Senate from Maine Independent Sen. Angus King won a third term in the U.S. Senate representing Maine on Thursday, turning back challenges from a former Republican state party chair and a Democratic environmental activist. The 80-year-old former governor would be the oldest senator from Maine to serve if he completes his term, which ends in 2030, but he wasn't dogged by questions about his age like President Joe Biden, the former Democratic presidential nominee. King caucuses with Democrats and was first elected to the Senate in 2012. The Associated Press declared King the winner at 10:14 a.m. EST. Here’s how 5 key demographic groups voted in 2024 Donald Trump won the presidency after holding tight to his core base of voters and slightly expanding his coalition to include several groups that have traditionally been part of the Democratic base. That finding comes from AP VoteCast, a sweeping survey of more than 120,000 voters nationwide that shows what issues mattered to voters in this election. Trump picked up a small but significant share of Black and Hispanic voters and made narrow gains with men and women. As Trump chipped away at parts of the Democratic coalition, Vice President Kamala Harris wasn’t able to make enough of her own gains. Trump succeeded in locking down his traditionally older, white base of voters, and he slightly expanded his margins with other groups into a winning coalition. ▶ Read more about how five key demographic groups voted Many European leaders at summit stress the need for defense self-reliance in wake of Trump’s reelection Around 50 European leaders on Thursday called for a stronger defense posture across the continent that no longer necessitates a fundamental dependence on Washington as they gave a guarded welcome to U.S. President-elect Donald Trump. The European Political Community summit on Thursday in Hungary’s capital of Budapest reassessed trans-Atlantic relations in the hope that Trump’s second U.S. presidency will avoid the strife of his first administration. 'He was elected by the American people. He will defend the American interests,' French President Emmanuel Macron told the other leaders, adding that it was not the role of European Union leaders to 'comment on the election ... to wonder if it is good or not.' 'The question is whether we are willing to defend the European interest. It is the only question. It is our priority,' Macron said. There are concerns, too, that the robust military aid Ukraine has enjoyed under President Joe Biden will be cut under Trump, particularly if Republicans take control of the House. ▶ Read more about how European leaders are responding to Trump’s election Feds set to cut interest rates again amid post-election uncertainty Federal Reserve officials are poised Thursday to reduce their key interest rate for a second straight time, responding to a steady slowdown of inflation pressures that exasperated many Americans and contributed to Donald Trump’s presidential election victory. Yet the Fed’s future moves are now more uncertain in the aftermath of the election, given that Trump’s economic proposals have been widely flagged as potentially inflationary. His election has also raised the specter of meddling by the White House in the Fed’s policy decisions, with Trump having proclaimed that as president he should have a voice in the central bank’s interest rate decisions. The Fed has long guarded its status as an independent institution able to make difficult decisions about borrowing rates, free from political interference. Yet during his previous term in the White House, Trump publicly attacked Chair Jerome Powell after the Fed raised rates to fight inflation, and he may do so again. ▶ Read more about interest rate cuts FACT FOCUS: A multimillion-vote gap between 2020 and 2024 fuels false election narratives Less than 24 hours after Donald Trump was elected the 47th president of the United States, social media users began pushing two conflicting narratives to suggest election fraud, one that revived false claims by Trump that the 2020 vote was stolen from him and the other questioning how Vice President Kamala Harris could have received so many fewer votes in 2024 than President Joe Biden in 2020. Both narratives hinge on a supposed 20 million vote gap between Harris and Biden. Here’s a closer look at the facts. CLAIM: President Joe Biden won approximately 20 million more votes in the 2020 election than Vice President Kamala Harris earned in the 2024 race, proving either that Trump has cheated his way to a second term or that there was widespread fraud four years ago. THE FACTS: The claims are unfounded. Votes from Tuesday’s presidential election are still being counted, so any comparison with previous races would not be accurate. In addition, election officials and agencies monitoring the vote have reported no significant issues with Tuesday’s election. Claims of widespread fraud in 2020 have been debunked countless times. ▶ Read more on this fact focus Trump’s return elicits both worry and hope among Iranians Iranians, like many around the world, are divided on what Donald Trump’s next presidency will bring: Some foresee an all-out war between Tehran and Washington, particularly as other conflicts rage in the region. Others hold out hope that America’s 47th president might engage in unexpected diplomacy as he did with North Korea. But nearly all believe something will change in the U.S.-Iran relationship. And while Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has final say on all matters of state, has repeatedly expressed his own disgust with Trump, Iran’s new reformist president has kept the door open to talks with Trump to seek relief from international sanctions to buoy a cratering economy. The Iranian rial, in a free fall for years, hit its lowest value against the dollar on Wednesday before slightly recovering. ▶ Read more about the response in Iran to Trump’s election win What could US diplomacy look like under Trump?

Bernie Sanders did not mince words in a scathing statement Wednesday. 'It should come as no great surprise that a Democratic Party which has abandoned working class people would find that the working class has abandoned them,' Sanders, Vermont’s senior senator, said. 'First, it was the white working class, and now it is Latino and Black workers as well,' Sanders said. Sanders won reelection to a fourth term on Tuesday. He singled out wealth inequality, a slipping standard of living in the U.S., a lack of full health care guarantees and support for Israel’s recent military campaigns as problems Democrats need to focus on. Sanders’s 2016 presidential run was a key factor in pushing the dialogue in the Democratic party to the left. Sanders has built his political career outside — and often criticizing — the Democratic Party, but he caucuses with Democrats in the Senate. Vatican No. 2: Holy See hopes Trump will help end the wars in Ukraine and Gaza 'At the start of his mandate, we wish him much wisdom because this is the main virtue of rulers according to the Bible,' Cardinal Pietro Parolin said, speaking on the sidelines of a Rome conference on Thursday, according to Vatican News. While acknowledging no one had a 'magic wand' to end wars in Ukraine and Gaza, Parolin said the Holy See hoped Trump 'can indeed be an element of détente and pacification in the current conflicts that are bleeding the world.' Parolin also said he hoped Trump would work to end polarization in the U.S., including over abortion. On migration, he recalled Pope Francis’ call to welcome those fleeing wars, poverty and climate change. After visiting the U.S.-Mexico border in 2016 and asked about Trump’s call to build a wall, Francis famously said anyone who builds a wall to keep out migrants was 'not Christian.' More recently, Francis recommended U.S. voters choose the 'lesser evil' when asked how a U.S. Catholic should vote given Trump’s pledge to deport migrants and Vice President Kamala Harris’ support of abortion rights. The Dalai Lama congratulates Trump on his election win 'I have long admired the United States of America as the champion of democracy, freedom and the rule of law,' the Tibetan spiritual leader said in a message to Trump from the northern Indian town of Dharamshala where he has lived in exile since fleeing Tibet in 1959. 'The Tibetan people and I have been honored to have received the support of respective U.S. Presidents and the American people, in our endeavor to protect and preserve our ancient Buddhist culture — a culture of peace, non-violence and compassion that has the potential to benefit humanity as a whole,' he said. Turkey’s president spoke with Trump late on Wednesday Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan conveyed his hopes in a call for strengthened cooperation between their two countries during Trump’s new term in office, according to a statement from the Turkish president’s office. Trump’s presidential transition starts now. Here’s how it will work Trump’s impending return to the White House means he’ll want to stand up an entirely new administration from the one that served under President Joe Biden. His team is also pledging that the second won’t look much like the first one Trump established after his 2016 victory. The president-elect now has a 75-day transition period to build out his team before Inauguration Day arrives on Jan. 20. One top item on the to-do list: filling around 4,000 government positions with political appointees, people who are specifically tapped for their jobs by Trump’s team. That includes everyone from the secretary of state and other heads of Cabinet departments to those selected to serve part-time on boards and commissions. Around 1,200 of those presidential appointments require Senate confirmation, which should be easier with the Senate now shifting to Republican control. ▶ Read more about Trump’s transition Neither party has a dominant pathway to House majority The House contests remain a tit-for-tat fight to the finish, with no dominant pathway to the majority for either party. Rarely, if ever, have the two chambers of Congress flipped in opposite directions. Each side is gaining and losing a few seats, including through the redistricting process, which is the routine redrawing of House seat boundary lines. The process reset seats in North Carolina, Louisiana and Alabama. Much of the outcome hinges on the West, particularly in California, where a handful of House seats are being fiercely contested, and mail-in ballots arriving a week after the election will still be counted. Hard-fought races around the 'blue dot' in Omaha, Nebraska and in far-flung Alaska are among those being watched. Updates on the last two presidential races left to be called With a win in Wisconsin early Wednesday, Trump cleared the 270 electoral votes needed to clinch the presidency. But his exact margin of victory is still unclear — there are two presidential races that the AP has yet to call: Arizona: Officials in Arizona’s Maricopa County said late Wednesday they’ve got more than 700,000 ballots left to count, which means the races for president and senate were too early to call. In all, AP estimates there are at least a million ballots to be added to the results in Arizona. County election officials are expected to firm up those numbers on Thursday. Nevada: AP estimated late Wednesday evening that there are more than 200,000 ballots left to count in Nevada — including more than 130,000 in Clark County. Given the narrow margins in the races for president and U.S. Senate, both are too early to call. The AP will further review results released by Nevada election officials on Thursday.

Control of the US House hangs in the balance with enormous implications for Trump’s agenda The U.S. House majority hung in the balance Wednesday, teetering between Republican control that would usher in a new era of unified GOP governance in Washington or a flip to Democrats as a last line of resistance to a Trump second-term White House agenda. A few individual seats, or even a single one, will determine the outcome. Final tallies will take a while, likely pushing the decision into next week — or beyond. After Republicans swept into the majority in the U.S. Senate by picking up seats in West Virginia, Ohio and Montana, House Speaker Mike Johnson predicted his chamber would fall in line next.

Italy opens procedure against China's Sinochem for possible breach of Pirelli governance	MILAN (AP) — Italy has opened an administrative procedure against China’s Sinochem, the largest shareholder in Italian tiremaker Pirelli, for a possible breach of restrictions designed to protect national strategic assets. Pirelli announced Wednesday that the procedure was launched under the so-called 'golden power' provisions, which include restrictions to the access of some information and higher vote thresholds for strategic decisions, invoked by the Rome government in mid-2023. Pirelli said Sinochem, which controls a 37% stake in the company, has denied any violations of the restrictions, adding the Italian government had 120 days to issue a finding. In announcing the golden power provision, the government cited the sensitivity of sensors implanted in tires that can collect data such as road layouts, geolocation and the state of infrastructure, making it of a 'critical technology of national strategic importance.' The tiremaker’s second-largest investor is Camfin, the investment vehicle of Pirelli’s former CEO and current executive vice-chairman Marco Tronchetti Provera, which holds a 32.4% stake.	https://apnews.com/article/italy-golden-power-china-pirelli-sinochem-67a3276b8e391fe0c7903ae8ea9cbc8b	2024-11-07T02:46:23-08:00	
An 8-hour Russian drone barrage keeps Kyiv on edge as the war in Ukraine nears 1,000 days	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Dozens of Russian drones targeted the Ukrainian capital Kyiv in a nighttime attack that lasted eight hours, authorities said Thursday, as Russia kept up its relentless pounding of Ukraine after almost 1,000 days of war. Russian forces fired lone drones and swarms of drones that entered Ukrainian airspace from various directions and at a variety of altitudes, officials said, in an apparent attempt to stretch air defense systems and unnerve city residents. Ukrainian air defenses 'neutralized' three dozen drones, but falling debris caused damage to a hospital and residential and office buildings in the capital, local authorities said, including a blaze on the 33rd floor of an apartment building. At least two people were reported injured. Drone attacks on Kyiv have recently been occurring almost daily, with the nighttime explosions and the continuous buzzing sound of drones keeping the city on edge. Russia is deploying about 10 times more Iranian-made Shahed drones than it was this time last year, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said earlier this week. Ukraine’s forces are struggling to match the might of Russia’s military, which is much bigger and better equipped. Western support is crucial for Ukraine to sustain the costly war of attrition. The uncertainty over how long that aid will continue has deepened, however, with the election of Donald Trump as the next president of the United States. He has repeatedly taken issue with U.S. aid to Ukraine. Russia, meanwhile, is trying to grind down Ukraine’s appetite for the fight and sap the West’s support for Kyiv by drawing out the conflict. The Russian barrages mostly involve Shahed drones. They are suited to terrorizing civilians, according to Andrii Kovalenko, head of the state Center for Countering Disinformation. Russia is aiming to save and stockpile its missiles, which are much more powerful than drones, Kovalenko claimed Thursday. Russia has used missiles effectively in its campaign to knock out Ukraine’s power grid. Also, the drone attacks gradually wear down Ukraine’s air defenses, making it more vulnerable to future missile launches. Power outages were reported in the Zhytomyr region, which borders Kyiv to the west, following a Russian attack there, according to the energy company Zhytomyroblenergo. Another Russian drone attack injured one person in the southern city of Odesa, regional Gov. Oleh Kiper said, as drone debris damaged an 11-story residential building. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-drones-kyiv-attack-0160dee7ea700d4c561c8735710918d8	2024-11-07T01:15:16-08:00	
50 European leaders assess how Trump will affect their fortunes and seek a common stance on Russia	BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) — Around 50 European leaders, including Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte, were reassessing their trans-Atlantic relations at a summit Thursday in the hope that Donald Trump's second U.S. presidency will avoid the strife of his first administration. European officials will also be seeking a strong common stance on Russia at the one-day gathering. Rutte, who was Dutch prime minister during Trump's first 2017-2021 presidency, said that 'I worked with him very well for four years. He is extremely clear about what he wants. He understands that you have to deal with each other to come to joint positions. And I think we can do that.' And he insisted that the common challenges posed by Russia in Ukraine affected both sides of the Atlantic. 'Russia is delivering the latest technology into North Korea in return for North Korean help with the war against Ukraine. And this is a threat not only to the European part of NATO, but also to the U.S. mainland,' Rutte said coming into the summit. Trump strongly pushed the European NATO allies to spend more on defense during his first presidency, to up and beyond 2% of gross domestic product and to be less reliant on U.S. military cover. That point has totally sunk in. 'When he was president, he was the one in NATO who stimulated us to move over the 2%. And now, also thanks to him, NATO, if you take out the numbers of the U.S., is above the 2%.,' Rutte said. Charles Michel, the council president of the 27-nation European Union, agreed that the continent needed to become less reliant on the United States. 'We have to be more masters of our destiny,' he said. 'Not because of Donald Trump or Kamala Harris, but because of our children.' During his election campaign, Trump has threatened anything from a trade war with Europe to a withdrawal of NATO commitments and a fundamental shift of support for Ukraine in its war with Russia — all issues that could have groundbreaking consequences for nations across Europe. Trump has said he would end the war in Ukraine, now well into its third year, within days of being reelected. Ukraine and many of its European backers fear that this means a peace on terms favorable to Russian President Vladimir Putin and involving the surrender of territory. European allies in NATO hope to convince Trump that if he helps to negotiate any peace, it should be done from a position of strength, for both Ukraine and the United States. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, the summit’s host and an ardent Trump fan, said early Thursday that he already had a phone call with the incoming president overnight, announcing that 'We have big plans for the future!' So did hard-right Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, who lauded the 'deep and historic strategic partnership that has always tied Rome and Washington.' That partnership came under constant pressure during Trump’s first term, from 2017-2021. Trump’s administration slapped tariffs on EU steel and aluminum in 2018, based on the claim that foreign products, even if produced by American allies, were a threat to U.S. national security. Europeans and other allies retaliated with duties on U.S.-made motorcycles, bourbon, peanut butter and jeans, among other items. The impact of the U.S. election result could be felt in Europe for years to come, on issues including the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East, as well as migration and climate change. Among the leaders, Zelenskyy, who is expected to make another plea for more aid as his country fends off Moscow’s invasion. The timing is laden with significance as Trump has vowed to end the war 'within 24 hours' of being elected — something leaders in Kyiv interpret as an impending evaporation of U.S. support following Trump's win. Further compounding an already complicated situation, Germany — Europe’s troubled economic juggernaut — sank into political crisis after German Chancellor Olaf Scholz fired his finance minister. It raises the specter of an election in a few months and yet another standoff between the emboldened hard right and the establishment parties in Europe. Those two combined 'adds even more pepper and salt to this situation,' Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said. ___ Lorne Cook contributed to this report from Brussels.	https://apnews.com/article/eu-summit-trump-ukraine-elections-germany-2b11d3dc3eedebe7f37d6c4c4d9792f8	2024-11-07T00:51:51-08:00	
South Korea's president denies wrongdoing in a growing scandal	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol denied wrongdoing Thursday in a burgeoning influence-peddling scandal involving him and his wife that’s severely hurting his approval ratings and providing political munition to his rivals. The political firestorm coincides with South Korea facing a slew of critical foreign policy issues, such as Donald Trump’s election win to become the next president of the United States and North Korea’s reported entry into the Russia-Ukraine war. The scandal centers around allegations that Yoon and first lady Kim Keon Hee exerted inappropriate influence on the conservative ruling People Power Party to pick a certain candidate to run for a parliamentary by-election in 2022 at the request of Myung Tae-kyun, an election broker and founder of a polling agency who conducted free opinion surveys for Yoon before he became president. For weeks, the scandal has been making headlines in South Korea as Myung's leaked phone conversations show he boasted of his influence over the presidential couple and other top ruling party officials. Asked about his ties with Myung during a press conference Thursday, Yoon said, 'I didn’t do anything inappropriate and have nothing to hide regarding Myung Tae-kyun.' Yoon said he has never meddled in any candidate nomination processes at the PPP, and had never asked Myung to carry out surveys for him, though he acknowledged that Myung gave him some sort of help during his presidential primary campaign in 2021. The main liberal opposition Democratic Party said Yoon's response only showed his 'arrogance' and 'self-righteousness.' The party earlier demanded Yoon apologize, reshuffle top officials and accept an independent investigation into his wife. The Democratic Party recently shared what it said was an audio file of phone calls between Yoon and Myung on May 9, 2022 — a day before Yoon took office for a single five-year term. The opposition party alleges that the conversation proves Yoon provided Myung with political favors in return for free surveys. In the audio file, Yoon can be heard telling Myung that he asked a PPP committee to pick senior party member Kim Young-sun to run for one of the parliamentary by-elections the following month. Kim Young-sun eventually obtained the party’s nomination and won the election. In the file, Myung is heard saying, 'I really won’t forget this favor for my entire life. Thank you!' South Korea’s election law bars public servants, including the president, from interfering in elections, but applies no such restrictions to a president-elect, so it's unclear whether Yoon violated the law. Recent surveys showed Yoon's approval rating fell below 20% for the first time since his inauguration. Kim Keon Hee has been grappling with other scandals, such as spy camera footage purportedly showing her accepting a luxury bag as a gift from a pastor. Yoon apologized for causing public concerns about him and his wife, but stressed that many of the allegations raised were not consistent with the facts. Some ruling party lawmakers have accused the Democratic Party of deliberately ramping up political attacks on Yoon and his wife in an effort to rescue its embattled leader, Lee Jae-myung, from legal troubles. Lee, a firebrand lawmaker who narrowly lost to Yoon in the 2022 presidential election, is undergoing four separate trials over corruption and various other allegations. The first two district court rulings on Lee over his election law violation and perjury charges are set for Nov. 15 and Nov. 25. Either a prison sentence or a fine of more than 1 million won ($750) in the election law case would unseat Lee as a lawmaker and disqualify him from running in elections for five years, although he is likely to appeal any guilty verdict. Surveys show Lee is the early favorite for the 2027 presidential race to succeed Yoon. On foreign policy, Yoon — who has worked closely with Washington and Tokyo to solidify security cooperation in the face of North Korean threats — expressed optimism that the three-way partnership will continue to expand under Trump’s government. He said he wants to meet Trump and new Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba soon to coordinate policies. During his previous presidency, Trump engaged in highly orchestrated nuclear summits with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Yoon noted that North Korea’s arsenal has significantly advanced since Trump’s diplomacy with Kim collapsed in 2019. Yoon said Trump 'will be receiving comprehensive reports very soon about how North Korea’s nuclear technologies and capabilities have changed since then.' 'After he receives these reports, I think we can have more meaningful and in-depth discussions when we have the opportunity to meet,' Yoon said. When asked about concerns that Trump’s 'America first' approach would damage South Korean interests in trade through increased tariffs and other measures, Yoon said Seoul was making 'multifaceted efforts to minimize the losses to our people’s economy.' 'Things can’t be exactly the same as they were during the Biden administration,' he said, 'but we have been preparing to hedge these risks for a long time.' Earlier Thursday, Yoon had a telephone call with Trump, congratulating him on his election win and discussing strengthening bilateral cooperation. The two agreed to arrange an in-person meeting soon, according to Yoon’s office. Prospects for South Korea-U.S. relations under Trump 'could depend on whether Yoon is able to strike up positive chemistry with Trump immediately during the transition and foster a close personal friendship to convince him to want to support advance Seoul’s interests,' said Duyeon Kim, a senior analyst at the Center for a New American Security in Washington. 'This might be the only way to avert devastating consequences and surprises in the alliance relationship — including South Korean questions about Washington’s defense commitment — that we currently assume would happen based on Trump’s harsh rhetoric against allies and transactional style,' she said.	https://apnews.com/article/south-korea-yoon-wife-scandal-ba065a2f07d5fc4a63fe0e4d36de12f6	2024-11-06T22:55:25-08:00	
A tiny grain of nuclear fuel is pulled from ruined Japanese nuclear plant, in a step toward cleanup	TOKYO (AP) — A robot that has spent months inside the ruins of a nuclear reactor at the tsunami-hit Fukushima Daiichi plant delivered a tiny sample of melted nuclear fuel on Thursday, in what plant officials said was a step toward beginning the cleanup of hundreds of tons of melted fuel debris. The sample, the size of a grain of rice, was placed into a secure container, marking the end of the mission, according to Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings, which manages the plant. It is being transported to a glove box for size and weight measurements before being sent to outside laboratories for detailed analyses over the coming months. Plant chief Akira Ono has said it will provide key data to plan a decommissioning strategy, develop necessary technology and robots and learn how the accident had developed. Despite multiple probes in the years since the 2011 disaster that wrecked the plant and forced thousands of nearby residents to leave their homes, much about the site's highly radioactive interior remains a mystery. The sample, the first to be retrieved from inside a reactor, was significantly less radioactive than expected. Officials had been concerned that it might be too radioactive to be safely tested even with heavy protective gear, and set an upper limit for removal out of the reactor. The sample came in well under the limit. That's led some to question whether the robot extracted the nuclear fuel it was looking for from an area in which previous probes have detected much higher levels of radioactive contamination, but TEPCO officials insist they believe the sample is melted fuel. The extendable robot, nicknamed Telesco, first began its mission August with a plan for a two-week round trip, after previous missions had been delayed since 2021. But progress was suspended twice due to mishaps — the first involving an assembly error that took nearly three weeks to fix, and the second a camera failure. On Oct. 30, it clipped a sample weighting less than 3 grams (.01 ounces) from the surface of a mound of melted fuel debris sitting on the bottom of the primary containment vessel of the Unit 2 reactor, TEPCO said. Three days later, the robot returned to an enclosed container, as workers in full hazmat gear slowly pulled it out. On Thursday, the gravel, whose radioactivity earlier this week recorded far below the upper limit set for its environmental and health safety, was placed into a safe container for removal out of the compartment. The sample return marks the first time the melted fuel is retrieved out of the containment vessel. Fukushima Daiichi lost its key cooling systems during a 2011 earthquake and tsunami, causing meltdowns in its three reactors. An estimated 880 tons of fatally radioactive melted fuel remains in them. The government and TEPCO have set a 30-to-40-year target to finish the cleanup by 2051, which experts say is overly optimistic and should be updated. Some say it would take for a century or longer. No specific plans for the full removal of the fuel debris or its final disposal have been decided.	https://apnews.com/article/japan-nuclear-fukushima-sample-robot-decommissioning-b7dd956a86401b39f04ae839f768d29f	2024-11-06T22:50:51-08:00	
Germany's coalition collapses dramatically. Scholz plans to lead with a minority government	BERLIN (AP) — Germany’s government coalition has collapsed in dramatic fashion after Chancellor Olaf Scholz fired Finance Minister Christian Lindner of the pro-business Free Democrats in a late-night move following a marathon of crisis meetings. The three remaining ministers of the Free Democrats resigned in response, leading to the downfall of the government coalition. Scholz is expected to lead the country with a minority government, but the opposition is calling for an immediate no-confidence vote. But early Thursday, Transport Minister Volker Wissing from the Free Democrats unexpectedly took back last night's resignation and told reporters that after talking to Scholz, he had decided to stay on as minister and leave the party instead. Lindner will receive his certificate of dismissal from President Frank-Walter Steinmeier on Thursday afternoon and, to ensure a smooth transition, a successor will likely be named right after. German news agency dpa reported that Jörg Kukies, an economic adviser to Scholz, will become the next finance minister. The posts of the research and justice ministers who resigned may also be filled Thursday, dpa reported. Scholz announced late Wednesday that he would seek a vote of confidence on Jan. 15 that he said might lead to an early election as soon as March — which otherwise would have been be due next September. Scholz had accused Lindner of breaching his trust and publicly calling for a fundamentally different economic policy, including what the chancellor said would be tax cuts worth billions for a few top earners while at the same time cutting pensions for all retirees. 'That is not decent,' Scholz said. Scholz's left-leaning Social Democrats will now effectively lead a minority government with the remaining coalition partner, the environmentalist Greens. The chancellor announced late Wednesday that he would reach out to the leader of the biggest opposition leader in parliament, Friedrich Merz from the center-right Christian Democrats, to confer on possible ways of strengthening the economy and defense, and passing important legislation through parliament. But Merz on Thursday vehemently rejected Scholz's plan to wait to hold a vote of confidence until January. 'The coalition no longer has a majority in the German Bundestag, and we therefore call on the chancellor (...) to call a vote of confidence immediately, or at the latest by the beginning of next week.' 'We simply cannot afford to have a government without a majority in Germany for several months now, and then campaign for several more months, and then possibly conduct coalition negotiations for several weeks,' Merz added. He said he was planning to meet with Scholz later Thursday to push for a quick vote of confidence. Since Scholz's government doesn't have a majority in parliament any longer, he would likely lose the vote. In that scenario, Germany's president could dissolve parliament within 21 days and an early election could then be held as soon as January. 'During these 21 days, we will have enough time to find out whether there are any issues that we may have to decide on together,' Merz said, offering his party's cooperation with the minority government. 'We are, of course, prepared to hold talks (..) we are also prepared to take responsibility for our country.' Indeed, pushing through new legislation and plugging the billion-euro hole in the 2025 budget won’t become easier for Scholz’s Social Democrats and the Greens as their government no longer has a majority in parliament. But Scholz has said his government needed that time to pass important legislation. Achim Wambach from the Leibniz Center for European Economic Research cast doubt that a prolonged period with a minority government would help Germany's economy get back on track. 'Germany’s problems are too big to tolerate political gridlock,' the analyst said. 'The government set out to reconcile the transformation towards climate neutrality with economic growth and social security,' the analyst said in a statement. 'It has not lived up to this claim. The economy is stagnating and investments are failing to materialize.' 'This daunting task was compounded by geo-economic tensions: wars in Europe and the Middle East as well as economically damaging interventions through tariffs and national subsidy policies,' he added. ' The election of Donald Trump has exacerbated these problems. Europe must do more for its security and will have to reckon with increased tariffs.' The collapse of the coalition came after weeks of disputes among the coalition partners over ways to boost the country’s ailing economy. Lindner's pro-business Free Democrats had rejected tax increases or changes to Germany’s strict self-imposed limits on running up debt. Scholz’s Social Democrats and the Greens wanted to see major state investment and rejected the Free Democrats’ proposals to cut welfare programs.	https://apnews.com/article/germany-scholz-government-coalition-collapse-struggling-economy-ca3ebd538bc0e71af272aa7f65b12c19	2024-11-06T22:28:58-08:00	
A new law allows Israel to deport the relatives of attackers. Experts expect it to be struck down	JERUSALEM (AP) — Israel’s parliament passed a law early Thursday that would allow it to deport family members of Palestinian attackers, including the country’s own citizens, to the war-ravaged Gaza Strip or other locations. The law, which was championed by members of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud party and his far-right allies, passed with a 61-41 vote. But legal experts said that any attempt to implement it would likely lead to it being struck down by Israeli courts. It would apply to Palestinian citizens of Israel and residents of annexed east Jerusalem who knew about their family members' attacks beforehand or who 'express support or identification with the act of terrorism.' They would be deported, either to the Gaza Strip or another location, for a period of seven to 20 years. The Israel-Hamas war is still raging in Gaza, where tens of thousands have been killed and most of the population has been internally displaced, often multiple times. It was unclear if it would apply in the occupied West Bank, where Israel already has a long-standing policy of demolishing the family homes of attackers. Palestinians have carried out scores of stabbing, shooting and car-ramming attacks against Israelis in recent years. Oded Feller, a legal adviser to the Association for Civil Rights in Israel, dismissed the law as 'populist nonsense.' He said it was unlikely to be applied, because there is no legal way for the Interior Ministry to send an Israeli citizen to another country or to Gaza. His organization doesn't plan to challenge the law unless authorities try to enforce it, in which case he expects any court challenge to succeed. Eran Shamir-Borer, a senior researcher at the Israel Democracy Institute and a former international law expert for the Israeli military, agreed that the law was likely to be struck down by the Supreme Court. 'The bottom line is this is completely nonconstitutional and a clear conflict to Israel’s core values,' Shamir-Borer said. Israel captured Gaza, the West Bank and east Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East war — territories the Palestinians want for their future state. It withdrew settlers and soldiers from Gaza in 2005, but has reoccupied parts of the territory since Hamas' attack on Oct. 7, 2023 triggered the war. Israel annexed east Jerusalem in a move not recognized by most of the international community. Palestinians there have permanent residency and are allowed to apply for citizenship, but most choose not to, and those who do face a series of obstacles. Palestinians living in Israel make up around 20% of the country's population. They have citizenship and the right to vote but face widespread discrimination. Many also have close family ties to those in the territories and most sympathize with the Palestinian cause. ___ Melanie Lidman reported from Tel Aviv, Israel.

Middle East latest: Large airstrikes hit Beirut suburbs as Israel expands northern Gaza operations	Several large airstrikes hit Beirut’s southern suburbs early Thursday, including one on a site adjacent to Lebanon’s only international airport. The Israeli military had issued an evacuation notice for the site, saying Hezbollah facilities were there, without giving more details. Also Thursday, the Israeli military announced it expanded its month-old ground operation in northern Gaza to include part of Beit Lahiya, a town that has been heavily bombed since the earliest days of the war and where Israel says Hamas militants have regrouped. Hezbollah leader Naim Kassem said in a speech aired Wednesday that the Lebanese militant group is open for cease-fire negotiations only once 'the enemy stops its aggression.' His speech marked the 40-day mourning period since former Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah was assassinated in Beirut. Hezbollah began firing into Israel on Oct. 8, 2023, in solidarity with Hamas in the Gaza Strip. Since the conflict erupted, more than 3,100 people have been killed and some 13,800 wounded in Lebanon, the health ministry reported. The Israel-Hamas war began after Palestinian militants stormed into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people — mostly civilians — and abducting 250 others. Israel's military response in Gaza has killed more than 43,000 people, Palestinian health officials say. They do not distinguish between civilians and combatants, but say more than half of those killed were women and children. ___ Here’s the latest: Gallant has last official conversation with US defense secretary TEL AVIV, Israel — Israel’s outgoing defense minister, Yoav Gallant, says he has held his last official conversation with his U.S. counterpart. Gallant has developed a close relationship with Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin throughout the war, and the two men speak several times a week. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu this week fired Gallant after months of tensions and disagreements. Gallant, a former general, was replaced by a Netanyahu loyalist with little military experience. In a statement, Gallant said he thanked Austin for his 'partnership and deep commitment' to the countries’ defense ties. 'Our special bond must remain powerful and unshakeable.' 52 people killed in Lebanon in last day, health ministry reports BEIRUT — Lebanon’s health ministry says 52 people were killed and 161 wounded Wednesday, raising the total toll over the past year of conflict between Israel and Hezbollah to 3,102 killed and 13,819 wounded. One-quarter of them are women and children. Lebanon’s crisis response unit recorded 121 airstrikes and incidents of shelling Wednesday, mostly concentrated in southern Lebanon, Baalbek-Hermel province and the Nabatiyeh province. The health ministry said that over the past year, 2,230 men, 614 women and 192 children were killed. Some 1,145 centers — including educational complexes, vocational institutes, universities, and other institutions — are sheltering 190,740 people, including 45,189 families, displaced by the Israeli offensive in Lebanon, the report said. Among these shelters, 981 have reached full capacity. The fighting in Lebanon has driven 1.2 million people from their homes, including more than 400,000 children, according to the U.N. children’s agency. 14 killed at school-turned-shelter in Gaza City DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — Palestinian rescue workers say Israel struck a school-turned-shelter run by the United Nations in Gaza City, killing 14 people and wounding dozens of others. The Israeli military said the attack Thursday that the building was being used by Hamas to plan and execute attacks on Israel, without giving more details. The military said it took steps to mitigate the risk of harming civilians, including using precise munitions, aerial surveillance, and additional intelligence. In recent months Israel has conducted dozens of airstrikes on schools across the embattled enclave, structures where hundreds of thousands of Palestinians displaced by fighting have sought refuge. The Gaza-based Civil Defense emergency service reported rescuers recovering the bodies of 14 people in the rubble of the school building in Shati refugee camp, just west of Gaza City along the Mediterranean coast. The school had been operated by the U.N. Palestinian refugee agency known as UNRWA. Shortly after the strike, the Israeli army ordered the evacuation of Shati camp among other neighborhoods west of Gaza City, spreading panic among Palestinians who in recent days had sought refuge in those areas from Israel’s renewed offensive against Hamas militants further north. Since the yearlong Israel-Hamas war began, schools in Gaza have been closed and served as shelters for Palestinians fleeing the fighting. Israeli military to allow 300 truckloads of aid from UAE into Gaza JERUSALEM — The Israeli military says it will allow 300 truckloads of humanitarian aid supplied by the United Arab Emirates to enter the Gaza Strip in the coming days. That’s less than the 350 trucks per day that the United States has said it wants to see enter the war-ravaged territory. COGAT, the military body in charge of civilian affairs in Gaza, said the aid was brought in by sea and unloaded at the Israeli port of Ashdod, just north of Gaza. It said the shipment, which includes food, water, medical equipment, shelter and hygiene supplies, would be inspected before being trucked into Gaza, though it did not specify a date. The amount of aid entering Gaza dropped dramatically in October as Israel launched another offensive in the territory’s north. By the end of October, an average of just 71 trucks a day were entering Gaza, according to the latest U.N. figures. The United States has warned Israel to ramp up the entry of aid by mid-November, saying failure to do so could lead to a reduction in military support. Israel says it allows plenty of aid to enter Gaza and blames U.N. agencies and other aid groups for not distributing it. Humanitarian groups say their efforts are hobbled by Israeli restrictions, ongoing fighting and the breakdown of law and order. Dozens of Lebanese killed in struck apartment building are laid to rest TYRE, Lebanon — Dozens of Lebanese were laid to rest Thursday following an Israeli airstrike that hit an apartment building in the town of Barja, just north of the port city of Sidon. The Lebanese Civil Defense said it pulled at least 30 bodies and remains following Tuesday's strike. Among the killed were many members of the Basma family, who had fled deeper into southern Lebanon for safety. Family members who survived found shelter elsewhere or weren’t in the building at the time. 'My sister was killed last week, and now my brother, my nephew, and my other nephew with members of his family,' said Hassan Basma. Nearby, Khadija Daramsis, who washes the bodies of the dead before burial in accordance with Islamic tradition, found herself doing the same for her nieces. She had just seen them last week. 'They told me they were scared of the strikes and then they were struck,' Daramsis said as she wept. 'What did they have to do with anything? Are they resistance? Are they Hezbollah?' Israel says its strikes target Hezbollah militants or the group’s assets. The strike in Barja came without warning. Khalil Basma says the war and Israel’s military escalation is the worst he’s seen in Lebanon. 'Knowing the wars we have gone through, this is regretfully the first time we see such crimes,' he said. 'May God protect everyone and end this crisis.' Israeli drone strike kills 3 in southern Lebanon city of Sidon, Lebanese state media says BEIRUT — Lebanon’s state news agency says an Israeli drone strike has hit a car at an army checkpoint in the southern port city of Sidon, killing three people and wounding several others including U.N. peacekeepers. The National News Agency said one of the wounded was taken to the hospital while the peacekeepers were treated for minor injuries at the scene of the attack at the northern entrance of Sidon, Lebanon’s third-largest city. The U.N. peacekeeping force known as UNIFIL said in a statement that a convoy bringing newly-arrived peacekeepers to south Lebanon was passing by when a drone strike took place near it. The strike lightly injured five peacekeepers, it said. 'We remind all actors of their obligation to avoid actions putting peacekeepers or civilians in danger. Differences should be resolved at the negotiating table, not through violence,' the statement said. A drone strike earlier Thursday hit a car on a main highway just outside Beirut, killing one woman, according to local media. French diplomat urges diplomatic solution PARIS — France’s top diplomat has urged action in the coming weeks toward a political solution to the wars in the Mideast. Visiting Israel, French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot said Thursday that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has ″never hid his wish to end the interminable wars in the Middle East.' 'So the conditions seem right to me to move in the coming weeks toward a diplomatic solution to the current conflict. Because force alone cannot suffice to guarantee Israel’s security,' Barrot said. Barrot called for a halt to Israel’s bombings of northern Gaza, saying they are contrary to Israel’s long-term interests. ″The Palestinian question will not disappear, regardless of what American administration is in office,″ Barrot told reporters. He also warned Iran against further escalation, and called for a diplomatic solution for Lebanon. He met his Israeli counterpart and heads next to the Palestinian territories for talks with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. Iran's Supreme Leader says militant groups against Israel remain strong TEHRAN, Iran -- Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei says its alliance of militant groups opposed to Israel remains strong despite the killing of many of their senior leaders. 'God willing, the world will see a day when the Zionist regime will be defeated by them,' Iranian state TV reported the leader as saying Thursday. The report quoted Khamenei as saying that Hamas and other 'leaders of the resistance' are 'still fighting' even though some of their leaders have been killed by intensified Israel airstrikes. Israeli strikes and military operations in recent months have killed the top leaders of both Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, as well as many of their senior commanders. Both groups are part of what is known as the Axis of Resistance, which includes other Iran-backed groups in Syria, Iraq and Yemen. Iran and its allies have repeatedly traded fire with Israel and the United States over the past year following Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack, raising fears of a regional war. Israel announces $5.2 billion fighter jet deal with Boeing JERUSALEM — Israel has reached an agreement to purchase 25 advanced F-15 fighter jets from U.S. aerospace giant Boeing for $5.2 billion. The Defense Ministry said the agreement, concluded Wednesday, was part of a broader aid package approved by the U.S. government earlier this year. Deliveries will begin in 2031, and there’s an option to purchase an additional 25 aircraft. The United States has provided crucial military support to Israel as it has battled Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon and traded fire with Iran. The Biden administration recently warned Israel that if it did not facilitate the delivery of more aid to Gaza, U.S. laws may force the administration to curb some of its military support. The State Department said this week that Israel had yet to sufficiently improve aid deliveries ahead of a mid-November deadline. President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to end the wars in the Middle East without saying how he plans to do it. He was a staunch supporter of Israel during his previous term but also cultivated close ties with Arab Gulf leaders. Israeli military extends shutdown of Al Jazeera's West Bank bureau RAMALLAH, West Bank — The Al Jazeera news network says the Israeli military has extended the order shutting down its bureau in the occupied West Bank. Walid al-Omari, the network’s bureau chief, said Israeli troops raided the office in Ramallah again early Thursday and posted a notice extending the closure for an additional 45 days. Israel had previously raided the office and shut it down on Sept. 22. Earlier this year, authorities took the rare step of barring the Qatar-based network from operating in Israel. Israel accuses Al Jazeera of serving as a mouthpiece for Hamas, an allegation denied by the network. Last month, Israel accused six Al Jazeera journalists in Gaza of being Palestinian militants, which the network also denied. Al-Jazeera has provided near 24-hour coverage from inside Gaza since the start of the Israel-Hamas war, with a heavy focus on the war’s toll among Palestinian civilians. Several of its correspondents have been killed or wounded by Israeli forces. It also routinely airs unedited Hamas videos showing attacks on Israeli forces and hostages speaking under duress. Israel passes law that would allow it to deport the families of Palestinian attackers, including citizens Israel’s parliament passed a law early Thursday that would allow it to deport family members of Palestinian attackers, including the country’s own citizens, to the war-ravaged Gaza Strip or other locations. The law, which was championed by members of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s Likud party and his far-right allies, passed with a 61-41 vote but is likely to be challenged in court. It would apply to Palestinian citizens of Israel and residents of annexed east Jerusalem who knew about their family members’ attacks beforehand or who 'express support or identification with the act of terrorism.'

Israel expands its ground operation in northern Gaza JERUSALEM — The Israeli military has expanded its month-old ground operation in northern Gaza to a town that has been heavily bombed since the earliest days of the war. The military said in a statement Thursday that 'troops started to operate' in the area of Beit Lahiya after intelligence indicated the presence of militants there. Hamas has repeatedly regrouped in areas where the military already conducted major operations. The town in the northwestern corner of Gaza was among the first targets of the ground invasion launched over a year ago, after Hamas’ attack into southern Israel. The northern third of the territory has been encircled by Israeli forces since then. Israel launched another major offensive in nearby Jabaliya, a decades-old urban refugee camp, in early October. It has sharply restricted the amount of aid entering northern Gaza and ordered a full evacuation. Tens of thousands have fled to nearby Gaza City in the latest mass displacement of the war. Airstrikes hit Beirut’s southern suburbs, including one on site adjacent to airport BEIRUT — Several large airstrikes hit Beirut’s southern suburbs early Thursday, including one on a site adjacent to Lebanon’s only international airport. The Israeli military had earlier issued an evacuation notice for the site, saying that there were Hezbollah facilities there, without giving more details. There were no immediate reports of casualties. Beirut’s airport has not been directly targeted in the war between Israel and Hezbollah, and national air carrier Middle East Airlines has continued to operate commercial flights. ___ For more Middle East news: https://apnews.com/hub/middle-east	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-hezbollah-mideast-latest-7-november-2024-9e9fe099be1b073c96cc4613a92ba6c3	2024-11-06T21:31:52-08:00	
Typhoon Yinxing slams into a northern Philippine region still recovering from back-to-back storms	MANILA, Philippines (AP) — A strong typhoon slammed into a northern Philippine province on Thursday as thousands were evacuated in a region still recovering from back-to-back storms that hit a few weeks ago. Typhoon Yinxing is the 13th to batter the disaster-prone Southeast Asian archipelago in 2024. 'I really pity our people but all of them are tough,' Gov. Marilou Cayco of the province of Batanes said by telephone. Her province was ravaged by recent destructive storms and is expected to be affected by Yinxing’s fierce wind and rain. Tens of thousands of villagers were returning to emergency shelters, and disaster-response teams were again put on alert in Cagayan and other northern provinces near the expected path of Yinxing. The typhoon blew into Santa Ana town in Cagayan province on Thursday afternoon. The slow-moving typhoon, locally named Marce, was packing sustained winds of up to 175 kilometers (109 miles) per hour and gusts of up to 240 kph (149 mph) just before it made landfall in the coastal town of Santa Ana in Cagayan province, government forecasters said. There were no immediate reports of casualties or major damage. Aside from flash floods, authorities were concerned about the higher possibilities of landslides in northern mountainous region, which has been inundated by pounding rains from two previous storms. The coast guard, army, air force and police were on high alert. Inter-island ferries and cargo services and domestic flights were suspended in northern provinces. Tropical Storm Trami and Typhoon Kong-rey hit the northern Philippines in recent weeks, leaving at least 151 people dead and affecting nearly 9 million others. More than 14 billion pesos ($241 million) in rice, corn and other crops and infrastructure were damaged. The death and destruction from the storms prompted President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. to declare a day of national mourning on Monday when he visited the worst-hit province of Batangas, south of the capital, Manila. At least 61 people perished in the coastal province. Trami dumped one to two months’ worth of rain in just 24 hours in some regions, including in Batangas. 'We want to avoid the loss of lives due to calamities,' Marcos said in Talisay town in Batangas, where he brought key Cabinet members to reassure storm victims of rapid government help. 'Storms nowadays are more intense, extensive and powerful.' In 2013, Typhoon Haiyan, one of the strongest recorded tropical cyclones, left more than 7,300 people dead or missing, flattened entire villages and caused ships to run aground and smash into houses in the central Philippines.	https://apnews.com/article/philippines-typhoon-yinxing-876e9d337a65d3c5c2069ab41d36be28	2024-11-06T20:23:15-08:00	
Trump's second term could realign US diplomacy toward authoritarian leaders	BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) — Hungary's fiery, right-wing leader says Donald Trump’s victory will help his own battle against immigration and multiculturalism and restore traditional family values. In Argentina, a president who once bear-hugged Trump at a political conference in Maryland is attacking his critics as rats and parasites, ranting against what he calls a corrupt elite and calling climate change 'a socialist lie.' Trump's second term could realign U.S. diplomacy away from traditional international alliances and more toward populist, authoritarian politicians, according to both those leaders and outside observers. Prime Minister Viktor Orbán of Hungary Two days before Tuesday's election, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán made a daring prediction. 'Donald Trump will be president again, and that means by the end of the year, pro-peace political forces will be in the majority in the West,' Orbán told state radio. Orbán has been accused by the European Union of burying Hungary’s democracy by dominating media and building a network of loyal oligarchs. He has worried foreign leaders by drawing closer to Russian President Vladimir Putin. What Orbán calls 'illiberal democracy' has stigmatized civil-society organizations and cracked down on LGBTQ+ rights. It favors retaining power even if that means contravening traditional Hungarian allies' interests. President Vladimir Putin of Russia Trump has avoided publicly criticizing Putin and has consistently spoken warmly about him. 'There is clearly that sort of authoritarian-minded chemistry,' between them, said Nigel Gould-Davies of the International Institute of Strategic Studies in London. That chemistry aligns with Trump’s admiration for other authoritarian leaders, some of whom were elected by systems that were once democratic, Gould-Davies said, noting Hungary under Orbán as an example. Trump has claimed that he will bring an end to Russia’s war in Ukraine 'within 24 hours,' an assertion welcomed by the Kremlin, which currently holds an advantage on the battlefield as well as roughly 20% of Ukrainian territory. Moscow may hope that Trump will sow dysfunction in NATO given his demands that other members of the alliance meet agreed military spending levels, and his warnings that Russia could 'do whatever the hell they want' to those who fail. Gould-Davies observed before the election that the Kremlin would welcome Trump’s victory because of his apparent desire for the war in Ukraine to end on terms favorable to Russia. Putin and other authoritarian leaders will be encouraged by Trump’s reelection, which will mean 'much less emphasis in American foreign policy on the importance and value of human rights,' Gould-Davies said. Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is one of his country’s both beloved and polarizing political leaders. Under Modi, Hindu nationalism — once a fringe ideology in India — has become mainstream, and nobody has done more to advance this cause than the 74-year-old leader. Some critics believe Modi’s politics have divided India, especially along religious lines. He was accused of using hate speech against the country’s minority Muslim community, especially in the last phase of election campaigning this year when he ramped up rhetoric against them. To his supporters, Modi is a political outsider who broke the country’s history of dynastic politics. His rise has been boosted in part by promises to overhaul India’s economy, but also by Hindu-first politics that have resonated widely in a country where 80% of the population is Hindu. To his critics, Modi has strained democracy and threatened India's secular fabric, while his attacks on media and free speech have grown in more than a decade of his rule. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey Like Trump, Erdogan projects an image of strength that prioritizes national interests and relies on populist messages that present him as a champion of common people against elites. The Biden administration has kept Erdogan’s government at arms’ length, but Trump and Erdogan have cultivated a cordial relationship. That's despite a series of differences between their countries, like when the Trump administration removed Turkey from the F-35 fighter jet program in 2019 over Ankara’s purchase of a Russian-made missile defense system. President Javier Milei of Argentina The president of Argentina has a brash style like Trump, rebukes multilateral institutions like the United Nations and has taken a disdainful approach to diplomacy, snubbing meetings with the leaders of traditional allies like Brazil and Spain. For many observers, the most worrying parallel involves Milei’s claims that last year’s presidential election in Argentina was rigged against him. That, along with his efforts to downplay the atrocities of Argentina’s 1976-1983 bloody military dictatorship has raised concerns about his impact on democracy. Milei congratulated Trump on his election victory Wednesday by posting an image on Instagram of the two men hugging in front of their nations’ flags. 'You know you can count on Argentina to carry out your task,' the caption reads. 'Now, Make America Great Again.' Analysts say his cash-strapped government — badly in need of support from the U.S., the largest stakeholder in the International Monetary Fund — has been betting on a Trump win. Milei’s administration is pinning its hopes on the idea that Trump could exert pressure on the IMF to lend more money to Argentina, its biggest debtor. The fund is weighing whether to lend Argentina more cash, which Milei’s libertarian government needs to fully reenter the world market and exit currency controls. During Trump’s first term, the IMF granted Argentina — at the time led by conservative President Mauricio Macri — a controversial $57 billion bailout. Mariano Machado, principal analyst for the Americas at Verisk Maplecroft, a global risk intelligence firm, said that while U.S. institutions and separation of powers are designed to prevent autocratic rule, 'Argentina is now going back to a phase where the very parameters of its institutions are being pressured.' Prime Minister Robert Fico of Slovakia While a leftist, Fico has used rhetoric similar to Trump's. Fico even compared the July assassination attempt against Trump to his own wounding in a shooting in May. 'It is a carbon-copy scenario,' Fico said. 'Political opponents of Donald Trump are trying to imprison him, and when they don’t succeed, they enrage the public so much that some loser picks up a gun.' Like Trump, Fico displays contempt for the mainstream media, and has declared war on illegal immigration. Fico has faced criminal charges for organized crime, which he denounced as politically motivated. The case was eventually dismissed. The Slovak leader has condemned the West's approach to the war in Ukraine and canceled weapons shipments to Kyiv. Fico, like Orbán, is known for his pro-Russian views, opposes EU sanctions on Moscow and has said he would block Ukraine from joining NATO. ___ Suzan Fraser in Ankara, Turkey, Isabel DeBre in Buenos Aires, Krutika Pathi in New Delhi and Karel Janicek in Prague contributed.	https://apnews.com/article/trump-reelection-world-leaders-authoritarians-ff69aeab1d5a357848d5ee4001dc1591	2024-11-06T20:19:03-08:00	
Australia plans a social media ban for children under 16	MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — The Australian government announced on Thursday what it described as world-leading legislation that would institute an age limit of 16 years for children to start using social media, and hold platforms responsible for ensuring compliance. 'Social media is doing harm to our kids and I’m calling time on it,' Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said. The legislation will be introduced in Parliament during its final two weeks in session this year, which begin on Nov. 18. The age limit would take effect 12 months after the law is passed, Albanese told reporters. The platforms including X, TikTok, Instagram and Facebook would need to use that year to work out how to exclude Australian children younger than 16. 'I’ve spoken to thousands of parents, grandparents, aunties and uncles. They, like me, are worried sick about the safety of our kids online,' Albanese said. The proposal comes as governments around the world are wrestling with how to supervise young people's use of technologies like smartphones and social media. Social media platforms would be penalized for breaching the age limit, but under-age children and their parents would not. 'The onus will be on social media platforms to demonstrate they are taking reasonable steps to prevent access. The onus won’t be on parents or young people,' Albanese said. Antigone Davis, head of safety at Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, said the company would respect any age limitations the government wants to introduce. 'However, what’s missing is a deeper discussion on how we implement protections, otherwise we risk making ourselves feel better, like we have taken action, but teens and parents will not find themselves in a better place,' Davis said in a statement. She added that stronger tools in app stores and operating systems for parents to control what apps their children can use would be a 'simple and effective solution.' X did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday. TikTok declined to comment. The Digital Industry Group Inc., an advocate for the digital industry in Australia, described the age limit as a '20th Century response to 21st Century challenges.' 'Rather than blocking access through bans, we need to take a balanced approach to create age-appropriate spaces, build digital literacy and protect young people from online harm,' DIGI managing director Sunita Bose said in a statement. More than 140 Australian and international academics with expertise in fields related to technology and child welfare signed an open letter to Albanese last month opposing a social media age limit as 'too blunt an instrument to address risks effectively.' Jackie Hallan, a director at the youth mental health service ReachOut, opposed the ban. She said 73% of young people across Australia accessing mental health support did so through social media. 'We’re uncomfortable with the ban. We think young people are likely to circumvent a ban and our concern is that it really drives the behavior underground and then if things go wrong, young people are less likely to get support from parents and carers because they’re worried about getting in trouble,' Hallan said. Child psychologist Philip Tam said a minimum age of 12 or 13 would have been more enforceable. 'My real fear honestly is that the problem of social media will simply be driven underground,' Tam said. Australian National University lawyer Associate Prof. Faith Gordon feared separating children from there platforms could create pressures within families. Albanese said there would be exclusions and exemptions in circumstances such as a need to continue access to educational services. But parental consent would not entitle a child under 16 to access social media. Earlier this year, the government began a trial of age-restriciton technologies. Australia’s eSafety Commissioner, the online watchdog that will police compliance, will use the results of that trial to provide platforms with guidance on what reasonable steps they can take. Communications Minister Michelle Rowland said the year-long lead-in would ensure the age limit could be implemented in a 'very practical way.' 'There does need to be enhanced penalties to ensure compliance,' Rowland said. 'Every company that operates in Australia, whether domiciled here or otherwise, is expected and must comply with Australian law or face the consequences,' she added. The main opposition party has given in-principle support for an age limit at 16. Opposition lawmaker Paul Fletcher said the platforms already had the technology to enforce such an age ban. 'It’s not really a technical viability question, it’s a question of their readiness to do it and will they incur the cost to do it,' Fletcher told Australian Broadcasting Corp. 'The platforms say: ’It's all too hard, we can’t do it, Australia will become a backwater, it won’t possibly work.' But if you have well-drafted legislation and you stick to your guns, you can get the outcomes,' Fletcher added.	https://apnews.com/article/australia-social-media-age-limit-e8259408c0b1456f41967decd474782a	2024-11-06T19:45:20-08:00	
Indonesia's Mount Lewotobi Laki Laki erupts for the second time in a week	MAUMERE, Indonesia (AP) — Indonesia’s Mount Lewotobi Laki Laki unleashed towering columns of ash into the air on Thursday, in an even larger eruption than the one that killed nine people and injured dozens of others three days ago. There were no immediate reports of casualties from the latest eruption. The 1,584-meter (5,197-foot) volcano on the remote island of Flores shot billowing columns of ash 11 times on Thursday, with the latest and largest rising 8,000 meters (26,240 feet), said Hadi Wijaya, the head of Center for Volcanology and Geological Disaster Mitigation. The volcano had shown less activity since Monday’s deadly eruption killed nine people and injured 64 others. Monday's eruption affected more than 10,000 people in 10 villages. About 4,400 villagers moved into makeshift emergency shelters after the eruption, which destroyed seven schools, nearly two dozen houses and a convent on the majority-Catholic island. Volcanic materials, including smoldering rocks, lava and hot, thumb-size gravel and ash were thrown up to 7 kilometers (4.3 miles) from its crater on Monday. While visiting the devastated areas, officials found craters where rocks fell during eruptions, up to 13 meters (43 feet) wide and 5 meters (16 feet) deep, in several places including a destroyed school. 'It shows a difference in characteristics from the previous eruption in January,' said Wijaya, head of the volcanology center. He added that the earlier eruption mostly unleashed volcanic materials around the peak, followed by lava flows. 'We are still analyzing the change of Lewotobi's eruption character, which will be used by the government to determine a safe relocation site for residents,' Wijaya said. He said his agency has asked the local government of East Nusa Tenggara province to close the only road connecting Maumere, the island’s largest city, to the neighboring district of Larantuka, as it passes through the volcano’s danger zone. The country’s volcano monitoring agency increased Lewotobi Laki Laki's alert status to the highest level and more than doubled the exclusion zone to a 7-kilometer (4.3-mile) radius on Monday, prohibiting any activity in that area. Authorities warned the thousands of people who fled not to return home, as the government planned to move about 16,000 residents out of the danger zone, said National Disaster Management Agency head Suharyanto, who like many Indonesians uses a single name. 'Permanent relocation is considered as a long-term mitigation measure to anticipate eruption in the future,' Suharyanto told reporters after visiting the devastated areas Thursday. He said residents of the hardest-hit villages would be relocated within the next six months, and each family waiting for a new house will be compensated 500,000 rupiah ($32) per month. About 6,500 people were evacuated in January after Mount Lewotobi Laki Laki began erupting, spewing thick clouds and forcing the government to close the island’s Fransiskus Xaverius Seda Airport. No casualties or major damage were reported, but the airport has remained closed since then due to seismic activity. Lewotobi Laki Laki is one of a pair of stratovolcanoes in the East Flores district of East Nusa Tenggara province, known locally as the husband-and-wife mountains. 'Laki laki' means man, while its mate is Lewotobi Perempuan, or woman. The vulcanology center also said another volcano, Mount Marapi in West Sumatra province — one of the country’s most active volcanoes — erupted again on Thursday, spewing thick columns of ash at least three times and blanketing nearby villages with debris. No casualties were reported. Lewotobi Laki Laki is one of the 120 active volcanoes in Indonesia, an archipelago of 280 million people. The country is prone to earthquakes, landslides and volcanic activity because it sits along the 'Ring of Fire,' a horseshoe-shaped series of seismic fault lines around the Pacific Ocean. ___ Karmini reported from Jakarta.

European climate agency says this will likely be the hottest year on record -- again	CHICAGO (AP) — For the second year in a row, Earth will almost certainly be the hottest it's ever been. And for the first time, the globe this year reached more than 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) of warming compared to the pre-industrial average, the European climate agency Copernicus said Thursday. 'It's this relentless nature of the warming that I think is is worrying,' said Carlo Buontempo, director of Copernicus. Buontempo said the data clearly shows the planet would not see such a long sequence of record-breaking temperatures without the constant increase of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere driving global warming. He cited other factors that contribute to exceptionally warm years like last year and this one. They include El Nino — the temporary warming of parts of the Pacific that changes weather worldwide — as well as volcanic eruptions that spew water vapor into the air and variations in energy from the sun. But he and other scientists say the long-term increase in temperatures beyond fluctuations like El Nino is a bad sign. 'A very strong El Nino event is a sneak peek into what the new normal will be about a decade from now,' said Zeke Hausfather, a research scientist with the nonprofit Berkeley Earth. News of a likely second year of record heat comes a day after Republican Donald Trump, who has called climate change a 'hoax' and promised to boost oil drilling and production, was reelected to the presidency. It also comes days before the next U.N. climate conference, called COP29, is set to begin in Azerbaijan. Talks are expected to focus on how to generate trillions of dollars to help the world transition to clean energes like wind and solar, and thus avoid continued warming. Buontempo pointed out that going over the 1.5 degree Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) threshold of warming for a single year is different than the goal adopted in the 2015 Paris Agreement. That goal was meant to try to cap warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) since pre-industrial times on average, over 20 or 30 years. A United Nations report this year said that since the mid-1800s on average, the world has already heated up 1.3 degrees Celsius (2.3 degrees Fahrenheit) — up from previous estimates of 1.1 degrees (2 degrees Fahrenheit) or 1.2 degrees (2.2 degrees Fahrenheit). That's of concern because the U.N. says the greenhouse gas emission reduction goals of the world's nations still aren't nearly ambitious enough to keep the 1.5 degree Celsius target on track. The target was chosen to try to stave off the worst effects of climate change on humanity, including extreme weather. 'The heat waves, storm damage, and droughts that we are experiencing now are just the tip of the iceberg,' said Natalie Mahowald, chair of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at Cornell University. Going over that number in 2024 doesn’t mean the overall trend line of global warming has, but 'in the absence of concerted action, it soon will,' said University of Pennsylvania climate scientist Michael Mann. Stanford University climate scientist Rob Jackson put it in starker terms. 'I think we have missed the 1.5 degree window,' said Jackson, who chairs the Global Carbon Project, a group of scientists who track countries’ carbon dioxide emissions. 'There’s too much warming.' Indiana state climatologist Beth Hall said she isn't surprised by the latest report from Copernicus, but emphasized that people should remember climate is a global issue beyond their local experiences with changing weather. 'We tend to be siloed in our own individual world,' she said. Reports like this one 'are taking into account lots and lots of locations that aren’t in our backyard.' Buontempo stressed the importance of global observations, bolstered by international cooperation, that allow scientists to have confidence in the new report's finding: Copernicus gets its results from billions of measurements from satellites, ships, aircraft and weather stations around the world. He said that going over the 1.5 degree Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) benchmark this year is 'psychologically important' as nations make decisions internally and approach negotiations at the annual U.N. climate change summit Nov. 11-22 in Azerbaijan. 'The decision, clearly, is ours. It’s of each and every one of us. And it’s the decision of our society and our policymakers as a consequence of that,' he said. 'But I believe these decisions are better made if they are based on evidence and facts.' ___ Associated Press science writer Seth Borenstein contributed to this report. ___ Follow Melina Walling on X, formerly Twitter: @MelinaWalling. ___ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Stock Market Today: Asian shares retreat after Trump's victory as focus turns to the Fed	Shares retreated in Asia early Thursday after U.S. stocks stormed to records as investors wagered on what Donald Trump’s return to the White House will mean for the economy and the world. Markets also were turning their attention to the Federal Reserve’s decision on interest rates, due later in the day. Japan's Nikkei 225 shed early gains to fall 0.6% to 39,246.86, while the Kospi in Seoul fell 0.4% to 2,554.57. Australia's S&amp;P/ASX 200 edged 0.1% lower, to 8,191.00. Chinese shares also declined. Hong Kong's Hang Seng dropped 0.7% to 20,386.36. The Shanghai Composite index also fell 0.7%, to 3,359.99. Trump has promised to slap blanket 60% tariffs on all Chinese imports, raising them still more if Beijing makes a move to invade the self-governing island of Taiwan. Investors are adding to bets built earlier on what the higher tariffs, lower tax rates and lighter regulation that Trump favors will mean. Higher tariffs on imports from China would add to the burdens Beijing is facing as it struggles to revive slowing growth in the world's second-largest economy. Higher tariffs on imports from China, Mexico and other countries also would raise the risk of trade wars and other disruptions to the global economy. On Wednesday, the U.S. stock market, Elon Musk’s Tesla, banks and bitcoin all stormed higher, however, as investors made bets on what Donald Trump’s return to the White House will mean for the economy and the world. Among the losers the market sees: the renewable-energy industry and potentially anyone worried about higher inflation. The S&amp;P 500 rallied 2.5% to 5,929.04 for its best day in nearly two years. The Dow Jones Industrial Average surged 3.6% to 43,729.93, while the Nasdaq composite jumped 3% to 18,983.47. All three indexes topped records they had set in recent weeks. The impact of Trump's second term will likely depend on whether his fellow Republicans win control of Congress, and that’s not yet clear. Investors see Trump’s policies potentially leading to stronger economic growth. That helps push prices down and yields up for Treasurys. Tax cuts under Trump could further swell the U.S. government’s deficit, increasing borrowing and forcing yields even higher. The yield on the 10-year Treasury jumped to 4.43% from 4.29% late Tuesday, which is a major move for the bond market. It’s up substantially from August, when it was below 4%. Investors expect the incoming president's policies, particularly higher tariffs, to fan inflation and add costs to U.S. household bills. Sharp cutbacks in immigration could also leave businesses shorthanded, forcing companies to raise wages for workers faster and put more upward pressure on prices. Much of Wall Street’s run to records this year was built on expectations for coming cuts to interest rates by the Federal Reserve, as inflation has headed back down to its 2% target. Easier interest rates help boost the economy, but they can also give inflation more fuel. The Fed will announce its latest decision on interest rates Thursday, where the expectation is still for a cut, according to data from CME Group. But traders are already paring back forecasts for how many cuts the Fed will provide through the middle of next year. In other dealings early Thursday, the U.S. dollar was holding steady against the Japanese yen, at 154.63. The euro slipped to $1.0728 from $1.0730. U.S. benchmark crude oil gained 2 cents to $71.71 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, was up 24 cents at $75.16. The price of bitcoin slipped to $$76,165 after hitting an all-time high above $76,480 on Wednesday, according to CoinDesk. Trump has pledged to make the country 'the crypto capital of the planet' and create a 'strategic reserve' of bitcoin. ___ AP Business Writer Stan Choe contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/stocks-markets-rates-china-ab18973c20d3e48e0567768378b32c01	2024-11-06T16:36:24-08:00	
Plea deals revived for alleged 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and others	WASHINGTON (AP) — A military judge has ruled that plea agreements struck by alleged Sept. 11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and two co-defendants are valid, voiding an order by Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin to throw out the deals, a government official said Wednesday. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because the order by the judge, Air Force Col. Matthew McCall, has not yet been posted publicly or officially announced. The plea agreements would spare Mohammed and the others the risk of the death penalty in exchange for guilty pleas in the long-running 9/11 case. Government prosecutors had negotiated the deals with defense attorneys under government auspices, and the top official for the military commission at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, had approved them. The plea deals in the Sept. 11, 2001, al-Qaida attacks that killed nearly 3,000 people spurred immediate political blowback by Republican lawmakers and others when announced in late July. The agreements, and Austin's attempt to reverse them, have been one of the most fraught episodes in a U.S. prosecution marked by delays and legal difficulties, including years of ongoing pretrial hearings to determine the admissibility of statements by the defendants given their years of torture in CIA custody. Within days of the deals becoming public this summer, Austin issued a brief order saying he was nullifying them. Plea bargains in possible death penalty cases tied to one of the gravest crimes ever carried out on U.S. soil were a momentous step that should only be decided by the defense secretary, Austin said at the time. The Pentagon is reviewing the judge's decision and had no immediate further comment, said Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder, Pentagon press secretary. The New York Times first reported the ruling. Military officials have yet to post the judge's decision on the Guantanamo military commission's online site. However, a legal blog that long has covered the prosecutions from the Guantanamo courtroom said McCall's 29-page ruling concludes that Austin lacked the authority to toss out the plea deals. The ruling also calls the timing of Austin's move 'fatal,' coming after Guantanamo's top official already had approved the deals, according to the blog, called Lawdragon. — AP reporter Lolita C. Baldor in Washington contributed.	https://apnews.com/article/guantanamo-plea-deal-911-austin-death-penalty-073c3455e27ecbfd0f7dd524ccffdef3	2024-11-06T16:25:14-08:00	
Controversial Australian Olympic breaker Rachael Gunn retires from competition	SYDNEY (AP) — Australian breaker Rachael Gunn has told a Sydney radio station that she plans to retire from competition just three months after her unconventional routine at the Paris Olympics led to her being ridiculed and spawned conspiracy theories about how she qualified for the Games. The now 37-year-old Sydney university lecturer failed to get on the scoreboard in all three of her competition rounds in August, with a routine that included unorthodox moves such as a kangaroo hop. Gunn had initially planned to keep competing but said the experience had been so 'upsetting' that she changed her mind. 'I just didn’t have any control over how people saw me or who I was,' she told radio station 2DayFM. 'I was going to keep competing, for sure, but that seems really difficult for me to do now. I think the level of scrutiny that’s going to be there, and people will be filming it, and it will go online.' Breaking was being contested at an Olympics for the first time . And it might be a one-and-done, not scheduled on the Olympic program for Los Angeles in 2028 or for Brisbane, Australia in 2032. 'Raygun' as she was known, was later ridiculed on social media, with some posts also questioning the Olympic qualifying process. In a television interview for The Project on Australia’s Channel 10 in September, she told of being chased by cameras through Paris streets and how she dealt with the very public reaction to her performance. 'That was really wild,' she said. 'If people are chasing me, what do I do? That really did put me in a state of panic. I was nervous to be out in public. It was pretty nerve-wracking for a while.' She apologized for the commotion, but again defended her performance and said she was thankful for support from others in the sport. She had previously defended how she qualified for Paris, and reiterated it on the TV program. 'I won the Oceania championships. It was a direct qualifier,' Gunn said. 'There were nine judges, all from overseas. I knew my chances were slim as soon as I qualified,' for the Olympics. 'People didn’t understand breaking and were just angry about my performance,' she added. 'The conspiracy theories were just awful and that was really upsetting. People are now attacking our reputation and our integrity — none of them were grounded in facts.' Gunn’s performance was mocked online and on television, including in a sketch on Jimmy Fallon’s late-night TV show. In her Sydney radio interview Wednesday, Gunn said she won't stop breaking entirely. 'I still dance and I still break.' she said. 'But that’s like, in my living room with my partner.' ___ AP Paris Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games	https://apnews.com/article/australia-olympics-breaker-retires-909872e56fa902b4743e476c7acb4af0	2024-11-06T16:20:05-08:00	
Canada orders TikTok's Canadian business to be dissolved but won't block app	TORONTO (AP) — Canada announced Wednesday it won’t block access to the popular video-sharing app TikTok but is ordering the dissolution of its Canadian business after a national security review of the Chinese company behind it. Industry Minister François-Philippe Champagne said it is meant to address risks related to ByteDance Ltd.’s establishment of TikTok Technology Canada Inc. 'The government is not blocking Canadians’ access to the TikTok application or their ability to create content. The decision to use a social media application or platform is a personal choice,' Champagne said. Champagne said it is important for Canadians to adopt good cybersecurity practices, including protecting their personal information. He said the dissolution order was made in accordance with the Investment Canada Act, which allows for the review of foreign investments that may harm Canada’s national security. He said the decision was based on information and evidence collected over the course of the review and on the advice of Canada’s security and intelligence community and other government partners. A TikTok spokesperson said in a statement that the shutdown of its Canadian offices will mean the loss of hundreds of local jobs. 'We will challenge this order in court,' the spokesperson said. 'The TikTok platform will remain available for creators to find an audience, explore new interests and for businesses to thrive.' TikTok is wildly popular with young people, but its Chinese ownership has raised fears that Beijing could use it to collect data on Western users or push pro-China narratives and misinformation. TikTok is owned by ByteDance, a Chinese company that moved its headquarters to Singapore in 2020. TikTok faces intensifying scrutiny from Europe and America over security and data privacy. It comes as China and the West are locked in a wider tug of war over technology ranging from spy balloons to computer chips. Canada previously banned TikTok from all government-issued mobile devices. TikTok has two offices in Canada, one in Toronto and one in Vancouver. Michael Geist, Canada research chair in Internet and E-commerce Law at the University of Ottawa, said in a blog post that 'banning the company rather than the app may actually make matters worse since the risks associated with the app will remain but the ability to hold the company accountable will be weakened.' Canada's move comes a day after the election in the United States of Donald Trump. In June, Trump joined TikTok, a platform he once tried to ban while in the White House. It has about 170 million users in the U.S. Trump tried to ban TikTok through an executive order that said 'the spread in the United States of mobile applications developed and owned' by Chinese companies was a national security threat. The courts blocked the action after TikTok sued. Both the U.S. FBI and the Federal Communications Commission have warned that ByteDance could share user data such as browsing history, location and biometric identifiers with China’s government. TikTok said it has never done that and would not, if asked. Trump said earlier this year that he still believes TikTok posed a national security risk, but was opposed to banning it. U.S. President Joe Biden signed legislation in April that would force ByteDance to sell the app to a U.S. company within a year or face a national ban. It’s not clear whether that law will survive a legal challenge filed by TikTok or that ByteDance would agree to sell.	https://apnews.com/article/tiktok-canada-china-f290fed849bcdb26edb165d55b0aa225	2024-11-06T15:37:23-08:00	
China is bracing for fresh tensions with Trump over trade, tech and Taiwan	TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) — The first time China faced Donald Trump in the White House, there was a trade war, a breach of protocol involving Taiwan’s former leader, and a president-to-president bromance that turned sour. As President-elect Trump prepares to start his second term in office, China is bracing for unpredictability in its ties with the United States and renewed tensions over trade, technology and Taiwan. A new tariff war looms Perhaps the biggest consequence for China — if Trump stays true to his campaign promises — is his threat to slap blanket 60% tariffs on all Chinese exports to the U.S. Tariffs like that would be a blow to China’s already unstable economy, which is suffering from high youth unemployment, a lengthy property slump and government debt. A 60% duty on Chinese imports could shave off 2.5 percentage points, or about half, of China’s projected economic growth, according to an analysis published earlier this year by UBS. During Trump's previous term in office, the U.S. imposed tariffs on more than $360 billion of Chinese products. That brought Beijing to the negotiating table, and in 2020 the two sides signed a trade deal in which China committed to improve intellectual property rights and buy an extra $200 billion of American goods. A research group a couple of years later showed China had bought essentially none of the goods it had promised. President Joe Biden retained most of those tariffs and added fresh duties this year on imports including steel, solar cells and electric vehicles. Like last time, tariffs could serve as a tool to force Beijing back to the negotiating table, said Henry Gao, a law professor at Singapore Management University who focuses on international trade. 'Given the weak economic position of China this time, I think there will be more willingness to talk,' he said. 'Thus, while the tariff might have some short-term effects on the Chinese economy, the situation might improve once they reach a deal.' Factoring into the trade talks could be Trump’s appeals to Chinese President Xi Jinping to help negotiate a resolution to the Ukraine war, which Trump has boasted he’ll be able to do quickly, without saying how. Trump previously sought Xi's help in dealing with North Korea's rogue leader Kim Jong Un. That dynamic could repeat itself, with Trump weighing trade grievances against seeking China's support in global crises, according to Wang Huiyao, founder of the Beijing-based think tank Center for China and Globalization. 'China is the largest trading partner of both Russia and Ukraine,' Wang wrote in a recent commentary. 'These close economic ties give China a unique opportunity to play a greater role in peace-making efforts.' Willing to go ‘crazy’ over Taiwan There is one scenario in which Trump has threatened to impose even higher tariffs — 150% to 200% — on Chinese goods: if China invades Taiwan, a self-ruled democracy that Beijing claims as its own. The U.S. does not recognize Taiwan as a country, but is its strongest backer and biggest arms provider. Trump angered Beijing in December 2016 by taking a congratulatory call from Taiwan’s then-president Tsai Ing-wen in a breach of diplomatic protocol. No U.S. president had spoken directly to a Taiwanese leader since Washington and Beijing established ties in 1979. Trump's move created anxiety in China-watching circles, but ultimately, he stuck to supporting the status quo in relations between Taipei and Beijing. China expects him to continue to do so, said Zhu Feng, dean of the School of International Relations at Nanjing University. 'Will (he) want to turn to support Taiwan independence? It is unlikely,' he said. As for China’s repeated threats to annex Taiwan, Trump told The Wall Street Journal last month that he would not have to use military force to prevent a blockade of Taiwan because Xi 'respects me and he knows I’m (expletive) crazy.' On the campaign trail, Trump sometimes talked up his personal connection with Xi, which started exuberantly during his first term but soured over disputes about trade and the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic. But Trump has also said that Taiwan should pay the U.S. for defending it against China, likening the relationship to insurance. Taiwan spends about 2.5% of its GDP on defense, and purchased hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of U.S. weapons this year. In a congratulatory message to Trump after his victory, Xi called for the U.S. and China to manage their differences and get along in a new era, according to Chinese state media. History has shown that both sides gain from cooperation and lose from confrontation, Xi said. Trump has purposely maintained a sense of uncertainty in his relationship with China, said Da Wei, director of the Center for International Security and Strategy at Tsinghua University in Beijing. 'We are clear about the challenges,' he said. 'As for opportunities, we are yet to see them clearly.' Disputes over chips During his first term, Trump began targeting Chinese technology firms over security concerns, focusing on large companies like the telecoms giant Huawei. Biden continued in that direction by placing curbs on China’s access to advanced semiconductors, which are needed to develop strategic industries such as artificial intelligence. But Trump has criticized Biden’s CHIPS and Science Act, a bipartisan bill that earmarked $53 billion to build up domestic manufacturing of semiconductors. Currently, Taiwan produces nearly 90% of the world’s supply of the most advanced chips. The island’s largest semiconductor manufacturer, TSMC, expanded production in Arizona, partly to respond to the CHIPS Act, and to be prepared to withstand any other protectionist policies in the U.S., said Shihoko Goto, director of the Indo-Pacific Program at the Wilson Center. Trump has promised to do away with the CHIPS Act, though critics say that would undermine his campaign to reindustrialize the U.S. The president-elect has also accused Taiwan of 'stealing' the chip industry from the U.S. decades ago. 'Rather than providing a silicon shield, Taiwan’s dominance in the chip industry could actually be the source of tension between Taipei and Trump, as Taiwan’s successes in the chip sector may be seen as having only been possible as a result of the United States being taken advantage of,' Goto said.	https://apnews.com/article/trump-china-tariffs-taiwan-foreign-policy-7351ce1069654f1c1aefb560b36dcc17	2024-11-06T15:02:43-08:00	
Trump's return to White House sets stage for far-reaching immigration crackdown	SAN DIEGO (AP) — 'Build the Wall' was Donald Trump's rally cry in 2016, and he acted on his promise by tapping military budgets for hundreds of miles of border wall with Mexico. 'Mass Deportation' was the buzzword that energized supporters for his White House bid in 2024. Trump’s victory sets the stage for a swift crackdown after an AP VoteCast survey showed the president-elect’s supporters were largely focused on immigration and inflation — issues the Republican has been hammering throughout his campaign. How and when Trump's actions on immigration will take shape is uncertain. While Trump and his advisers have offered outlines, many questions remain about how they would deport anywhere close to the 11 million people estimated to be in the country illegally. How would immigrants be identified? Where would they be detained? What if their countries refuse to take them back? Where would Trump find money and trained officers to carry out their deportation? Trump has said he would invoke the Alien Enemies Act, a rarely used 1798 law that allows the president to deport any noncitizen from a country the U.S. is at war with. He has spoken about deploying the National Guard, which can be activated on orders from a governor. Stephen Miller, a top Trump adviser, has said troops under sympathetic Republican governors would send troops to nearby states that refuse to participate. Trump, who repeatedly referred to immigrants 'poisoning the blood' of the United States, has stricken fear in immigrant communities with words alone. Julie Moreno, a U.S. citizen who has been married for seven years to a Mexican man who is in the country illegally, is adjusting to the idea that she may have to live separately from her husband, who came to the United States in 2004. She can move to Mexico from New Jersey but it would be nearly impossible to keep running her business importing boxing gloves. 'I don’t have words yet, too many feelings,' Moreno said, her voice breaking as she spoke Wednesday of Trump's victory. 'I am very scared for my husband’s safety. … If they detain him, what is going to happen?' Moreno's husband, Neftali Juarez, ran a construction business and feels he has contributed to the country, paying taxes and providing employment through his company. 'Unfortunately, the sentiment of the people who voted is different,' he said. 'I feel horrible losing my wife.' Some policy experts expect Trump’s first immigration moves to be at the border. He may pressure Mexico to keep blocking migrants from reaching the U.S. border as it has since December. He may lean on Mexico to reinstate a Trump-era policy that made asylum-seekers wait in Mexico for hearings in U.S. immigration court. Andrew Arthur, a fellow at the Center for Immigration Studies, which supports immigration restrictions, highlighted campaign remarks by Vice President-elect JD Vance that deporting millions would be done one step at a time, not all at once. 'You’re not talking about a dragnet,' Arthur, a former immigration judge, told The Associated Press. 'There’s no way you could do it. The first thing you have to do is seal the border and then you can address the interior. All of this is going to be guided by the resources you have available.' Elena, a 46-year-old Nicaraguan who has been living in the United States illegally for 25 years, couldn’t sleep after Trump's victory, crying about what to do if she and her husband, 50, are deported. They have two adult daughters, both U.S. citizens, who have had stomach pain and respiratory problems from anxiety about the election. 'It is so difficult for me to uproot myself from the country that I have seen as my home,' said Elena, who lives in South Florida and gave only her first name for fear of being deported. 'I have made my roots here and it is difficult to have to abandon everything to start over.' Advocates are looking at where deportation arrests might take place and are watching especially closely to see if authorities adhere to a longstanding policy of avoiding schools, hospitals, places of worship and disaster relief centers, said Heidi Altman, federal advocacy director for the National Immigration Law Center’s Immigrant Justice Fund. 'We're taking it very seriously,' said Altman. 'We all have to have our eyes wide open to the fact that this isn't 2016. Trump and Stephen Miller learned a lot from their first administration. The courts look very different than they did four years ago.' Trump is expected to resume other far-reaching policies from his first term and jettison key Biden moves. These include: —Trump has harshly criticized Biden policies to create and expand legal pathways to entry, including an online app called CBP One under which nearly 1 million people have entered at land crossings with Mexico since January 2023. Another policy has allowed more than 500,000 Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans to fly into the country with financial sponsors. — Trump slashed the number of refugees screened abroad by the United Nations and State Department for settlement in the U.S. to its lowest level since Congress established the program in 1980. Biden rebuilt it, establishing an annual cap of 125,000, up from 18,000 under Trump. —Trump sought to end the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which shielded people who came to the U.S. as young children from deportation. A lawsuit by Republican governors that has seemed headed for the Supreme Court challenges DACA. For now, hundreds of thousands of DACA recipients may renew their status but new applications aren't accepted. —Trump dramatically curtailed the use of Temporary Protected Status, created under a 1990 law to allow people already in the United States to stay if their homelands are deemed unsafe. Biden sharply expanded use of TPS, including to hundreds of thousands of Haitians and Venezuelans. Maribel Hernandez, a Venezuelan on TPS that allows her to stay in the United States until April 2025, burst into tears as her 2-year-old son slept in a stroller outside New York's Roosevelt Hotel as migrants discussed election fallout Wednesday. 'Imagine if they end it,' she said. ___ Salomon reported from Miami.

Deforestation in Brazil's Amazon drops by nearly 31% compared to previous year	AGUA CLARA, Brazil (AP) — Forest loss in Brazil’s Amazon dropped by 30.6% compared to the previous year, officials said Wednesday, the lowest level of destruction in nine years. In a 12-month span, the Amazon rainforest lost 6,288 square kilometers (2,428 square miles), roughly the size of the U.S. state of Delaware. The results, announced in Brazil´s presidential palace, sharply contrast with President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva’s predecessor, far-right leader Jair Bolsonaro, who prioritized agribusiness expansion over forest protection and weakened environmental agencies. Deforestation hit a 15-year high during his term. Deforestation in Brazil's vast savannah, known as the Cerrado, decreased by 25.7%, the first decline in five years. The area destroyed reached 8,174 square kilometers (3,156 square miles). Located in central Brazil, it is the world’s most biodiverse savannah but has fewer legal protections than the Amazon. Despite the success in curbing Amazon deforestation, Lula's government has been criticized by environmentalists for backing projects that could harm the region, such as the pavement of a highway that cuts from an old-growth area, oil drilling in the mouth of the Amazon River and building a railway to transport soy to Amazonian ports. Brazil’s deforestation monitoring system tracks Aug. 1 to July 30, so Wednesday's report doesn’t capture the destruction from the past few months, as a historic drought opened the way to a surge in forest fires that burned an area larger than Switzerland. Much of the damage from fires is classified as degradation, not clearcutting deforestation, as the fire in the Amazon rainforest spreads mostly through leaves on the ground, and not through treetops. But the full impact will be assessed in the following months through further satellite monitoring. Government officials already fear that the deforestation rate may increase next year as the Amazonian city of Belem prepares to host the annual U.N. climate talks, known as COP30. The Amazon, an area twice the size of India, holds the world’s largest rainforest, about two-thirds of it within Brazil. It stores vast amounts of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas that causes climate change. The Amazon thus prevents the climate from warming even faster than it would otherwise. The basin also holds about 20% of the world’s fresh water and biodiversity includes 16,000 known tree species. ___ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

In new term, Trump set to target measures that are making the most difference for the climate	WASHINGTON (AP) — The election of Donald Trump as president for a second time and the Republican takeback of the U.S. Senate could undo many of the national climate policies that are most reducing planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, according to climate solutions experts. When they list measures that are making the most difference, it lines up with policies Trump has said he'll target. These rollbacks will come as more lives are being lost in heat waves, record amounts of climate pollution are accumulating in the atmosphere, the United States has been hit with what may be two of its most expensive hurricanes, and nations, which will meet in Baku, Azerbaijan next week for climate negotiations, have failed to take strong action to change these realities. Here are some of the measures. The Inflation Reduction Act, the nation's landmark climate law This law is significant because it is expected to reduce U.S. emissions by about 40% by 2030, if it unfolds as planned in the coming years. It funnels money to measures that substitute clean energy for dirty. One major way it does so is by giving credits to businessespeople who build new solar and wind farms. But it's not limited to that. It encourages developers of geothermal energy and businesses that separate the carbon dioxide from their smokestacks and bury it underground. It incentivizes the next generation of nuclear power. It gives a $7,500 tax credit to people who buy electric cars. People who buy their cars used can get a credit too, as long as they don't earn too much to qualify. Trump, by contrast, has summed up his energy policy as 'drill, baby, drill' and pledged to dismantle what he calls Democrats’ 'green new scam' in favor of boosting production of fossil fuels such as oil, natural gas and coal, the main causes of climate change. He vows to end subsidies for wind power that were included in the landmark 2022 climate law. If Trump does target the climate law, there are provisions that are likely safe. One is a credit for companies in advanced manufacturing, because it is perceived as 'America first and pro-U.S. business,' said David Shepheard, partner and energy expert at the global consultant Baringa. Incentives for electric vehicles are likely most at risk, he added. In a call Wednesday morning, Scott Segal, head of a communications group at the law firm Bracewell LLP, which represents the energy industry, said the climate law is not likely to be repealed. Dan Jasper, a senior policy advisor at Project Drawdown, said repealing parts of the climate law could backfire because most of the investments and jobs are in Republican congressional districts. Pollution from electric power plants The main U.S. rule aimed at reducing the climate change that comes from making electricity at power plants that burn coal is also considered vulnerable. This rule from the Environmental Protection Agency, announced in April, would force many coal-fired plants to capture 90% of their carbon emissions or shut down within eight years, Shepheard said. It was projected to reduce roughly 1.38 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide through 2047, along with tens of thousands of tons of other harmful air pollutants. Industry groups and Republican-controlled states have filed legal challenges to a host of EPA rules including this one and Trump’s victory means the Justice Department is unlikely to defend it. Under a Trump presidency, it is unlikely to survive, Shepheard said. The United States has been reducing carbon dioxide emissions primarily by replacing coal-fired power plants with clean, renewable power, said Stanford University climate scientist Rob Jackson, who chairs the Global Carbon Project, a group of scientists that tracks countries’ carbon dioxide emissions. 'I hope that we don’t lose sight of the benefits of clean energy,' he said. 'It’s not just about the climate. It’s about our lives and our health.' Limiting leaks from damaging methane, or natural gas The Biden administration was under pressure to reduce one of the main pollutants contributing to drought, heat waves, flooding and stronger hurricanes — methane or natural gas. It leaks out of oil and gas equipment, sometimes deliberately when companies consider it too expensive to transport. The Biden administration issued the first national rules on this. Industry groups and Republican-leaning states have challenged the rule in court. They say the Environmental Protection Agency overstepped its authority and set unattainable standards. The EPA said the rules are squarely within its legal responsibilities and would protect the public. Fuel-efficient vehicles The Environmental Protection Agency has issued its strongest rules on tailpipe emissions from cars and trucks under the Biden administration. While it is unclear who will head the EPA under Trump, the agency is considered likely to begin a lengthy process to repeal and replace a host of standards including the one on tailpipe emissions, which Trump falsely calls an electric vehicle 'mandate.″ Trump rolled back more than 100 environmental laws as president and that number is likely to grow in a second term. Trump has said EV manufacturing will destroy jobs in the auto industry and has falsely claimed that battery-powered cars don’t work in cold weather and aren’t able to travel long distances. Trump softened his rhetoric in recent months after Tesla CEO Elon Musk endorsed him and campaigned heavily for his election. Even so, industry officials expect Trump to try to slow a shift to electric cars. Drilling in Alaska refuge Trump is almost certain to reinstate drilling in Alaska’s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, continuing a partisan battle that has persisted for decades. Biden and other Democratic presidents have blocked drilling in the sprawling refuge, which is home to polar bears, caribou and other wildlife. Trump reinstated the drilling program in a 2017 tax cut law enacted by congressional Republicans. Even so, no drilling has occurred in the refuge. Transition to cleaner energy, transport will continue Trump, who has cast climate change as a 'hoax,' has said he will also eliminate regulations by the Biden administration to increase the energy efficiency of lightbulbs, stoves, dishwashers and shower heads. Dan Jasper, a senior policy advisor at Project Drawdown said climate action will continue to move forward at the state and local level. Zara Ahmed, who leads policy analysis and science strategy at Carbon Direct, agreed. While there may be an abdication of leadership at the federal level on climate, she’s optimistic that states including California will continue to lead. Clean Air Task Force Executive Director Armond Cohen said on Wednesday that states, cities, utilities and businesses that have committed to net zero emissions will keep working toward those goals, driving record installations of wind and solar energy. Governors of both parties are also interested in ramping up nuclear energy as a carbon-free source of electricity, Cohen said. Trump has said he, too, is interested in developing the next generation of nuclear reactors that are smaller than traditional reactors. Gina McCarthy, a former EPA administrator who was Biden’s first national climate adviser, said Trump will be unable to stop clean energy such as wind, solar and geothermal power. 'No matter what Trump may say, the shift to clean energy is unstoppable and our country is not turning back,″ McCarthy said. Advocates for clean energy are bipartisan, well-organized 'and fully prepared to deliver climate solutions, boost local economies, and drive climate ambition,′ she said. ___ McDermott reported from Providence, R.I. ___ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

UK identifies 4 cases of new mpox variant, the first cluster outside Africa	LONDON (AP) — British health officials say they have identified four cases of the new, more infectious version of mpox that first emerged in Congo, marking the first time the variant has caused a cluster of illness outside of Africa. Scientists said the risk to the public remains low. Authorities announced the first case of the new form of mpox in the U.K. last week, saying the case was being treated at a London hospital after recently traveling to countries in Africa with ongoing outbreaks. This week, the U.K. Health Security Agency said it had now identified three further cases who lived in the same household as the first patient. They too are now being treated at a hospital in London. 'Mpox is very infectious in households with close contact and so it is not unexpected to see further cases within the same household,' said Susan Hopkins, chief medical advisor of the U.K. Health Security Agency. The new variant of mpox was first detected earlier this year in eastern Congo. Scientists believe it causes milder symptoms that are harder to notice, which makes it easier to spread because people may not know they are infected. Its spread in Congo and elsewhere in Africa prompted the World Health Organization to declare a global emergency in August. Britain recorded more than 3,000 cases of another type of mpox during a 2022 outbreak that hit more than 100 countries. The new variant of mpox has also caused outbreaks in Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda and Uganda. Single cases in travelers have also been reported in Sweden, India, Germany and Thailand. To date, there have been about 43,000 suspect cases of mpox in Africa, including more than 1,000 deaths, mostly in Congo. On Wednesday, WHO said it had allocated 899,900 vaccine doses to nine African countries struggling with mpox epidemics. __ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.

Corning faces EU antitrust scrutiny over Gorilla Glass deals with phone makers	LONDON (AP) — Corning is facing European Union antitrust scrutiny after the bloc's watchdog said Wednesday it's investigating the speciality glass maker's exclusive deals for its Gorilla Glass used in cellphones. The European Commission, the 27-nation EU's top antitrust enforcer, said it opened a formal investigation to determine whether Corning Inc. abused its dominant worldwide position for the toughened glass used in smartphones, tablets and other portable devices. The commission, which is the EU's executive branch, said it was concerned about 'anti-competitive exclusive supply agreements' requiring device makers to source all or nearly all of their glass from Corning. Under these deals, manufacturers got rebates for buying only Corning glass, and could only take competing offers from rival glass makers if Corning couldn't match the price. Strong competition 'is crucial to ensure low prices and high-quality glass,' said Margrethe Vestager, the commission's executive vice-president in charge of competition policy. 'We are investigating if Corning, a major producer of this special glass, may have tried to exclude rival glass producers, thereby depriving consumers from cheaper and more break-resistant glass.' Corning is 'committed to compliance with all applicable rules and regulations where it does business,' the company said in a statement. 'As part of that commitment, we work with local regulatory authorities to ensure open discussion and cooperation.' Brussels has no deadline to wrap up the case, which could result in formal charges and a hefty fine worth up to 10% of the company's annual global revenue.	https://apnews.com/article/corning-antitrust-european-union-phone-dcdc7759ba8f7e3354d92759bff4879c	2024-11-06T08:30:16-08:00

Sorrentino's ode to Naples, 'Parthenope,' gets mixed reviews in Italy over San Gennaro sex scene	ROME (AP) — When director Paolo Sorrentino’s hit series 'The Young Pope' debuted in 2016, it took the Vatican a year to grudgingly bless his imagined and occasionally blasphemous portrayal of the pope. Not so for Sorrentino’s latest film 'Parthenope,' which has gotten an early thumbs down from Italy's Catholic Church. That has only seemed to pique interest in the film, driving it to the top of the box office here for Italian films since its release in theaters last month. Set in Sorrentino’s native Naples, the film is a lush meditation on beauty, love and death, drawn from the Greek myth of the siren Parthenope, who throws herself into the sea after she fails to entice Odysseus with her song. Parthenope is closely affiliated with Naples, such that the city is sometimes called 'Partenope' and its people 'Partenopei' in Italian. The film is by no means about the church, but toward the end of the film, there is a single scene that would make any Catholic choke. It involves a cardinal, the seductive protagonist Parthenope and the liquification of the blood of San Gennaro — the purported recurring miracle that is a sacred cow to many Neapolitans. Prominent Italian Catholics have denounced the sacrilegious sex scene as not only demeaning to the faith but Naples itself, with the newspaper of the Italian bishops conference Avvenire calling the 'sterile aesthetics' of the scene 'in poor taste.' In a roundup of negative reaction, Avvenire said Sorrentino’s fascination with the Catholic Church in 'The Young Pope' had reached new lows in 'Parthenope.' 'The impression is that they are images chosen for the image, whether nuns playing tennis or cardinals smoking cigars,' Avvenire concluded. Monsignor Vincenzo De Gregorio, who oversees the chapel that houses the relic of San Gennaro’s blood and related treasures of Naples’ patron saint, said he hadn’t seen the film in its entirety but that the clips of the scene were enough. While acknowledging that his comments would only give the film more publicity, De Gregorio told Corriere della Sera that he objected primarily to the 'superficial' treatment the film gave to one of Naples’ enduring mysteries: How San Gennaro’s blood liquifies, or doesn’t, on three specific days each year. According to legend, the purported miracle recalls the eruption of Mt. Vesuvius in 1631 when the blood of San Gennaro liquified and the magma from the volcano stopped before entering the city. San Gennaro is today often invoked to protect Neapolitans, and the thrice-yearly ritual draws thousands of devotees. 'Of course Sorrentino didn’t intend to make a documentary or an in-depth, sociological, historical analysis of Naples, but simply to analyze its dreamlike aspect, because basically that’s all it is,' De Gregorio told Corriere. Sorrentino, who won an Oscar for his Fellini-esque love letter to Rome, 'The Great Beauty,' has said his ode to Naples had to focus on Parthenope, the sea and the complicated and at times contradictory relationship between them and Naples itself. 'She is a free woman, very spontaneous, she doesn’t judge, as the city doesn’t judge,' he told a press conference at the Cannes Film Festival, where 'Parthenope' debuted in May to a standing ovation. 'She’s the mirror of the city where I grew up.' And some have hailed 'Parthenope,' with the Cannes jury giving its cinematographer, Daria d’Antonio, the festival's technical award. This week, Italian media reported that T-shirts have begun circulating around Naples with 'I love Sorrentino' and 'I love Parthenope,' and new figurines for Christmas creches, for which Neapolitan artisans are famous, featuring one of the film’s characters. Sorrentino himself found adoring fans seeking selfies and autographs this week during a special screening of the film in Palermo, Sicily. It's the latest brush of recent cinematic attention for Naples, the backdrop for the HBO television series 'My Brilliant Friend' based on the best-selling quartet of novels by Elena Ferrante. Sorrentino’s last feature film, 'The Hand of God,' was also based in Naples and featured another sacred but secular icon to Neapolitans, Maradona. Before that, he made a splash with his 10-episode series 'The Young Pope,' starring Jude Law as an improbable and controversial pope, which was followed by 'The New Pope,' starring John Malkovich. A year after the initial HBO and Sky series began airing in Italy in late 2016, the Vatican newspaper L’Osservatore Romano finally offered generally positive reviews despite what it called the 'frivolous,' ’’caustic' and 'grotesque' way it painted the Vatican. L’Osservatore Romano hasn’t commented on 'Parthenope.' The Vatican is a perennial topic for directors, with a host of films in recent years focusing on the papacy including Nanni Moretti’s 'Habemus Papam,' Netflix’s 'The Two Popes' and most recently 'Conclave' starring Ralph Fiennes. ___ Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

Trump promises to bring lasting peace to a tumultuous Middle East. But fixing it won't be easy	TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Donald Trump will return to the U.S. presidency at a time of unprecedented conflict and uncertainty in the Middle East. He has vowed to fix it. But Trump's history of strong support for Israel coupled with his insistence during the campaign that the war in Gaza should end quickly, the isolationist forces in the Republican party and his penchant for unpredictability raise a mountain of questions over how his second presidency will affect the region at this pivotal moment. Barring the achievement of elusive cease-fires before the inauguration, Trump will ascend to the highest office in the country as a brutal war in Gaza still rages and Israel presses its offensive against the Lebanese Hezbollah militant group. A conflagration between Iran and Israel shows no signs of abating — nor do Israel’s conflicts with Iranian proxies in Iraq and Yemen — and Iran’s nuclear program remains a top concern for Israel. Trump says he wants peace, but how? Throughout his campaign, Trump has vowed to bring peace to the region. 'Get it over with and let’s get back to peace and stop killing people,' Trump said of the conflict in Gaza in an interview with conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt in April. Israel launched the war in response to Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attacks, when militants killed 1,200 people in Israel and kidnapped 250, with dozens still in Gaza. Israel’s offensive has killed more than 43,000 people, according to Gaza health officials, whose count does not distinguish between civilians and fighters, though they say more than half of the dead are women and children. The war has ignited a humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza, driven Israel into increasing international isolation, with two world courts examining charges of war crimes, and has sparked a wave of protests on American campuses that have fueled debate over the U.S. role as Israel's key military and diplomatic supporter. International mediators from the U.S., Egypt and Qatar have tried unsuccessfully to bring about a lasting cease-fire. Yet Trump has repeatedly urged to Israel 'finish the job' and destroy Hamas — but hasn’t said how. 'Does finish the job mean you have a free hand to act in dealing with the remnants of Hamas? Or does finish the job mean the war has to come to an end now?' asked David Makovsky, director of the program on Arab-Israel Relations at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. 'That’s part of the enigmas here.' Netanyahu is pinning his hopes on a pro-Israel Trump administration Uncertainty also shrouds how Trump will engage with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. During his first term, Trump offered broad support for the Israeli leader’s hard-line policies, including unilaterally withdrawing from a deal meant to rein in Iran’s nuclear program that Netanyahu long opposed. Trump also recognized Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, bolstering its claim over the disputed city, and Israel’s annexation of the Golan Heights, captured from Syria in the 1967 Mideast war. He presented a peace plan with the Palestinians widely seen as favoring Israel. Settlement-building in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, seen as an obstacle to Palestinian statehood, surged under his presidency. Trump also helped secure agreements between Israel and four Arab countries to normalize ties that were not contingent on progress toward Palestinian statehood — a major victory for Netanyahu. The Israeli leader hopes to replicate those successes with a deal with Saudi Arabia. The leaders had a falling out after Netanyahu congratulated President Joe Biden following the 2020 elections — a move Trump viewed as a slight from his loyal ally, though Netanyahu visited Trump in Florida this year. Under Biden, the U.S. has been critical at times and slowed some weapons deliveries in response to Israel's conduct in Gaza. Netanyahu is likely hoping that Trump's return will loosen any restraints on Israel to pursue its war goals. The American leader could also work to challenge a potential international war crimes arrest warrant for Netanyahu. And a smoother relationship with Washington could help improve the Israeli leader's own popular support. 'He has the most pro-Israel record of any president,' said Michael Oren, a former Israeli ambassador to Washington. 'The hope is here that there’ll be more of the same.' Neither Netanyahu nor Trump has a clear vision for postwar Gaza Netanyahu leads a far-right government whose key members have vowed to topple his rule if the war in Gaza ends with anything short of Hamas' destruction. They support resettling Gaza and are enthusiastic about a Trump presidency — and their influence will only grow now that Netanyahu has fired his defense minister over his more pragmatic approach to the conflict. Their grip on the government and over Netanyahu’s political future helps explain why Netanyahu has not spelled out a clear vision for a postwar Gaza. The Biden administration has favored having the war-ravaged territory governed by the Western-backed Palestinian Authority, which administers parts of the West Bank. Netanyahu has rejected that idea and insists on the right for the Israeli military to operate there. Trump has not outlined a clear vision, although he has said developers could make Gaza 'better than Monaco' because it has 'the best location in the Middle East, the best water, the best everything.' Diana Buttu, a former adviser to Palestinian leaders, said a lack of a firm U.S. vision for Gaza, coupled with a politically powerful Israeli far right, made the future for people in Gaza and for Palestinians in general grim. 'I don’t see this as a president who is going to care about Palestinians,' she said. Will Trump help defend Israel against Iran or choose America first? In Lebanon, Israel is battling the Iranian-backed Hezbollah with both a ground invasion and strikes on Hezbollah targets. The militant group has fired thousands of rockets and drones at Israeli communities, killing dozens and displacing 60,000. Israel’s offensive, meanwhile, has displaced over 1 million people in Lebanon and killed more than 3,000. U.S. mediation efforts there too have been fruitless. Trump, who has a Lebanese-American son-in-law, recently posted on the social platform X that as president he would 'stop the suffering and destruction in Lebanon.' But a key question is how much Trump will be swayed by his America First instincts. The U.S. has played a central role in diplomatic efforts throughout the war, and an even more robust role in helping Israel defend itself against Iran and its allies. The U.S. has sent military assets to the region, helped Israel thwart two missile attacks by Iran and even has U.S. soldiers in Israel to operate a sophisticated air defense system. But any effective Israeli attack on Iran’s nuclear facilities, a target it avoided in its strike last month, will likely need greater U.S. military involvement. Accusations that Iran has hacked campaign associates and concerns about the potential for Tehran to carry out violence against Trump or members of his administration could deepen his antipathy toward the country. While Trump has indicated he will focus on domestic affairs, the Mideast could be an outlier. He enjoys a wide base of support from evangelical Christians, who are staunchly pro-Israel, and his son-in-law and former adviser Jared Kushner was a prominent voice in support of the country in his first administration. 'As Trump is likely to navigate between those forces mostly based on his intuition,' said Udi Sommer, an expert on U.S.-Israel relations at Tel Aviv University, 'uncertainty will likely define his approach.'	https://apnews.com/article/trump-mideast-netanyahu-israel-gaza-iran-wars-2e37305522d19bdc34e956586cce99bd	2024-11-06T06:13:55-08:00	
4 dead, 25 survivors in Greece after migrant smuggler allegedly forced his passengers overboard	ATHENS, Greece (AP) — Greek authorities have recovered the bodies of four people from the sea just off the coast of the eastern Aegean island of Rhodes, while another 25 people have been found alive on land after a migrant smuggler allegedly forced his passengers overboard while transferring them from Turkey to Greece, the coast guard said Wednesday. The bodies of three men and one woman were recovered near the coast on the southern tip of Rhodes early Wednesday, the coast guard said. The group of 25 survivors were found on land, with police originally locating an initial group of 11 people shortly after midnight, and the rest found afterwards. Survivors told authorities they had been traveling to the Greek island from the nearby Turkish coast by speedboat when the smuggler driving the vessel forced them overboard into the water and left, the coast guard said. A search and rescue operation in the area was called off Wednesday afternoon once authorities ascertained from survivors that there were no further people missing. The nationalities of the passengers weren't immediately known. It was the latest fatal case involving migrants trying to make their way into the European Union using the sea route either from the nearby Turkish coast or across the Mediterranean from North Africa. Greece lies on a popular route into the European Union for people fleeing war and poverty in Africa, Asia and the Middle East, with tens of thousands heading to Greek islands, usually in smuggling boats from the nearby Turkish coast, or making the longer and more treacherous journey across the Mediterranean from North Africa. Migration Minister Nikos Panagiotopoulos has said the government is seeking stricter EU migration policies and is considering creating detention facilities on the islands of Rhodes and Crete after the rate of arrivals by sea has more than doubled, starting last fall. Just over 50,000 migrants were registered as having arrived in Greece by early November, with more than 43,000 of them arriving by sea, according to figures from the U.N. refugee agency. ___ Follow AP’s global migration coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/migration	https://apnews.com/article/migration-greece-rhodes-people-thrown-overboard-85e32a23ecc264ca3640f93f807d8179	2024-11-06T05:35:38-08:00	
Lebanon files complaint against Israel at UN labor body over deadly pager explosions	GENEVA (AP) — Lebanon filed a complaint against Israel at the U.N.’s labor organization over the string of deadly attacks involving exploding pagers, saying workers were among those killed and injured, a Lebanese government minister said Wednesday. The wave of remotely triggered explosions that hit pagers and walkie-talkies carried by Hezbollah members in mid-September were widely blamed on Israel, which has neither confirmed nor denied involvement. The blasts which went off in grocery stores, homes and on streets killed at least 37 people, including two children, and wounded around 3,000 people, according to Lebanese authorities, deeply unsettling even Lebanese who have no Hezbollah affiliation. In addition to fighters, the detonating devices hit workers in Hezbollah’s civilian institutions, including its health care and media operations. Lebanese Labor Minister Moustafa Bayram and other officials said he traveled to Geneva and formally filed the complaint Tuesday against Israel at the International Labor Organization, a sprawling U.N. agency that brings together governments, businesses and workers. 'This method of warfare and conflicts may open the way for many who are evading international humanitarian law to adopt this method of warfare,' he told reporters at the U.N. compound in Geneva. 'It’s a very dangerous precedent, if not condemned,' he said. 'We are in a situation where ordinary objects — objects used in daily life — become dangerous and lethal.' Speaking in Arabic, Bayram insisted that ILO conventions guarantee the safety and security of workers, who 'were in their workplace and had their pagers or walkies-talkies exploding all of a sudden,' according to an interpreter. 'I do not know where the outcome (of the complaint) will go, but at least we raised our voices to say and warn against this dangerous approach that strikes at human relations and leads to more conflicts,' he added. An ILO spokeswoman said she was not immediately aware of the complaint or what redress might be possible through it.	https://apnews.com/article/lebanon-pagers-explosion-israel-moustafa-bayram-un-bcafb4419834d9d4f83aab3ffd82b1e3	2024-11-06T05:00:56-08:00	
Donald Trump has sweeping plans for a second administration. Here's what he's proposed	WASHINGTON (AP) — Donald Trump has promised sweeping action in a second administration. The former president and now president-elect often skipped over details but through more than a year of policy pronouncements and written statements outlined a wide-ranging agenda that blends traditional conservative approaches to taxes, regulation and cultural issues with a more populist bent on trade and a shift in America's international role. Trump's agenda also would scale back federal government efforts on civil rights and expand presidential powers. A look at what Trump has proposed: Immigration 'Build the wall!' from his 2016 campaign has become creating 'the largest mass deportation program in history.' Trump has called for using the National Guard and empowering domestic police forces in the effort. Still, Trump has been scant on details of what the program would look like and how he would ensure that it targeted only people in the U.S. illegally. He’s pitched 'ideological screening' for would-be entrants, ending birth-right citizenship (which almost certainly would require a constitutional change), and said he’d reinstitute first-term policies such as 'Remain in Mexico,' limiting migrants on public health grounds and severely limiting or banning entrants from certain majority-Muslim nations. Altogether, the approach would not just crack down on illegal migration, but curtail immigration overall. Abortion Trump played down abortion as a second-term priority, even as he took credit for the Supreme Court ending a woman’s federal right to terminate a pregnancy and returning abortion regulation to state governments. At Trump’s insistence, the GOP platform, for the first time in decades, did not call for a national ban on abortion. Trump maintains that overturning Roe v. Wade is enough on the federal level. Still, Trump has not said explicitly that he would veto national abortion restrictions if they reached his desk. And in an example of how the conservative movement might proceed with or without Trump, anti-abortion activists note that the GOP platform still asserts that a fetus should have due process protections under the 14th Amendment’s equal protection clause. That constitutional argument is a roadmap for conservatives to seek a national abortion ban through federal courts. Taxes Trump’s tax policies broadly tilt toward corporations and wealthier Americans. That’s mostly due to his promise to extend his 2017 tax overhaul, with a few notable changes that include lowering the corporate income tax rate to 15% from the current 21%. That also involves rolling back Democratic President Joe Biden’s income tax hikes on the wealthiest Americans and scrapping Inflation Reduction Act levies that finance energy measures intended to combat climate change. Those policies notwithstanding, Trump has put more emphasis on new proposals aimed at working- and middle class Americans: exempting earned tips, Social Security wages and overtime wages from income taxes. It’s noteworthy, however, that his proposal on tips, depending on how Congress might write it, could give a back-door tax break to top wage earners by allowing them to reclassify some of their pay as tip income — a prospect that at its most extreme could see hedge-fund managers or top-flight attorneys taking advantage of a policy that Trump frames as being designed for restaurant servers, bartenders and other service workers. Tariffs and trade Trump’s posture on international trade is to distrust world markets as harmful to American interests. He proposes tariffs of 10% to 20% on foreign goods — and in some speeches has mentioned even higher percentages. He promises to reinstitute an August 2020 executive order requiring that the Food and Drug Administration buy 'essential' medications only from U.S. companies. He pledges to block purchases of 'any vital infrastructure' in the U.S. by Chinese buyers. DEI, LGBTQ and civil rights Trump has called for rolling back societal emphasis on diversity and for legal protections for LGBTQ citizens. Trump has called for ending diversity, equity and inclusion programs in government institutions, using federal funding as leverage. On transgender rights, Trump promises generally to end 'boys in girls’ sports,' a practice he insists, without evidence, is widespread. But his policies go well beyond standard applause lines from his rally speeches. Among other ideas, Trump would roll back the Biden administration’s policy of extending Title IX civil rights protections to transgender students, and he would ask Congress to require that only two genders can be recognized at birth. Regulation, federal bureaucracy and presidential power The president-elect seeks to reduce the role of federal bureaucrats and regulations across economic sectors. Trump frames all regulatory cuts as an economic magic wand. He pledges precipitous drops in U.S. households’ utility bills by removing obstacles to fossil fuel production, including opening all federal lands for exploration — even though U.S. energy production is already at record highs. Trump promises to unleash housing construction by cutting regulations — though most construction rules come from state and local government. He also says he would end 'frivolous litigation from the environmental extremists.' The approach would in many ways strengthen executive branch influence. That power would come more directly from the White House. He would make it easier to fire federal workers by classifying thousands of them as being outside civil service protections. That could weaken the government’s power to enforce statutes and rules by reducing the number of employees engaging in the work and, potentially, impose a chilling effect on those who remain. Trump also claims that presidents have exclusive power to control federal spending even after Congress has appropriated money. Trump argues that lawmakers’ budget actions 'set a ceiling' on spending but not a floor — meaning the president’s constitutional duty to 'faithfully execute the laws' includes discretion on whether to spend the money. This interpretation could set up a court battle with Congress. As a candidate, he also suggested that the Federal Reserve, an independent entity that sets interest rates, should be subject to more presidential power. Though he has not offered details, any such move would represent a momentous change to how the U.S. economic and monetary systems work. Education The federal Department of Education would be targeted for elimination in a second Trump administration. That does not mean that Trump wants Washington out of classrooms. He still proposes, among other maneuvers, using federal funding as leverage to pressure K-12 school systems to abolish tenure and adopt merit pay for teachers and to scrap diversity programs at all levels of education. He calls for pulling federal funding 'for any school or program pushing Critical Race Theory, gender ideology, or other inappropriate racial, sexual, or political content on our children.' In higher education, Trump proposes taking over accreditation processes for colleges, a move he describes as his 'secret weapon' against the 'Marxist Maniacs and lunatics' he says control higher education. Trump takes aim at higher education endowments, saying he will collect 'billions and billions of dollars' from schools via 'taxing, fining and suing excessively large private university endowments' at schools that do not comply with his edicts. That almost certainly would end up in protracted legal fights. As in other policy areas, Trump isn’t actually proposing limiting federal power in higher education but strengthening it. He calls for redirecting the confiscated endowment money into an online 'American Academy' offering college credentials to all Americans without a tuition charges. 'It will be strictly non-political, and there will be no wokeness or jihadism allowed—none of that’s going to be allowed,' Trump said on Nov. 1, 2023. Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid Trump insists he would protect Social Security and Medicare, popular programs geared toward older Americans and among the biggest pieces of the federal spending pie each year. There are questions about how his proposal not to tax tip and overtime wages might affect Social Security and Medicare. If such plans eventually involved only income taxes, the entitlement programs would not be affected. But exempting those wages from payroll taxes would reduce the funding stream for Social Security and Medicare outlays. Trump has talked little about Medicaid but his first administration, in general, defaulted to approving state requests for waivers of various federal rules and it broadly endorsed state-level work requirements for recipients. Affordable Care Act and Health Care As he has since 2015, Trump calls for repealing the Affordable Care Act and its subsidized health insurance marketplaces. But he still has not proposed a replacement: In a September debate, he insisted he had the 'concepts of a plan.' In the latter stages of the campaign, Trump played up his alliance with former presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime critic of vaccines and of pesticides used in U.S. agriculture. Trump repeatedly told rally crowds that he would put Kennedy in charge of 'making America healthy again.' Climate and energy Trump, who claims falsely that climate change is a 'hoax,' blasts Biden-era spending on cleaner energy designed to reduce U.S. reliance on fossil fuels. He proposes an energy policy – and transportation infrastructure spending – anchored to fossil fuels: roads, bridges and combustion-engine vehicles. 'Drill, baby, drill!' was a regular chant at Trump rallies. Trump says he does not oppose electric vehicles but promises to end all Biden incentives to encourage EV market development. Trump also pledges to roll back Biden-era fuel efficiency standards. Workers’ rights Trump and Vice President-elect JD Vance framed their ticket as favoring America’s workers. But Trump could make it harder for workers to unionize. In discussing auto workers, Trump focused almost exclusively on Biden’s push toward electric vehicles. When he mentioned unions, it was often to lump 'the union bosses and CEOs' together as complicit in 'this disastrous electric car scheme.' In an Oct. 23, 2023, statement, Trump said of United Auto Workers, 'I’m telling you, you shouldn’t pay those dues.' National defense and America’s role in the world Trump’s rhetoric and policy approach in world affairs is more isolationist diplomatically, non-interventionist militarily and protectionist economically than the U.S. has been since World War II. But the details are more complicated. He pledges expansion of the military, promises to protect Pentagon spending from austerity efforts and proposes a new missile defense shield — an old idea from the Reagan era during the Cold War. Trump insists he can end Russia’s war in Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas war, without explaining how. Trump summarizes his approach through another Reagan phrase: 'peace through strength.' But he remains critical of NATO and top U.S. military brass. 'I don’t consider them leaders,' Trump said of Pentagon officials that Americans 'see on television.' He repeatedly praised authoritarians like Hungary’s Viktor Orban and Russia’s Vladimir Putin.	https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-wins-second-term-policies-de3dcf0f173b42602b258042fd7aaafb	2024-11-06T03:38:40-08:00	
On Ukraine's front and in Kyiv, hope and pragmatism compete when it comes to Trump's election	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Soldiers in a Ukrainian artillery battery on the front lines of the country’s east were only vaguely aware of American election results pointing to Donald Trump’s victory Wednesday — but firm in their hopes for the next president of the United States. Their entrenched artillery battery fires on Russian forces daily — and takes fire nearly as often. Just the other day, one of their overhead nets snared a Russian drone. 'I hope that the quantity of weapons, the quantity of guns for our victory will increase,' the unit's 39-year-old commander, who goes by the name Mozart, said in the hours before Trump’s win was confirmed. 'We don't care who is the president, as long as they don't cut us off from help, because we need it.' Though Trump's election throws into doubt American support for Ukraine — and ultimately whether Kyiv can beat back Russia's invasion — the soldiers who use their Starlink connection to the internet sparingly learned of the results from Associated Press journalists. Mozart — who like other soldiers Wednesday did not give his name in keeping with Ukrainian military protocol and has given musical monikers to the battlefield positions — is among many Ukrainians who hope that Trump will hold the line on American support for their country. Russian forces have recently made gains in the east, although the commander described the front-line situation as 'static.' It was under Trump that the United States first sent weapons to Ukraine in its fight against Russia, in 2017. Those Javelin anti-tank missiles were crucial to Ukraine's ability to fend off the full-scale invasion in 2022. But Trump overall is wary of U.S. involvement in foreign conflicts. Trump, who has touted his good relationship with President Vladimir Putin and called the Russian leader 'pretty smart' for invading Ukraine, has repeatedly criticized American backing of Ukraine. He characterized Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as 'the greatest salesman on Earth' for winning U.S. aid. Zelenskyy was among the first world leaders to publicly congratulate Trump and said the two discussed how to end 'Russian aggression against Ukraine' when they met in September. 'I appreciate President Trump’s commitment to the ‘peace through strength’ approach in global affairs. This is exactly the principle that can practically bring just peace in Ukraine closer. I am hopeful that we will put it into action together,' he wrote on the social platform X. Trump has said repeatedly he would have a peace deal done between Ukraine and Russia within a day if elected, although he has not said how. During his debate with Vice President Kamala Harris, he twice refused to directly answer a question about whether he wanted Ukraine to win — raising concerns that Kyiv would be forced to accept unfavorable terms in any negotiations he oversaw. In Kyiv, which comes under attack from Russian drones near daily, 18-year-old Viktoriia Zubrytska was pragmatic about her expectations for the next American president. She thinks Ukraine will be forced to give up territory in exchange for peace under a Trump presidency. But she said she preferred that to what she called the false hope that the Biden administration offered. 'We will live in a world of facts where we will be certain on what awaits us,' said the law student. 'Certainty and objective truth is much better than lies and life in illusions.' According to VoteCast, 74% of voters who supported Harris favored continuing aid to Ukraine, while only 36% of Trump’s voters did. AP VoteCast is a survey of the American electorate conducted by NORC at the University of Chicago. On the front lines in Ukraine's eastern Kharkiv region, Andriy, who goes by 'Rodych' or 'Relative,' was resigned to the fact that he has no power to influence the American vote. 'We will come up with something' whatever happens, he said. 'We are a shield between Europe and Russia,' he added. 'Other countries do not understand what is happening here, they see it on TV and for them it is far away.' America's NATO allies were also closely watching the election. France and Germany arranged a last-minute, top-level defense meeting Wednesday in Paris to discuss the results, and Ukraine is likely to be central to the meeting. The two leading powers in the European Union provide significant support to Ukraine to defend it against Russia’s war. NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte, citing a 'more aggressive Russia,' also invoked Trump's motto of 'peace through strength.' Rutte praised Trump for his work during his first term to persuade countries in the alliance to ramp up defense spending. In Moscow, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said he had no information on whether Putin plans to congratulate Trump but emphasized that Moscow views the U.S. as an 'unfriendly' country. Peskov reaffirmed the Kremlin’s claim that the U.S. support for Ukraine amounted to its involvement in the conflict, telling reporters: 'Let’s not forget that we are talking about, the unfriendly country that is both directly and indirectly involved in a war against our state.' Still, he noted Trump's promise to end the war swiftly once elected. 'The U.S. can help end the conflict,' Peskov said, adding that 'it certainly can’t be done overnight.' ___ Konovalov reported from the Kharkiv region.

Rescuers pull 30 bodies from a building in central Lebanon hit in an Israeli strike	BARJA, Lebanon (AP) — Lebanese rescuers pulled 30 bodies out of the rubble after a late night Israeli strike on an apartment building in the town of Barja, Lebanon’s Civil Defense service said Wednesday as the Mideast wars press on with no signs of abating. It remained unclear if there were any survivors or bodies still trapped under the rubble following the Tuesday night airstrike, which came without warning. There was no statement from the Israeli military and the strike's intended target also was unknown. Barja, a town just north of the port city of Sidon in central Lebanon, has not been regularly targeted so far in the conflict. 'Something pulled me hard, and then the explosion happened,' said Moussa Zahran, who was at home with his wife and son when the building was hit. He said he couldn't see but started digging through the rubble until he found his wife and son — alive but injured — and pulled them out. Both are still in the hospital, he said. Another building resident, Muhyiddin Al- Qalaaji, said he was at work when the strike happened and heard the news from his wife who called him frantically. 'There are many dead and injured,' he said as he carried out what he could salvage of the family's belongings on Wednesday morning. Civil defense official Mostafa Danaj said some of the neighbors have reported there are still people missing. Israeli forces and the Hezbollah militant group have been clashing for more than a year, since Hezbollah started firing rockets across the border soon after the Palestinian Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023 attack from Gaza into southern Israel sparked the ongoing war there. The war on the Lebanese front has substantially escalated since mid-September, with Israel launching a massive aerial bombardment and ground invasion. On Wednesday, sirens blared across northern and central Israel, including in the populous metropolitan area of Tel Aviv, as Hezbollah launched 10 rockets. There were no reports of injuries. A large portion of a rocket slammed into a parked car in the central Israeli city of Raanana. Rockets also struck an open area near Israel’s main airport, Israeli media reported, though the airport said flights were operating as normally. On Tuesday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu dismissed Defense Minister Yoav Gallant in a surprise announcement that sparked protests across the country. Gallant’s replacement is Foreign Minister Israel Katz, a longtime Netanyahu loyalist and veteran Cabinet minister. Israeli police said they arrested 40 people during protests on Tuesday night when the demonstrators blocked Israel’s main highway in Tel Aviv. Another night of protests over Gallant’s firing was planned across Israel on Wednesday evening. Netanyahu and Gallant have repeatedly been at odds over the war in Gaza but the prime minister had avoided letting go of his rival before the U.S. presidential election on Tuesday, in which former President Donald Trump made a comeback victory. Gallant had pushed back on some of Netanyahu's demands during indirect negotiations with Hamas over a cease-fire and hostage release, and was seen as more open to reaching at least a temporary truce. The Hamas attack that triggered the war killed some 1,200 people — mostly civilians — and Palestinian militants abducted 250 others that day. Around 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, around a third of whom are believed to be dead. Israel’s offensive has killed more than 43,000 people, Palestinian health officials say. They do not distinguish between civilians and combatants, but say more than half of those killed were women and children. Since the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah erupted in 2023, at least 3,000 people have been killed and some 13,500 have been wounded in Lebanon, about a quarter of them women and children, the Health Ministry reported. Hezbollah continues to send dozens of rockets and drones towards Israel. The projectiles have killed 72 people in Israel so far, including 30 soldiers, according to Netanyahu’s office. ___ Associated Press writers Abby Sewell in Beirut and Melanie Lidman in Tel Aviv, Israel, contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-lebanon-hezbollah-iran-11-06-2024-75daf6b9a4214ff64de58a4314b00e5b	2024-11-06T02:16:46-08:00	
Global leaders congratulate Trump but his victory looks set to roil the world -- again	LONDON (AP) — The verdict of U.S. voters was more decisive than most pollsters and pundits had predicted. Now the world waits to see whether the election of Donald Trump as president for a second time will prove as destabilizing as many American allies fear. Trump secured victory Wednesday when he surpassed the 270 electoral college votes needed to win. In a victory speech before the official declaration, he vowed to 'put our country first' and bring about a 'golden age' for America. Trump’s first term saw him insult and alienate many of the United States’ longstanding allies. His return to the White House, four years after losing office to President Joe Biden, has huge consequences for everything from global trade to climate change to multiple crises and conflicts around the world. Trump has pledged to ramp up a tariff feud with China, the United States’ growing economic and strategic rival. In the Middle East, Trump has pledged, without saying how, to end the conflicts between Israel, Hamas and Hezbollah. He has also vowed to end the Russia-Ukraine war within 24 hours of taking office – something Ukraine and its supporters fear would be on terms favorable to Moscow. Here’s how leaders and others around the world are reacting: NATO is nervous and Ukraine is anxious NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte congratulated Trump, saying, 'I look forward to working with him again to advance peace through strength through NATO' in the face of 'a growing number of challenges globally,' including 'the increasing alignment of China, Russia, North Korea and Iran.' Trump was a strong critic of the North Atlantic military alliance during his first term, accusing its other members of failing to pull their weight. Earlier this year he said the United States would not defend NATO members that don’t meet defense spending targets. Rutte emphasized the positive, praising Trump for his work persuading member states to ramp up defense spending and saying NATO was now 'stronger, larger, and more united.' America’s allies are — belatedly, some say — grappling with what to do if they cannot depend on the U.S. for their defense. 'The existential concern for Europeans has been what happens to Ukraine, what happens to Europe’s security, what happens to America’s commitment to NATO?' said Leslie Vinjamuri, director of the U.S. and Americas program at the think tank Chatham House. 'Will America be there for Europe?' The U.S. is by far Kyiv’s biggest military backer as it battles Russian invasion, though the Biden administration resisted pressure from President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to do even more. Zelenskyy, like Rutte, said he welcomed Trump’s 'peace through strength' approach. 'This is exactly the principle that can practically bring just peace in Ukraine closer,' Zelenskyy wrote on social media. 'I am hopeful that we will put it into action together. We look forward to an era of a strong United States of America under President Trump’s decisive leadership.' No congratulations were forthcoming from Moscow, where President Vladimir Putin’s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, declared that Russia-U.S. relations were at the 'lowest point in history.' European congratulations mask deep divisions European leaders rushed to congratulate Trump even before his victory was officially declared — some more effusively than others. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer called it a 'historic election victory' and said that 'as the closest of allies, the U.K. and U.S. will continue to work together to protect our shared values of freedom and democracy.' Like governments of U.S. allies around the world, Starmer’s center-left administration has worked hard to forge ties with Trump and his team. Starmer had dinner with Trump at Trump Tower in September. France’s centrist President Emmanuel Macron offered congratulations, 'respect and ambition.' Social Democratic German Chancellor Olaf Scholz congratulated Trump and said he wanted continued close ties, even if 'surely many things will be different under a Donald Trump-led administration.' Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni, whose far right-led government is in some ways close to Trump politically, said Italy and the U.S. had a 'strategic bond, which I am sure we will now strengthen even more.' European leaders are keen to stress that the transatlantic relationship transcends individual politicians, but Trump’s protectionist economic leanings are causing concern. During his last term he slapped tariffs on European steel and aluminum, roiling the bloc’s economy. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen stressed that the EU and the U.S. 'are bound by a true partnership between our people, uniting 800 million citizens. Let us work together on a transatlantic partnership that continues to deliver for our citizens.' Europe’s populist politicians, meanwhile, welcomed the victory of a politician they consider a kindred spirit. 'They threatened him with prison, they took his property, they wanted to kill him ... and he still won,' said Hungary’s nationalist Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, who will hold a summit in Budapest for some 50 European leaders on Thursday. A Middle East in turmoil awaits Trump’s moves During his first term, Trump pushed to remake the Middle East by reconciling Israel and Saudi Arabia, and all eyes now are on how he intervenes in the region’s raging conflicts between Israel and Hamas in Gaza and Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon — and the chief backer of the two militant groups, Iran. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called Trump’s election win 'history’s greatest comeback.' 'Your historic return to the White House offers a new beginning for America and a powerful recommitment to the great alliance between Israel and America. This is a huge victory!' he wrote on social media. Trump and Netanyahu — a fellow conservative nationalist — had a tight relationship during the former president’s first term, but the ties soured when Netanyahu congratulated President Joe Biden on winning in 2020. Netanyahu’s inner circle hopes Trump will allow Israel free rein against its enemies, but the president-elect is famously unpredictable, and the Israeli leader faces strong opposition at home. On Tuesday he fired popular Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, a surprise announcement that sparked protests across the country. Hamas issued a terse statement saying, 'Our position on the new U.S. administration depends on its positions and practical behavior towards our Palestinian people, their legitimate rights and their just cause.' Washington is one of the key mediators of so-far unsuccessful Gaza cease-fire talks and has publicly accused Hamas of turning down several deals. Hamas has denied this, blaming Israel for demanding last-minute changes to the proposals. The challenge of China still looms The Chinese government said its approach to the U.S. was unchanged by Trump's victory. 'We will continue to view and handle China-U.S. relations in accordance with the principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and cooperation for win-win,' said foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning. But analysts in China were pessimistic, citing the likelihood of escalating tariffs and an intensifying confrontation over Taiwan. 'It is not all dark, but there are more challenges than opportunities,' said Da Wei, director of the Center for International Security and Strategy at Tsinghua University in Beijing. 'We are clear about the challenges. As for opportunities, we are yet to see them clearly.' Long-seething territorial disputes in the South China Sea are a fault line in the U.S.-China rivalry in Asia and likely will remain a major foreign policy concern for the next American president. Phillips O’Brien, professor of strategic studies at the University of St. Andrews, said Washington's allies in the Indo-Pacific, including Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and even Australia, 'can no longer look for the U.S.A. to be a reliable partner in defense.' Asian leaders apprehensive about China’s growing clout and North Korea's nuclear program, clamored for Trump’s attention in congratulatory messages. 'I hope to closely cooperate with President-elect Trump to further elevate Japan-U.S. alliance and relations to even higher levels,' Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba said. South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol said the Korea-U.S. alliance 'will shine brighter,' under Trump's 'strong leadership.' Neighbors hope for good relations The United States’ neighbors in the Americas, some of whom bore the impact of Trump's protectionist instincts during his first term, also braced for uncertainty. Mexico’s President Claudia Sheinbaum told Mexicans 'there is no reason to worry,' despite Trump’s previous threats to impose trade tariffs on Mexican products unless the country does more to stem the flow of migrants and drugs to the U.S. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau — previously derided by Trump as 'weak' and 'dishonest' — wrote on X: 'The friendship between Canada and the U.S. is the envy of the world. I know President Trump and I will work together to create more opportunity, prosperity, and security for both of our nations.' ___ Associated Press writers around the world contributed to this story.	https://apnews.com/article/us-election-trump-global-reaction-7f7d4c5f6b84f263d7c49bb4978ab418	2024-11-06T01:53:29-08:00	
Germany's quarrelsome government meets in last-minute effort to find solution for its ailing economy	BERLIN (AP) — The leaders of Germany’s quarrelsome governing coalition are meeting again on Wednesday in another last-minute effort to find a joint solution to fix the country's struggling economy. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz of the center-left Social Democrats, Finance Minister Christian Lindner of the pro-business Free Democrats and Economy Minister Robert Habeck of the environmentalist Greens want to boost the economy but are at odds over how to do it. A meeting of the coalition committee later Wednesday will focus on how the billion-euro hole in the 2025 budget can be plugged and how the German economy can be put back on track. However, they disagree fundamentally over how to kickstart the economy again, and after weeks of government infighting many Germans wonder if the current government will actually survive the coming 11 months before the next election is due. Uncoordinated summit meetings and differing proposals by the leaders have fueled the conflict among the coalition partners. If the leaders fail to reach an agreement later on Wednesday, the government could be on the brink of collapse. Scholz appealed to all coalition partners to find a solution and prioritize the country over different party convictions. 'As far as the situation of the government’s further work is concerned, it is about feeling committed to the country, not about ideology,' he said Tuesday in Berlin. 'And it is clear that we can. In this respect, the question is not whether it can be done at all, but whether it is possible, and everyone has to work on that now.' The Free Democrats have pushed for changes in the country's economic policy, some of which Lindner expressed in an 18-page paper last week that was leaked to the media. The party categorically rejects tax increases or changes to Germany’s strict self-imposed limits on running up debt, and say it’s time to save money — for example, on benefits for the long-term unemployed. Politicians on the left want to see massive state investment and reject talk of cutting welfare programs and many other ideas Lindner proposed in his paper last week. Germany's economy is expected to shrink in 2024 for the second year in a row, or at best stagnate, battered by external shocks and home-grown problems including red tape and a shortage of skilled labor.	https://apnews.com/article/germany-scholz-government-struggling-economy-coalition-lindner-1cae2cd0266453103fc89800e47e7ce7	2024-11-06T00:47:27-08:00	
Russia ratifies North Korea pact after US says up to 10,000 North Korean troops deployed to Kursk	MOSCOW (AP) — The upper house of Russian parliament on Wednesday ratified a treaty with North Korea envisioning mutual military assistance, a move that comes as the U.S. has confirmed the deployment of 10,000 North Korean troops to Russia. The 'comprehensive strategic partnership treaty,' which Russian President Vladimir Putin signed with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on a visit to Pyongyang in June, obliges Russia and North Korea to immediately provide military assistance using 'all means' if either is attacked. It marked the strongest link between Moscow and Pyongyang since the end of the Cold War. The pact's endorsement by the upper house, the Federation Council, follows its ratification by the lower house, the State Duma, on Oct. 24. On Monday, U.S. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller told reporters that up to 10,000 North Korean soldiers were in Russia’s Kursk region and were preparing to join Moscow’s fight against Ukraine in the coming days. If they engage in combat, it would be North Korea’s first participation in a large-scale conflict since the end of the 1950-53 Korean War. Moscow and Pyongyang have responded vaguely to South Korean and Western claims of the North Korean troop deployment to Russia, emphasizing that their military cooperation conforms with international law, without directly admitting the presence of the North’s forces in Russia. On Monday, Putin met with North Korean Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui, who was on an official visit to Russia since late last week. During her talks with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, Choe reiterated Pyongyang’s support 'for the just fight of Russia’s military and people to defend their country’s sovereign rights and security interests' in Ukraine. Russia and North Korea have previously rejected assertions by the U.S. and its allies that Pyongyang has given Moscow ballistic missiles and millions of artillery shells for use in Ukraine. South Korean and Western officials voiced concerns about Russia’s possible transfer of technology to North Korea to enhance its nuclear and missile programs in exchange for its troops. On Tuesday, North Korea fired a barrage of short-range ballistic missiles into the sea in a demonstration of its military capability hours before the U.S. presidential election.	https://apnews.com/article/russia-north-korea-treaty-ratification-ukraine-fighting-bcf2a2ac3a45560e90fce586b010e05c	2024-11-06T00:26:32-08:00	
Middle East latest: Rescue workers pull 30 bodies from apartments in Lebanon after Israeli strike	Lebanon’s Civil Defense service says they have pulled 30 bodies from the rubble of an apartment building that Israel struck the night before. Search efforts were ongoing Wednesday, and it was unclear how many survivors or bodies were still trapped under the rubble. The airstrike Tuesday night came without warning. There was no statement from the Israeli military on the strike, and it was not immediately clear what the intended target was. On Tuesday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu dismissed Defense Minister Yoav Gallant in a surprise announcement that sparked protests across the country. Gallant’s replacement is Foreign Minister Israel Katz, a longtime Netanyahu loyalist and veteran Cabinet minister. While Netanyahu has called for continued military pressure on Hamas, Gallant said military force created the necessary conditions for at least a temporary diplomatic deal that could bring home hostages held by the militant group. The Israel-Hamas war began after Palestinian militants stormed into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people — mostly civilians — and abducting 250 others. Israel's military response in Gaza has killed more than 43,000 people, Palestinian health officials say. They do not distinguish between civilians and combatants, but say more than half of those killed were women and children. Since the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah erupted in 2023, at least 3,000 people have been killed and some 13,500 wounded in Lebanon, the Health Ministry reported. A report by Lebanon’s crisis response unit said 361,300 Syrians and over 177,800 Lebanese crossed into Syria between Sept. 23 and Nov. 1. ___ Here’s the latest: Hezbollah leader says group is not concerned with results of US election BEIRUT — Hezbollah’s leader Naim Kassem said in a speech aired Wednesday the Lebanese militant group 'is not basing its expectations on the results of the American elections.' 'We will make the enemy seek to demand an end to the aggression,' Kassem said, speaking from an undisclosed location in a pre-recorded televised address. 'Our military capabilities are available for a long time, and we do not rely on the results of the American elections.' His speech marked the 40-day mourning period since former Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah was assassinated in Beirut. 'Whether Harris wins or Trump wins, they have no value to us,' Kassem said. He said that Hezbollah is open for cease-fire negotiations only once 'the enemy stops its aggression.' 'The only thing that will stop the war is the battlefield,' he said. U.S. envoy Amos Hochstein visited Israel nearly a week ago, raising hopes for an imminent cease-fire between Hezbollah and Israel. However, he immediately returned to the U.S. without traveling to Lebanon, which many saw as a sign of a setback. As Kassem spoke, the Israeli army issued evacuation warnings for three buildings in Burj al-Barajneh, a district in Beirut’s southern suburbs with a strong Hezbollah presence. Since the hostilities escalation, the suburb has faced repeated Israeli strikes, which have leveled hundreds of buildings. Hezbollah rockets target Israel, reaching as far as Tel Aviv and central city of Raanana JERUSALEM — Sirens blared across northern and central Israel on Wednesday, including in the populous metropolitan area of Tel Aviv, as Hezbollah launched 10 rockets towards Israel. Israel’s Magen David Adom rescue services said there were no reports of injuries. A large portion of a rocket slammed into a parked car in the central Israeli city of Raanana. Rockets also struck an open area near Israel’s main airport, Israeli media reported, though the airport said flights were operating as normally. Israel’s Magen David Adom rescue services said there were no injuries. Israeli police said they arrested 40 people during protests on Tuesday night when the demonstrators blocked Israel’s main highway in Tel Aviv. The Lebanese militant group Hezbollah continues to send dozens of rockets and drones towards Israel. The projectiles have killed 72 people in Israel so far, including 30 soldiers, according to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office. 30 bodies are pulled from the rubble of a Lebanon apartment building struck by Israel BEIRUT — Lebanon’s Civil Defense service said Wednesday they have pulled 30 bodies and remains out of the rubble of an apartment building in the town of Barja that Israel struck the night before. Search efforts were ongoing. The airstrike Tuesday hit an area that had not been regularly targeted by Israeli military operations. It came without warning. There was no statement from the Israeli military on the strike, and it was not immediately clear what the intended target was. Civil defense official Mostafa Danaj said it was unclear how many survivors or bodies were still trapped under the rubble. 'We hope that there isn’t anyone else, but the neighbors have said that there are still people (missing),' he said. Israeli forces and the Hezbollah militant group have been clashing for more than a year, since Hezbollah started firing rockets across the border on Oct. 8, 2023 — a day after the deadly Hamas-led incursion into southern Israel sparked the war in Gaza. The war on the Lebanese front has substantially escalated since mid-September, with Israel launching a massive aerial bombardment of much of Lebanon and a ground invasion. More than 3,000 people have been killed by Israeli strikes in Lebanon, the vast majority of them since Sept. 23. Israel has said it targets Hezbollah militants and weapons caches, but hundreds of civilians have also been killed. ___ For more Middle East news: https://apnews.com/hub/middle-east	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-hezbollah-mideast-latest-6-november-2024-64bae4547ba0dca7042cf87d32e55cc1	2024-11-06T00:25:12-08:00	
Iran's currency falls to an all-time low as Trump is on the verge of clinching the US presidency	TEHRAN, Iran (AP) — Iran’s currency fell on Wednesday to an all-time low as former President Donald Trump was on the verge of clinching the U.S. presidency again, signaling new challenges ahead for Tehran as it remains locked in the wars raging in the Middle East. The rial traded at 703,000 rials to the dollar, traders in Tehran said. The rate could still change throughout the day. Iran’s Central Bank could flood the market with more hard currencies as an attempt to improve the rate, as it has done in the past. The slide comes as the rial already faces considerable woes over its sharp slide in value. In 2015, at the time of Iran's nuclear deal with world powers, the rial was at 32,000 to $1. On July 30, the day that Iran's reformist President Masoud Pezeshkian was sworn in and started his term, the rate was 584,000 to $1. Trump unilaterally withdrew America from the accord in 2018, sparking years of tensions between the countries that persist today. Iran's economy has struggled for years under crippling international sanctions over its rapidly advancing nuclear program, which now enriches uranium at near weapons-grade levels. Pezeshkian, elected after a helicopter crash killed hard-line President Ebrahim Raisi in May, came to power on a promise to reach a deal to ease Western sanctions. However, Iran's government has for weeks been trying to downplay the effect on Tehran of whoever won Tuesday's election in the United States. That stance continued on Wednesday with a brief comment from Fatemeh Mohajerani, a spokeswoman for Pezeshkian's administration. 'The election of the U.S. president doesn't have anything specifically to do with us,' she said. 'The major policies of America and the Islamic Republic are fixed, and they won’t heavily change by people replacing others. We have already made necessary preparations in advance.' But tensions remain high between the nations, 45 years after the 1979 U.S. Embassy takeover and 444-day hostage crisis that followed. Iran remains locked in the Mideast wars roiling the region, with its allies battered — militant groups and fighters of its self-described 'Axis of Resistance,' including the militant Palestinian Hamas, lebanon's Hezbollah and Yemen's Houthi rebels. Israel is pressing its war in the Gaza Strip targeting Hamas and its invasion of Lebanon amid devastating attacks against Hezbollah. At the same time, Iran still appears to be assessing damage from Israel’s strikes on the Islamic Republic on Oct. 26 in response to two Iranian ballistic missile attacks. Iran has threatened to retaliate against Israel — where U.S. troops now man a missile defense battery. ___ Associated Press writer Jon Gambrell in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/iran-us-election-rial-currency-falls-b9cd891cfb864f51c5c3f2a7735804fc	2024-11-05T23:30:39-08:00	
Australian High Court overturns law that forced scores of migrants to wear tracking bracelets	MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — Australia’s highest court ruled Wednesday that migrants can’t be forced by law to wear electronic tracking bracelets or to comply with curfews. The ruling is a blow to the government, whose lawyers have unsuccessfully argued that laws imposing curfews and tracking technology are justified to protect the community. Five of the seven High Court judges ruled that the tough restrictions placed on more than 100 migrants, usually because of their criminal records, were unconstitutional because the conditions amounted to punishment. The constitution states that punishment must be imposed by judges, not lawmakers. The restrictions were part of emergency laws hastily passed in December in response to another High Court ruling that non-citizens could no longer be detained indefinitely as an alternative to deportation. That ruling in the case of a stateless Rohingya man reversed a 28-year-old High Court precedent that allowed indefinite detention where there were security concerns. Wednesday's ruling means the government can no longer electronically track the more than 200 non-citizens with criminal records who were released and, for a variety of reasons, couldn’t be deported. Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke said he would introduce legislation to Parliament on Thursday that 'will allow for an adjusted process for electronic monitoring devices and curfews to be used.' He did not detail those adjustments. 'The court’s decision is not the one the government wanted — but it is one the government has prepared for,' Burke said in a statement. 'The security and safety of the Australian community will always be the absolute priority for this government,' he added. The latest High Court case was brought by a 36-year-old stateless man, identified as YBFZ, who was born in Eritrea. His family initially fled to Ethiopia because they feared persecution in their homeland as Jehovah’s Witnesses, and they arrived in Australia as refugees in 2002. His refugee visa was canceled in 2017 due to convictions including burglary and recklessly causing injury, part of a criminal record that extended for more than a decade. He was held in custody until 2023, when the High Court outlawed indefinite detention. YBFZ’s lawyer, David Manne, described Wednesday’s verdict as a 'major victory' for fundamental freedoms and the rule of law in Australia. 'This is an important ruling because it underscores the bedrock principle that for everyone, whether citizen or non-citizen, the government does not have the power to punish people by stripping them of their fundamental rights to freedom and dignity,' Manne told reporters. Opposition lawmakers described the High Court decision as an 'embarrassing loss' for the government. 'The effect of this decision will be that 215 dangerous non-citizen offenders including 12 murderers, 66 sex offenders, 97 people convicted of assault, 15 domestic violence perpetrators and others will be free in the community without any monitoring or curfews,' an opposition statement said.	https://apnews.com/article/australia-bracelets-law-overturned-curfews-migrants-69e8b7860fe7da12d98f476e7222f141	2024-11-05T21:30:33-08:00	
The Latest: Trump inches towards a victory, GOP reclaims Senate majority	Republican Donald Trump has won Pennsylvania, Georgia and North Carolina, capturing three of the seven heavily contested battlegrounds and coming within a few electoral votes of winning the presidency. Republicans reclaimed control of the Senate, picking up seats in West Virginia and Ohio. Top House races are focused in New York and California, where Democrats are trying to claw back some of the 10 or so seats where Republicans have made surprising gains in recent years. Follow the AP’s Election 2024 coverage at: https://apnews.com/hub/election-2024. Here’s the latest: Race to control the House intensifies with Michigan flip Republicans have flipped a House seat that was previously held by Democrats, giving them a valuable pickup in a frenzied race for House control. At this point, practically every seat matters when it comes to building a House majority. In Michigan’s 7th district, Republican Tom Barrett picked up a seat that Democratic Rep. Elissa Slotkin vacated to run for U.S. Senate. Barrett, a former state senator, defeated another former state lawmaker, Democrat Curtis Hertel. On the campaign trail, Barrett didn’t back away from his record of supporting abortion restrictions in the statehouse, but he also described abortion access as a settled issue in Michigan. Zelenskyy says he appreciates Trump’s ‘peace through strength’ mentality Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says he appreciates Trump’s commitment to 'peace through strength' as the Republican presidential nominee closes in on the electoral votes needed to win the White House. 'I recall our great meeting with President Trump back in September, when we discussed in detail the Ukraine-U.S. strategic partnership, the Victory Plan, and ways to put an end to Russian aggression against Ukraine,' said Zelenskyy on X. Zelenskyy said that Ukraine is interested 'in developing mutually beneficial political and economic cooperation that will benefit both of our nations.' 'We look forward to an era of a strong United States of America under President Trump’s decisive leadership,' said Zelenskyy. 'I appreciate President Trump’s commitment to the ‘peace through strength’ approach in global affairs. This is exactly the principle that can practically bring just peace in Ukraine closer. I am hopeful that we will put it into action together,' he said. European Commission president says she’s looking forward to working with Trump The European Union’s top official says she’s looking forward to working with Trump again as the former president is on the cusp of victory in the U.S. presidential race. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said that the E.U. and U.S. 'are more than just allies. We are bound by a true partnership between our people, uniting 800 million citizens.' 'Let us work together on a transatlantic partnership that continues to deliver for our citizens. Millions of jobs and billions in trade and investment on each side of the Atlantic depend on the dynamism and stability of our economic relationship,' she said in a statement. The tariffs that Trump slapped on steel and aluminum exports during his last term roiled the bloc’s economy. NATO leader looks forward to working with Trump NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte says he looks forward to working with Trump 'to advance peace through strength' as the former president closes in on the 270 electoral votes needed to win the White House. 'We face a growing number of challenges globally, from a more aggressive Russia, to terrorism, to strategic competition with China, as well the increasing alignment of China, Russia, North Korea and Iran,' Rutte said. 'Working together through NATO helps to deter aggression, protect our collective security and support our economies,' he added. Rutte also praised Trump for his work during his first term to persuade U.S. allies in NATO to ramp up defense spending. He noted that around two-thirds of the 32 NATO allies are due to meet the organization’s main defense spending target this year. World leaders offer their congratulations to Trump The AP’s current count has Trump three electoral votes shy of winning the White House, though he is leading in key battleground states. 'Congratulations on history’s greatest comeback!' wrote Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on X. 'Your historic return to the White House offers a new beginning for America and a powerful recommitment to the great alliance between Israel and America.' French President Emmanuel Macron posted on X: 'Ready to work together as we were able to do during four years. With your convictions and mine. In respect and ambition. For more peace and prosperity.' Trump, a longtime source of division, calls on country to unite in election night speech Trump, someone whose political career has been defined by division and acrimony, told the audience at his election night party early on Wednesday that it was 'time to unite' as a country. 'It’s time to put the divisions of the past four years behind us,' Trump said. 'It’s time to unite.' 'We have to put our country first for at least a period of time,' he added. 'We have to fix it.' Trump speaks at election party flanked by family, friends and top political supporters Most of the important people in Trump’s personal and political life have joined him on stage in West Palm Beach, Florida. Former first lady Melania Trump stood near her husband and was joined by Barron, the former president’s youngest son. Trump’s older children, Don Jr., Eric, Ivanka and Tiffany, all joined their father on stage, too. Trump’s top political minds, including top campaign advisers Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita, joined Trump on stage. And his political allies were on stage, too, including House Speaker Mike Johnson. Trump also celebrated a few celebrities in the audience and on stage. Dana White, the CEO of UFC, was on stage with Trump, and the former president called golfer Bryson DeChambeau on stage. Trump also shouted out Elon Musk, the billionaire owner of X, who has become one of his most high-profile supporters. 'We have a new star. A star is born: Elon,' Trump said. Trump hails GOP’s congressional wins Donald Trump made sure to recognize GOP wins in down ballot races in his speech in the early morning Wednesday. 'The number of victories in the senate was absolutely incredible,' Trump said. Republicans have so far won 51 seats, giving them a majority. But Montana, Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Nevada have not been called, and it’s possible Republicans could pick up more seats. Trump also said he expected Republicans to hold the House and complimented House Speaker Mike Johnson. The House, however, is still up for grabs. There are over 70 House races across the country that have not been called, and neither party has a convincing edge in the tally of House races. Trump vows in his election night speech to fight ‘for your family and your future’ He promised that he would 'not rest until we have delivered the strong safe and prosperous America.' 'Every single day,' Trump said, 'I will be fighting for you with every breath in my body.' Donald Trump has taken the stage The AP’s current count has him at 267 of the 270 electoral votes he needs to win the White House. He is leading in key races left to be called, including Michigan and Wisconsin. Pennsylvania puts Trump three electoral votes short of the presidential threshold Trump’s victory in Pennsylvania has put him three electoral votes short of winning the presidency. He could win the White House by capturing Alaska or any remaining swing state. Hugs, calls and celebration at Trump’s watch party Trump supporters gathered at his election night watch party were hugging one another, making calls, jumping up and down, and throwing their MAGA hats in the air every chance they got to celebrate as results continued to trickle in. Guests are still arriving at the convention center in West Palm Beach. Democrats flip another House seat in New York The pickups for House Democrats have mostly come from New York so far as the party flipped its second seat in the state. Democrat Josh Riley defeated Republican Rep. Mark Molinaro in a district that spans across the center of the state. Democrats earlier flipped a seat held by Rep. Brandon Williams. While a House majority is still up for grabs, the victories will buoy Democrats’ hopes, especially in House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries’ home state. Nevada polls close nearly 3 hours later Polls closed in Nevada nearly three hours late after voters waited in long lines to cast ballots, the state’s top election official said, and initial election results began to be posted just before 10 p.m. PST. Polls had been scheduled to close at 7 p.m., but state law allows anyone in line at that time to cast a ballot. Secretary of State Cisco Aguilar acknowledged Nevada’s position as an electoral battleground and promised to keep updating results as the counties receive 'and cure' additional ballots. Mailed ballots are accepted and counted until Saturday, and thousands of voters whose ballots were set aside to allow for signature verification, or 'curing,' have until 5 p.m. Nov. 12 to validate their vote with election officials. Aguilar, a Democrat, called Nevada’s elections 'safe, secure and transparent' and said he was proud of reports of high voter turnout. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. joins Trump watch party The former presidential candidate has arrived at the Palm Beach Convention Center, entering and walking briskly as he made his way near the stage among crowds of supporters. Trump has said he will play a role when it comes to health policy but has not specified what that would be. Kennedy, who launched his own presidential bid as an independent before dropping out of the race and endorsing Trump, joined him at several rallies in the last stretch of the campaign. Republicans celebrate early turnout among Black and Hispanic voters As the election stretched into the early hours of Wednesday, Republicans — seeing a map trending positively for their party — began to point to a shift in demographic support among key voting groups who often lean Democrat. Preliminary AP VoteCast data suggested a shift among Black and Latino voters, who appeared slightly less likely to support Harris than they were to back Biden four years ago. About 8 in 10 Black voters backed Harris, down from the roughly 9 in 10 who backed Biden. More than half of Hispanic voters supported Harris, but that was down slightly from the roughly 6 in 10 who backed Biden in 2020. Trump’s support among those groups appeared to rise slightly compared to 2020. Republican Sen. Marco Rubio told AP at Trump’s election watch party in West Palm Beach, Florida, that he’s excited for the exit polling in states like Pennsylvania and Georgia, where Republicans are already seeing overperformance compared to this time in the election in 2020. 'I’m just really excited not just because I think it’s going to be a victory but about how we won,' the Florida lawmaker said. There are serious 2016 echoes in Harris’ 2024 election night Forgive Democrats if they are having a bit of déjà vu. There are noticeable similarities between then-Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton’s election night in 2016 and the one that Harris had planned for tonight at Howard University. Neither Clinton nor Harris, appeared at their election night party, despite both heading into Election Day believing they were about to defeat Donald Trump. Both sent top aides to inform the demoralized audience that the woman would not speak. And there were noticeable similarities between what each man said. 'We still have votes to count. We still have states that have not been called yet. We will continue overnight to fight to make sure that every vote is counted,' Cedric Richmond, Harris’ campaign co-chair, told the audience Tuesday. 'So you won’t hear from the vice president tonight, but you will hear from her tomorrow.' 'We’re still counting votes,' John Podesta, Clinton’s campaign chairman, said in 2016. 'And every vote should count. Several states are too close to call. So we’re not going to have anything more to say tonight.' Even the mood of the events — and the trajectory they took over the course of the night — was similar. The vibe at Clinton’s event at Javits Center started jubilantly, with people dancing, smiling and eager to make history — the campaign had even planned to launch reflective confetti in the air when Clinton won to resemble a glass ceiling shattering. The same was true for Harris, with the event resembling a dance party on the campus of the Democrat’s alma mater. By the time Podesta and Richmond had taken the stage, the party had stopped, people had left, and those who remained looked forlorn. Harris’ path to the White House is growing less forgiving Harris still has a path to the White House through the Northern battleground states, but the map is getting less forgiving. Harris’ campaign has long said her surest way to 270 electoral votes was through Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, states Trump won in 2016 and Biden captured narrowly in 2020. Harris cannot lose Pennsylvania and reach 270 electoral votes. However, she can lose pieces of the blue wall — so named for its longtime reputation as a Democratic firewall — and still reach 270. If she loses Michigan, she can make it up by winning Arizona and Nevada. She can lose Wisconsin and make up for it with Arizona. But the map has surely shrunk for Harris, who cannot lose more than one in the three-state northern arc. Trump campaign comments on Harris’ watch party mood A Trump campaign spokesperson is weighing in as the mood has shifted over at Harris’ watch party. 'Sounds like the joy has left the building,' posted Karoline Leavitt, a campaign spokeswoman on X. The Harris campaign turned off its projected CNN broadcasts at its election night watch party at Howard University as midnight approached. And some Harris supporters began leaving the event. Harris’ Howard party cuts CNN, resumes music as tough race calls roll in As midnight approached on the East Coast, the Harris campaign turned off its projected broadcasts of CNN at its election night watch party at Howard University. Instead, various high-energy remixes blared from speakers alongside floodlights flickering in tempo to hype the crowd. The cheers in the crowd had become less frequent as more results came in from battleground states showing a tight race or victories for Trump. Some attendees began leaving the event though the vast majority of rallygoers remained. It is unclear if Harris will make an appearance at her alma mater. Melania Trump shows image of her son Barron voting 'Voted for the first time - for his dad,' she shared on X. Barron Trump turned 18 years old in March and began his freshman year at New York University this fall. Republicans secure Senate control The GOP has won control of the Senate as Sen. Deb Fischer secures reelection in Nebraska. With at least 51 Senate seats secured, Republicans will retake control of the chamber for the first time in four years. It gives the party a major power center in Washington and important power in confirming the next president’s Cabinet, as well as any Supreme Court justice if there is a vacancy. With a handful of battleground races yet to be decided, Republicans still have an opportunity to grow their majority. GOP senators have already been looking at ways to extend tax cuts that were passed during Donald Trump’s first term, as well as sending funding towards toughened border security measures. However, the extent of Republicans’ power in Washington will also be determined by the results of the presidential and House races. Rashida Tlaib wins reelection in Michigan House race Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., the only Palestinian American in Congress, has won a fourth term in the House. Tlaib represents a district with a large Arab-American population. She has been highly critical of Israel in its war against Hamas, describing its actions in Gaza as genocide. But her comments have also evoked outrage from many of her colleagues. The Republican-led House voted last year to censure her for her statements regarding the war. Tlaib said her criticism was directed toward Israel’s government and its leadership under Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and vowed she 'will not be silenced.' Sen. Ted Cruz calls victory in Texas a mandate for tougher border measures Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas says he considers his reelection victory over Democratic U.S. Rep. Colin Allred a mandate for stronger enforcement along the U.S.-Mexico border. During a victory speech in front of supporters in his hometown of Houston, Cruz praised strong support from Hispanic voters. He singled out South Texas, where Cruz was performing much better in large border counties than he did during a narrow victory in 2018 over Beto O’Rourke. 'Tonight we are witnessing incredible results, especially with Hispanics across the state of Texas,' Cruz told the crowd. 'And we are seeing tonight generational change in South Texas. The results tonight, this decisive victory should shake the Democratic establishment to its core.' Last poll closures Polls will close at midnight EST in Alaska and Hawaii. Ohio sends its first Latino to U.S. Senate Bernie Moreno will be the first Latino that Ohio has sent to the U.S. Senate, thanks to his victory over Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown. Moreno was born in Bogota, Colombia. He moved with his family to the United States at age 5 and became an American citizen when he was 18. He built his fortune as a luxury car dealer and blockchain entrepreneur and will come to the Senate as one of its wealthiest members. Daughter fills in late mother’s congressional seat The daughter of late Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee won a special election Tuesday night to finish her mother’s congressional term. Erica Lee Carter defeated two Republican challengers in the race for the Houston-area district where her mother served for almost 30 years. Jackson Lee died in July at age 74 after a battle with pancreatic cancer. Her funeral was filled with high profile mourners, including Vice President Harris who gave Jackson Lee’s eulogy just days after declaring her candidacy for president. Republicans gain steam towards Senate control The GOP’s victory in the Ohio Senate race puts them on track to gain a Senate majority as long as they keep their seats in Texas and Nebraska. In Ohio, Republican Bernie Moreno defeated three-term Sen. Sherrod Brown. The long-serving Ohio Democrat had tried to appeal to working-class voters and make access to abortion a top priority, but Moreno, a Cleveland businessman, cast Brown as too liberal for the conservative state, tying the long-serving Ohio Democrat to President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris. As long as Republican Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Deb Fischer of Nebraska secure reelection, the GOP will have the Senate in hand. Trump’s North Carolina win gives him options toward 270 threshold By winning North Carolina, Trump maintains options to reach the 270 electoral vote threshold. Trump can reach the magic number by carrying Georgia and Pennsylvania or by carrying Georgia, Michigan and Wisconsin. He also can win by carrying Wisconsin and Arizona, as well as other combinations involving Nevada. But that would require him to crack the blue wall of northern states Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Trump blitzed North Carolina in the final days of the campaign, stopping in four cities over four days and finishing his North Carolina campaign in Raleigh on Monday. Harris’ Howard night energy turns from festive to fretting as race calls roll in The mood at Harris’ election night party at Howard University shifted from electric to anxious as race calls began rolling in. The musical performances and triumphant speeches on display earlier in the evening have been replaced by occasional DJ mixes and broadcast race calls. Anxious faces and hushed talk spread through the crowd as the night stretched on and the tightness of the race became apparent. The still-packed crowd periodically went quiet as attendees watched returns come in on a giant projection of CNN. Rallygoers cheered and waved American flags as solidly blue states like Harris’ native California were called in her favor.	https://apnews.com/article/kamala-harris-election-donald-trump-75f89f8cdc3eda7f9cd3e7b622aca1a4	2024-11-05T21:14:53-08:00	
European leaders seek to chart a common future at summit but all eyes are glued on Washington	BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) — Dozens of European leaders will be gingerly seeking to chart a more common future during a one-day summit in Hungary's capital on Thursday. Yet despite myriad economic challenges and two wars in the neighborhood, all eyes will be glued on Washington to see whether the pivotal U.S. election will cause a political rift throughout the continent. The transatlantic relationship will doubtless change after the vote, leaders and experts have said. But the question is whether that change will be gradual under Kamala Harris or possibly seismic under Donald Trump. The impact of the U.S. results could be felt for years to come, on issues including the war in Ukraine, the European Union's trade relations with the rest of the world, migration, the Middle East conflict and climate change. 'All this is putting peace, stability and prosperity at risk in our region,' said the invitation letter to the leaders of the European Political Community, which unites almost 50 nations in Europe and its near abroad, bar Russia and Belarus. Among the leaders likely to attend on Thursday is Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who is expected to make another plea for more aid as his country fends off Moscow's invasion. The timing is laden with significance as Trump has vowed to end the war 'within 24 hours' of being elected — something leaders in Kyiv interpret as an impending evaporation of U.S. support should Trump win. Orbán makes plain his support for Trump Not so long ago, such a meeting — which is also expected to include leaders from non-EU countries like Turkey, Serbia and the United Kingdom — would end with praise for European unity and a common political direction. Yet with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán as the host of the summit, friction is as good as assured. Orbán, who has openly thrown his weight behind Trump and argued the former president is a 'man of peace,' has predicted a Trump victory and suggested that civil and criminal cases against him were the result of a politically motivated Department of Justice — a common Trump refrain. Having played the obstructionist for years within the 27-nation EU, Orbán now holds the bloc's rotating presidency, giving him a more prominent platform and making him the host of Thursday's EPC summit, as well as another gathering of EU leaders on Friday. The presidency under Orbán caused turmoil from day one, when he declared 'Make Europe Great Again' the motto of his six months in charge. It was a strikingly clear reference to his affection for Trump, which he followed up with unannounced visits to Moscow and Beijing, angering EU leaders who said he was not acting on their behalf. In response to Orbán's self-styled 'peace mission,' many EU countries began boycotting presidency meetings in Budapest, or sending only lower-level bureaucrats rather than ministers. However, no boycotts are expected for this week's summits. While Orbán has cast the result of U.S. elections as determinative of Europe's future — he's even delayed passing Hungary's 2025 national budget until after a new president is elected — not all EU leaders are comfortable with the bloc's fate being so tightly bound up with the movements of American politics. Donald Tusk, the center-right prime minister of Poland, said Europe must forge a more independent path that is less sensitive to changes across the Atlantic. 'Some claim that the future of Europe depends on the American elections, while it depends first and foremost on us, on the condition that Europe finally grows up and believes in its own strength,' Tusk said in the days ahead of the summit. 'Whatever the outcome, the era of geopolitical outsourcing is over.'	https://apnews.com/article/eu-summit-us-elections-russia-ukraine-uk-315e9b04685807d419415662137b0fa2	2024-11-05T21:06:09-08:00

Stock market today: Stocks, bond yields and bitcoin advance as US election brings Republican gains	HONG KONG (AP) — Share prices and bond yields surged Wednesday as the Republican party gained control of the Senate and former President Donald Trump closed in on the 270 electoral votes needed to return him to the White House. The full results of Tuesday's election may not be known for days as officials count all the votes, but investors already were repositioning in anticipation of sweeping gains by the Republicans, who took control of the Senate for the first time in four years. The results of the House elections were not yet finalized. Trump won the battleground state of Georgia, a Republican stronghold that had voted for Democrats in 2020. A win in North Carolina helped Trump narrow Vice President Kamala Harris’ pathways to victory. Clinching Pennsylvania took him within 3 electoral votes of the 270 votes needed to become the next president. The expectation is that a victory by Trump will lead to faster economic growth and more market-friendly policies. Auguring gains for U.S. markets on Wednesday, the future for the S&amp;P 500 gained 1.9% and that for the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 2.2%. The Nasdaq composite future was 1.7% higher. The price of bitcoin jumped nearly 8% to a record $75,345.00, as investors bet on a victory for Trump, who has pledged support for cryptocurrencies. It later fell back to $73,720.00. Bond yields also surged, with the yield on the 10-year Treasury climbing to 4.4% from 4.28% on Tuesday. 'The markets are scrambling to figure out what happens next, but for the time being, the market is pricing in a higher growth and higher inflation outlook,' Peter Esho of Esho Capital said in a commentary. In early European trading, Germany's DAX climbed 1.3% to 19,503.40, while the CAC 40 in Paris advanced 1.9% to 7,550.36. Britain's FTSE 100 was up 1.4% at 8,285.06. Markets worldwide have been fixated on what the election will mean for U.S. economic, monetary and trade policy, as well as geopolitics. A split in Congress between political parties would complicate policymaking, and a White House headed by Trump could have far reaching ramifications given his support for sharp increases in tariffs, especially on imports from China. The broad U.S. stock market has historically tended to rise regardless of which party wins the White House, even if each party’s policies can help and hurt different industries’ profits. Since 1945, the S&amp;P 500 has risen in 73% of the years where a Democrat was president and 70% of the years when a Republican was the nation’s chief executive, according to Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. The S&amp;P 500 has risen nearly 70% since the 2020 election brought President Joe Biden into office. It rallied to records as the U.S. economy bounced back from the COVID-19 pandemic and managed to avoid a recession despite a jump in inflation. In Asian share trading Wednesday, Japan's Nikkei 225 index gained 2.6% to 39,480.67, while the Kospi in Seoul shed 0.9% to 2,553.90. Australia's S&amp;P/ASX 200 rose 0.8% to 8,199.50. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index fell 2.2% to 20,538.38, ending a three-day rally, as investors sought safe-haven assets amid the uncertainties surrounding the U.S. election. The Hang Seng Tech Index slipped 2.5%, while the Shanghai Composite index edged 0.1% lower, to 3,383.81. Trump has vowed to sharply raise tariffs on imports from China and other countries, darkening the outlook for Chinese exporters at a time when Beijing has relied heavily on ramping up manufacturing to try to revive its slowing economy. 'Positive outcomes for Harris are expected to boost Asian assets, while Trump gains may exert downward pressure,' Anderson Alves of ActivTrades said in a commentary. Chinese markets have been among the most active in the region this week as leaders hold a meeting of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, the country's legislature. The gathering is expected to deliver more moves to help spur faster economic growth and resolve mounting levels of local government debt. On Tuesday, upbeat comments by Premier Li Qiang about the potential for both fiscal and monetary policies helped lift share benchmarks in Hong Kong and Shanghai by more than 2%. Li also expressed confidence that China will attain its growth target of about 5% this year. In other dealings early Wednesday, U.S. benchmark crude oil lost 90 cents to $71.09 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, gave up $1.00 cents to $74.53 per barrel. A Trump win was expected to bolster the value of the dollar, which surged to 154.08 Japanese yen from 151.62 yen late Tuesday. The euro slipped to $1.0756 from $1.0931.	https://apnews.com/article/stock-markets-rates-china-93421462d761eb1402d813cb381fe6e9	2024-11-05T16:40:43-08:00	
Tropical Storm Rafael strengthens to Category 1 hurricane as it barrels toward Cuba	SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) — Tropical Storm Rafael strengthened into a Category 1 hurricane on Tuesday as it swirled past the Cayman Islands and chugged toward western Cuba, where it's forecast to hit as a Category 2 hurricane. It was another stroke of bad news for Cuba, which has been struggling with blackouts while recovering from another hurricane two weeks ago that killed at least six people in the eastern part of the island. The storm was located 60 miles (95 kilometers) northeast of Little Cayman in the Cayman Islands on Tuesday morning. It had maximum sustained winds of 80 mph (130 kph) and was moving northwest at 13 mph (2o kph), according to the National Hurricane Center in Miami. Forecasters warned that Rafael was expected to slam into Cuba on Wednesday after dumping rain on Jamaica and the Cayman Islands on Tuesday. The center warned of floods, storm surges and mudslides. The U.S. State Department issued an advisory for Cuba on Tuesday afternoon, offering departure flights to non-essential staff and American citizens, and advising others to 'reconsider travel to Cuba due to the potential impact of Tropical Storm Rafael.' On Tuesday morning, the Cuban Civil Defense called on Cubans to prepare as soon as possible, because when the storm makes landfall 'it’s important to stay where you are.' The day before, authorities said they had issued an evacuation order for 37,000 people in far eastern Cuba, in the province of Guantanamo, due to bad weather. A hurricane warning was in effect Tuesday for the Cayman Islands and the Cuban provinces of Pinar del Rio, Artemisa, La Habana, Mayabeque, Matanzas and the Isle of Youth. A tropical storm warning was in effect for the Cuban provinces of Villa Clara, Cienfuegos, Sancti Spiritus and Ciego de Avila, as well as the lower and middle Florida Keys from Key West to west of the Channel 5 Bridge, and Dry Tortugas. The warning was lifted in Jamaica after the storm passed by the western coast. A tropical storm watch was in effect for the Cuban provinces of Camaguey and Las Tunas. Officials in the Cayman Islands closed schools and government offices as they urged residents to prepare. Long lines were reported at grocery stores as the storm approached. Forecasters warned Rafael would unleash heavy rains across the western Caribbean that could lead to flooding and mudslides in parts of Cuba and the Cayman Islands. Heavy rainfall also was expected to spread north into Florida and nearby areas of the southeast U.S. during the middle to late part of the week. The Hurricane Center predicted storm surges in Florida could reach 1 to 3 feet in Dry Tortugas and 1 to 2 feet in the Lower Florida Keys. A few tornadoes also were expected Wednesday over the Keys and southwestern Florida. Rafael is the 17th named storm of the season. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicted the 2024 hurricane season was likely to be well above average, with between 17 and 25 named storms. The forecast called for as many as 13 hurricanes and four major hurricanes. An average Atlantic hurricane season produces 14 named storms, seven of them hurricanes and three major hurricanes. ____ Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america	https://apnews.com/article/rafael-tropical-storm-hurricane-cuba-f96033ae40b18d745f95d9dd17868457	2024-11-05T15:46:12-08:00

North Korean test of ICBM is condemned by two-thirds of UN Security Council	UNITED NATIONS (AP) — A U.S.-led statement approved by 10 of the 15 U.N. Security Council members Tuesday condemned a recent North Korean intercontinental ballistic missile launch and called on Pyongyang to return to negotiations and abandon its missile programs. The statement follows a series of recent North Korean missile launches, including the test Thursday of the country’s newest ICBM that is designed to reach the United States. The 10 Security Council members said that launch — in addition to more than 100 North Korean ballistic missile launches since 2022 — violates multiple Security Council resolutions prohibiting the North from using ballistic missile technology and jeopardizes international peace and security. The foreign ministers of the Group of Seven wealthy democracies also decried last week's launch in a statement Tuesday, saying North Korea 'continues to advance its unlawful nuclear and ballistic missile capabilities and to escalate its destabilizing activities.' The G7 is Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the U.S. At the United Nations, U.S. deputy ambassador Robert Wood read the statement to reporters surrounded by diplomats from the nine other nations that signed on — Ecuador, France, Japan, Malta, South Korea, Sierra Leone, Slovenia, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. They were joined by representatives from three countries that will join the council in January — Denmark, Greece and Panama. Five Security Council nations didn’t support the statement — Russia, China, Algeria, Mozambique and Guyana. In the statement, the 10 council members said the United States sought the required approval of all 15 council members for a press statement condemning the ICBM test and calling for North Korea to adhere to the Securitiy Council's legally binding sanctions. But the statement said two countries — identified by council members as North Korea’s allies Russia and China — refused to join the denunciation of Pyongyang’s actions. The 10 members stressed that all council nations are obligated to implement sanctions on North Korea, urging all the nations on the Security Council to abide by that responsibility, maintain international peace and security, and uphold the treaty banning the proliferation of nuclear weapons. While Russia and China were not named, the statement appeared aimed especially at Russia, which has reportedly received munitions and troops from North Korea for its war against Ukraine. At a Security Council meeting Monday, the U.S. and its allies sparred with Russia, China and North Korea over Pyongyang's ICBM tests and troop deployment to Russia. Ukrainian officials said Tuesday that their troops engaged North Korean units for the first time in Russia’s Kursk border region, which Ukrainian forces occupy. The Security Council imposed sanctions after North Korea’s first nuclear test explosion in 2006 and tightened them over the years, seeking — so far unsuccessfully — to cut funds and curb its nuclear and ballistic missile programs. The last sanctions resolution was adopted by the council in December 2017. China and Russia vetoed a U.S.-sponsored resolution in May 2022 that would have imposed new sanctions over a spate of ICBM launches and have blocked any council action since then.	https://apnews.com/article/un-north-korea-missiles-nuclear-russia-ukraine-5f78bb1a9ff3d5edb223a8ead98712ec	2024-11-05T11:58:31-08:00

Police fire tear gas at protest over deadly canopy collapse in Serbia	NOVI SAD, Serbia (AP) — Protesters on Tuesday threw flares and red paint on the City Hall building in the Serbian city of Novi Sad in rage over last week's collapse of a concrete canopy at the railway station that killed 14 people. Police responded by firing tear gas canisters. The protesters surrounded the building in the city center, broke windows and threw stones and other objects despite calls by organizers to remain calm. Special police troops were deployed inside the building. Serbia’s autocratic President Aleksandar Vucic said police were 'showing restraint,' while warning that 'horrific, violent protests are underway.' 'People of Serbia, please do not think violence is allowed,' he said on X. 'All those taking part in the incidents will be punished.' Miran Pogacar, an opposition activist, said 'one glass window can be mended but we cannot bring back 14 lives. People are angry. Serbia won’t stand for this.' Protest organizers said they wanted to enter the City Hall building and submit their demands, including that those responsible for the canopy collapse face justice. Some of the protesters trying to get inside the building wore masks and were believed to be soccer hooligans who are close to the populist government. Bojan Pajtic, an opposition politician, said he believed violence was being stoked by provocateurs, a tactic used before in Serbia to derail peaceful anti-government protests and paint the opposition protesters as enemies of the nation. Earlier, thousands of demonstrators had marched through the city streets demanding that top officials step down because of the fatal outer roof collapse last Friday, including President Vucic and Prime Minister Milos Vucevic. The protesters first gathered outside the railway station where they held a moment of silence for the victims as organizers read their names. The crowd responded by chanting: 'arrest the gang' and 'thieves.' The protest started peacefully but some demonstrators later hurled plastic bottles and bricks at the headquarters of Vucic’s ruling Serbian Progressive Party and smeared red paint on posters of the Serbian president and the prime minister — a message that they have blood on their hands. The protesters removed most of the Serbian national red, blue and white national flags that were apparently hung on the headquarters to prevent it from an attack. That triggered an angry reaction from the president. 'Our Serbian tri-color has been destroyed, hidden and removed by all those who do not love Serbia,' Vucic wrote on X. 'Tonight, in Novi Sad, this is being done by those who tell us that they love Serbia more than us, the decent citizens of this country.' As protests wound down later in the evening, Vucic made a surprise trip to Novi Sad and made a brief appearance before his several hundred supporters gathered outside the party headquarters. Critics of Serbia’s populist government have attributed the disaster to rampant corruption in the Balkan country, a lack of transparency and sloppy work during renovation work on the station building which was part of a wider railway deal with Chinese state companies. The accident happened without warning. Surveillance camera footage showed the massive canopy on the outer wall of the station building crashing down on the people sitting below on benches or going in and out. Officials have promised full accountability and, faced with pressure, Serbia’s construction minister submitted his resignation on Tuesday. Prosecutors have said that more than 40 people already have been questioned as part of a probe into what happened. Many in Serbia, however, doubt that justice will be served with the populists in firm control of the judicial system and the police. Opposition parties behind Tuesday’s protest said they are also demanding the resignation of Vucevic and that documentation be made public listing all the companies and individuals involved. The victims included a 6-year-old girl. Those injured in the roof collapse remained in serious condition on Tuesday. The train station has been renovated twice in recent years. Officials have insisted that the canopy had not been part of the renovation work, suggesting this was the reason why it collapsed but giving no explanation for why it was not included. The Novi Sad railway station was originally built in 1964, while the renovated station was inaugurated by Vucic and his populist ally, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, over two years ago as a major stopover for a planned fast train line between Belgrade and Budapest.	https://apnews.com/article/serbia-canopy-collapse-protest-novi-sad-9f4c6e14c01aca29aa4f2c6720bbebff	2024-11-05T10:01:28-08:00	
Israel's Netanyahu dismisses his defense minister as wars rage. Protests erupt across country	JERUSALEM (AP) — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday dismissed his popular defense minister, Yoav Gallant, in a surprise announcement that came as the country is embroiled in wars on multiple fronts across the region. The move sparked protests across the country, including a mass gathering that paralyzed central Tel Aviv. Netanyahu and Gallant have repeatedly been at odds over the war in Gaza. But Netanyahu had avoided firing his rival before taking the step as the world's attention was focused on the U.S. presidential election. Netanyahu cited 'significant gaps' and a 'crisis of trust' in his Tuesday evening announcement as he replaced Gallant with a longtime loyalist. 'In the midst of a war, more than ever, full trust is required between the prime minister and defense minister,' Netanyahu said. 'Unfortunately, although in the first months of the campaign there was such trust and there was very fruitful work, during the last months this trust cracked between me and the defense minister.' In the early days of the war, Israel's leadership presented a unified front as it responded to Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack. But as the war has dragged on and spread to Lebanon, key policy differences have emerged. While Netanyahu has called for continued military pressure on Hamas, Gallant had taken a more pragmatic approach, saying that military force has created the necessary conditions for at least a temporary diplomatic deal that could bring home hostages held by the militant group. In a late-night news conference broadcast on national TV, Gallant said that he had disagreed with Netanyahu over three main issues: the need to end controversial exemptions from the military draft for ultra-Orthodox men, the urgent need for a hostage deal and the need to establish an official commission of inquiry into the political and security failures of Oct. 7, when Hamas militants stormed into Israel and killed 1,200 people and took 250 others hostage. Israel estimates that about 100 hostages remain in captivity, only about 65 of them still alive. With military service compulsory for most Jews, Gallant said that drafting the ultra-Orthodox was both an issue of fairness and security at a time when Israel faces so many challenges. He said a hostage deal was needed 'as quickly as possible, when they are still alive' and said there will be 'no forgiveness' for neglecting them. And he said a full investigation into the events of Oct. 7 was the only way to ensure the government would learn the proper lessons. Netanyahu has rejected calls for an inquiry, saying it should only take place when the war is over. Gallant ended his statement by honoring the soldiers serving in the army and those who have died in the wars. He held up his hand and saluted as he walked away from the podium. Many of the families of the hostages, along with tens of thousands of people who have joined anti-government protests, accuse Netanyahu of scuttling a deal in order to maintain his hold on power. Netanyahu's hard-line partners have threatened to bring down the government if he makes concessions to Hamas, raising the risk of early elections at a time when the prime minister's popularity is low. This week, authorities announced the arrest of a Netanyahu aide on suspicion of leaking classified information to foreign media that gave the prime minister political cover as hostage talks fell apart. 'Firing Gallant in the middle of a war is an act of madness,' opposition leader Yair Lapid said on X. 'Netanyahu is selling Israel’s security and the Israeli army soldiers for a disgraceful political survival.' Israel's president, Isaac Herzog, whose largely ceremonial office is meant to help unify the country, called the dismissal 'the last thing Israel needs.' The grassroots forum representing hostage families said Gallant’s dismissal is 'a direct continuation of the ‘efforts’ to torpedo the abductee deal.' Within hours, thousands of protesters gathered in central Tel Aviv, blocking the city's main highway and crippling traffic. The crowd, many holding blue and white Israeli flags and others blowing whistles and pounding drums, gathered around multiple bonfires. Several thousand people demonstrated outside Netanyahu's home in Jerusalem and elsewhere in the city. Protesters gathered and blocked roads in several other spots across the country, and Israeli TV stations showed images of police scuffling with protesters. The dismissal comes at a delicate time. Israeli troops remain bogged down in Gaza, over a year after invading the territory in a war that has killed over 42,000 Palestinians, including tens of thousands of civilians, and caused widespread destruction, while Israeli ground troops are pressing ahead with a month-old ground invasion against Hezbollah militants in Lebanon. Hundreds of Israeli soldiers have been killed in the fighting. Israel also has clashed with Iranian-backed groups in Iraq, Syria and Yemen, and is facing the possibility of another strike by Iran. Iran has vowed to avenge an Israeli strike that came in response to an Oct. 1 Iranian missile attack, itself a reprisal for earlier Israeli attacks on Iranian-linked targets. On Monday, Gallant announced he had sent out thousands of draft notices to young ultra-Orthodox men. The system of exemptions for religious men has bred widespread resentment among the secular majority, and Israel's Supreme Court has ordered the government to scrap the system. Netanyahu, whose governing coalition depends on ultra-Orthodox parties, has not yet implemented the order. Channel 13 TV said Netanyahu had also taken advantage of the U.S. election, when American attention is focused elsewhere, to dismiss his rival. The White House on Tuesday declined to comment on the firing but called Galant 'an important partner on all matters related to the defense of Israel.' 'As close partners, we will continue to work collaboratively with Israel’s next minister of defense,' the White House National Security Council said. Gallant, a former general with a gruff, no-nonsense demeanor, has emerged as the most popular figure with the public in Israel's wartime government. Gallant has worn a simple, black buttoned shirt throughout the war in a sign of sorrow over the Oct. 7 attack and developed a strong relationship with his U.S. counterpart, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin. A previous attempt by Netanyahu to fire Gallant in March 2023 sparked widespread street protests against Netanyahu. He also flirted with the idea of dismissing Gallant over the summer but held off until Tuesday's announcement. Israel Katz, his replacement, currently serves as foreign minister and is a longtime Netanyahu loyalist and veteran Cabinet minister. Katz thanked Netanyahu and pledged to lead the security establishment to victory in the wars against Israel’s enemies. Katz, 69, was a junior officer in the military decades ago and has little military experience, though he has been a key member of Netanyahu's Security Cabinet over the years. Gideon Saar, a former Netanyahu rival who rejoined the government in September, will take the foreign affairs post. Netanyahu has a long history of neutralizing his rivals. In his statement, he claimed he had made 'many attempts' to bridge the gaps with Gallant. 'But they kept getting wider,' he said. 'Our enemies enjoyed it and derived a lot of benefit from it.' ___ Associated Press writers Eleanor H.

Western officials suspect Russia was behind a plot to put incendiary packages on cargo planes	WARSAW, Poland (AP) — Western security officials suspect Russian intelligence was behind a plot to put incendiary devices in packages on cargo planes headed to North America, including one that caught fire at a courier hub in Germany and another that ignited in a warehouse in England. Poland said last month that it has arrested four people suspected to be linked to a foreign intelligence operation that carried out sabotage and is searching for two others. Lithuania's prosecutor general Nida Grunskiene said Tuesday there were an unspecified number of people detained in several countries, offering no elaboration. The events come as Western officials say they are seeing an intensification of a hybrid war of sabotage by Russia targeting Ukraine’s allies, including election disinformation and arson attacks in Europe this year. Several officials said they believe the attacks were the work of Russian military intelligence, the GRU, although Moscow denied involvement. Poland’s Internal Security Agency, or ABW, says that incidents in Poland, as well as other EU and NATO members, had intensified this year. ABW believes they are initiated and coordinated by the Russian special services. So far, 20 people have been charged in investigations led by the prosecutor’s office, the ABW and police. Polish Prosecutor Katarzyna Calów-Jaszewska said the investigation focuses on foreign agents conducting acts of sabotage, including damaging industrial facilities or critical infrastructure such as airports, airplanes and other vehicles, and as well as arson using self-combustible parcels sent to EU countries and the U.K. that would ignite during road or air transport. She added that the group tested a channel for sending such parcels to the United States and Canada. The Wall Street Journal first reported the details of the cargo plane incidents. The U.S. Transportation Security Administration said it has put extra security measures in place in recent months for certain cargo shipments heading to the United States. 'We continually adjust our security posture as appropriate and promptly share any and all relevant information with our industry partners, to include requirements and recommendations that help them reduce risk,' the TSA said. There was no active threat targeting flights heading to the United States, according to a U.S. official, who was not authorized to comment publicly. Dirk Heinrichs, a spokesperson for DHL in Germany, said in an emailed statement to The Associated Press that the company could not provide details about the matter but was 'fully cooperating with the relevant authorities to protect our people, our network and our customers’ shipments.' The head of Britain’s domestic intelligence agency, MI5, said last month the U.K. is facing a 'staggering rise' in attempts at assassination, sabotage and other crimes on its soil by Russia as well as Iran. Calów-Jaszewska said Oct. 25 that parcels with camouflaged explosives were sent via cargo companies to EU countries and Britain to 'test the transfer channel for such parcels' that were ultimately destined for the U.S. and Canada. The incendiary devices in Germany and the U.K. both ignited in July. One was at at stopover at a DHL logistics center at an airport in the city of Leipzig, according to Thomas Haldenwang, head of the German intelligence service. The German news agency dpa reported that the connecting flight containing the package, which came from one of the Baltic nations, was delayed in Leipzig and was on the ground when it ignited and set fire to a freight container. British counterterrorism police are investigating whether Russian agents were behind an incendiary device in a parcel that caught fire in a DHL warehouse in Minworth, near Birmingham, in central England on July 22. The incident, first reported by the Guardian newspaper and German broadcasters, was similar to the one in Germany. The Polish newspaper Gazeta Wyborcza also reported that a fire was reported in a courier truck near Warsaw. 'We are observing aggressive action by the Russian intelligence services. In particular Russian espionage and sabotage in Germany are on the rise, both quantitatively and qualitatively,' Haldenwang told the German Budestag, or parliament, last month while discussing the Leipzig incident. 'The activities of Russian intelligence services in the real world as well as in cyberspace show that Germany is the focus of this Russia’s hybrid war against Western democracies,' he added. 'Russia is using its entire toolbox: from influencing political discussions within Germany to cyber attacks against critical infrastructure and sabotage. Russia’s willingness to use force proves that it is also willing to put human lives at risk.' In a rare public speech setting out the major threats to the U.K., MI5 Director General Ken McCallum said 'the GRU in particular is on a sustained mission to generate mayhem on British and European streets: We’ve seen arson, sabotage and more. Dangerous actions conducted with increasing recklessness.' Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Tuesday called media reports about the alleged sabotage plot an example of a 'vague fabrication.' ___ Associated Press writers Jill Lawless and Danica Kirka in London, Dasha Litvinova in Tallinn, Estonia, Kirsten Grieshaber in Berlin, Aamer Madhani in Washington, D.C., :and Liudas Dapkus in Vilnius, Lithuania, contributed.	https://apnews.com/article/russia-poland-germany-sabotage-cargo-planes-b7f559805d7a996dd6aabe8e69041607	2024-11-05T08:41:17-08:00

Maldives recalls its ambassador in Pakistan over unsanctioned meeting with Kabul's envoy	ISLAMABAD (AP) — Pakistani officials said on Tuesday they were aware the Maldives government had recalled its ambassador to Pakistan after he met with the Afghan Taliban government's top diplomat in Islamabad without clearing it with his government. The Maldives does not recognize the Taliban government which seized power in August 2021 as United States and NATO forces withdrew from the country. The Taliban has been widely isolated for human rights violations since the takeover, including bans on Afghan girls and women. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Maldives said in a statement on Nov. 3 that the recent meeting between Mohamed Thoha, the High Commissioner of Maldives in Pakistan and Ahmad Shakib, Afghanistan’s chargé d’affaires was not 'sanctioned by the Government of Maldives.' Without elaborating, the statement said an 'appropriate action' was taken against Thoha on Saturday. It said 'Maldives is guided by the practice followed by the United Nations General Assembly when questions arise about the representative character of a government. Consistent with this practice, the Maldives recognizes the Government representing Afghanistan at the United Nations as the legitimate Government of Afghanistan.' This came days after the Afghan embassy in Islamabad said in a statement the two officials met to discuss ways to enhance cooperation and trade relations between Maldives and Central Asian Countries through Afghanistan. It also stated that the Afghan envoy while thanking Thoha said 'Afghanistan seeks constructive relations with all countries and is striving through its economy-focused policies to transform Afghanistan into a regional connectivity hub'. The high commission of Maldives in Islamabad took down Thoha's photo from its website.	https://apnews.com/article/pakistan-maldives-ambassador-recalled-meeting-taliban-envoy-f1f16910ef724d228417a575d40d5ec6	2024-11-05T06:34:48-08:00

The church of Saint-Sulpice in Paris shines in an immersive light show	PARIS (AP) — As dusk falls over the City of Light, a new spectacle is illuminating Saint-Sulpice church, a monument whose interiors are even larger than Notre Dame's — and arguably just as breathtaking. The cavernous walls of the neoclassical gem on Paris' Left Bank are coming alive with 360-degree video projections, sparkling cutting-edge technology and actors, all telling the story of the church and its place in French history. Blending centuries of intrigue, revolution and family drama, the show reimagines the Saint-Germain district during the Fronde, the 17th-century civil war, and the lead-up to the French Revolution. 'Paris Cœur de Lumières' (Paris Chancel of Lights), which runs until Nov. 23, transforms the church’s sprawling 6,000-square-meter (65,000-square-foot) interior into a digital stage through advanced video mapping. 'From a technological standpoint, it’s a laser scan of the entire building that allows us to reconstruct the space in three dimensions,' director Damien Fontaine explained. 'We then ‘unfold’ it like origami ... and put it back into 3D to be projected as a single unified image. We have over 45 projectors, each covering a part of the vaults, a section of a pillar, or a piece of the nave. It’s ... a mosaic of images to form one large picture.' Projections transform stone carvings into animated storytellers, while immersive soundscapes, paired with an original score, wrap the audience in a sensory experience. The actors brought history to life. Over 350 performers and volunteers, clad in more than 500 historical costumes, move among the audience portraying local families and rivalries, threading personal narratives into the broader history. Many of those who volunteered themselves marveled at learning about little known aspects of French history. Anne Dubosc, a 65-year-old amateur actress, played Anne of Austria, mother of Sun King Louis XIV. 'She was a remarkable woman, very involved in politics and religion,' Dubosc said. 'I hadn’t realized how important she was. If Louis XIV became the man he was, it was partly thanks to this woman, this mother who was like a tigress, doing everything to protect her son and teaching him to be a great statesman.' Performing in Saint-Sulpice, she added, was extraordinary: 'It’s exceptional. You lose track of what’s happening, of where fiction ends and history begins.' Her historic costume shaped her performance — literally. 'I have a corset that squeezes me so tightly,' she said. 'You realize there’s a very 18th-century way of holding yourself, of carrying your shoulders and neck, which gives a natural majesty. The costume really impacts how you carry your body, and that posture influences your mind, giving character to this woman of state.' The production underscored a growing trend in Paris of using light technology to show off the city's storied church interiors. A similar illuminations display took place at Saint-Eustache church until September, featuring video projections, lighting effects and spatialized electronic soundtrack. ___ Associated Press writer Marine Lesprit contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/paris-light-illuminations-saintsulpice-c60f37c0514825b87aa00897ce9bd61e	2024-11-05T05:44:54-08:00

UK introduces a bill that would eventually make the purchase of cigarettes illegal	LONDON (AP) — Legislation intended to ban today’s British children from ever legally being able to smoke began its journey through Parliament on Tuesday. The Tobacco and Vapes Bill would also bar smoking and vaping in some outdoor spaces such as playgrounds and the entrances to schools and hospitals. But a proposed ban on smoking in pub beer gardens has been dropped after opposition from bar owners. Health Secretary Wes Streeting said the hospitality industry had 'taken a real battering in recent years' and it is not 'the right time' to ban smoking outside pubs. The bill also proposes to restrict vape flavors and ban bright vape packaging aimed at children, to combat 'a cynical industry that has sought to addict a new generation of children to nicotine,' Streeting said. It also continues a plan by the previous Conservative government, which was ousted in July’s general election, to raise the minimum age for buying tobacco by one year each year, so that no one born after Jan. 1, 2009 will ever be able to buy cigarettes legally in Britain. It is currently illegal to sell cigarettes, tobacco products or vapes to people under 18. If passed – as is likely because of the governing Labour Party’s large majority in Parliament -- the bill would give Britain some of the toughest anti-smoking measures in the world. The government said the bill 'breaks the cycle of addiction and paves the way for a smoke-free U.K.' The number of people who smoke in Britain has declined by two-thirds since the 1970s, but some 6.4 million people — or about 13% of the population — still smoke, according to official figures. Authorities say smoking causes some 80,000 deaths a year in the U.K, and remains the number one preventable cause of death, disability and poor health.	https://apnews.com/article/uk-smoking-ban-vapes-children-health-tobacco-pubs-0a25159ad4536d4a30f652486c6fc585	2024-11-05T03:46:22-08:00	
French court convicts 18 in a major trial that casts light on the deadly migrant-smuggling trade	LILLE, France (AP) — A French court found 18 people guilty Tuesday in a major migrant-smuggling trial that shed light on the lucrative but often deadly clandestine business of transporting people on flimsy boats across the perilous sea from France to the U.K. The defendants were swept up in a pan-European police operation in 2022 that led to dozens of arrests and the seizure of boats, life jackets, outboard engines, paddles, and cash. The court in Lille, northern France, sentenced one of the ringleaders, from Iraq, to 15 years in prison and a fine of 200,000 euros ($218,000). Other sentences ranged from two years to 10 years in prison. 'These sentences are obviously very severe,' said Kamel Abbas, a lawyer who represented one of the defendants already imprisoned in France. 'That’s a testimony of the scale of the case, and of the intention to severely punish the smugglers.' Most of the defendants were not in court for the verdicts and sentencing. Some attended the trial remotely from various prisons in northern France, while others are not in custody. Fourteen of the 18 defendants were from Iraq, with the others from Iran, Poland, France and the Netherlands. The trial comes in what has been a particularly deadly year for attempted crossings of the English Channel, one of the world's busiest shipping lanes. More than 31,000 migrants have made the perilous Channel crossing so far this year, more than in all of 2023, though fewer than in 2022. At least 56 people have perished in the attempts this year, according to French officials, making 2024 the deadliest since the crossings began surging in 2018. The route, despite French and British efforts to stop it, remains a major smuggling corridor for people fleeing conflict or poverty. Migrants favor the U.K. for reasons of language, family ties, or perceived easier access to asylum and work. Europe’s increasingly strict asylum rules, growing xenophobia and hostile treatment of migrants are also pushing many migrants north. On Monday, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer called for international cooperation against smuggling gangs, likening the issue to a global security threat on par with terrorism. Starmer told a conference of international police organization Interpol that 'people-smuggling should be viewed as a global security threat similar to terrorism.' He said intelligence and law-enforcement agencies should try to 'stop smuggling gangs before they act' in the same way they do in counterterrorism operations. ___ AP journalists John Leicester in Paris and Jill Lawless in London contributed. ___ Follow all AP stories on global migration at https://apnews.com/hub/migration	https://apnews.com/article/migration-france-britain-iraq-ddac64d4ffbe832740dd19e561c7838c	2024-11-05T03:21:14-08:00	
A week after Spain's floods, families hold out hope that loved ones are not among the dead	SEDAVI, Spain (AP) — Francisco Murgui went out to try to salvage his motorbike when the water started to rise. He never came back. One week after catastrophic flooding devasted eastern Spain, María Murgui still holds out hope that her father is alive and among the unknown number of the missing. 'He was like many people in town who went out to get their car or motorbike to safety,' the 27-year-old told The Associated Press. 'The flash flood caught him outside, and he had to cling to a tree in order to escape drowning. He called us to tell us he was fine, that we shouldn’t worry.' But when María set out into the streets of Sedaví to try to rescue him from the water washing away everything in its path, he was nowhere to be found. 'He held up until 1 in the morning,' she said. 'By 2, I went outside with a neighbor and a rope to try to locate him. But we couldn’t find him. And since then, we haven’t heard anything about him.' At least 218 have been confirmed dead after a deluge caused by heavy rains late on Oct. 29 and the next morning swamped entire communities, mostly in Spain's Valencia region. Most people were caught off guard. Regional authorities have been heavily criticized for having issued alerts to mobile phones some two hours after the disaster had started. Authorities have yet to any give an estimate of the missing. Spanish state broadcaster RTVE shows a steady stream of appeals by people searching for family members. María Murgui herself has posted a missing person’s message on social media with a photo of her father, a 57-year-old retiree. 'This is like riding a rollercoaster. Sometimes I feel very bad and sometimes I feel better. I try to stay positive,' she said. 'This truly is madness. We don’t know what else to do. Neither does anybody else in town.' Central government passes relief package While many search for their loved ones, the gargantuan recovery efforts in Sedaví and dozens of other communities slowly moved forward. The central government approved a 10.6-billion-euro relief package for 78 communities on Tuesday. Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez compared it to the measures taken during the COVID-19 pandemic. The package includes direct payments of 20,000 euros to 60,000 euros to owners of damaged homes, and financial aid for businesses and municipal governments. 'We have a lot of work left to do, and we know it,' Sánchez said. Sánchez said he will ask the European Union to help pay for the relief, saying 'it is time for the European Union to help.' Many people are still without basic goods amid scenes of devastation The floods have left behind post-apocalyptic scenes. In town after town, streets are still covered with thick brown mud and mounds of ruined belongings, clumps of rotting vegetation and wrecked vehicles. A stench arises from the muck. In many places, people still face shortages of basic goods, and lines form at impromptu emergency kitchens and stands handing out food. Water is running again but authorities say it is not fit for drinking. The ground floors of thousands of homes have been ruined. It is feared that inside some of the vehicles that were washed away or trapped in underground garages there could be bodies waiting to be recovered. Thousands of soldiers are working with firefighters and police reinforcements in the immense emergency response. Officers and troops are searching in destroyed homes, and in the countless cars strewn across highways and streets or lodged in the mud in canals and gorges. Authorities are worried about other health problems in the aftermath of the deadliest natural disaster in Spain's recent history. They have urged people to get tetanus shots, to treat any wounds to prevent infections and to clean the mud from their skin. Many people wear face masks. Thousands of volunteers are helping out, but frustration over the crisis management boiled over on Sunday when a crowd in hard-hit Paiporta hurled mud and other objects at Spain’s royals, Sánchez and regional officials when they made their first visit to the epicenter of the flood damage. ___ Wilson reported from Barcelona, Spain.	https://apnews.com/article/spain-floods-missing-people-valencia-dead-d032b706a16c1051ee2d741af10afa7b	2024-11-05T03:12:07-08:00	
An Iran official claims Iranian-German prisoner died before he could be executed	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — An Iranian official claimed Tuesday that Iranian-German prisoner Jamshid Sharmahd died before Tehran could execute him — directly contradicting the country's earlier announcement he had been put to death. The comment by Asghar Jahangir comes after Germany shut down all three Iranian consulates in the country over Sharmahd's death, leaving only the embassy in Berlin open. Germany later disputed Jahangir's remark. Meanwhile, even Iran's reformist President Masoud Pezeshkian has offered his own criticism of Germany's response to Sharmahd's death as tensions remain high between Tehran and the West over its rapidly advancing nuclear program and the ongoing Mideast wars. The judiciary’s Mizan news agency quoted Jahangir as saying: 'Jamshid Sharmahd was sentenced to death, his sentence was ready to be carried out, but he passed away before implementation of the sentence.' He did not elaborate. Jahangir's remarks were made to the state-affiliated Quds newspaper after a weekly news conference, when journalists typically buttonhole the spokesman into answering questions he didn't take from the podium. Germany's Foreign Ministry, reacting to the official's comment, said: 'His death was confirmed to us by the Iranian side.' 'Jamshid Sharmahd was abducted by Iran and held for years without a fair trial, in inhumane conditions and without the necessary medical care,' the ministry said. 'Iran is responsible for his death.' Germany added it was 'lobbying the Iranian government to hand over his body to his family.' The State Department in the U.S., where Sharmahd once lived, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Jason Poblete, a lawyer representing Sharmahd's family, told The Associated Press that the conflicting comments from Iran were 'deeply concerning.' 'This inconsistency raises serious questions about the circumstances of the death and the transparency of the Iranian system,' Poblete said. 'The family has been urging the German and U.S. authorities to investigate this matter to ascertain the truth, ensure accountability thoroughly and reunite Jimmy with his family in California.' Iran had said it executed Sharmahd on Oct. 28. He was 69. Iran accused Sharmahd, who lived in Glendora, California, of planning a 2008 attack on a mosque that killed 14 people — including five women and a child — and wounded over 200 others, as well as plotting other assaults through the little-known Kingdom Assembly of Iran and its Tondar militant wing. Iran also accused Sharmahd of 'disclosing classified information' on missile sites of Iran’s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard during a television program in 2017. His family disputed the allegations and had worked for years to see him freed. Germany, the U.S. and international rights groups have dismissed Sharmahd's trial as a sham. Amnesty International said the proceedings against Sharmahd had been a 'grossly unfair trial' because he had been denied access to an independent lawyer and 'the right to defend himself.' However, Amnesty also noted that Sharmahd ran a website for the Kingdom Assembly of Iran and its Tondar militant wing that included claims of 'responsibility for explosions inside Iran,' though he repeatedly denied being involved in the attacks. Sharmahd was apparently kidnapped while on a layover in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, in 2020. His family received their last message from him on July 28, 2020. It’s unclear how the abduction happened, but tracking data showed that Sharmahd’s cellphone traveled south from Dubai to the city of Al Ain on July 29, crossing the border into Oman. On July 30, tracking data showed the phone traveled to the Omani port city of Sohar, where the signal stopped. Two days later, Iran announced it had captured Sharmahd in a 'complex operation.' The Intelligence Ministry published a photograph of him blindfolded. In the time since his execution, Germany shut the consulates. It's a diplomatic tool Germany seldom uses and signals a major downgrade in relations with Tehran. However, Iran has responded by criticizing Germany and the West, including Pezeshkian, who campaigned on a promise of getting sanctions on the Islamic Republic lifted. 'When someone, who has slaughtered dozens, is executed, they say you do not observe human rights,' Pezeshkian said. ___ Associated Press writer Kirsten Grieshaber in Berlin contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/iran-sharmahd-execution-acb36064d51847f7e46c6886585e8bba	2024-11-05T02:40:06-08:00	
The Latest: Trump and Harris cede stage to voters who'll also decide control of House and Senate	Election Day is here. Voters are gearing up to head to the polls to cast their ballots for either Donald Trump or Kamala Harris in one of the nation’s most historic presidential races. They'll also be determining which party will control the House and Senate. Follow the AP’s Election 2024 coverage at: https://apnews.com/hub/election-2024. Here’s the latest: Voter Voice: ‘I got my sticker. I’m showing that off today’ Geoff Grace has a tremor, and filling out the little circles on his Wisconsin ballot was a difficult task. But he got it done — with some help from his mother — and got a round of applause from poll workers for getting through the process when his ballot was deposited. 'They were very nice and accommodating for that,' Grace said. 'And I got my sticker. I’m showing that off today.' Grace voted for Harris. 'I strongly believe a woman should have a chance at being president,' he said. Where are the voters who could decide the presidential election? When you hear the term bellwether, you might think about states in the presidential election that always vote with the White House winner. The true meaning of a bellwether is an indicator of a trend. For that, you need to think about counties. Across the seven main battleground states in 2024, there are 10 counties — out of more than 500 — that voted for Trump in 2016 and then flipped to Biden in 2020. Most are small and home to relatively few voters, with Arizona’s Maricopa a notable exception. So it’s not likely they’ll swing an entire state all by themselves. What these counties probably will do is provide an early indication of which candidate is performing best among the swing voters likely to decide a closely contested race. It doesn’t take much for a flip. For example, the difference in Wisconsin, during both 2016 and 2020, was only about 20,000 votes. ▶ Read more about the states that might matter the most on Election Day An Alabama county is printing emergency ballots after discovering a missing page St. Clair County Probate Judge Andrew Weathington said the problem was discovered Tuesday morning when packs of sealed ballots were opened at polling places and many were found to be missing the back page, which contains proposed constitutional amendments. He said it appeared to be a printing error. The proposed ballots were proofed before printing and were correct, he added. The Alabama Secretary of State’s Office confirmed emergency ballots are being printed. The ACLU of Alabama has asked the St. Clair probate office to extend voting hours by the number of hours it takes to get new ballots, a spokesman for the organization said. Weathington said he is seeking legal guidance from the Alabama secretary of state and the county attorney. Alabama voters are deciding local constitutional amendments and one statewide amendment. The statewide amendment relates to allowing a local school board to sell land, located in another Alabama county, to a developer. Voters in the county were also voting on a local amendment related to local school board governance. Florida’s voter information website is experiencing issues Florida voters turning to a state-run website to check their voter registration status were getting an error message Tuesday morning. A spokesperson for Florida Secretary of State Cord Byrd confirmed the state’s online Voter Information Lookup tool was experiencing technical issues but did not answer questions about what was causing the problem. 'We’re working to resolve it,' spokesperson Mark Ard said. 'We’re providing alternative websites and locations for voters to find their voter information, their precinct.' Floridians can check their voter registration status and find their polling place by going to their county supervisor of elections website. Foreign election interference issues quiet so far Cait Conley, senior adviser to the director of the Cybersecurity Infrastructure and Security Agency, said during a briefing that 'we are not currently tracking any national level, significant incidents impacting the security of our election infrastructure. We are tracking instances of extreme weather and other temporary infrastructure disruption to certain areas of the country, but these are largely expected routine and planned for events.' Conley said CISA, the FBI and intelligence communities did anticipate that foreign actors would try to influence the election later today and in the following weeks. Nancy Mace tries to cement her hold on her US House seat in South Carolina South Carolina Republican U.S. Rep. Nancy Mace is trying to cement her hold on her seat in a state that doesn’t mind sending people back to Congress for decades. There have been questions over whether Mace’s attention-seeking personality and brashness and willingness to buck her party’s establishment could be a liability. But so far, she’s been embraced by her coastal 1st District. Mace flipped the seat back to Republicans in 2020 after a stunning upset of incumbent Democratic Rep. Joe Cunningham. She fought off a GOP challenger endorsed by former President Donald Trump in 2022 and breezed to a surprisingly easy win — this time with Trump’s backing — in the 2024 Republican primary without a runoff. Her fellow Republicans in the South Carolina General Assembly also did her a favor by redrawing the district and sending traditional Democratic precincts in and around downtown Charleston to the state’s only majority-minority district. Under the old map in 2020, Mace won less than 51% of the vote. With the new maps in 2022 she received more than 56%. Mace’s Democratic challenger as voting ends Tuesday is businessman and former International African American Museum CEO Michael Moore. His campaign has struggled to gain momentum and Mace has barely acknowledged he’s in the race. ▶ Read more about the South Carolina House race Why you hear about Dixville Notch every presidential election It’s practically an Election Day tradition now. The news media gathers in tiny Dixville Notch, New Hampshire, a picturesque town near the Canadian border, to watch the first voters cast their ballots at midnight. Dixville Notch started its tradition in 1960. Neil Tillotson, who owned the town’s Balsams Grand Resort Hotel, heard about midnight voting from an Associated Press reporter, his son Tom told CBS News. The elder petitioned the legislature to let the community create its own voting precinct. Even though two other towns had midnight voting — including one that opened early for railroad workers — Dixville Notch was the only one with a hotel that made it convenient for reporters and photographers to file, with phone lines and a dark room. The first polling place was inside Tillotson’s resort. Per the tradition, AP reporter Nick Perry was on hand when a half-dozen voters cast their ballots at the polling place, which has moved to the living room of the Tillotson home. He documented the scene, and made sure not to miss that the polling place featured ' a couple of very friendly dogs.' NFL, NBA facilities in use on Election Day There are no NFL or NBA games today. Plenty of fans will be going to stadiums anyway. At least 17 NFL and NBA facilities are either polling locations or ballot drop-off stations. Some teams even offered voters personalized 'I Voted' stickers with team logos. Tuesdays aren’t game days in the NFL. The NBA, for the third consecutive year, isn’t playing any games on Election Day to support 'civic engagement,' the league said. And players from all 30 NBA teams wore warm-up shirts with a simple message Monday night: 'Vote,' they said. Giuliani ordered to appear in court after missing deadline to turn over possessions U.S. District Judge Lewis Liman issued the order late Monday after lawyers for Ruby Freeman and her daughter, Wandrea 'Shaye' Moss — two former Georgia election workers who were awarded a $148 million defamation judgment — reported to the court that Rudy Giuliani cleared out his Manhattan apartment weeks before the Oct. 29 deadline to surrender his possessions. Lawyers for Freeman and Moss say Giuliani has not yet surrendered any of the items that he was ordered to turn over — including his $5 million New York apartment, a 1980 Mercedes once owned by movie star Lauren Bacall and a variety of other belongings including sports memorabilia. Giuliani spokesperson Ted Goodman said Tuesday that Giuliani has made his property available and accused Freeman and Moss’ lawyers of deception and attempting to 'further bully and intimidate Mayor Giuliani until he is rendered penniless and homeless.' Giuliani was ordered to pay the former election workers for falsely accusing them of ballot fraud during the 2020 presidential election, as part of Donald Trump’s unfounded claims that the election was stolen from him. Harris campaign stresses patience as votes are tallied The seven battleground states have varying rules on when votes are counted, so it is expected to take some time before all votes are tallied in the key states that are expected to decide the razor-tight race. 'We’re going to be patient,' Harris campaign chair Jen O’Malley Dillon said during a Tuesday appearance on MSNBC. 'We’re going to be very focused on what’s happening in the early part of the night. But we know some of our bigger battleground states are not going to be fully tallied until later in the night or early in the morning.' O’Malley Dillon was hopeful that early turnout in Georgia and North Carolina was a positive sign for the Harris campaign. By the time early voting in North Carolina had ended on Saturday, over 4.4 million voters — or nearly 57% of all registered voters in the state — had cast their ballots. It was particularly robust in the 25 western counties affected by Hurricane Helene and was even stronger at 59% of registered voters. Georgia meanwhile saw more than 4 million voters cast early ballots, a record-breaking number for the state. Voter Voice: Harris is ‘going to go out and get the ball’ on Social Security Atlanta audio-visual technician Mark Butler wasn’t working on Tuesday and planned to watch election coverage after he cast his ballot in the morning. He said he voted for Harris. 'What matters to me is Social Security,' Butler said. 'I think she’s going to go out and get the ball on that one.' Butler, a lifelong Atlanta resident, said he’s fully aware of the weight Georgia will likely carry in deciding who wins the White House. 'It’s very important. We’re a swing state, probably one of the most important swing states,' he said. Democrats hope to flip a reliably Republican Louisiana congressional seat with new boundaries In a critical election year, Democrats are looking to flip a once reliably Republican Louisiana congressional seat, where political boundaries were recently redrawn to form the state’s second mostly Black congressional district. With five people on the ballot for Louisiana’s Sixth Congressional District, Democrats have thrown their support behind longtime politician Cleo Fields, 61. The state senator has been involved in state politics for three decades and served two terms in Congress after being elected in 1992. Across the aisle, Republicans are looking to preserve the seat, especially in an election year where the GOP is trying to hold on to their majority in the U.S. House. The only Republican on the ballot is former state lawmaker Elbert Guillory, 80. For nearly 50 years, only one Democrat has won the seat in Louisiana’s 6th Congressional District. But the district’s boundaries have recently been recrafted. ▶ Read more about Louisiana’s House race Migrant caravan starts walking in southern Mexico Some 2,500 migrants from at least a dozen countries have started walking in southern Mexico, hoping Mexican authorities will allow them to eventually reach the U.S. border. The caravan departed on U.S. Election Day after a tight race that frequently put immigration at its center. Those walking voiced more immediate concerns than U.S. politics like safety for their families and job opportunities. Groups of several hundred to several thousand migrants moving together en masse has become more common in recent years. In October 2020, a caravan that formed in Honduras ahead of the U.S. election was stopped by authorities in Guatemala. In October 2018, ahead of U.S. midterms, another caravan that started in Honduras grew to about 7,000 and eventually reached the U.S. border. In recent years, caravans haven’t made it out of southern Mexico. FBI warns of fabricated videos misusing its name and insignia A news clip that purports to come from the FBI tells voters that they should vote remotely because of a high terror threat at polling stations. But the FBI said that the clip is bogus, did not come from the bureau and does not accurately represent concerns about safety at polling locations. Also false is a video depicting a fabricated FBI press release claiming that the management of prisons in several key battleground states rigged inmate voting and colluded with one of the political parties. The FBI did not identify anyone who it thought might be responsible for the manufactured videos. Over the past two weeks, the agency has blamed Russian influence actors for a variety of manufactured internet postings and videos officials say were released as part of a broader disinformation campaign. Puerto Rico will also vote on new House delegate and statehood Voters in Puerto Rico will elect a new resident commissioner, the island’s representative with limited voting powers in the U.S. House. The outgoing resident commissioner, Jenniffer González of the pro-statehood New Progressive Party, is running for governor. There’s another item on the ballot that involves Congress: statehood. Voters will be asked for a seventh time about Puerto Rico’s political status. The nonbinding referendum offers three options: statehood, independence and independence with free association, under which issues like foreign affairs, U.S. citizenship and use of the U.S. dollar would be negotiated. Regardless of the outcome, a change in status requires approval from Congress. Nearly 2 million voters are eligible to participate in Tuesday’s election, although it remains to be seen how many people will do so. Voter apathy has dominated recent elections. The post office is open today, but it may be too late to send your mail-in ballot The U.S. Postal Service is open as usual on Election Day, but before voters drop their ballots in they should check their state’s deadlines. Some states require mail-in ballots to arrive byElection Day. Others only require ballots to be postmarked by Election Day. And some states, too, allow mail-in ballots to be dropped off in ballot boxes or at polling places through Election Day. Voters should check their state election websites to determine the deadlines. Vance casts his ballot in Ohio Republican Vice Presidential candidate JD Vance voted in Cincinnati this morning. 'Look, I feel good. You never know until you know, but I feel good about this race,' Vance said after he and his wife cast their ballots. Vance said he would depart for Palm Beach, Florida, later today to be with Donald Trump as results come in. Trump and Harris are on the ballot in Puerto Rico. But it’s symbolic As a presidential campaign that engendered fury on the island over a comedian’s incendiary remarks at a Trump rally culminates, Puerto Ricans can support Harris or Trump in a symbolic vote if they wish. While Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens, those on the island are not allowed to vote in U.S. presidential elections. The election is still consequential, as voters will elect a new governor. If Jenniffer González of the pro-statehood New Progressive Party wins, it will mark the first time in the island’s history that the party secures three consecutive terms. If Juan Dalmau, who is running for Puerto Rico’s Independence Party and Citizen Victory Movement, wins, it will be the first win for a candidate not representing either of the two main parties that have dominated the island’s politics for decades. Voters also will be asked for a seventh time about Puerto Rico’s political status. Nearly 2 million voters in Puerto Rico are eligible to participate in Tuesday’s election, though it remains to be seen how many will do so. Voter apathy has dominated recent elections. Voters fend off stormy weather as they head to the polls It’s raining across much of the nation’s midsection this morning and forecasters say storms are possible in large swaths of the country later today. In Houston, local television cameras showed voters huddled together under umbrellas as they waited to enter polling locations. In Miami Lakes, Florida, at least one voter held a sample ballot over his head in a largely futile effort to fend off a quick downpour. And it’s not just rain in the forecast. Voters in Colorado and Montana might see snow later today, forecasters say. Andy Kim and Curtis Bashaw face off in a New Jersey Senate race opened up by a bribery scandal New Jersey voters are deciding between Democratic U.S. Rep. Andy Kim and hotel developer Curtis Bashaw, a Republican, in the race to fill the Senate seat occupied until recently by Democrat Bob Menendez, who resigned following a federal bribery conviction. The Senate race has attracted attention because of Democrats’ razor-thin majority. There’s little margin of error for the party in a state like New Jersey, which hasn’t elected a Republican to the Senate in more than 50 years. 'I very much feel the pressure to make sure that we’re delivering not just for New Jersey, but delivering a majority for this country so I can get the important things done,' Kim said recently. The contest pits Kim, a three-term House member from New Jersey’s 3rd District, against Bashaw, a first-time candidate and businessman from Cape May. Four others including Green, Libertarian and Socialist party candidates are on the ballot. ▶ Read more about New Jersey’s Senate race Voter Voice: ‘I was just waiting for this day to come’ In Scranton, Pennsylvania, Liza Fortt, a 74-year-old Black woman, arrived at her polling location in a wheelchair and not feeling well. But she ventured out anyway to vote for Harris. 'It means a lot to me and my grandkids, my granddaughters, my nieces. ... I was just waiting for this day to come,' Fortt said. She said she never thought she’d have such an opportunity, to cast a ballot for a Black woman in a presidential race. 'I’m proud, to see a woman, not only a woman, but a Black woman,' Fortt said. A Palm Beach precinct is preparing for Trump’s arrival at the polls In Palm Beach, Florida, precinct 5604 had a large police presence Tuesday morning, about an hour after polls opened. At least 15 officers — from local sheriff’s deputies to Secret Service agents — were seen using the same walkway that voters were utilizing on their walk into the polling location, preparing for Trump’s arrival. The former president is expected to vote there later in the day. The voting line flowed without interruption, with a steady stream throughout the early hours. Democratic Rep. Angie Craig seeks a 4th term in Minnesota’s tightest congressional race Democratic U.S. Rep. Angie Craig is seeking a fourth term in Minnesota’s tightest congressional race, a faceoff against Republican former federal prosecutor Joe Teirab. And in the race for the open seat being vacated by Democratic U.S. Rep. Dean Phillips, Kelly Morrison, a Democratic former state senator, was favored over retired Washington County District Judge Tad Jude. He’s a Republican who also served on the Hennepin County Board and in both chambers of the state Legislature, where in 1972 at age 20 he became the youngest member ever elected to the House. Craig and Teirab ran in the 2nd District, which includes a political mix of outer suburbs of Minneapolis and St. Paul south of the Minnesota River, and rural areas farther south that trend Republican. It’s Minnesota’s sole swing district. Morrison and Jude competed in the 3rd District, which includes suburbs surrounding Minneapolis and has gone Democratic in recent elections. ▶ Read more about Minnesota’s congressional races Federal judge says Missouri can’t block federal election monitors in St. Louis A federal judge says Missouri can’t block federal officials from observing elections in St. Louis. At issue is a settlement agreement with the St. Louis Board aimed at ensuring people with mobility and vision impairments can access polling places. The settlement was reached in 2021 under Trump’s Justice Department after federal officials found problems, such as ramps that were too steep and inaccessible parking, according to the court papers. But Missouri is among several states pushing back against federal election monitors. And on Monday, Missouri Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft argued in a lawsuit that state law 'clearly and specifically limits who may be in polling places.' He also accused the federal government of 'attempting to illegally interfere in Missouri’s elections.' U.S. District Judge Sarah Pitlyk wrote Monday night that the case boils down to two individuals at one polling place to ensure compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act, as has happened at least twice before without any problems. 'Being prevented from enforcing its election laws may also be a harm to the State of Missouri, but that harm also has a counterweight in the United States’ interest in enforcing the ADA,' Pitlyk wrote. Bernie Sanders seeks a fourth Senate term representing Vermont Bernie Sanders, the Vermont independent beloved by progressives, is seeking to win a fourth six-year term in the U.S. Senate on Tuesday. The 83-year-old senator is a self-described democratic socialist who caucuses with the Democrats and twice came close to winning the presidential nomination. More recently, he’s worked closely with the Biden administration to craft its domestic policy goals on health care, education, child care and workers’ rights. The longest-serving independent in Congress is being challenged by Republican Gerald Malloy, a U.S. Army veteran and businessman. Also on the ballot are independent Steve Berry, as well as minor party candidates Mark Stewart Greenstein, Matt Hill and Justin Schoville. Sanders says he’s running again because the country faces some of its toughest and most serious challenges of the modern era. He described those as threats to its democratic foundations, massive levels of income and wealth inequality, climate change, and challenges to women’s ability to control their own bodies. 'I just did not feel with my seniority and with my experience that I could walk away from Vermont, representing Vermont, at this difficult moment in American history,' he said at a recent WCAX-TV debate. Malloy, 62, who served 22 years in the Army and was a defense contractor for 16 years, said he thought Sanders was going to retire — and thinks he should — after 34 years in Congress. Malloy said Sanders isn’t delivering results. ▶ Read more about the Vermont Senate race Most Florida voters cast their ballot before Election Day When polls opened at 7 a.m. local time in Florida on Tuesday, a majority of the state’s registered voters had already cast a ballot early — including voting by mail and early in-person voting, according to an analysis of state data by the University of Florida Election Lab. Of those who waited to vote on Election Day, many were getting their civic duty out of the way early, according to elections officials. In Orange County, home to the city of Orlando, more than 4,700 people voted in the first 20 minutes of polls being open, according to a social media post by the county elections supervisor’s office. Attorneys general urge a ‘peaceful transfer of power’ The attorneys general from 47 states and three U.S. territories are urging people to remain peaceful and to preemptively 'condemn any acts of violence related to the results.' The statement, released Tuesday, was signed by chief prosecutors from every U.S. state except Indiana, Montana and Texas. Attorneys general from the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories of American Samoa, Northern Mariana Islands and U.S. Virgin Islands also signed. 'We call upon every American to vote, participate in civil discourse and, above all, respect the integrity of the democratic process,' they wrote. 'Violence has no place in the democratic process; we will exercise our authority to enforce the law against any illegal acts that threaten it.' Fears of election violence persist nearly four years after Trump supporters rioted at the U.S. Capitol in an attempt to stop the election certification. Rather than condemning the violence during his campaign, Trump has celebrated the rioters, pledging to pardon them and featuring a recorded chorus of prisoners in jail for their roles in the Jan. 6 attack singing the national anthem. Where are Trump and Harris? Trump spent the very early hours of Election Day in Michigan, where he wrapped up a late-night rally in Grand Rapids. The Republican candidate plans to spend the day in Florida, where he is expected to vote in person — despite previously saying he would vote early. He’s scheduled to hold a campaign watch party in Palm Beach on Tuesday night. Harris plans to attend an election night party at Howard University in Washington, a historically Black university where she graduated with a degree in economics and political science in 1986 and was an active member of Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority. Aside from Howard, she has no public schedule announced for Election Day. Harris said Sunday that she had 'just filled out' her mail-in ballot and it was 'on its way to California.' ▶ Read more on what to watch on Election Day DC braces for potential election-related violence Businesses around the White House on Tuesday morning continued to board up windows and erect temporary fencing, precautions being taken amid worries that Election Day — and the days ahead — could lead to unrest. DC Mayor Muriel Bowser says the police department is also stepping up its presence in commercial districts in all eight wards of the city. Metropolitan Police Chief Pamela Smith at a Monday new conference also sought to assure the city’s residents that her department is prepared for whatever Election Day might bring. 'Our team has been fully engaged and vigilant,' she said. 'We are the best in the country at what we do, and we will keep working around the clock to keep Washington, D.C., safe and keep our residents safe.' How Harris and Trump wrapped up the final day before the election Vice President Kamala Harris and former president Donald Trump both spent the waning hours of their campaigns in the well-trodden swing states of Pennsylvania and Michigan, widely seen as critical to winning the White House. Harris wrapped her day in Philadelphia, where Lady Gaga sang 'God Bless America' and Oprah Winfrey appeared on stage with first-time voters. Ricky Martin, who is from Puerto Rico, was also there to draw out Puerto Rican voters turned off by a comedian who called their homeland a 'floating island of garbage' at a recent Trump rally. 'Our people-powered movement reflects a simple and undeniable truth: that we are all in this together,' Harris said. Harris didn’t arrive at the vice president’s residence, the Naval Observatory, until 1:41 a.m. Trump, meanwhile, spent the final hours of the day in Grand Rapids, Michigan, wrapping up around 2 a.m. He took shots at Harris for campaigning alongside celebrities. 'We don’t need a star because we have policy. We have great policy,' he said. Later, he boasted of his own stars: 'So many celebrities here, it’s incredible: Mike Pompeo, please stand up,' introducing his former secretary of state. Trump landed in Florida around 6 a.m. North Carolina voter reveals how he voted: ‘Carefully’ In Black Mountain, North Carolina, soil conservationist JD Jorgensen, 35, did not reveal what his presidential choice was after he voted around 7 a.m. But when asked how he voted, he said, 'Carefully.' 'I tried to do it as informed as I could be,' he added. 'I tried to stick to my values and just tried to pick candidates that align to those values and who I thought were going to be best for the offices they were running for.' Jorgensen said the choice he made was 'not really that tough.' 'I think that the candidates, both being in the public eye for as long as they have been, if you were on the fence you’re not really paying attention,' Jorgensen said.	https://apnews.com/article/kamala-harris-donald-trump-election-2024-a2352c1cc3289d206d21260c5dc34da8	2024-11-05T02:18:20-08:00	
Prince William walks nature trails near South Africa's Table Mountain to promote conservation	CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) — Prince William went on an early-morning nature walk near South Africa's Table Mountain on Tuesday to promote the work of conservation rangers in a unique urban national park. The Prince of Wales and heir to the British throne met with some of the rangers who guard the Table Mountain National Park, an 85-square-mile (220-square kilometer) area that overlooks Cape Town and spills into the city's suburbs in some areas. William didn't go to the top of the famous flat-topped mountain, instead strolling through nature trails on Signal Hill, a foothill that sits by the ocean's edge. The prince was accompanied on the walk by Megan Taplin, the park manager, and Robert Irwin, an Australian conservationist and the son of the late Steve Irwin, who was known as 'The Crocodile Hunter.' William met with rangers, park firefighters and members of a K-9 dog unit. 'He got to learn about what they do on a daily basis and what challenges they face,' Taplin said. 'We also spoke a lot about ranger wellness and how that's really important that rangers are supported, that their families are supported, because they are doing quite dangerous work and difficult work.' William is in South Africa to promote his annual Earthshot Prize, which awards $1.2 million in grants to five entrepreneurs or organizations for innovative ideas that help the environment and combat climate change. William set up the Earthshot Prize in 2020 through his Royal Foundation and the awards ceremony will be held in Cape Town — the first time it's been in Africa — on Wednesday night. The prince's four-day visit is a kind of environmental roadshow and is heavily focused on climate and conservation, though he did break away from those issues on his first day in Cape Town on Monday to attend a rugby practice at a local high school and play a little of South Africa's favorite sport with some of the kids. William also met with South African President Cyril Ramaphosa at the president's Cape Town residence on Tuesday. The prince was joined by U.K. Foreign Secretary David Lammy, who is in the country for a bilateral meeting with South Africa's foreign minister. Cape Town is renowned for its natural beauty and while Table Mountain is its most iconic landmark, the national park forms part of the Cape Floral Kingdom, which is a UNESCO world heritage site. Some of the plants growing on the slopes of the mountain and across the wider Cape Peninsula are not found anywhere else in the world. William's engagements this week include meetings with young environmentalists, attending a wildlife summit, visiting a botanical garden and spending time at a sea rescue institute and with a Cape Town fishing community. At one event, he'll learn how seaweed is being used to help regenerate oceans. Officials said he will wear sustainable clothes during his visit to promote a climate-friendly clothing industry. William last visited Africa in 2018 but he has a long-standing connection to the continent. He traveled there as a boy after the death of his mother, Princess Diana, in a Paris car crash in 1997. He and his wife, Kate, got engaged at a wildlife conservancy in Kenya in 2010. And he said he came up with the idea for the Earthshot awards while in Namibia in 2018. Before the visit to Cape Town, William said that Africa has always had 'a special place in my heart.' William's brother, Prince Harry, also retains links to Africa and visited South Africa and neighboring Lesotho last month for a charity he set up in southern Africa. William's wife Kate, the Princess of Wales, and their children Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis did not travel to South Africa. Kate only recently returned to some public duties after completing treatment for an undisclosed type of cancer. ___ AP Africa news: https://apnews.com/hub/africa	https://apnews.com/article/prince-william-royal-british-south-africa-earthshot-04b295e44e6549e0fc362b31766f11f7	2024-11-05T01:42:07-08:00	
Tropical Storm Rafael near hurricane intensity as it barrels toward Cuba and Cayman Islands	SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) — Tropical Storm Rafael strengthened to near hurricane intensity Tuesday night, as it barreled toward the Cayman Islands and Cuba, where it was forecast to hit as a hurricane. The storm was located 25 miles (45 kilometers) southeast of Little Cayman in the Cayman Islands on Tuesday after passing by Jamaica, where little damage was reported. It was picking up speed with maximum sustained winds of 70 mph (110 kph) and was moving northwest at 15 mph (24 kph), according to the National Hurricane Center in Miami. Hurricane force winds start at 74 mph. The center said it expected 'steady to rapid intensification' over the next 24 hours. It was expected to pass over or by the Cayman Islands on Tuesday night and make landfall in western Cuba on Wednesday. 'Rafael is expected to become a hurricane as it passes near the Cayman Islands with further strengthening before it makes landfall in Cuba,' the center said. The U.S. State Department issued an advisory for Cuba on Tuesday afternoon, offering departure flights to non-essential staff and American citizens, and advising others to 'reconsider travel to Cuba due to the potential impact of Tropical Storm Rafael.' Meanwhile, on Tuesday morning, the Cuban Civil Defense called on Cubans on social media to prepare as soon as possible, because when the storm makes landfall 'it’s important to stay where you are.' The day before, authorities said they had issued an evacuation order for 37,000 people in far eastern Cuba, in the province of Guantanamo, due to bad weather. A hurricane warning was in effect for the Cayman Islands and the Cuban provinces of Pinar del Rio, Artemisa, La Habana, Mayabeque, Matanzas and the Isle of Youth. A tropical storm warning was in effect for the Cuban provinces of Villa Clara, Cienfuegos, Sancti Spiritus and Ciego de Avila, as well as the lower and middle Florida Keys from Key West to west of the Channel 5 Bridge, and Dry Tortugas. The warning was lifted in Jamaica after the storm passed by the western coast. A tropical storm watch was in effect for the Cuban provinces of Camaguey and Las Tunas. 'The storm is currently situated in an atmospheric and oceanic environment that is quite conducive for strengthening,' the hurricane center said. In the Cayman Islands, officials closed schools and government offices as they urged residents to prepare. Long lines were reported at grocery stores as the storm approached. The storm is bad news for Cuba, which is still struggling to recover from Hurricane Oscar, which battered the island about two weeks ago after making landfall in the eastern part of Cuba, killing at least six people. The storm also coincided with a large-scale blackout on the island. Forecasters warned Rafael would unleash heavy rains across the western Caribbean that could lead to flooding and mudslides in parts of Cuba and the Cayman Islands. Heavy rainfall also was expected to spread north into Florida and nearby areas of the southeast U.S. during the middle to late part of the week. The Hurricane Center predicted storm surges in Florida could reach 1 to 3 feet in Dry Tortugas and 1 to 2 feet in the Lower Florida Keys. A few tornadoes also were expected Wednesday over the Keys and southwesternmost Florida mainland. Rafael is the 17th named storm of the season. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicted the 2024 hurricane season was likely to be well above average, with between 17 and 25 named storms. The forecast called for as many as 13 hurricanes and four major hurricanes. An average Atlantic hurricane season produces 14 named storms, seven of them hurricanes and three major hurricanes.	https://apnews.com/article/hurricane-rafael-caribbean-cuba-cayman-islands-a6e887bf385bddae926629ed8aa0ea53	2024-11-05T01:22:03-08:00	
An Israeli airstrike kills 20 people in northern Gaza, Palestinian officials say	DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — An Israeli airstrike in northern Gaza has killed at least 20 people, mostly women and children, Palestinian officials said Tuesday, as Israel wages a nearly monthlong air and ground operation in what was already the most isolated and heavily destroyed part of the territory. The strike late Monday hit a home where several displaced families were sheltering in the town of Beit Lahiya, near the border with Israel, according to Hossam Abu Safiya, the director of the recently raided and barely functioning Kamal Adwan Hospital, which received the casualties. The Israeli military said it targeted a weapons storage facility from which a militant had operated, and that 'numerous steps were taken to mitigate the risk of harming civilians.' The dead included eight women and six children, according to a list provided by the Gaza Health Ministry’s emergency service. Separate strikes elsewhere in Gaza early Tuesday killed another 10 people, according to health officials. Israel launched the offensive in the north after saying Hamas militants had regrouped there. The army has returned to several areas of Gaza multiple times after previous operations, as Hamas continues to carry out hit-and-run attacks on troops and fire occasional rockets into Israel. The military has ordered the complete evacuation of Beit Lahiya, the nearby town of Beit Hanoun and the urban Jabaliya refugee camp, and has allowed almost no humanitarian aid into the area for over a month. That has drawn rebukes from the Biden administration, which has warned that U.S. laws might force it to curb military aid to Israel if more aid is not allowed in. The U.N. estimates about 100,000 people remain in the area, after tens of thousands of people fled to nearby Gaza City since Israel’s offensive there began, the latest wave of displacement within the besieged territory. Around 90% of the population of 2.3 million have fled during the 13-month-old war, often multiple times. The three hospitals serving the area have been largely inaccessible because of the fighting, and ambulances have stopped operating. Israeli troops raided Kamal Adwan Hospital last month, saying Hamas militants were sheltering there, allegations denied by Palestinian health officials. The offensive has raised fears among Palestinians that Israel is implementing a surrender-or-starve plan for northern Gaza proposed by former generals, in which civilians would be ordered out, aid would be cut off and anyone remaining would be considered a fighter. The Israeli military has denied receiving such orders, but the government has not said whether it is adopting part or all of the plan. Palestinian officials said a separate wave of Israeli strikes early Tuesday killed 10 people, including four children and two women. One strike hit a house in the Tufah neighborhood in Gaza City, killing two children and their parents, according to the Health Ministry’s emergency service. Two other children were wounded, it said. In the central town of Zuweida, an Israeli airstrike hit a tent where a displaced family was sheltering, killing four people, including a mother and her two children, according to Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in the nearby city of Deir al-Balah. Another strike hit a house in Deir al-Balah, killing two people, the hospital said. An Associated Press journalist counted the bodies at the hospital morgue. The Israeli military says it only targets militants and accuses them of hiding among civilians. It rarely comments on individual strikes, which often kill women and children. The war began when Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, taking another 250 people hostage. Around 100 captives are still inside Gaza, about a third of whom are believed to be dead. Israel’s retaliatory offensive has killed over 43,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in its toll but says over half of those killed were women and children. ___ Magdy reported from Cairo.

Pakistani guard shoots, wound 2 Chinese working in a textile mill in Karachi	KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) — A Pakistani guard shot and wounded two Chinese nationals working in a textile mill in the southern port city of Karachi on Tuesday, but authorities said the attack was not related to militant violence. China has frequently demanded better security for its nationals working in Pakistan. Last month, two Chinese were killed in a suicide car bombing outside the Karachi airport. Thousands of Chinese are in Pakistan to work for Beijing’s multibillion-dollar Belt and Road Initiative, which is building major infrastructure projects. An unknown number of Chinese are also working at factories in the country. Suhail Jokhoio, the spokesperson for the provincial home department, said the guard involved in the textile mill attack was arrested and police are still investigating to determine why the man to opened fire. He said the wounded Chinese were taken to a hospital.

Qataris decide whether to end limited voting for legislative seats in shadow of US election	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Qatar opened a snap poll Tuesday to decide whether to end its limited voting for legislative seats, a measure likely to pass and end its short-lived experiment in electing members of the country’s advisory Shura Council. Voting began as the world's attention focused on the U.S. presidential election, with even Qatar’s state-funded satellite news network Al Jazeera offering brief acknowledgments of the vote wedged between coverage of the U.S. and the Mideast wars. Though Qatar's ruling emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, announced last month a vote would take place, it was only Sunday that authorities announced the date of the poll. Voting will run until 7 p.m. (1600 GMT) and results are expected on Wednesday. All Qatari employees in the country also were granted permission to leave work beginning from 11 a.m. to vote. Qatar's state news agency described the voting as 'an enthusiastic atmosphere and a historic moment, clearly confirming everyone’s keenness to make this national celebration a success.' The vote will 'strengthen the social fabric in the most beautiful image and form, which honestly represents an important stage in the country’s victorious march and its national unity,' the news agency added. Qatar first introduced plans for legislative elections in its 2003 constitution, but authorities repeatedly postponed implementing the vote. The country finally held elections for two-thirds of the Shura Council, which drafts laws, approves state budgets and advises the ruler, in October 2021. The elections came after the end of a boycott of Qatar by Bahrain, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates that tore the Gulf Arab states apart. It also came about a year ahead of Qatar hosting the 2022 FIFA World Cup, an event that drew intense scrutiny from the West of the country's treatment of foreign laborers and its system of governance. Qatar remains an important nation to the West as it hosted the Taliban and assisted in the chaotic 2021 NATO withdrawal from Afghanistan and as a mediator as the Israel-Hamas war rages in the Gaza Strip and has expanded to Lebanon. But the election created problems in the energy-rich nation. Electoral law distinguishes between born and naturalized Qatari citizens and bars the latter from electoral participation. Human Rights Watch described the system as 'discriminatory,' excluding thousands of Qataris from running or voting. The disqualifications sparked minor protests that led to several arrests. In announcing the vote on changing the constitution, Sheikh Tamim said: 'The contest between candidates for membership in the Shura Council took place within families and tribes, and there are different views regarding the repercussions of such competition on our norms, traditions, as well as the conventional social institutions and their cohesion.' 'The contest assumes an identity-based character that we are not equipped to handle, with potential complications over time that we would rather avoid,' he added. The vote marks yet another rollback in the hereditarily ruled Gulf Arab states of halting steps to embrace representational rule following efforts by the United States to push harder for democratic reforms in the Middle East after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. Hopes for democracy in the region also rose in the wake of the 2011 Arab Spring. In May, the ruler of oil-rich Kuwait dissolved his country’s parliament for as much as four years. While the Kuwaiti parliament had struggled, it represented the Gulf Arab state’s most free-wheeling legislative body and could challenge the country’s rulers.	https://apnews.com/article/qatar-constitutional-amendment-vote-elections-9c9125cb4bb6d6e98bc73cf5a7cbdaea	2024-11-04T22:54:08-08:00	
Indonesian rescuers dig through volcanic ash after eruption kills 9 and destroys buildings	MAUMERE, Indonesia (AP) — Rescue workers on Tuesday were sifting through smoldering debris and thick mud in search of survivors, a day after a volcano on Indonesia’s remote island of Flores erupted with fury, killing at least nine people with its searing lava and ash. Mount Lewotobi Laki Laki spewed thick brownish ash as high as 2,000 meters (6,500 feet) into the air, and searing lava, gravel and ash were thrown up to seven kilometers (4.3 miles) from its crater, blanketing nearby villages and towns with tons of volcanic debris and forcing residents to flee. The National Disaster Management Agency on Tuesday lowered the known death toll from an earlier report of 10, saying it had received updated information from rescuers that a victim trapped under tons of debris in a collapsed house who was feared dead was eventually rescued alive and was now in critical condition at a hospital. The agency said 63 other people were hospitalized, 31 of them with serious injuries. More than 2,400 villagers streamed into makeshift emergency shelters after Monday's powerful eruption that burned down seven schools and 23 houses, including a convent of nuns, on the majority-Catholic island, said the agency’s spokesperson, Abdul Muhari. Smoldering debris, thick mud and a power blackout hampered the evacuation and search efforts, said Kensius Didimus, a local disaster agency chief, 'We’ll do everything we can to evacuate villagers by preparing trucks and motorbikes for them to flee at any time,' he said, adding that the debris and lava mixed with rainfall formed thick mud that destroyed the main roads on the island. Authorities warned the thousands of people who fled the volcano’s wrath not to return during Tuesday’s lull in activity. But some were desperate to check on livestock and possessions left behind. In several areas, everything — from the thinnest tree branch to couches and chairs inside homes — was caked with ash. Videos released by the National Search and Rescue Agency showed roads that were covered in heavy gray ash and houses covered by thick gray mud, rocks and uprooted trees. The country’s geology agency said a series of eruptions since Thursday had created an accumulation of hidden energy due to a blockage of magma in the crater, which reduced detectible seismic activity while building up pressure. 'The eruptions have eased pressure that had been building under a lava dome perched on the crater,' said Priatin Hadi Wijaya, who heads the Center for Volcanology and Disaster Mitigation. 'But we should anticipate hot ash and debris could tumble down from the crater due to heavy rains.' Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto has instructed his Cabinet and disaster and military officials to coordinate the response, said Coordinating Minister for Human Development and Culture Pratikno, who like many Indonesians uses a single name. The country’s volcano monitoring agency increased the volcano’s alert status to the highest level and more than doubled the exclusion zone to a seven-kilometer (4.3-mile) radius after midnight on Monday as eruptions became more frequent. Lewotobi Laki Laki is one of a pair of stratovolcanoes in the East Flores district of East Nusa Tenggara province known locally as the husband and wife mountains. 'Laki laki' means husband, while its mate is Lewotobi Perempuan, or woman. About 6,500 people were evacuated in January after Mount Lewotobi Laki Laki began erupting, spewing thick clouds and forcing the government to close the island’s Frans Seda Airport. No casualties or major damage were reported, but the airport has remained closed since then due to seismic activity. This is Indonesia’s second volcanic eruption in as many weeks. West Sumatra province’s Mount Marapi, one of the country’s most active volcanos, erupted on Oct. 27, spewing thick columns of ash at least three times and blanketing nearby villages with debris, but no casualties were reported. Lewotobi Laki Laki is one of the 120 active volcanoes in Indonesia, an archipelago of 280 million people. The country is prone to earthquakes, landslides and volcanic activity because it sits along the 'Ring of Fire,' a horseshoe-shaped series of seismic fault lines around the Pacific Ocean. ___ Niniek Karmini and Andi Jatmiko in Jakarta, Indonesia, contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/indonesia-volcano-eruption-3300ed5bc84ed023465eef626007a2c9	2024-11-04T22:47:57-08:00	
Middle East latest: Israeli strikes kill 10 people in Gaza and 2 in the West Bank	Israeli strikes early Tuesday killed 10 people in the Gaza Strip, including four children and two women, Palestinian officials say. In the occupied West Bank, Israeli forces killed two people in an airstrike and shot a third person dead. Despite growing pressure from the United States and others in the international community for a cease-fire in Gaza and Lebanon, intensified Israeli strikes against the Hezbollah militant group are expanding beyond Lebanon’s border areas. Israel is also fighting a seemingly endless war against Hamas in northern Gaza. Since the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah erupted in 2023, at least 3,000 people have been killed and some 13,500 wounded in Lebanon, the Health Ministry reports. More than a year of Israel's war against Hamas in Gaza has killed more than 43,000 people, Palestinian health officials say. They do not distinguish between civilians and combatants, but say more than half of those killed were women and children. The war began after Palestinian militants stormed into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people — mostly civilians — and abducting 250 others. ___ Here’s the latest: Israeli strikes kill 10 in Gaza DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — Palestinian officials say Israeli strikes early Tuesday killed 10 people in the Gaza Strip, including four children and two women. One strike hit a house in the Tufah neighborhood in Gaza City, killing two children and their parents, according to the Gaza Health Ministry’s emergency service. Two other children were wounded, it said. In the central town of Zuweida, an Israeli airstrike hit a tent where a displaced family was sheltering, killing four people, including a mother and her two children, according to the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in the nearby city of Deir al-Balah. Another strike hit a house in Deir al-Balah, killing two people, the hospital said. An Associated Press journalist counted the bodies at the hospital morgue. The Israeli military says it only targets militants and accuses them of hiding among civilians. It rarely comments on individual strikes, which often kill women and children. The war began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking another 250 hostage. Around 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, a third of whom are believed to be dead. Israel’s offensive has killed over 43,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which says over half were women and children. It does not distinguish between civilians and combatants. Israeli forces kill 3 people in the occupied West Bank RAMALLAH, West Bank — Palestinian officials say Israeli forces have killed three people in the occupied West Bank. Two were killed in an airstrike early Tuesday near the northern city of Jenin, a flashpoint for Israeli-Palestinian violence in recent years. A third person was shot in the village of Tamoun, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry. The Israeli military said it called in an airstrike on a militant cell near Jenin. There was no immediate comment on the shooting. Israeli forces have carried out near-daily military raids in the West Bank since Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack out of the Gaza Strip triggered the Israel-Hamas war. The Health Ministry says at least 767 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank since then. Most appear to have been militants killed in battles with Israeli forces, but the dead also include civilian bystanders and people killed during protests. Israel says the raids are aimed at dismantling Hamas in the West Bank and preventing attacks. Palestinians have carried out dozens of stabbing, shooting and car-ramming attacks against Israelis since the start of the war. Israel captured the West Bank in the 1967 Mideast war, and the Palestinians want it to form the main part of their future state.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-hezbollah-mideast-latest-5-november-2024-c2a90bdb0fdd4f3f643e20114fd70e0a	2024-11-04T22:41:51-08:00	
A tiny village in India where Kamala Harris has ancestral roots is praying for her victory	THULASENDRAPURAM, India (AP) — The temple reverberated with rhythmic Sanskrit and Tamil hymns, as a Hindu priest held a flame before the god. As this tiny South Indian village gathered to pray for Kamala Harris, a gaggle of reporters jostled for space and camera angles. There's little to distinguish the village of Thulasendrapuram from any other rural community in Tamil Nadu, except its connection to a woman who could become America's first leader with South Asian roots. As millions of Americans vote, Harris has people rooting for her from thousands of miles away in a village surrounded by rice paddies and coconut trees, where her mother's family has ancestral ties. They talk about her at the local tea shop. Banners and billboards bearing her face are seen throughout the community. 'Our deity is a very powerful God. If we pray well to him, he will make her victorious,' said M. Natarajan, the temple priest that led the prayers in front of the image of Hindu deity Ayyanar, a form of Lord Shiva. Harris’ maternal grandfather was born in the village, about 350 kilometers (215 miles) from the southern coastal city of Chennai, more than 100 years ago. As an adult, he moved to Chennai, where he worked as a high-ranking government official until his retirement. Harris has never visited Thulasendrapuram and she has no living relatives in the village, but people here still venerate the family that made it big in the U.S. 'Our village ancestors' granddaughter is running as a U.S. presidential candidate. Her victory will be happy news for every one of us,' Natarajan said. The village's sudden fame has helped bring money into the village. Recently, construction began on a water storage tank with funds donated by a local bank. Village residents say it will carry a plaque with Harris’ name. Harris’ late mother, Shyamala Gopalan, was born in India. After moving to the U.S. to study, she married a Jamaican man, and they named their daughter Kamala, a Sanskrit word for 'lotus flower.' Other than trips during her childhood, Harris hasn’t visited India much — particularly not since becoming vice president — but she has often spoken emotionally about her ties to her late mother’s country of birth. On Tuesday, she released a campaign video highlighting her mother, who arrived in the U.S. at age 19 and became a cancer researcher. Titled 'Mother,' the video ends with a narrator saying: 'This daughter of Shyamala, this daughter of the American story, is ready to lead us forward.' Harris has often talked about how she was guided by the values of her Indian-born grandfather and mother. She has also spoken of her love of south Indian food, especially a type of steamed rice cake called idli. Harris’ name is engraved in a list of donors — her aunt Sarala Gopalan gave money to the temple in her name — along with that of her grandfather. Outside, a large banner wishes 'the daughter of the land' success in the election. On Tuesday, the village temple also received rare international visitors: two American tourists and one from the U.K., all wearing black t-shirts that said 'Kamala Freakin Harris.' Manikandan Ganesan, a villager who runs a small store near the temple, said Harris’ bid for the presidency has made the village famous. He hopes Harris will eventually visit them. 'Even if she mentioned that she would visit our village, it would make us very happy,' Ganesan said. 'Her victory itself will be a big source of happiness for us.' Village residents also prayed for Harris’ victory in 2020, and set off firecrackers when she became the U.S. Vice President. For women of the village, the candidate's journey is a source of inspiration. Local politician Arulmozhi Sudhakar said Harris embodies a significant step toward female empowerment in places like Thulasendrapuram, where a majority of women continue to face discrimination and gender inequality. 'From the time when women were not even allowed to step out of their house, to now a woman from our village contesting in the U.S. presidential election — this brings happiness for us,' Sudhakar said. 'The coming generations will see her as a role model to succeed in life.'	https://apnews.com/article/india-kamala-harris-village-us-election-a2c1bf50db407b8e9503d763bc9fd572	2024-11-04T22:37:57-08:00	
Puerto Rico holds general election that promises to be historic	SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) — Puerto Rico is holding elections that will be historic regardless of which of the top two gubernatorial candidates wins. If Jenniffer González of the pro-statehood New Progressive Party wins Tuesday's election, it will mark the first time in the island’s history that the party secures three consecutive terms. If Juan Dalmau, who is running for Puerto Rico’s Independence Party and Citizen Victory Movement, wins, it will be the first win for a candidate not representing either of the two main parties that have dominated the island’s politics for decades. Trailing González and Dalmau in polls is Jesús Manuel Ortiz of the Popular Democratic Party, which supports the island’s territorial status. Also running is Javier Jiménez of Project Dignity, a conservative party created in 2019. For decades, the New Progressive Party and the Popular Democratic Party would receive at least 90% of all votes, but that began to change in 2016, with newer parties attracting more voters amid economic and political turmoil. 'That has been a very big change,' said Jorge Schmidt Nieto, a political analyst and university professor. Delayed results Results are not expected late Tuesday, with analysts warning it might be a couple of days before that happens. During the 2020 elections, it took officials four days to release preliminary results. Puerto Rico’s State Elections Commission is still counting more than 220,000 early and absentee votes it received, with officials from various political parties noting the process is slow-going. The counting of those votes began more than two weeks later than usual. Jessika Padilla, the commission’s alternate president, said in a press conference that some 40% of those votes had been counted as of Monday. 'This validation process is one that we are not going to take lightly,' she said. More than 5,000 inmates out of some 7,400 total in Puerto Rico also have voted, although it’s unclear how many of those votes have been counted. The commission and other officials also are still receiving allegations about electoral crimes, including from people who said they received confirmations for early voting when they made no such request. Meanwhile, energy generators have been dispatched to more than two dozen polling stations to guarantee electricity given the chronic power outages that have plagued Puerto Rico in recent years. A status question and a symbolic vote On Tuesday, voters also will be asked for a seventh time about Puerto Rico’s political status. The nonbinding referendum offers three options: statehood, independence and independence with free association, under which issues like foreign affairs, U.S. citizenship and use of the U.S. dollar would be negotiated. Regardless of the outcome, a change in status requires approval from the U.S. Congress. In addition, Puerto Ricans on Tuesday can support Kamala Harris or Donald Trump in a symbolic vote if they wish. While Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens, those on the island are not allowed to vote in U.S. presidential elections. Nearly 2 million voters are eligible to participate in Tuesday’s election, although it remains to be seen how many people will do so. Voter apathy has dominated recent elections. ____ Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america	https://apnews.com/article/puerto-rico-elections-dalmau-jenniffer-f32de13cb3d7aad4f4264d1b3d86352f	2024-11-04T20:06:25-08:00	
Australian foreign minister raises allegations with Indian counterpart of targeting Sikhs in Canada	MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — Australia’s foreign minister said Tuesday she raised allegations with her Indian counterpart that India has targeted Sikh activists in Canada. Foreign Minister Penny Wong said she discussed the Canadian allegations with Indian Foreign Minister S. Jaishankar while he was in the Australian capital, Canberra. India has denied Canada’s allegation that Indian Home Minister Amit Shah ordered the targeting of Sikh activists inside Canada. Wong said her message to the Sikh community was that people have a right to be safe and respected in Australia, regardless of who they are. 'We’ve made clear our concerns about the allegations under investigation. We’ve said that we respect Canada’s judicial process,' Wong said at a news conference with Jaishankar. 'We convey our views to India as you would expect us to do and we have a principled position in relation to matters such as the rule of law and the independence of the judiciary and also, frankly, the sovereignty of all countries,' she added. Jaishankar said Canada has put Indian diplomats under surveillance, which was 'unacceptable.' 'Canada has developed a pattern of making allegations without providing specifics,' he said. Australia has close intelligence-sharing ties with Canada as members of the Five Eyes alliance that also includes the United States, Britain and New Zealand. Over the weekend, India officially protested Canada's allegation of Sikh activists being targeted there as 'absurd and baseless.' Jaishankar on Tuesday also condemned reports of vandalism at a Hindu temple near Toronto in Canada on Sunday as 'deeply concerning.' In videos on social media, demonstrators carrying yellow flags in support of the Sikh separatist movement can be seen clashing with others, including some holding India's national flag, inside the temple complex. Indian consular officials were visiting the temple where the clashes erupted. It was unclear how the violence began. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called the violence at the temple 'unacceptable,' adding that 'every Canadian has the right to practice their faith freely and safely.' The attack on the temple also drew a strong rebuke from Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday. 'Equally appalling are the cowardly attempts to intimidate our diplomats. Such acts of violence will never weaken India’s resolve,' he wrote on the social media platform X, adding that India expects Canada to ensure justice. Relations between the two countries soured after Trudeau said last year there were credible allegations the Indian government had links to the assassination of Sikh activist Hardeep Singh Nijjar in Canada. India has vehemently rejected the accusation. New Delhi, long anxious about Sikh separatist groups, has increasingly accused the Canadian government of giving free rein to separatists from a once-strong movement to create an independent Sikh homeland, known as Khalistan, in India. The diplomatic row led to the expulsion of each side's top diplomats last month. Jaishankar said, 'We believe in freedoms, but we also believe freedom should not be misused.' Canada is not the only country that has accused Indian officials of plotting an assassination on foreign soil. The United States Justice Department announced criminal charges in mid-October against an Indian government employee in connection with an alleged foiled plot to kill a Sikh separatist leader living in New York City. The Justice Department said Vikash Yadav, who authorities say directed the New York plot from India, faces murder-for-hire charges in an alleged planned killing that prosecutors have previously said was meant to precede a string of other politically motivated murders in the United States and Canada. ___ Associated Press writer Krutika Pathi in New Delhi contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/australia-india-canada-sikh-foreign-minister-4aa2d7dfdc83212fcb77c3f38fe5f1bb	2024-11-04T19:56:30-08:00	
Stock market today: World shares are mixed as investors eye the US election	World shares were mixed on Tuesday, with major benchmarks in Asia gaining more than 1%, as investors awaited the outcome of the U.S. presidential election and other potentially market-rattling events this week. This week brings bring various potential flashpoints, among them Election Day in the United States. But the results may not be known for some time as officials count all the votes, and the uncertainty could roil markets. Adding to the potential for volatility, the Federal Reserve will also be meeting on interest rates later this week. The widespread expectation is for it to cut its main interest rate for a second straight time. The futures for the S&amp;P 500 and for the Dow Jones Industrial Average were 0.1% higher. In early European trading, Germany's DAX edged 0.1% lower to 19,125.18 while the CAC 40 in Paris shed 0.2% to 7,356.02. Britain's FTSE 100 was down 0.1% at 8,179.73. Share prices surged on Chinese markets as investors anticipated moves by Beijing to boost the world’s second-largest economy during a meeting of the Standing Committee of China’s National People’s Congress. Hong Kong's Hang Seng jumped 2.1% to 21,006.97, while the Shanghai Composite index surged 2.3% to 3,386.99. Officials are expected to endorse major spending initiatives to boost economic growth amid troubles for the country’s real-estate industry. The official Xinhua News Agency reported that the lawmakers had reviewed legislation to raise ceilings on local government debt to replace existing hidden debts, part of a plan announced earlier to arrange debt swaps to help resolve the financial woes brought on by the pandemic and by a collapse in the property market in recent years. So far, no specific amount of funding for such efforts has been announced. Elsewhere in Asia, Japan's Nikkei 225 index gained 1.1% to 38,474.90, reopening after a holiday on Monday. South Korea's Kospi fell 0.4% to 2,576,88 after the country's military said North Korea launched multiple short-range ballistic missiles toward its eastern sea, continuing its weapons demonstrations ahead of the U.S. presidential election. The S&amp;P/ASX 200 in Australia dropped 0.4% to 8,131.80 as the central bank kept its benchmark interest rate unchanged. On Monday, the S&amp;P 500 slipped 0.3%, remaining near its record set last month. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.6%, while the Nasdaq composite slipped 0.3%. The hope that’s propelled U.S. stock indexes to records recently is that the U.S. economy can remain resilient and avoid a long-feared recession, in part because of the coming cuts to rates expected from the Fed. The broad U.S. stock market has historically risen regardless of which party wins the White House. And in 2020, U.S. stocks climbed immediately after Election Day and kept going even after former President Donald Trump refused to concede and challenged the results, creating plenty of uncertainty. A large part of that rally was due to excitement about the potential for a vaccine for COVID-19, which had just shut down the global economy. A Trump victory would be less of a surprise to markets this time around than in 2016, when Treasury yields soared on expectations for tax cuts that could further inflate the nation’s debt or fuel a stronger U.S economy. In the oil market early Tuesday, the price for a barrel of U.S. crude gained 27 cents to $71.74. On Monday, it rose 2.8% after Saudi Arabia and other oil producers said they would delay plans to increase the amount of crude they produced. Brent crude, the international standard, advanced 23 cents to $75.31 per barrel. It rose 2.7% on Monday. The price of Brent is still down for the year so far, in part because of worries about how much demand will come from China given its economic challenges. In currency dealings, the dollar rose to 152.36 Japanese yen from 152.10 yen. The euro climbed to $1.0886 from $1.0880.	https://apnews.com/article/stocks-markets-election-china-f7739620ddf23f012aa2ba7559e2f486	2024-11-04T17:28:09-08:00	
Kenyan man is convicted of plotting a 9/11-style attack on the US	NEW YORK (AP) — A Kenyan man was convicted Monday of plotting a 9/11-style attack on a U.S. building on behalf of the terrorist organization al-Shabab. A federal jury in Manhattan found Cholo Abdi Abdullah guilty on all six counts he faced for conspiring to hijack an aircraft and slam it into a building, according to court records. He’s due to be sentenced next March and faces a mandatory minimum of 20 years in prison. Abdullah represented himself during the trial, which opened last week. He declined to give an opening statement and did not actively participate in questioning witnesses. In court papers filed ahead of the trial, prosecutors said Abdullah intended to 'merely sit passively during the trial, not oppose the prosecution and whatever the outcome, he would accept the outcome because he does not believe that this is a legitimate system.' Lawyers appointed to assist Abdullah in his self-defense didn't respond to an email seeking comment Monday. Federal prosecutors, who rested their case Thursday, said Abdullah plotted the attack for four years, undergoing extensive training in explosives and how to operate in secret and avoid detection. He then moved to the Philippines in 2017 where he began training as a commercial pilot. Abdullah was almost finished with his two-year pilot training when he was arrested in 2019 on local charges. He was transferred the following year to U.S. law enforcement authorities, who charged him with terrorism related crimes. Prosecutors said Abdullah also researched how to breach a cockpit door and information 'about the tallest building in a major U.S. city' before he was caught. The State Department in 2008 designated al-Shabab, which means 'the youth' in Arabic, as a foreign terrorist organization. The militant group is an al-Qaida affiliate that has fought to establish an Islamic state in Somalia based on Shariah law.	https://apnews.com/article/alshabab-9-11-plot-cc02311a9658695f172054a380e59963	2024-11-04T15:54:11-08:00	
Russian rocket launches Iranian satellites into orbit as Moscow and Tehran expand ties	MOSCOW (AP) — A Russian rocket on Tuesday blasted off successfully to carry a pair of Iranian satellites into orbit, a launch that reflected growing cooperation between Moscow and Tehran. The Soyuz rocket lifted off as scheduled from Vostochny launchpad in far eastern Russia and put its payload into a designated orbit nine minutes after the launch. It was carrying two Russian Ionosphere-M Earth observation satellites and several dozen smaller satellites, including the two Iranian ones. Iran’s two satellites, named Kowsar and Hodhod, were the first launched on behalf of the country’s private sector. In 2022, a Russian rocket launched an Iranian Earth observation satellite called Khayyam that was built in Russia on Tehran’s order, and in February Russia put another Iranian satellite named Pars-1 into orbit. Tuesday's launch comes as Russia and Iran have expanded ties in various spheres. Ukraine and the West have accused Tehran of providing Moscow with hundreds of exploding drones for use on the battlefield in Ukraine and helped launch their production in Russia. The Iranian drone deliveries, which Moscow and Tehran have denied, have allowed for a constant barrage of long-range drone strikes at Ukraine’s infrastructure. Moscow and Tehran are planning to further bolster their ties with a 'comprehensive strategic partnership' that is set to be signed during Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian’s planned visit to Russia. The date for that visit hasn’t been set yet, but the Kremlin said it could happen soon. Tuesday’s successful launch of the Iranian satellites atop a Russian rocket follows a series of failed launches suffered by Iran’s civilian space program in recent years. There have been five failed launches in a row for the Simorgh program, a satellite-carrying rocket. A fire at the Imam Khomeini Spaceport in February 2019 killed three researchers, authorities said at the time. A launchpad rocket explosion later that year drew the attention of then-President Donald Trump, who taunted Iran with a tweet showing what appeared to be a U.S. surveillance photo of the site. At the same time, a separate Iranian space program run by the country’s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard has seen successful launches from a military base outside of Shahroud, some 350 kilometers (215 miles) east of the capital, Tehran. However, satellite images analyzed by The Associated Press show Israel likely bombed the site during its Oct. 26 retaliatory strike on Iran. The U.S. intelligence community’s worldwide threat assessment this year said Iran’s development of satellite launch vehicles 'would shorten the timeline' for Iran to develop an intercontinental ballistic missile because it uses similar technology. Intercontinental ballistic missiles can be used to deliver nuclear weapons. Iran is now producing uranium close to weapons-grade levels after the collapse of its nuclear deal with world powers. Tehran has enough enriched uranium for 'several' nuclear weapons, if it chooses to produce them, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency has warned. Iran has always denied seeking nuclear weapons and says its space program, like its nuclear activities, is for purely civilian purposes.

Belarus' authoritarian ruler will face only token challengers in presidential vote	TALLINN, Estonia (AP) — Belarus' election commission on Monday allowed seven politicians loyal to President Alexander Lukashenko to start collecting signatures to run against him in January's election, in an apparent bid to create a semblance of competition to the longtime authoritarian ruler. Lukashenko, who has ruled the country for more than 30 years, is seeking a seventh term following a relentless crackdown on the opposition and free media. The election, scheduled for Jan. 26, would come 4 1/2 years after the 2020 presidential vote that was rejected by the opposition and the West as rigged with fraud and triggered massive nationwide protests. Belarusian authorities responded to the demonstrations with a sweeping crackdown on dissent, resulting in about 65,000 people arrested. Major opposition figures were either imprisoned or fled the country in the crackdown. Human rights activists say Belarus now holds about 1,300 political prisoners and that many of them are denied adequate medical care and contact with their families. Lukashenko has relied on subsidies and political support from his main ally, Russia, to survive the protests. He allowed Moscow to use Belarusian territory to send troops into Ukraine in February 2022. Last week, Belarus' Central Election Commission registered an initiative group for Lukashenko to prepare for the race. On Monday, it also permitted seven politicians to begin collecting signatures to be able to run, including Sergei Syrankov of the Communist Party, Oleg Gaidukevich, the leader of the Liberal Democratic Party, and former Interior Ministry spokeswoman Olga Chеmоdanova. 'Those are alternative candidates, and I believe they just want to safeguard the incumbent,' Lukashenko said of his aspiring token challengers. Each of the candidates is required to collect at least 100,000 signatures until Dec. 6 to enter the race. Last week, the commission refused to register initiative groups for two opposition politicians who aspired to enter the race. 'There are candidates, but no competition in this election,' said Valery Karbalevich, an independent political analyst. 'Lukashenko fears a replay of the 2020 protests, his trauma is still fresh and so he will carry out the vote in a format when the result is predetermined.' Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, who is in exile after challenging Lukashenko in the 2020 presidential election, denounced January's vote as a farce and urged Belarusians to vote against all candidates. 'We are offering people to voice their protest by voting against all those who are robbing us of our right to vote,' said Tsikhanouskaya, whose husband Siarhei Tsikhanouski is serving a 19 1/2-year prison sentence after trying to run against Lukashenko. 'This is not an election but an imitation of an electoral process held amid terror when alternative candidates and observers aren't allowed.' During February's parliamentary and local elections, in which only candidates loyal to Lukashenko were allowed to compete, Belarus for the first time also refused to invite observers from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to monitor the vote.	https://apnews.com/article/belarus-election-lukashenko-crackdown-29a9853ffa5d542cdcca389097364c1b	2024-11-04T13:56:26-08:00	
North Korea fired a ballistic missile toward its eastern sea, South Korea's military says	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korea on Tuesday fired at least one ballistic missile toward its eastern sea, according to the South Korean military, as the country continued its weapons demonstrations hours before the U.S. presidential elections. South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff on Tuesday didn’t immediately say what type of missile it was or how far it flew. Japan’s Defense Ministry said the missile was believed to have already landed at sea. The launch came days after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un supervised a flight test of the country’s newest intercontinental ballistic missile designed to reach the U.S. mainland. In response to that launch, the United States flew a long-range B-1B bomber in a trilateral drill with South Korea and Japan on Sunday in a show of force. That drew condemnation from Kim’s powerful sister, who on Tuesday accused the North’s rivals of raising tensions with 'aggressive and adventuristic military threats.' North Korean state media claimed last week that the Hwasong-19 it tested on Oct. 31 was 'the world’s strongest' ICBM, but experts say the solid-fuel missile was too big to be useful in a war situation. Experts say the North has yet to acquire some critical technologies to build a functioning ICBM, such as ensuring that the warhead survives the harsh conditions of atmospheric re-entry. The latest launches came after South Korean officials said the North was likely to dial up its military displays around the U.S. presidential elections to command the attention of Washington. South Korea’s military intelligence agency said last week that North Korea has also likely completed preparations for its seventh nuclear test. Tensions between the Koreas are at their highest point in years as Kim has repeatedly flaunted his expanding nuclear weapons and missile programs, while reportedly providing Russia with munitions and troops to support President Vladimir Putin’s war in Ukraine. After a meeting in Seoul on Monday, South Korean Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul and EU’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, expressed 'deep concern' over the possibility that Russian transfers any nuclear or ballistic missile-related technology to the North in exchange for its arms and military personnel. Such transfers would ' jeopardize the international non-proliferation efforts and threaten peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula and across the globe,' they said, while calling on North Korea and Russia to immediately withdraw the troops from Russia. In response to North Korea’s growing nuclear threats, South Korea, the United States and Japan have been expanding their combined military exercises and updating their nuclear deterrence plans built around U.S. strategic assets. __ Associated Press writer Mari Yamaguchi in Tokyo contributed.	https://apnews.com/article/north-korea-missile-launch-sea-us-elections-3c00eaae880d1cdeb79f7c9aa0aded9d	2024-11-04T13:50:34-08:00	
US gives Israel a 'fail' grade on improving aid to Gaza so far	WASHINGTON (AP) — The Biden administration is stepping up criticism of Israel for not doing enough to improve humanitarian conditions in Gaza as a 30-day deadline looms for Israeli officials to meet certain requirements or risk potential restrictions on military assistance. State Department spokesman Matthew Miller on Monday gave Israel a 'fail' grade in terms of meeting the conditions for an improvement in aid deliveries to Gaza laid out in a letter last month to senior Israeli officials from Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin. He said there were still roughly nine days until the deadline expires, but that limited progress so far has been insufficient. 'As of today, the situation has not significantly turned around,' Miller told reporters. 'We have seen an increase in some measurements. But if you look at the stipulated recommendations in the letter — those have not been met.' A day before the U.S. election, the Biden administration called out its close ally, with support for Israel a key issue for many voters and the humanitarian crisis for Palestinians also a factor for many in the race. Former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris have been competing for Muslim and Arab American voters and Jewish voters in battleground states like Michigan and Pennsylvania. Among other conditions, Austin and Blinken's letter from mid-October said that Israel must allow in a minimum of 350 trucks a day carrying desperately needed food and other supplies for Palestinians besieged by more than a year of war between Israel and Hamas. By the end of October, an average of just 71 trucks a day were entering Gaza, according to the latest U.N. figures. 'The results are not good enough today,' Miller said. 'They certainly do not have a pass. … They have failed to implement all the things that that we recommended. Now, that said, we are not at the end of the 30-day period.' He would not say when asked what the U.S. would do when the deadline comes up next week, just that 'we will follow the law.' Blinken spoke Monday with Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, urging additional steps to 'substantially increase and sustain humanitarian aid' to civilians in Gaza, according to a State Department readout of their call. Similarly, Austin has been reinforcing 'how important it is to ensure that humanitarian assistance can flow and flow faster into Gaza' in calls with Gallant, said Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder, Pentagon press secretary. The Israeli military body in charge of humanitarian aid to Gaza, known as COGAT, said it had evacuated 72 patients from hospitals in northern Gaza to other medical facilities Monday and had brought medical supplies as well as fuel, food, water and units of blood. The head of UNICEF, the U.N. agency for children, said over the weekend that 'the entire Palestinian population in North Gaza, especially children, is at imminent risk of dying from disease, famine, and the ongoing bombardments.' Miller also said the U.S. is looking into a decision by the Israeli government to end an agreement facilitating the work of the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, known as UNRWA, which is the main aid provider in Gaza. It followed the passage of Israeli laws last week to sever ties with UNRWA, a move that Blinken and Austin opposed in their letter. The Israeli Foreign Ministry said in a statement Monday that it has notified the U.N. of the cancellation of an agreement dating back to 1967 that facilitates UNRWA’s work. It said UNRWA 'is part of the problem in the Gaza Strip and not part of the solution.' Israel alleges that UNRWA has been infiltrated by Hamas, which the agency denies and says it takes measures to ensure its neutrality. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres reiterated that UNRWA is essential and there is no alternative to its work in the Palestinian territories, spokesman Stephane Dujarric said. At the same time, Miller said the U.S. is 'deeply concerned' by a recent escalation in attacks by Israeli settlers on Palestinians in the West Bank, including several cars being torched overnight just a few kilometers (miles) away from the Palestinian Authority’s headquarters and attacks on Palestinians harvesting olives, their livestock and other property. 'These violent actions cause intense human suffering for Palestinians and they threaten Israel’s security,' Miller said. 'It is critical that the government of Israel deter extremist settler violence and take measures to protect all communities from harm in accordance with its international obligations.' He noted that the U.S. has since the beginning of the year imposed sanctions against Israeli groups and people implicated in violence against Palestinian civilians and warned of more to come. ___ AP reporters Ellen Knickmeyer and Lolita C.

Spain's king stood his ground under a mud barrage. What will the iconic moment mean for his reign?	BARCELONA, Spain (AP) — Mud splattered the cheek of Spain's monarch as survivors of catastrophic floods unleashed their fury in a barrage of muck and mire. Felipe VI took it, literally, on the chin, and his determination to stay and speak to the enraged crowd could redefine his reign. It instantly became an iconic moment. But what it will mean remains to be seen. Spain’s royals, prime minister and the Valencian regional president were greeted by a crowd hurling mud and other debris on Sunday when they tried to visit Paiporta, where over 60 people perished in last week's floods. The deluge has killed over 200 people in Spain and shattered communities. It was the officials' first visit to the devastated area. Sticky brown globs hit Felipe on the face and all over his black jacket, while Queen Letizia's hands were streaked with the mud that, nearly a week after the floods, still coats street after street of the southern outskirts of Valencia city. Many in the crowd wielded the shovels they are using to dig out their homes. The anger appeared directed not at the king specifically but at the entire state for its management of the worst natural disaster in Spain's living memory. The government is also saying there were far-right agitators among the locals, implying they wanted to go after the Socialist prime minister. In any case, for Montserrat Nebrera, professor of constitutional law at the International University of Catalonia, the shocking sight of a muddied monarch could set a precedent for more fervent protests, since 'never had such anger been shown to the king.' Monarchists like Nebrera and even republicans agreed that Felipe, who holds a largely ceremonial position, cut the figure of a man of state. The king insisted that his bodyguards, who tried to cover him with umbrellas, let him get close to talk with residents, some of whom screamed 'Get out!' and 'Killers!' Letizia has likewise been praised for staying put and speaking with distraught people. A monarch seen as aloof extends himself 'It could go down as the greatest day of Felipe’s reign,' Oriol Bartomeus, a political science professor at the Autonomous University of Barcelona, told The Associated Press. 'If he had sought protection from his bodyguards and run away, now that would have been the darkest day of his reign. Instead he showed why he is king, demonstrating composure and serenity, and by getting as close as he could to the people.' There is no doubt it was the most memorable moment of his reign. The 56-year-old Felipe took over a Royal House whose reputation was in tatters after the financial and lifestyle scandals of his father, Juan Carlos, who abdicated in 2014. Earlier in his reign, Juan Carlos was loved or at least grudgingly respected after helping Spain’s restoration of democracy after the death of dictator Francisco Franco. He was seen as down to earth and fun-loving compared to other European royals. His son, by contrast, has been perceived as aloof, and has relied on Letizia, a former journalist, to help him run a relatively frugal palace in a nation where republican sentiment is strong. Felipe heard some jeers when he took part in a tribute to the dead of the 2017 terror attack in Barcelona, but that was nothing compared to Sunday’s reception. The prime minister and others were struck On Sunday, Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez was whisked away by his security detail after he also was pelted. Interior Minister Fernando Grande-Marlaska said 'there was a clear danger and (Sánchez) had received a blow.' The back window of the prime minister’s car was broken. The minister did not specify what hit the prime minister. One of Letizia’s bodyguards had a bloody forehead. An investigative judge has opened a preliminary probe into possible assault. Felipe stood his ground for over half an hour. It was impossible to hear what was said, but he spoke to several shouting people in an intimate and apparently serious tone. Bartomeus, who said he is not a fervent defender of the monarchy, noted what the king didn’t do: He didn’t appear to patronize the people. 'He didn’t console the people, like for example you see the British royals do,' Bartomeus said. Instead, 'he dialogued with them. He put the state on his back, got down off the pedestal and went down to the people who were telling him that the state had not arrived, and he told them that it will.' Did Felipe's involvement promise more than he can deliver? Later Sunday, Felipe attended a gathering of the heads of the emergency response in Valencia, along with Sánchez and other politicians. He asked them to give 'hope to those affected by the flood and attend to their needs, guaranteeing that the state is there for them.' On Monday, he presided over the government's crisis committee at a military airbase outside Madrid. But that, Nebrera said, could compound his problems. In going to Paiporta with elected officials, Nebrera said, Felipe has created the impression that he has a real role to play in managing the gargantuan recovery effort, when his powers are mostly representing Spain on state visits and playing an institutional role in the post-election process. In other words, it looks like he owns it. 'If there already existed a certain confusion among some people as to what powers the king has, now he runs the danger of people thinking he is responsible for something which he is not,' she said. 'It is very likely that regardless of how many meetings he presides over, there will be nothing but more bad news coming from Valencia. They are only going to find more and more of the dead.'	https://apnews.com/article/spain-floods-royals-mud-felipe-letizia-903a0f29591049ff54e9778e916882b8	2024-11-04T10:40:51-08:00	
Serbian minister to resign over concrete canopy crash that killed 14 people	BELGRADE, Serbia (AP) — Serbia's construction minister said Monday he was stepping down days after a concrete canopy collapsed at a railway station, killing 14 people and severely injuring three. Minister Goran Vesic announced his resignation at a hastily called press conference as anger mounted in the Balkan country over the fatal collapse that happened just before noon on Friday in the northern city of Novi Sad. Vesic's resignation needs to be confirmed in Serbia's parliament. 'I would like to inform you that I will formally submit my resignation tomorrow morning,' said Vesic. 'Once the parliament accepts it, I will no longer perform this duty.' Surveillance camera footage showed the massive canopy on the outer wall of the station building crashing down on the people sitting below on benches or going in and out. The train station has been renovated twice in recent years. Critics of Serbia’s populist government attributed the disaster to rampant corruption, a lack of transparency and sloppy work during the reconstruction. The renovation was part of a wider deal with Chinese construction companies. Opposition parties have demanded the resignation of top officials, including President Aleksandar Vucic and Prime Minister Milos Vucevic, accusing them of being responsible for the deadly accident. The opposition says Vesic is just a scapegoat for the real culprits behind the tragedy. Opposition groups plan to hold a rally on Tuesday in Novi Sad and more protests later if their demands are not met. Vesic said that he does not accept any guilt for the deaths of the victims. 'I cannot accept guilt for the death of 14 people because neither I, nor the people who work with me, bear even a shred of responsibility for the tragedy that happened,'' he said. 'I urge the authorities to determine as soon as possible who was responsible for this tragedy.' On Sunday, angry protesters in the capital, Belgrade, left red handprints on government buildings, telling officials, ''You have blood on your hands.' The dead included a 6-year-old girl. The three injured, who are between 18 and 24 years old, all had to have limbs amputated. They were still in serious condition on Monday without improvement, doctors said. Populist officials have accused opposition parties of using the tragedy for political gains while pledging accountability. President Vucic on Monday promised those responsible will be punished. 'I am certain that the state authorities will determine criminal responsibility for the tragedy that happened in our country,' said Vucic. Serbian prosecutors said they have already questioned more than 40 people — including Vesic — since opening the probe on Saturday. But critics believe that justice is unlikely to be served with the populists in firm control of the judicial system and the police. Officials have insisted that the canopy had not been part of the renovation work, suggesting this was the reason why it collapsed but giving no explanation for why it was not renovated. The Novi Sad railway station was originally built in 1964, while the renovated station was inaugurated by Vucic and his populist ally, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, over two years ago as a major stopover for a planned fast train line between Belgrade and Budapest.	https://apnews.com/article/serbia-roof-collapse-resignation-minister-vesic-novisad-3ce61658fec23c8606954b9d3483ae22	2024-11-04T09:18:42-08:00	
The death toll in Lebanon crosses 3,000 in the 13-month Israel-Hezbollah war, Health Ministry says	BEIRUT (AP) — The 13-month war between Israel and Hezbollah has killed more than 3,000 people in Lebanon, the country’s Health Ministry said on Monday, more than double the number of people killed since their last major war two decades ago. The war shows no signs of ending, and Israel has said it is carrying out new operations targeting Hezbollah infrastructure across Lebanon and in parts of Syria while Hezbollah continues to launch dozens of rockets into northern Israel. Hezbollah began firing rockets into northern Israel the day after Hamas’ surprise attack into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023 ignited the war in Gaza. Hezbollah and Hamas are both allied with Iran. For nearly a year, the conflict was mostly contained to the areas along the border between Israel and Lebanon. The conflict dramatically escalated on Sept. 23 with intense Israeli airstrikes on south and east Lebanon as well as Beirut’s southern suburbs, leaving hundreds dead and leading to the displacement of nearly 1.2 million people. Israel began a ground invasion of south Lebanon on Oct. 1, causing wide destruction in border villages but making little advances on the ground inside Lebanon. Israel says it is destroying Hezbollah weapons and command centers near the border, including an extensive tunnel system built by Hezbollah. The Lebanese Health Ministry said 16 people were killed and 90 injured in attacks on Sunday, bringing the death toll to 3,002. At least 13,492 have been injured. The ministry does not differentiate between civilians and Hezbollah fighters in its toll. Israel claimed hundreds of Hezbollah fighters have been killed. In Israel, 72 people have been killed by Hezbollah attacks, including 30 soldiers, according to the prime minister's office. More than 60,000 people have been displaced from their homes. Also on Monday, Israel announced it terminated the agreement facilitating the work of the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, the main aid provider in Gaza. It was the first step in implementing legislation passed last week that would sever ties with the agency, which Israel says has been infiltrated by Hamas, and prevent it from operating in Israel. The agency, known as UNRWA, denies the allegations and says it takes measures to ensure its neutrality. The Israeli Foreign Ministry said in a statement Monday that it has notified the U.N. of the cancellation of an agreement dating back to 1967 that facilitates UNRWA’s work. It said UNRWA 'is part of the problem in the Gaza Strip and not part of the solution.' Israel controls all entry into Gaza, and aid groups groups have warned that the legislation could severely hamper UNRWA’s work, creating further obstacles to addressing a severe humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Israel says that UNRWA is responsible for only 13% of aid entering Gaza and it says other U.N. agencies and aid groups can fill the gap. But aid organizations say UNRWA is essential, and the agency says the Israeli figures do not account for the key role it plays in coordinating aid deliveries. 'Without UNRWA coordination, without UNRWA logistics platforms ... no U.N. agency could operate at the scale required,' said Jonathan Fowler, a spokesman for the agency. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said the US was clear about their opposition to the legislation, and gravely concerned about the insufficient number of aid trucks entering Gaza. 'We have serious concerns about the implications of it being fully implemented, as well as our concerns about the underlying humanitarian situation in, Gaza, even before Israel passed the legislation,' he told reporters in Washington on Monday. The agency provides education, health and other basic services to Palestinian refugees from the 1948 war surrounding Israel’s creation and their descendants, who now number nearly six million across the region. Refugee families make up the majority of Gaza’s population. The remainder of the legislation is set to go into effect in three months. — Lidman reported from Jerusalem.
