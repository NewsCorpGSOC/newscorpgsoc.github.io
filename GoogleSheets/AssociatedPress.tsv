Liam Payne and his bandmates all sought solo success after One Direction fame	LONDON (AP) — One Direction was one of the last boy bands from the age of mass-audience linear television and one of the first of the social media era. That helped propel them to a level of fame comparable to Beatlemania, but with the constant scrutiny of a world of smartphones and streaming. The band members, still in their teens, had to cope with the fame, then navigate the aftermath of its split while trying to build solo careers — challenges that have received renewed attention in the wake of band member Liam Payne's death on Wednesday. One Direction was put together by music mogul Simon Cowell after the teens auditioned separately for TV talent show 'The X-Factor' in 2010. They didn’t win, instead coming third in a final watched by 17 million people in the U.K., a quarter of the population. But they were signed by Cowell and had the first of several No. 1 hits with the now-pop classic 'What Makes You Beautiful' in 2012. British radio host Kevin Hughes called them 'one of the biggest selling U.K. bands since The Beatles, a huge global export and one of the biggest selling pop acts of the 21st century.' One Direction’s appeal rested partly on the members’ cheerful, cheeky ordinariness. The late filmmaker Morgan Spurlock said when he directed a documentary about One Direction in 2013 that 'part of the reason they’ve been so incredibly successful with their fans is that they are so incredibly grounded and normal.' After five studio albums and 70 million records sold, One Direction announced an indefinite hiatus in 2016. All the members embarked on solo careers, with varying degrees of success. LIAM PAYNE Payne, who died at 31 after falling from a hotel balcony in Argentina, became one of the main songwriters on One Direction’s albums. His first solo single, 'Strip that Down,' a power pop track featuring rapper Quavo, was a Top 10 hit in Britain in 2017. 'For You,' performed with Rita Ora, was a U.K. hit in 2018. Payne’s debut solo album, 'LP1,' was released in 2019, but didn’t make the U.S. Top 100. Payne had a son, now 7, with the former 'Girls Aloud' singer Cheryl — an 'X Factor' judge during One Direction's season. He was open about struggling with his mental health amid the pressures of fame. He spent time in rehab for alcoholism and in hospital with what he said were kidney problems. After a period of silence, Payne returned with a new single, 'Teardrops,' in March, saying in a statement that it 'marks the start of a new beginning.' The song failed to chart and a second album was reportedly put on hold before his death. ZAYN MALIK Malik precipitated One Direction’s demise when he left the group in 2015, saying he wanted 'to be a normal 22-year-old' for a while. His first solo single, 'Pillowtalk,' was released early in 2016 and topped the charts in both the U.S. and Britain. A duet with Taylor Swift, 'I Don’t Wanna Live Forever,' was a hit late the same year. Malik has released the solo albums 'Mind of Mine' in 2016, 'Icarus Falls' in 2018, 'Nobody is Listening' in 2021 and 'Room Under the Stairs' this year. The most recent adds a country sound to the R&amp;B-pop on which he’s built his career. Malik, who has spoken of struggles with anxiety and anorexia, has a daughter, born in 2020, with his on-off partner, model Gigi Hadid. In 2021, he was sentenced to 90 days’ probation after pleading no contest to harassing Hadid and her mother during an argument at the family home in Pennsylvania. NIALL HORAN The affable Irish member of One Direction released his first single, 'This Town,' in 2016, and debut album 'Flicker' the following year. Showcasing Horan’s talent for tuneful pop, it topped Billboard’s album chart. A second album, 'Heartbreak Weather,' came out in 2020 and a third, 'The Show,' was released in 2023, accompanied by a world tour this year — including a concert in Buenos Aires earlier this month attended by Payne. Horan has also served as a coach on TV talent series 'The Voice' in the U.S. LOUIS TOMLINSON Tomlinson made his solo debut with the single 'Just Hold On' in 2016. Several more singles followed before his debut album, 'Walls,' was released in 2020. It was a Top 10 hit in the U.S. and the U.K., as was his second album, 'Faith in the Future,' released in late 2022. Tomlinson released a live album, 'Live,' in 2024. In 2018, he appeared as a judge on 'The X Factor,' the show that made him famous. Tomlinson's other great love is soccer. He briefly played for his home town team, Doncaster Rovers, and he has been involved with the Soccer Aid charity fundraiser for UNICEF. He has a child with ex-girlfriend Briana Jungwirth. HARRY STYLES Musician, actor and style icon, Harry Styles is easily the biggest solo star spawned by One Direction. He released his first single, 'Sign of the Times,' later than the others, in 2017, but soon made up for lost time. His debut album, 'Harry Styles,' topped the album charts in the U.S., Britain and several other countries, while the second, 'Fine Line,' appeared in 2019 and included the Grammy-winning 'Watermelon Sugar.' His third album, 2022's 'Harry’s House,' topped British and U.S. charts, won album of the year at the Grammys and the Brit Awards, and was nominated for the cred-heavy Mercury Prize. The single 'As it Was' became his biggest hit yet, topping the Billboard Hot 100 for 15 weeks. Styles’ profile has been raised by a playful, adventurous fashion sense that includes a fondness for 1970s-inspired three-piece suits and bellbottomed jumpsuits. As an actor, Styles appeared as a World War II soldier in Christopher Nolan’s 'Dunkirk' before starring alongside Florence Pugh in Olivia Wilde’s dystopian thriller 'Don’t Worry Darling.' It premiered at the 2022 Venice Film Festival, where Styles’ red-carpet appearance drew throng of fans and the approving appraisal of fashionistas. He also starred in period romance 'My Policeman,' which premiered at the 2022 Toronto International Film Festival.	https://apnews.com/article/one-direction-members-solo-careers-liam-payne-188f5c6a452cad49abdbe492fae39b64	2024-10-17T06:38:44-07:00	
US imposes sanctions on Chinese companies accused of helping make Russian attack drones	WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. Treasury on Thursday announced sanctions against two Chinese makers of drone engines and parts that the Biden administration said directly helped Russia build long-range attack drones used in the war in Ukraine. The U.S. has previously accused China of providing material support to Russia's military-industrial base to sustain the Kremlin's war against Ukraine, and the latest round of sanctions sought to target the 'direct activity' between Beijing and Moscow, according to senior Biden administration officials, who discussed the sanctions on the condition of anonymity before the measures were announced. Russia’s Garpiya series long-range attack drone, 'designed and produced in the People’s Republic of China in collaboration with Russian defense firms, has been used to destroy critical infrastructure and has resulted in mass casualties' during the war in Ukraine, State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said in a statement. Beijing has insisted that it does not provide weapons to either Ukraine or Russia, and it has defended its trade with Russia as normal and above the board. The U.S. is imposing sanctions on Xiamen Limbach Aircraft Engine Company, which produces drone engines, and Redlepus Vector Industry, which has worked with a Russian entity already facing sanctions to facilitate the shipment of the drones to Russia. The administration officials said China should have known that the Russian entity, TSK Vektor, was a 'problematic actor.' They indicated that the two Chinese firms had been developing long-range attack drones with the Russians since the beginning of the year. The administration also announced sanctions against Artem Mikhailovich Yamshchikov, a Russian national described as the beneficial owner of TSK Vektor, and the Russian entity TD Vector, which has been involved in facilitating the shipments, the officials say.	https://apnews.com/article/china-russia-sanctions-united-states-ukraine-drones-49e4e56bb37ee46faf028f649df140b0	2024-10-17T06:09:34-07:00	
India denies Canadian allegation that it uses mobsters to target Sikh separatists in Canada	NEW DELHI (AP) — India's government on Thursday denied it was working with mobsters to target Sikh separatists in Canada as alleged publicly this week by Canadian officials in an escalating diplomatic dispute. India’s External Affairs Ministry spokesman Randhir Jaiswal denied that India was in cahoots with India-based mobsters in Canada and even suggested that Canadian authorities had been resisting India's attempts to extradite those people to India. 'It is strange that people who we asked to be deported' are being blamed by the Canadians for 'committing crimes in Canada,' Jaiswal said. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and police officials went public this week with allegations that Indian diplomats were targeting Sikh separatists in Canada by sharing information about them with their government back home. They said top Indian officials were then passing that information along to Indian organized crime groups who were targeting the activists, who are Canadian citizens, with drive-by shootings, extortions and even murder. The two sides ordered the expulsion of top diplomats this week in the deepening crisis over the accusations, including Canada’s allegation that t he diplomats were linked to the June 2023 killing of Sikh activist Hardeep Singh Nijjar. The Nijjar killing has soured ties for more than a year, and despite Canada's assertion that it has forwarded evidence of its allegations to Indian authorities, the Indian government continues to deny it has seen any. Jaiswal said again on Thursday that Canada has provided no evidence of its allegations surrounding attacks on Sikh activists, contradicting Trudeau's statements this week that his country’s investigators have privately shared information with Indian counterparts and found them to be uncooperative. At the same time, Jaiswal accused Canada of failing to take action against Sikhs living in Canada who face terrorism charges in India and who are accused of being part of a Sikh secessionist campaign in India’s northern Punjab state. Jaiswal said India’s 26 extradition requests have been pending in Canada for a decade or more. He also said that several criminals had provisional arrest requests pending with Canadian authorities. 'Some of them are charged with terror and terror-related crimes (in India). So far, no action has been taken by the Canadian side on our requests. This is very serious,' Jaiswal said. India has repeatedly criticized the Canadian government for being soft on supporters of what is known as the Khalistan movement, which is banned in India but has support among the Sikh diaspora, particularly in Canada. The Royal Canadian Police said Monday it had identified India’s top diplomat in the country and five other diplomats as persons of interest in the Nijjar killing. The RCMP also said they uncovered evidence of an intensifying campaign against Canadians by agents of the Indian government. Nijjar, 45, was fatally shot last year in his pickup truck after he left the Sikh temple he led in Surrey, British Columbia. An Indian-born citizen of Canada, he owned a plumbing business and was a leader in what remains of a once-strong movement to create an independent Sikh homeland. Four Indian nationals living in Canada were charged with Nijjar’s murder and are awaiting trial.	https://apnews.com/article/india-canada-killing-diplomatic-row-6008c252542cb52af0e19fe41a70d55f	2024-10-17T06:04:55-07:00	
Africa's mpox deaths surpass 1,000 as health officials urge international support	KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) — The number of mpox -related deaths in Africa has surpassed 1,000, the head of the continent’s top public health agency said Thursday, warning of the continuing threat of cross-border contamination and a lack of rapid test kits. There were 50 mpox-related deaths in the past week, bringing the total to 1,100, indicating that authorities face a challenge in stemming outbreaks currently affecting 18 of the continent's 55 nations, said Jean Kaseya, director general of the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 'We are still fighting with this outbreak,' Kaseya said. 'We don’t want to see all African countries affected.' Mpox belongs to the same family of viruses as smallpox but causes milder symptoms, including fever, chills and body aches. People with more serious cases can develop lesions on the face, hands, chest and genitals. Kaseya said the trend shows mpox in Africa 'is going out of control if we don’t act,' and urged international partners to honor their pledges to support Africa’s response. 'This is my clear message to our partners. We acknowledge their pledge, but we need quickly to translate pledge into concrete money to support the response,' he said. The estimated budget for a six-month plan put forward by Africa CDC and the World Health Organization is almost $600 million, with 55% allocated to the response to mpox in 14 affected nations and boosting readiness in 15 others. Zambia and Zimbabwe became the latest African countries to confirm mpox cases in the past week, Kenya recorded its first death from mpox, and a case was confirmed in a prison in central Uganda, according to Africa CDC. The case in Zambia was detected in a truck driver. Mpox, also known as monkeypox, had been spreading mostly undetected for years in Africa before a 2022 global outbreak in which wealthy countries quickly responded with vaccines from their stockpiles, while Africa received fewer doses despite pleas from its governments. WHO declared Africa’s outbreaks a global health emergency in August, with Congo as the epicenter. The total number of suspected cases in Africa since the beginning of the year now stands at 42,438, with 8,113 confirmed as mpox, according to Africa CDC. Mpox vaccinations have begun in Rwanda and Congo.	https://apnews.com/article/africa-mpox-deaths-international-help-6830e9c4000b2518ee12efb24cd6b07a	2024-10-17T06:04:00-07:00	
Who is Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar?	Israel says it is looking into the possibility that Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, a mastermind of the Oct. 7, 2023, attack that triggered the war in Gaza, has been killed in a military operation. His death, which has not yet been confirmed, would be a significant moment in Israel's yearlong offensive against the militant group and could complicate efforts to release dozens of hostages held in Gaza. Sinwar became the head of Hamas after the killing of the previous leader, Ismail Haniyeh, in an explosion in Iran in July that was widely blamed on Israel. Some things to know about Sinwar: From refugee camp to Hamas militant Sinwar was born in 1962 in a refugee camp in the Gaza town of Khan Younis. He was an early member of Hamas, which was formed in 1987. He eventually led the group's security arm, which worked to purge it of informants for Israel. Israel arrested him in the late 1980s and he admitted to killing 12 suspected collaborators, a role that earned him the nickname 'The Butcher of Khan Younis.' He was sentenced to four life terms for offenses that included the killing of two Israeli soldiers. A prison leader Sinwar organized strikes in prison to improve working conditions. He also studied Hebrew and Israeli society. He survived brain cancer in 2008 after being treated by Israeli doctors. Sinwar was among more than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners released in 2011 by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as part of an exchange for an Israeli soldier captured by Hamas in a cross-border raid. Rise to Gaza power When Sinwar returned to Gaza, he quickly rose through Hamas' leadership ranks with a reputation for ruthlessness. He is widely believed to be behind the 2016 killing of another top Hamas commander, Mahmoud Ishtewi, in an internal power struggle. Sinwar became head of Hamas in Gaza, effectively putting him in control of the territory, and worked with Haniyeh to align the group with Iran and its proxies around the region while also building the group's military capabilities. The October attack on Israel Sinwar, along with Mohammed Deif, the head of Hamas' armed wing, is believed to have engineered the surprise Oct. 7 attack on Israel. The attack killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and sparked a war that has killed over 42,000 Palestinians in Gaza, according to health authorities there. Hamas said it launched the attack in retaliation for Israel's treatment of Palestinians and to push the Palestinian cause back onto the world agenda. The International Criminal Court’s prosecutor sought arrest warrants in May for Sinwar, Deif and Haniyeh for their alleged roles in the attack. Israel said it killed Deif in a strike in July, while Hamas says he is still alive. Where would this leave Hamas? Sinwar has been in hiding since the attack, and cease-fire negotiators have said it can take several days to send and receive messages from him. Even before becoming Hamas' top leader, Sinwar was believed to have the final word on any deal to release hostages held by the militant group. Some 100 hostages remain in Gaza, around a third of whom are believed to be dead. It's unclear who would replace Sinwar, and what that might mean for the cease-fire efforts, which sputtered to a halt in August after months of negotiations brokered by the United States, Egypt and Qatar. Hamas has hundreds of thousands of supporters in Gaza, the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Palestinian refugee camps across the region. Several of its top leaders are based in Qatar, which has served as a mediator between Israel and the militant group. Israel has arrested and killed several top Hamas leaders and militant commanders over the years, and the militant group has quickly replaced them. But it has never fought a prolonged war against Israel, which says it has killed dozens of high-ranking militants and over 17,000 fighters, though it has not provided evidence for the latter figure. ___ This story has been updated to correct that not all of the approximately 1,200 people killed in the Oct. 7 attack were Israeli. ___ Find more of AP’s war coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-sinwar-leader-2963dbc6e8ef040a00e588488cba33e7	2024-10-17T05:30:40-07:00	
Ukraine's former armed forces chief endorses 'victory plan' in first speech since his dismissal	LONDON (AP) — Ukraine's former commander-in-chief, Valerii Zaluzhnyi, on Thursday expressed his support for President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s 'victory plan,' despite the tensions between the two that led to his dismissal. 'Ukraine must clearly follow the plan,' Zaluzhnyi said in his first public appearance since his appointment as ambassador to the U.K. He told an audience at London’s Chatham House think-tank: 'But this list of steps primarily concerns those countries that should ultimately be interested in stopping the war.' The plan lays out Ukraine’s view on how to strengthen its positions before any potential negotiations with Russia to end the conflict. After briefing U.S. and other Western officials, Zelenskyy presented the key points publicly during a speech to the Ukrainian parliament on Wednesday. The plan includes a formal invitation for Ukraine to join NATO and permission to use Western-supplied longer-range missiles to strike military targets deep inside Russian territory — steps that have been met with reluctance by Kyiv’s allies so far. Zaluzhnyi asserted that NATO membership is the only viable security guarantee for his country, fully backing President Zelensky’s call for the alliance to extend an invitation to Kyiv. But the prospect of Ukraine joining NATO has left the alliance in a bind, with some members concerned it could escalate the conflict and risk direct confrontation with Russia. 'Declaring yet another freeze in the situation with Ukraine will not work,' said Ukraine’s former commander-in-chief. 'We want to have guarantees of security for ourselves and our children,' he said. Zaluzhnyi, who was in charge of armed forces during Ukraine's failed counter-offensive in the summer of 2023, said a shortfall in Western support during that period meant that Ukraine lost its chance to fend off Russia on its own. He said that missed opportunity turned the war into a protracted conflict where the way out 'seems rather doubtful and almost impossible,' and allowed Russia the chance to form an alliance with North Korea, Iran and China which Ukraine now cannot defeat without the help of Western partners. 'Against Ukraine now stands not only Russia, but also a quite powerful coalition of strong states,' he said. Such an 'alliance of authoritarian countries' may pose a security threat to the democratic world and the West 'should have made a plan to protect its democratic institutions,' he said. During the presentation of his plan in Brussels on Thursday, Zelenskyy said Kyiv has intelligence information that 10,000 troops from North Korea are being prepared to join Russian forces fighting against his country, warning that a third nation wading into the hostilities would turn the conflict into a 'world war.' Zelenskyy did not go into further details about the claim. As the war grinds through its third year, the mood in Ukraine is grim as its outmanned troops face difficulty holding back Russian advances, especially in the east. Although Moscow’s gains are incremental, the steady forward movement is making Kyiv feel it needs more large-scale Western help. The former armed forces chief stressed that Ukraine is battling Russia, which significantly outweighs it in resources, including in manpower. 'The only thing which works in the war is mathematics,' he said. Zaluzhnyi acknowledged the challenges his country faces with mobilization, emphasizing the need to reform recruitment practices inherited from the times Ukraine was a part of the Soviet Union. Despite his popularity, he has faced widespread criticism for failing to meet the army’s need for more troops. Conscription has become a sensitive issue as infantry shortages grow, which became one of the factors that allowed Russia to gain the initiative on the battlefield. 'We had to change it (the system),' he said but adding that Ukraine doesn’t have enough time to do it while the war with Russia lasts. 'The material side does not depend entirely on us, but in working with human resources, everything completely depends on Ukraine,' he said. Tensions between Zaluzhnyi and President Zelenskyy escalated following Ukraine’s 2023 counter-offensive, which failed to achieve significant territorial gains. In February, Zelenskyy dismissed Zaluzhnyi as military commander-in-chief in a move to revitalize efforts in the stalled war. Zaluzhnyi is widely respected among Ukrainian troops and considered a national hero. He is credited with stalling Russia’s full-scale invasion in the early days of the war and expertly pushing back Moscow’s troops. ——— Arhirova contributed from Kyiv	https://apnews.com/article/victory-plan-ukraine-russia-war-zelenskyy-zaluzhnyi-5634fc4a1c17a04b09a64c17b98c6512	2024-10-17T05:18:03-07:00	
After hurricane, with no running water, residents organize to meet a basic need	ASHEVILLE, N.C. (AP) — It takes water to flush a toilet and tens of thousands of North Carolinians have been without it since Hurricane Helene ripped through the state three weeks ago. When Lark Frazier went around asking her Asheville neighbors how they were doing as far as water to flush, several burst into tears over the stress of where to go to the bathroom and what to do with the waste. Some told her they were eating less to avoid going. Others said they were dumping poop in the yard and covering it with leaves. An elderly woman mentioned planning to scoop it out of the toilet with her hands. 'Not only is that horrifying and inhumane but it's dangerous for her to be handling her waste like that,' Frazier said. Since Helene swallowed mountain towns, damaged water infrastructure and killed nearly 250 people across the Southeast, local governments have been overwhelmed, and that's spurred community organizing and innovation. Frazier is one of the newly-minted leaders to have stepped up. She grew up in rural Colorado, using an outhouse for years before her family got a flush toilet. She drew on that experience, then came across the Emergency Toilet Guidebook online, published by the Regional Disaster Preparedness Organization in Oregon. She began fashioning rudimentary toilets and training others to do it, too. The concept is simple: line a sturdy bucket with a thick plastic bag, cover the top with a toilet seat or a water-resistant foam noodle for comfort, then drop in a handful of wood chips or other dry material after every use to absorb liquid and reduce odor. Pee should stay separate. 'Not having waste treated appropriately can absolutely lead to a major public health crisis,' said Sue Mohnkern, who developed the guidebook. Mishandling fecal matter can lead to cholera, dysentery and other serious, even fatal diseases. Mohnkern recommends everybody living in a disaster-prone area have an emergency toilet handy. Neither the city nor the county have released official guidelines on how to manage human waste without water to flush. Frazier called that lack of guidance 'astounding.' County spokesperson Lillian Govus said no county could give sufficient attention to every important issue in a disaster of this scale. City councilwoman Kim Roney has released a video explaining how to use an emergency toilet. The city set up the first water refill sites about a week after Helene, when some 136,000 people across the Southeast had nonoperational water providers, according to the EPA. Around 100,000 were in the Asheville area, although the city says that number has been reduced significantly in the past week. Still, thousands lack water, and it's unclear when it'll be back on. Those who can't get to these refill sites are getting missed, and here again, volunteers fil the gap. Molly Black and Elle DeBruhl, strangers before the storm, now coordinate an army of neighbors from dawn to dusk to get flush water to people. From Florida to Ohio to Texas, people have donated cube-shaped, 250-gallon, white plastic containers known as IBC totes that are often used on farms, in the chemical industry and disasters. A single tote can nearly fill a 6-foot pickup bed. Black and DeBruhl have organized people to haul the totes to ponds, fill them using pumps, then take them to where they're needed, like apartment buildings. Other neighbors and volunteers pick up the work from there, taking buckets of water to residents in need. 'I don’t even feel like I’m living my real life,' said DeBruhl, whose employer EY, a global accounting firm, gave her paid leave to serve her community following the storm. 'I went from a six-man tote operation to now I’m in charge of solving the nonpotable flushing water for the impacted area? Its crazy.' With cell service returned now, residents can text Black and DeBruhl’s grassroots group, Flush AVL — AVL is the shorthand for Asheville — to request a refill when their tote is empty. The group replenishes some 400 sites every other day. The city is helping with some of those, but this stopgap effort to preserve dignity and public health is mainly individuals donating their time and money. Govus applauded the volunteer efforts. 'It helps fill the gaps and meet peoples needs as we're working on systems and major processes to get people food, shelter and water,' she said. Yet another water solution is coming from people who still have water — because they have a well. Erik Iverson lives near a well owned by an urban farm that wanted to help after the hurricane. He laid two 200-foot lengths of plastic PEX pipe to route the well water to the road for public access. Then he added filtration and ultraviolet light in order to offer drinkable water in addition to the flush water (the city, however, recommends boiling all water sources). Now people driving by can access multiple spouts, operated by a foot pedal connected to a chain, touch-free to minimize germs spreading. 'With climate change this is probably not going to the be last time this happens,' Iverson said. 'No matter how resilient Asheville rebuilds their water system, it’s simply poor planning to not have this infrastructure in place to deal with something like this again.' Wine to Water, a global nonprofit focused on clean water, paid for the purification for this and nine other wells whose owners have agreed to community access. The private well owners 'benefit from having purified water on their property, and when this happens again, they can jump right into offering this purified water again. That is resilience,' Iverson said. Yet another grassroots group, Be Well AVL sprang up in the last two weeks and is pulling water from higher-capacity commercial wells offered up by local businesses, distributing it at apartments for low-income, elderly and disabled residents. They can't guarantee it's potable, given the official warning to boil water, but well water is typically cleaner than the pond water being distributed for flushing. Both sources are essential, said Grace Barron, an organizer with Be Well AVL. 'We absolutely need toilets to be flushed,' Barron said. And 'there's this other area of need for sanitation … washing dishes, clothing and bathing,' she said. There are infants in the community, she said, and they shouldn't be bathed in pond water. Barron, an Asheville resident of 18 years, said Hurricane Helene has reminded residents of the caring culture that was a foundation of the city before it ballooned into one of the most expensive places to live in the state. 'Mutual aid has been a part of our community prior to this,' she said. 'The community connections we had before have only grown.' __ Videojournalist Erik Verduzco contributed from Asheville. __ The Associated Press receives support from the Walton Family Foundation for coverage of water and environmental policy.

Hunger experts say the risk of famine in Gaza remains high	The Gaza Strip is still at risk of famine more than a year into the Israel-Hamas war, even as the number of people facing the most extreme level of hunger has declined in recent months, the international authority on hunger crises said Thursday. The findings come after the United States warned Israel that it might cut off military aid if its ally does not do more to address the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Hundreds of thousands of people there are displaced from their homes and packed into squalid tent camps and schools-turned-shelters. In recent weeks Israel has once again ordered the evacuation of the northern third of Gaza, and it launched another major military operation there. It allowed no food to enter the north for roughly the first two weeks of October before resuming shipments on Monday. According to the military's own figures, a little over 5,800 tons of food have entered all of Gaza so far this month, compared to nearly 76,000 in September, and not all of those shipments have reached people inside. More than 500 trucks remain trapped on the Gaza side of the border, where the U.N. says it has difficulty retrieving the cargo because of Israeli military operations, lawlessness and other obstacles. In a statement announcing a second shipment on Wednesday, the military said it will continue to act in accordance with international law 'to facilitate and ease the entry of humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip.' 86% of Gaza's population faces crisis-level hunger or worse The latest findings on hunger in Gaza were released by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, or IPC, an initiative set up in 2004 during the famine in Somalia that involves more than a dozen U.N. agencies, aid organizations, governments and other groups. It has repeatedly warned of famine over the course of the yearlong war, which was triggered by Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack into southern Israel. Over 1.8 million people, or around 86% of Gaza's population, are experiencing crisis levels of hunger, defined as Phase 3 or higher on the IPC's five-point scale. Some 133,000 people, or around 6%, are at Phase 5, the highest level, known as catastrophic hunger. That is down from earlier periods of the war, when nearly a third of the population was at Phase 5. The IPC warned the situation could rapidly deteriorate, and that it expects catastrophic hunger levels to double in the coming months. It cited a slowdown in aid in recent weeks, the onset of what is typically a cold and rainy winter, and the harsh conditions people face in crowded tent camps with little in the way of food, clean water or toilets. 'One year into the conflict, the risk of famine persists throughout the whole Gaza Strip as conflict intensifies and winter approaches,' it said in the report. Israel has controlled Gaza's entire land border since May. The Israeli military body in charge of civilian affairs, known as COGAT, says it places no limits on humanitarian aid entering the territory and accuses U.N. agencies and aid groups of failing to promptly deliver it. Those groups say their efforts are severely hampered by Israeli restrictions, ongoing fighting and displacement, and the breakdown of law and order in many areas. At a public kitchen in central Gaza on Thursday, crowds of women and children lined up with empty pots to receive a thin tomato soup with peas and noodles. 'It’s been two weeks since we had enough food for ourselves and our children. A lot of food items disappeared from the markets because the crossings are closed,' said Mohammed Abed, who was displaced from Gaza City, in the northern part of the territory. 'We used to live a decent life, but now as you can see, we stand at kitchens to get a plate of food and bread,' said Aisha Saliby, who was also displaced from Gaza City. 'End the war and let us go back home safely.' Israel cut aid to the north for 2 weeks as it launched another offensive Israel allowed no food to enter northern Gaza for the first two weeks of October, according to the U.N.'s World Food Program, as it waged a major military operation there that is still ongoing. U.N. humanitarian officials said last week that aid entering Gaza is at its lowest level in months. Most residents of northern Gaza fled after evacuation warnings at the start of the war, and Israel has not allowed them to return. An estimated 400,000 people have remained there despite the harsh conditions. Palestinians say nowhere in the besieged territory feels safe. Many fear Israel will implement a surrender-or-starve plan proposed by former generals calling for a cutoff in aid, and for anyone who ignores evacuation orders to be classified as a militant. The Israeli government has not said whether it has adopted the plan, which rights groups say would violate international law. The IPC report said the latest evacuation orders 'have significantly disrupted humanitarian operations, and repeated displacements have steadily worn down people’s ability to cope and access food, water and medicine, deepening the vulnerability of entire communities.' In a letter over the weekend, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin warned Israel that if it did not increase the amount of humanitarian aid allowed into Gaza within the next 30 days it could risk losing U.S. weapons supplies for the ongoing wars against Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon. A similar letter sent in April — after an Israeli strike killed seven aid workers — led to an increase in humanitarian aid to the territory. But State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said this week that the supply dwindled again, falling by over 50% from its peak earlier this year. Israel has so far allowed two shipments into northern Gaza this week — a total of 80 trucks — and it says around 430 trucks have entered through the southern Kerem Shalom Crossing since the start of the month. That is far below the 350 trucks a day that the U.S. said were needed. The United States has spent nearly $18 billion on military aid to Israel since the war in Gaza began, according to a report for Brown University’s Costs of War project. ___ Magdy reported from Cairo.

Israel is DNA-testing a body from Gaza to see if it's Hamas' top leader Sinwar, an official says	DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — The Israeli military said Thursday it was looking into whether Hamas’ top leader Yahya Sinwar was killed in a military operation in Gaza. Authorities were conducting DNA tests on a body to determine if it is him, an Israeli security official said. The military said in a statement that three militants were killed during operations in Gaza, without specifying where or elaborating further. It said the identities of the three were so far not confirmed, but it was 'checking the possibility' that one of them was Sinwar. The security official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss an ongoing investigation, said the tests on the body had not yet confirmed if it was Sinwar's. There was no immediate comment by Hamas on the report. Sinwar was one of the chief architects of Hamas’ attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, and Israel has vowed to kill him since the beginning of its retaliatory campaign in Gaza. If confirmed, Sinwar's death could be a heavy blow to the militant group. He has been Hamas' top leader inside the Gaza Strip for years, closely connected to its military wing while dramatically building up its capabilities. Sinwar was chosen as Hamas's top leader after his predecessor, Ismail Haniyeh, was assassinated in July in an apparent Israeli strike in the Iranian capital Tehran. Israel has also claimed to have killed the head of Hamas' military wing Mohammed Deif in an airstrike, but the group has said he survived. President Joe Biden has been briefed on Israel's investigation into whether it killed Sinwar, and U.S. officials have been in close contact with Israeli officials throughout Thursday morning, according to a senior administration official. The report came as Israeli forces continued a more than week-old major air and ground assault in the Jabaliya refugee camp in northern Gaza. On Thursday, an Israeli strike hit a school sheltering displaced Palestinians, killing at least 15 people, including five children, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry. Fares Abu Hamza, head of Gaza Health Ministry’s local emergency unit, said dozens of people were wounded. He said the nearby Kamal Adwan Hospital was struggling to treat the casualties. 'Many women and children are in critical condition,' he said. The Israeli military said it targeted a command center run by Hamas and Islamic Jihad inside the school. It provided a list of around a dozen names of people it identified as militants who were present when the strike was called in. It was not immediately possible to verify the names. Israel has repeatedly struck tent camps and schools sheltering displaced people in Gaza. The Israeli military says it carries out precise strikes on militants and tries to avoid harming civilians, but its strikes often kill women and children. In a separate development, a building in central Beirut that houses offices of the Al Jazeera news network and the Norwegian Embassy was evacuated after a warning. Mazen Ibrahim, Al Jazeera’s Lebanon bureau chief, said the building’s administration received three calls telling everyone to leave the building, which he said also houses the embassies of Norway and Azerbaijan, as well as dozens of offices. He said it was unclear who called in the warning. Norwegian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Ragnhild Simenstad said the building was evacuated after a 'bomb threat,' without elaborating. Israel has ordered the evacuation of several buildings, as well as entire cities, towns and villages, as it strikes what it says are targets linked to the Hezbollah militant group. There have also been several instances of evacuation warning calls and text messages that turned out to be bogus, which Lebanese security agencies say they are investigating. Israel launched its campaign in Gaza to eliminate Hamas after the militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250 others. Some 100 captives are still inside Gaza, about a third of whom are believed to be dead. Israel’s offensive has killed over 42,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry. It does not differentiate between civilians and combatants but says women and children make up a little more than half of the fatalities. Northern Gaza was the first target of Israel’s ground invasion nearly a year ago and has suffered the heaviest destruction of the war, with entire neighborhoods in Gaza City and other towns reduced to rubble. Most of the population fled after Israel issued evacuation orders in the opening days of the war, but about 400,000 are believed to have remained despite the harsh conditions. Earlier this month, Israel once again ordered the full-scale evacuation of the north, and allowed no food aid to enter the area for around two weeks. That led many Palestinians to fear that it had adopted a surrender-or-starve strategy suggested by former Israeli generals. Israel allowed two shipments of aid to enter the north earlier this week after the United States warned it might reduce its military aid if its ally did not do more to address the humanitarian crisis. Since the start of the conflict, Israeli forces have launched repeated operations into Jabaliya, a densely populated urban refugee camp dating back to the 1948 war surrounding Israel’s creation. The military says militants have repeatedly regrouped there after major operations. ___ Magdy reported from Cairo, Jeffery from Jerusalem.

Death of ex-One Direction member Liam Payne at 31 sends shockwaves around the world	BUENOS AIRES, Argentine (AP) — Shockwaves spread around the world Thursday at the death of Liam Payne, who shot to stardom as a member of British boy band One Direction and had to deal with intense global fame while still in his teens. Fans, music-industry figures and fellow musicians paid tribute to Payne, 31, who died after falling from a hotel balcony in Argentina. Buenos Aires police said Payne fell from the third floor of the Casa Sur Hotel in the trendy Palermo neighborhood of Argentina’s capital on Wednesday, resulting in 'extremely serious injuries.' Medics confirmed his death on the spot, the police said in a statement. Pablo Policicchio, the communications director for the Buenos Aires Security Ministry, said in a statement to The Associated Press that Payne 'had jumped from the balcony of his room.' Police rushed to the hotel in response to an emergency call just after 5 p.m. local time, he said, warning of an 'aggressive man who could be under the influence of drugs or alcohol.' The hotel manager can be heard on a 911 call obtained by the AP saying they had 'a guest who is overwhelmed with drugs and alcohol ... He’s destroying the entire room and, well, we need you to send someone, please.' The manager’s voice became more anxious as the call went on, noting the room had a balcony. Alberto Crescenti, head of the state emergency medical system, told Argentina’s Todo Noticias TV channel that authorities were investigating the circumstances of his death and conducting an autopsy. Payne was known as the tousle=headed, sensible one of the quintet that went from a TV talent show to a pop phenomenon with a huge international following of swooning fans. In recent years he had acknowledged struggling with alcoholism, posting a video in July 2023 to his YouTube channel where he said he had been sober for six months after receiving treatment. Representatives for Payne did not immediately return emails and calls. Rolling Stone Ronnie Wood, who performed with One Direction in 2014, said he was 'shocked and saddened.' 'God bless Liam, thinking of all his loved ones. He will be dearly missed,' Wood wrote on X. Paris Hilton also sent condolences on X, saying the news was 'so upsetting.' The Backstreet Boys said in a social media post that their hearts go out to 'Directioners around the world.' Dozens of One Direction fans flocked from across Buenos Aires to the Casa Sur Hotel after the news broke, forming lines that spilled into the cordoned-off street outside the hotel where police stood sentinel. Forensic investigators were seen exiting the hotel, from where Payne’s body was removed around three hours after the fall. Young women filming with their cellphones expressed shock and heartbreak as a makeshift memorial with rows of candles and bouquets quickly grew outside the hotel. 'I didn’t think he was going to die so young,' 21-year-old Isabella Milesi told the AP. Payne was one of five members of One Direction, which formed when they each auditioned for the British singing competition series 'The X Factor' in 2010, two years after Payne’s first attempt to get on the show. At 16 the second time around, Payne sang Michael Bublé’s version of 'Cry Me a River,' appearing nervous at the start but warming up with the audience’s cheers and applause. After each singer failed to make it through the competition as solo acts, Simon Cowell and his fellow judges combined Payne, Zayn Malik, Harry Styles, Niall Horan and Louis Tomlinson into what would become one of the most successful boy bands — even though they lost the competition. Each member had their own persona, with Payne — who hailed from Wolverhampton in England's West Midlands region — known as the responsible one. The band became known for their pop sound and romantic hits like 'What Makes You Beautiful,' 'Night Changes' and 'Story of My Life.' Payne had prominent solos on songs including 'Stole My Heart' and 'Change Your Ticket,' co-writing several of the band’s hits. They had six Top 10 hits on the Billboard charts by the time they disbanded in 2016 and a highly loyal fan base, known as 'Directioners,' many of them teen girls. 'I’ve always loved One Direction since I was little,' said 18-year-old Juana Relh, another fan outside Payne’s hotel. 'To see that he died and that there will never be another reunion of the boys is unbelievable, it kills me.' With his meteoric rise to fame, Payne had said that it took some time to adjust to the public eye. 'I don’t think you can ever deal with that, it’s all a bit crazy for us to see that people get in that sort of state of mind about us and what we do,' he said in a 2013 interview with the AP after recounting an experience where a fan was in a state of shock upon meeting him. One Direction announced an indefinite 'hiatus' in 2016, and Payne — like each of his erstwhile bandmates — pursued a solo career, shifting toward EDM and hip-hop. While Styles became a huge solo star, the others had more modest success. Payne's 2017 single 'Strip That Down,' featuring Quavo, reached the Billboard Top 10, and stayed on the charts for several months. He put out an album 'LP1' in 2019, and his last release — a single called 'Teardrops' — was released in March. In 2020, to mark the 10th anniversary of One Direction, Payne shared a screenshot of a text message he sent to his father on the day he joined the group, which read: 'I’m in a boyband.' 'What a journey… I had no idea what we were in for when I sent this text to my dad years ago at this exact time the band was formed,' he wrote. Payne had a 7-year-old son, Bear Grey Payne, with his former girlfriend, the musician Cheryl who was known as Cheryl Cole when she performed with Girls Aloud. She was an 'X Factor' judge during One Direction’s season, although their relationship began years later. Payne was previously engaged to Maya Henry, from August 2020 to early 2022. Henry released a novel earlier this year that she said was based on their relationship. In addition to his son, he is survived by his parents, Geoff and Karen Payne, and his two older sisters, Ruth and Nicola. ___ Huamani reported from Los Angeles.

Bangladesh court issues arrest warrant for ex-Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina over deaths of protesters	DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) — A special court in Bangladesh issued arrest warrants on Thursday for former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and 45 others, including her close aides, on charges of crimes against humanity during a student-led uprising in July and August that forced her to flee the country, a prosecutor said. Prosecutor B.M. Sultan Mahmud said the Dhaka-based International Crimes Tribunal under Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, the country's interim leader, issued the arrest warrants in response to two petitions submitted by the prosecution. He said the head of the tribunal, Golam Mortuza Majumdar, issued the orders in the presence of other judges. 'The tribunal first accepted our petition that involved Sheikh Hasina alone. Then we moved our second petition against 45 people that involved her close aides and others for the crimes against humanity. It was also accepted by the tribunal,' he said by phone. Hasina fled the country to India on Aug. 5 after weeks of violent protests over government job quotas in which hundreds of people died. Prosecutors said in the petitions that Hasina, her close aides and security agencies were responsible for killing the protesters and others. It is not clear if India will respond to any request from Bangladesh for Hasina's extradition under a mutual treaty. The tribunal's chief prosecutor, Muhammad Tajul Islam, earlier said they would seek help from Interpol, if necessary, to get Hasina back. The Yunus-led interim government has promised to try Hasina and others in her administration for alleged crimes involving the uprising against her and has invited the United Nations to help investigate the killings. Hasina also called for investigation as she questioned the killings, saying many deaths may have involved others beyond security agencies.	https://apnews.com/article/bangladesh-sheikh-hasina-arrest-warrant-isssued-f92d56b9c9930e9c6438c141c20f4b34	2024-10-16T23:51:02-07:00	
Vietnamese real estate tycoon found guilty of billions in fraud in government graft crackdown	HANOI, Vietnam (AP) — A Vietnamese real estate tycoon was convicted Thursday of fraudulently obtaining property worth billions of dollars in a case that has been a centerpiece of the government's crackdown on corruption. Truong My Lan was already convicted in April by the same Ho Chi Minh City court of fraud amounting to $12.5 billion — nearly 3% of the country's gross domestic product — in a separate case and sentenced to death by lethal injection. The trials were broken into two parts due to the number of allegations against her, and Thursday's verdict, which carries a maximum penalty of life in prison, adds to Lan's legal troubles as she awaits the appeal of her death sentence to be heard. Vietnam has handed down more than 2,000 death sentences in the past decades and executed more than 400 prisoners. It is a possible sentence for 14 different crimes but is generally only applied in cases of murder and drug trafficking. 'Standing here today is a price too expensive for me to pay. I consider this my destiny and a career accident,' the VNexpress online newspaper quoted Lan, the chairwoman of property developer Van Thinh Phat, as telling the judges in her closing statement last week. 'For the rest of my life, I will never forget that my actions have affected tens of thousands of families.' Thirty three others were tried as co-defendants in the case but details on the other verdicts were not immediately available. Lan's sentence was expected to be announced later in the day. In addition to obtaining property by fraud, Lan was also convicted of money laundering and illegal cross-border money transfer charges, according to state-run media. She was accused of raising $1.2 billion from nearly 36,000 investors by issuing bonds illegally through four companies, according to state media reports. She was also found guilty of siphoning off $18 billion obtained through fraud and for using companies controlled by her to illegally transfer more than $4.5 billion in and out of Vietnam between 2012 and 2022. It was not immediately clear if Lan would appeal the verdict and no date has yet been set for her appeal of her death penalty conviction to be heard. In the April conviction, she was found to have orchestrated financial fraud amounting to $12.5 billion for illegally controlling a major bank allowing loans that resulted in losses of $27 billion, according to state media reports. Lan’s arrest in October 2022 was among the most high-profile in an ongoing anti-corruption drive in Vietnam that has intensified since 2022. The Communist Party's 'blazing furnace' campaign has also touched the highest echelons of Vietnamese politics. Former President Vo Van Thuong resigned in March after being implicated in the campaign. Since 2016, thousands of party officials have been disciplined, including former President Nguyen Xuan Phuc and the former head of parliament, Vuong Dinh Hue, both of whom resigned. In all, eight members of the powerful Politburo have been ousted on corruption allegations, compared to none between 1986 and 2016. The anti-corruption drive began in 2013, but it wasn’t until 2018 that authorities began scanning the private sector. Since then, several owners of Vietnam’s fast-growing businesses have been arrested. The campaign had been the hallmark of Communist Party General Secretary Nguyen Phu Trong, Vietnam’s top politician. who died earlier this year at age 80. The ideologue had called corruption a grave threat to the party and vowed that the campaign would be a 'blazing furnace' in which no one was untouchable. In another high-profile case, business tycoon Trinh Van Quyet was found guilty in August of defrauding stockholders of nearly $150 million by falsely inflating the value of his company. The Hanoi People's Court sentenced Quyet to 21 years in prison and convicted 49 co-defendants on a variety charges, with sentences ranging from probation to multiple years in prison. Lan and her family established the Van Thinh Phat company in 1992 after Vietnam shifted from a state-run economy to a more market-oriented approach that was open to foreign investors. She started out helping her mother, a Chinese entrepreneur, sell cosmetics in Ho Chi Minh City’s oldest market, according to the state media outlet Tien Phong. Van Thinh Phat became one of Vietnam’s richest real estate companies, with projects including luxury residential buildings, offices, hotels and shopping centers. This made her a key player in the country’s financial industry. Lan’s first trial shocked many Vietnamese. Analysts said the scale of the scam raised questions about whether other banks or businesses had similarly erred, dampening Vietnam’s economic outlook and making foreign investors jittery at a time when Vietnam is trying to position itself as the ideal home for businesses trying to diversify supply chains away from China. ___ Rising reported from Bangkok.	https://apnews.com/article/vietnam-tycoon-death-trial-corruption-lan-b63f5a33af8dcee3f4662b3360ce764c	2024-10-16T22:42:07-07:00	
Ukrainian president Zelenskyy heads to EU, NATO to seek backing for his 'victory plan'	BRUSSELS (AP) — Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will seek support from European Union leaders on Thursday for what he is calling his ' victory plan ' to end the devastating war with Russia. Zelenskyy will address EU leaders at their summit in Brussels before shuttling across town to meet with NATO defense ministers. The EU is a key supporter of Ukraine — a candidate member of the 27-nation bloc — as it fights Russia's invasion that began more than 2 1/2 years ago. Zelenskyy outlined the five-point plan to Ukraine’s parliament on Wednesday without disclosing confidential elements that have been presented in private to key allies, including the United States. NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte was muted in his response to the plan on Wednesday. On Thursday he said that Kyiv can rest 'absolutely assured that 32 allies are united in making sure that collectively, we will do whatever is needed to make sure that Ukraine can prevail, that (asterisk)Russian President Vladimir) Putin will not get his way.' Rutte reiterated that Ukraine’s place is among NATO’s ranks, but he would not say when it might join. Zelenskyy insists that a membership invitation is central to his 'victory plan' and would provide his country with the ultimate security guarantee to protect it from Russia. 'Ukraine will be a member of NATO in the future,' Rutte said. 'The question is exactly about the ‘when.’ I cannot answer that now.' However, Rutte said, Putin must understand that 'we are in this, if necessary, for the long haul. And obviously we want to be in a place where Zelenskyy and Ukraine, from a position of strength, is able to start talks with Russia.' Major points of the plan include an invitation for Ukraine to join NATO and permission to use Western-supplied longer-range missiles to strike military targets deep inside Russia — steps that have been met with reluctance by Kyiv’s allies so far. A draft copy of EU summit conclusions — a text that will likely be tweaked before publication at the end of Thursday's meeting — reaffirms the bloc's 'unwavering commitment to providing continued political, financial, economic, humanitarian, military and diplomatic support to Ukraine and its people for as long as it takes and as intensely as needed. Russia must not prevail.' Thursday's talks in Brussels come as Ukrainian troops are struggling to hold off better-equipped Russian forces, especially in the eastern Donetsk region where they are gradually being pushed back. Kyiv is surviving with Western help, but Ukraine says it is coming too slowly. Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda criticized slow Western decision-making over Ukraine and said it 'would be a great mistake to think that our hesitance is the best way to de-escalation.' If Western allies bolstered support to Kyiv, leading to gains on the ground for Ukrainian forces, 'then I think Putin would be pressed to go to negotiations table. Right now, he thinks he is prevailing,' he said when entering the EU summit. Finnish Prime Minister Petteri Orpo said EU leaders 'have to give a strong signal and unified signal that we continue to support Ukraine as much and as long as needed.' At their summit in Washington in July, the 32 NATO members declared Ukraine on an 'irreversible' path to membership. But for now, NATO is in a holding pattern. Its biggest and most powerful member, the United States, is facing a presidential election. European allies expect little movement on Ukraine until a new president takes office in January. Beyond that, the United States and European heavyweight Germany remain deeply concerned about being dragged into a wider war with nuclear-armed Russia, and they lead a group of countries that oppose allowing Ukraine to join NATO until the conflict ends. ___ Corder reported from The Hague, Netherlands.	https://apnews.com/article/ukraine-zelenskyy-europe-victory-plan-summit-863bd5c70816449e3c92b7c1f767a2ff	2024-10-16T22:25:23-07:00	
Middle East latest: 28 killed in Israeli strike on shelter in Gaza, Palestinians say	Palestinian officials reported at least 28 dead, including four children, in an Israeli strike on a school being used as a shelter in Gaza on Thursday. Nearly 100 people were wounded in the strike in Jabaliya, according to the Gaza Health Ministry’s emergency unit in the north. The Israeli military said it is looking into whether Hamas’ top leader Yahya Sinwar was killed in a separate military operation in Gaza. Authorities were conducting DNA tests on a body to determine if it is him, an Israeli security official said. Syria’s military said an Israeli strike early Thursday wounded two civilians and damaged a military post. Israel regularly targets military sites in Syria linked to Iran and to Lebanon’s militant Hezbollah group and has escalated its campaign against Hezbollah in recent weeks, after a year of near-daily exchanges of cross-border fire. Lebanon says more than 2,300 people have been killed in the past year and 77% of public schools are out of service, either due to their use as shelters or their location in areas directly affected by the war. On Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas-led militants blew holes in Israel’s security fence and stormed in, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting another 250. Israel’s offensive in Gaza has killed over 42,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities, who do not distinguish combatants from civilians. The war has destroyed large areas of Gaza and displaced about 90% of its population of 2.3 million people. Israel’s military says it has allowed 50 trucks of humanitarian aid into northern Gaza on Wednesday, after the United States warned it to boost aid efforts or risk losing weapons funding. The region has suffered heavy destruction and has been completely encircled by Israeli forces for nearly a year. ___ Here's the latest: Palestinian officials say death toll in Gaza school strike rises to 28 DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — Palestinian medical officials say the death toll from an Israeli strike on a school where displaced people were sheltering has risen to 28. The Israeli military said the strike on Thursday targeted dozens of militants who were meeting inside the school in Jabaliya, in northern Gaza. Fares Abu Hamza, head of the Gaza Health Ministry’s emergency unit in the north, said the death toll had climbed to 28, with another 98 people wounded. Israel has been waging a large military operation in Jabaliya, an urban refugee camp dating back to the 1948 war, for more than a week now. It has once again called on all residents of northern Gaza to flee south, and it allowed no food aid to enter the north for around two weeks at the start of the month. Its forces have repeatedly returned to Jabaliya and other areas of Gaza after saying that militants had regrouped there. Philippines evacuate dozens of workers from Lebanon MANILA, Philippines — The Philippine government has evacuated dozens of Filipino workers from Lebanon, including one who urged thousands of compatriots to leave the war-hit nation before it’s too late. The 45 Filipino workers and two children who arrived Thursday in the Philippine capital were a fraction of about 10,000 to 11,000 Filipinos, many of whom have refused to leave their jobs in Lebanon for their poverty-stricken homeland. 'I hope they would return home because it has become too dangerous there,' Felicilda Aboc, a 56-year-old who has worked for 18 years as a house helper in Lebanon, told reporters at Manila’s international airport. She recounted how a powerful blast two days ago shook the house where she worked. The Philippine government has offered free chartered flights, cash and new livelihood training to encourage Filipinos in Lebanon to return home but has yet to issue a mandatory evacuation order. 'I was told that even if the bombs are in front of them, they may not go home as long as they still have employers,' Philippine Foreign Undersecretary Eduardo de Vega said of the many Filipinos in Lebanon. Israel's military looking into whether Hamas leader Sinwar was killed in Gaza JERUSALEM — The Israeli military says it is looking into whether Hamas’ top leader Yahya Sinwar was killed in a military operation in Gaza. The military said in a statement Thursday that three militants were killed during operations in Gaza, without elaborating. It said the identities of the three were so far not confirmed, but it was 'checking the possibility' that one of the three was Sinwar. Sinwar was one of the chief architects of Hamas’ attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. He was chosen as the group’s top leader following the assassination of Ismael Haniyeh in July in an apparent Israeli strike in the Iranian capital Tehran. German military says it intercepted drone off Lebanese coast BERLIN — The German military says a German navy ship deployed to the U.N. peacekeeping mission off the Lebanese coast has intercepted and brought down a drone. The military said a defense system on board the corvette, the Ludwigshafen am Rhein, brought the drone down in the water around 5 a.m. Thursday and that the drone’s explosive load detonated in the process. It said it did not know where the drone came from. The military didn’t specify the location of the ship at the time of the incident. The Ludwigshafen am Rhein is currently participating in the UNIFIL mission in Lebanon. Germany also has soldiers at the mission’s headquarters in Naqoura. Norwegian embassy in Beirut evacuated after receiving bomb threat OSLO, Norway — Norway's foreign ministry said the Norwegian embassy in Beirut was evacuated received a 'bomb threat' on Thursday. No one has been injured. A spokeswoman said the small number of Norwegian diplomats in Beirut were all safe. 'The acts of war in Lebanon make the security situation very unpredictable and tense. This threat is another example of that,' Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Ragnhild Simenstad said. 'The Foreign Ministry is continuously assessing the situation, including the safety of our colleagues who work in Beirut. The embassy has already implemented measures, as we have routines for in situations like this.' Strike on Gaza school-turned-shelter kills at least 15 An Israeli strike on a school sheltering displaced people in northern Gaza on Thursday killed at least 15 people, including four children, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry. The Israeli military said the strike targeted dozens of Hamas and Islamic Jihad militants who had gathered at the school. The strike hit the Abu Hussein school in Jabaliya, an urban refugee camp in northern Gaza where Israel has been waging a major air and ground operation for more than a week. ___ This item has been corrected to show four children were confirmed dead in the strike, not five.

Hezbollah official says the group will keep fighting ‘with all available means’ BEIRUT — A Hezbollah official says that the aim of the group’s military command is to keep fighting 'with all available means' to prevent Israel from achieving its goals and to eventually agree on a cease-fire. Legislator Hassan Fadlallah told reporters that since Israel’s invasion began on Oct. 1, Israeli troops have not been able to capture any village. Fadlallah said the aim of his group now is to stop the war but he refused to go into details saying that Lebanon’s parliament speaker and caretaker prime minister are leading the efforts. 'Our goal today is to end the aggression. We will not go into any detail related to the mechanism or solutions,' he said when asked whether Hezbollah still insists that it will only stop fighting once Israel’s offensive on Gaza stops. Fadlallah said that Israel has not been able to push deeper into Lebanon, stop Hezbollah rocket fire or create the conditions for its citizens to return to communities in the north near the border, which Israel says is its main war aim. Strike on Gaza tent camp kills 3 DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — Palestinian medical officials say an Israeli strike on a tent camp in the Gaza Strip killed three men and wounded eight other people, including women and children. The bodies were taken to Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir al-Balah after the strike on Thursday. An Associated Press reporter counted the bodies. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military. Israel has repeatedly struck tent camps and schools sheltering displaced people in Gaza. The military says it carries out precise strikes on militants who shelter among civilians, putting them in danger. Hamas-led militants triggered the war when they stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250 others. Some 100 captives are still inside Gaza, about a third of whom are believed to be dead. Israel’s offensive has killed over 42,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry. It does not differentiate between civilians and combatants but says women and children make up a little more than half of the fatalities. Iranian foreign minister makes rare visit to Egypt to discuss tensions CAIRO -- Iran’s foreign minister has paid a rare visit to Egypt to discuss regional tensions linked to Israel’s war with Iran-allied groups in Lebanon and the Gaza Strip. Abbas Araghchi met with Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah El-Sissi and other top officials on Thursday to discuss ways of de-escalating tensions, according to an Egyptian statement. Egypt was the first Arab country to make peace with Israel and is a close U.S. ally. Araghchi visited Jordan, another close U.S. ally, on Wednesday. Israel has vowed to respond to an Iranian ballistic missile attack earlier this month, raising fears of a regionwide war that could draw in the U.S. and its allies. Egypt and Jordan have repeatedly called for a cease-fire in Gaza, and Egypt has been a key mediator between Israel and Hamas. Israel says it has killed local Hezbollah commander JERUSALEM — The Israeli military says it has killed a local Hezbollah commander in a southern Lebanese town near the border. The military said Thursday that an airstrike on Bint Jbeil killed Hussein Awada, who it said was in charge of firing projectiles into Israel from areas near the town. Israeli strikes in recent weeks have killed Hezbollah’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah, and most of his senior commanders. Also on Thursday, the Israeli military warned people to stay away from two buildings in the eastern villages of Saraaine and Tamnine, in the Bekaa Valley, where Israel has carried out scores of airstrikes over the past two weeks. Iranian commander repeats threats to Israel TEHRAN, Iran — The chief of Iran’s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard threatened Israel on Thursday with more missile barrages if it strikes Iran. 'Do not repeat your mistake — if you misbehave, if you strike anything of ours either in the region or in Iran, we will again hit you painfully,' said Gen. Hossein Salami in a funeral ceremony for Iranian Guard commander Abbas Nilforoushan, who was killed alongside the head of the Hezbollah militant group in Beirut in September. Salami said a missile barrage by Iran on Israel earlier in October in retaliation of killing Nasrallah and Nilforoushan was the 'tiniest' action by Iran. He said an air defense battery deployed to Israel by the U.S. will not prevent Iranian retaliation. 'We do know about your weakness, and you know too,' said Salami. Earlier this month, Iran launched some 180 missiles at Israel in retaliation for the death of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, killed in Iran in July, as well as Nilforoushan and Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, who were killed in Israel strikes on Beirut in September. Iran is the main backer of Hezbollah and supports militant groups opposed to Israel across the region including Hamas. An Israeli strike wounds 2 in Syria, its military says DAMASCUS, Syria — Syria’s military says Israel carried out a strike early Thursday in the coastal city of Latakia, wounding two civilians and damaging a military post. The military statement that was carried by state media did not give further details. Israel regularly targets military sites in Syria linked to Iran and to Lebanon’s militant Hezbollah group. Those strikes have become more frequent after exchanges of fire along the Lebanon-Israel border began in October 2023, with Hezbollah attacking Israeli posts in support of the Palestinians and its ally, Hamas. The exchanges intensified over the past three weeks, and on Oct. 1, Israel began a ground invasion of southern Lebanon. US B-2 stealth bombers strike bunkers of Yemen’s Houthi rebels DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Long-range American B-2 stealth bombers launched airstrikes early Thursday morning targeting underground bunkers used by Yemen’s Houthi rebels, officials said. It wasn’t immediately clear what damage was done in the strikes. However, there are no previous reports of the B-2 Spirit being used in the strikes targeting the Houthis, who have been attacking ships for months in the Red Sea corridor over the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip. The Houthis’ al-Masirah satellite news channel reported airstrikes around Yemen’s capital, Sanaa, which the group has held since 2014. They also reported strikes around the Houthi stronghold of Saada. They offered no immediate information on damage or casualties. United States Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said in a statement that the B-2 bombers targeted 'five hardened underground weapons storage locations in Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen.' The strike also appeared to be an indirect warning to Iran, the Houthis’ main benefactor, which has targeted Israel with ballistic missile attacks twice over the past year. The nuclear-capable B-2, which first saw action in 1999 in the Kosovo War, is rarely used by the U.S. military in combat as each aircraft is worth some $1 billion.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-hezbollah-mideast-latest-17-october-2024-b250e3c9d313e617d96977e406dea947	2024-10-16T21:41:36-07:00	
European Central Bank, seeing no signs of recession, cuts interest rates again	LONDON (AP) — The European Central Bank, which sets interest rates for the 20 countries that use the euro currency, does not expect the bloc to slide into recession as it cut borrowing costs once again Thursday in the wake of recent data showing inflation across the bloc falling to its lowest level in more than three years, and economic growth waning. The bank’s rate-setting council lowered its benchmark rate from 3.5% to 3.25% — its third reduction since June — at a meeting in Llubljana, Slovenia, rather than its usual Frankfurt, Germany, headquarters, and said the 'disinflationary process is well on track.' According to revised figures on Thursday, inflation across the 20-country eurozone, sank to 1.7% in September, the first time in three years that it has been below the ECB’s target rate of 2%. In a statement accompanying the decision, the ECB predicted an inflation pick-up in the coming months, before a return to its target in the course of next year. In a press briefing following the decision, ECB President Christine Lagarde gave few signals that the bank would be cutting interest rates again at the next policy meeting in December, stressing that the governing council is 'not pre-committing to a particular rate path.' She insisted that decisions will 'follow a data-dependent and meeting-by-meeting approach.' Lagarde did acknowledge that the recent data on economic activity had come in 'somewhat weaker than expected,' pointing to a contraction in manufacturing sector and weaker exports. Even though Germany, Europe's powerhouse economy, saw output shrink in the second quarter, albeit by 0.1%, Lagarde said that she she didn't expect the eurozone economy overall to fall into recession, though she did note the downside risks that could emanate from the conflict in the Middle East and any new tariffs that Donald Trump may impose on European goods should he become U.S. president again. 'On the basis of the information that we have, we certainly do not see a recession,' she said. Economists think mounting evidence of an economic slowdown in the eurozone, particularly in Germany, will pile pressure on rate-setters to consider another cut to help bolster growth by making it even cheaper for businesses and consumers to borrow. In the second quarter of the year, the eurozone expanded by a modest quarterly rate of 0.2%. 'Although the ECB did not pre-commit to any specific rate path, we believe that downside risks to growth in a context of easing inflationary pressure will lead to more rate cuts starting in December and continuing in 2025,' said GianLuigi Mandruzzato, senior economist at EFG Asset Management. The ECB, which was created in 1999 when the euro currency was born, started raising interest rates in the summer of 2021, taking them up to a r ecord high of 4% in Sept. 2023 to get a grip on inflation by making it more expensive for businesses and consumers to borrow, but that has come at a cost by weighing on growth. One reason why inflation has fallen around the world — it's down at 2.4% in the U.S. and 1.7% in the U.K. — is that central banks dramatically increased borrowing costs from near zero during the coronavirus pandemic when prices started to shoot up, first as a result of supply chain issues built up and then because of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in early 2022, which pushed up energy costs. Other central banks, such as the U.S. Federal Reserve, have also started to cut interest rates as inflation rates have fallen.	https://apnews.com/article/european-central-bank-interest-rates-inflation-4b2545966c179c893a8ff34421a2530f	2024-10-16T21:07:36-07:00	
Stock market today: Wall Street drifts around its records as the US economy keeps humming	NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks are drifting around their records Thursday following the latest signals that the U.S. economy continues to hum. The S&amp;P 500 was 0.1% higher in midday trading and flirting with its record set early this week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was adding 99 points, or 0.2%, to its own all-time high set the day before, and the Nasdaq composite was 0.2% higher, as of 11 a.m. Eastern time. Nvidia and other companies in the chip industry were helping to lead the way after global heavyweight Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. reported bigger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. TSMC credited strong demand related to smartphones and artificial intelligence, and its stock that trades in the United States jumped 13.1%. The 2.5% rise for Nvidia was the strongest force pushing upward on the S&amp;P 500, and it was a sharp turnaround from earlier in the week when a warning from a major Dutch supplier to the chip industry, ASML, sent stocks sinking across the industry. Because Nvidia and other tech stocks have grown so big, their movements pack extra weight on the S&amp;P 500 and other indexes. Treasury yields were also rising in the bond market following the latest encouraging reports on the U.S. economy. U.S. retailers made more in sales in September than in August, and underlying growth trends within the data were better than economists expected. The strength was 'all the more impressive in the face of stretched household finances, particularly among lower-income shoppers, and pre-election jitters,' according to Gary Schlossberg, market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. A separate report, meanwhile, said fewer U.S. workers applied for unemployment benefits last week, a signal that layoffs nationwide are relatively low and aren’t damaging the job market. Such data bolster the hope that has sent U.S. stocks to records: The economy could make a perfect escape from the worst inflation in generations, one that doesn’t end with a recession that many investors worried was nearly inevitable. And with the Federal Reserve now cutting interest rates to help the economy keep humming, the expectation among optimists is that stocks can rise even further. Critics, meanwhile, warn that stock prices look too expensive given how much faster they've climbed than profits for companies. Lower interest rates can ease the brakes off the economy, boost prices for investments and make borrowing bills less costly for households and businesses. And rates are heading lower around the world, with only a couple exceptions. The European Central Bank on Thursday cut its main interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point. That helped send stock indexes higher by 1.3% in France and 0.7% in Germany. They halted a run of losses that began the day in Asian stock markets, where Japan’s Nikkei 225 fell 0.7% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng dropped 1%. On Wall Street, insurer Travelers was another winner and rose 7.8% after reporting stronger profit and revenue for the latest quarter than analysts expected. Higher income made from its investments and elsewhere helped cover greater losses due to Hurricane Helene and severe wind and hail storms in multiple states. Blackstone also helped push indexes higher after the investor in real estate, hedge funds and other alternative investments reported stronger profit than expected. It climbed 4.5% after CEO Stephen Schwarzman said it's seeing broad-based acceleration across its businesses. They helped offset a 12.7% drop for Elevance Health, which reported weaker profit for the latest quarter than expected. The Blue Cross-Blue Shield insurer also cut its forecast for profit for the full year, saying it was dealing with a 'timing mismatch' between Medicaid rates and higher claims from customers. CSX fell 4.8% after falling short of analysts’ profit expectations for the latest quarter. The railroad also expects only modest volume growth the rest of the year as the Southeast rebuilds after two major hurricanes. In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.09% from 4.02%. The two-year yield, which moves more closely with expectations for action by the Fed, rose to 3.98% from 3.94%. All the strong recent reports on the U.S. economy have forced traders to abandon bets that the Federal Reserve could cut its main interest rate by another half a percentage point in November. Instead, they're largely betting the Fed will move forward with a traditional-sized cut of a quarter of a percentage point, according to data from CME Group. That shift in expectations has helped push Treasury yields higher. ___ AP Business Writers Matt Ott and Elaine Kurtenbach contributed.	https://apnews.com/article/stocks-markets-rates-china-earnings-17ae24422a6dd5c641f94597b0d99b1f	2024-10-16T20:13:22-07:00	
How a broke Argentine province is countering Milei's deep austerity cuts	LA RIOJA, Argentina (AP) — They look like cash, fit into wallets like cash and the governor promises they’ll be treated like cash. But these brightly colored banknotes aren’t pesos, the depreciating national currency of Argentina, or U.S. dollars, everyone’s money of choice here. They are chachos, a new emergency tender invented by the left-wing populist governor of La Rioja, a province in the country's northwest that went broke when far-right President Javier Milei slashed federal budget transfers to provinces as part of an unprecedented austerity program. 'Who would have imagined that one day I’d find myself wishing I’d gotten pesos?' said Lucia Vera, a music teacher emerging from a gymnasium packed with state workers waiting to get their monthly bonus of chachos worth 50,000 pesos (about $40). Across La Rioja's capital, 'Chachos accepted here' decals now appear on the windows of everything from chain supermarkets and gas stations to upscale restaurants and hair salons. The local government guarantees a 1-to-1 exchange rate with pesos, and accepts chachos for tax payments and utilities bills. But there’s a catch. Chachos can’t be used outside La Rioja, and only registered businesses can swap chachos for pesos at a few government exchange points. 'I need real money,' said Adriana Parcas, a 22-year-old street vendor who pays her suppliers in pesos, after turning down two customers in a row who asked if they could buy her perfumes with chachos. The bills bear the face of Ángel Vicente 'Chacho' Peñaloza, the caudillo, or strongman, famed for defending La Rioja in a 19th-century battle against national authorities in Buenos Aires. A QR code on the banknote links to a website denouncing Milei for refusing to transfer La Rioja its fair share of federal funds. After entering office in December 2023, Milei swiftly imposed his shock therapy in a bid to reverse decades of budget-busting populism that ran up Argentina's monumental deficits. The cuts squeezed all of Argentina’s 23 provinces but boiled over into a full-blown crisis in La Rioja, where the public payroll accounts for two-thirds of registered workers and the federal government’s redistributed taxes cover some 90% of the provincial budget. With just 384,600 people and little industry beyond walnuts and olives, La Rioja received more discretionary federal funds than any other last year except Buenos Aires, home to 17.6 million people. Yet the province’s poverty rate tops 66% — the result, critics say, of a patronage system long used to placate interest groups at the expense of efficiency. While Milei's reforms forced other provinces to tighten their belts and lay off thousands of employees, Governor Ricardo Quintela — an ambitious power broker in Argentina’s long-dominant Peronist movement and one of Milei’s fiercest critics — refused to absorb the strife of austerity. 'I’m not going to take food from the people of La Rioja to pay the debt that the government owes us,' Quintela told The Associated Press, portraying his chacho-printing plan as a daring stand against 10 months of crumbling wages, rising unemployment and deepening misery under Milei. La Rioja defaulted on its debts in February and August. A New York federal judge ordered the province to pay American and British bondholders nearly $40 million in damages in September. Argentina’s Supreme Court is taking up the case of the province’s refusal to charge consumers sky-high prices for electricity after Milei’s removal of subsidies. 'There’s an alternative path to the cruelty of policies that the president is applying,' Quintela said. He appeared confident, speaking as Milei’s approval ratings dipped below 50% for the first time since the radical economist came to power. But as Milei and his allies tell it, Quintela’s alternative offers little more than a return to Argentina’s habitual Peronist preserve of reckless spending — and insolvency — that delivered the unmitigated crisis that his government inherited. 'You were used to having your tie fastened for you and your shoes polished, but now, you’ve got to tie the knot yourself,' Eduardo Serenellini, press secretary of Milei’s office, snapped at La Rioja business leaders on a recent visit to the province. 'When you run out of cash, you run out cash.' Serenellini picked up a chacho note, then flicked it away like lint. Gov. Quintela’s gambit in the remote province has had little effect on Argentina’s federal finances, but that could change if more cash-trapped provinces catch on, as happened during Argentina’s terrible financial crisis of 2001, when a similarly brutal austerity scheme sent over a dozen provinces scrambling to print their own parallel currencies. Unlike two decades ago, when former President Néstor Kirchner, a Peronist, put an end to the chaos by redeeming 'patacones,' 'cecacores' and 'boncanfores' for pesos, President Milei has ruled out a bailout for La Rioja. 'We will not be accomplices to irresponsible people,' Milei warned in a recent interview with Argentine TV channel Todo Noticias. But the libertarian purist added that he couldn’t stop La Rioja from doing what it pleased, considering that Argentina's constitution allows for such desperate financial work-arounds. The chacho hit the streets in August after La Rioja’s legislature approved plans to run off $22.5 billion pesos worth of the currency to help cover up to 30% of public sector salaries. With La Rioja’s average income sinking below $200 per month and stores shuttering for lack of business, authorities doled out 8.4 billion pesos worth of the scrip in monthly bonuses in August and September, an effort to help workers cope with Argentina’s 230% annual inflation and spur the stricken local economy. To encourage the chacho's use, authorities promise to pay interest of 17% on bills held to maturity on December 31. 'The closer we get to the expiration date, the more we’ll see public confidence in the chacho increase,' said provincial treasurer advisor Carlos Nardillo Giraud. Most state workers interviewed in the many chacho lines spilling onto La Rioja’s sidewalks last month said they wanted to get rid of the bills as quickly as possible. 'Now the chacho is an alternative, an option for people who can’t make it to the end of the month,' said 30-year-old physics teacher Daniela Parra, mounting her boyfriend’s motorcycle with arms full of chachos, ready to spend them all in one go at the supermarket. 'Who knows what will it be next month?' On the streets, merchants said they felt locked in a catch-22. Rejecting chachos meant turning away customers with new spending power in a deep recession. But accepting chachos meant filling cash registers with money that’s worthless to foreign suppliers and already changing hands at a discount to pesos on the street. 'They've formed a system where you're forced to depend on the state for everything,' said Juan Keulian, the director of La Rioja’s Center for Commerce and Industry. 'There’s no choice in a place like this.' ___ Follow AP's Latin America coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america	https://apnews.com/article/argentina-fake-money-economic-crisis-milei-peronism-bankrupt-province-30d478ec8292ccce27cb450ea1bb1c1a	2024-10-16T19:06:14-07:00	
Japan records trade deficit on weak yen, slowing exports	TOKYO (AP) — Japan racked up a trade deficit of 294.3 billion yen ($2 billion) in September, according to Finance Ministry data released Thursday, as exports fell to key destinations like China. For the first half of the April to March fiscal year, Japan’s trade deficit, or its imports subtracted from exports, was 3.1 trillion ($21 billion), the preliminary report showed. Japan’s exports in September fell 1.7% from the same month a year earlier in the first such decline in 10 months. Imports grew 2.1% from the previous year, on the back of a weak yen, which inflates their value. It was unclear if the drop, which was unexpected, reflected weaker demand in other major economies, since exports to other Asian countries rose. It also could be partly due to temporary disruptions like a recent typhoon. But slowing global demand remains a long-term worry for export-dependent Japan. The U.S. dollar has been trading at 149 yen Japanese yen levels recently, not far from its level a year ago but up from about 120 yen two years ago. Inflation and rising energy prices have also pushed up import costs. Exports rose 6.6% for the months from April through September to 53.55 trillion yen ($358 billion) as demand remained strong for computer chips. Imports grew 7% during that period to 56.66 trillion yen ($379 billion), as Japanese businesses and shoppers bought more U.S. products, the report said. In the first half of fiscal 2024, Japan recorded a nearly 4.3 trillion yen ($29 billion) trade surplus with the United States and a 3 trillion yen ($20 billion) deficit with China. ___ Yuri Kageyama is on X: https://x.com/yurikageyama	https://apnews.com/article/japan-trade-energy-deficit-currency-583416dd5f2ded1e1ca9667149342683	2024-10-16T18:50:29-07:00	
US long-range B-2 stealth bombers target underground bunkers of Yemen's Houthi rebels	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — U.S. long-range B-2 stealth bombers launched airstrikes early Thursday morning targeting underground bunkers used by Yemen's Houthi rebels, officials said. It wasn't immediately clear what damage was done in the strikes. However, there are no previous reports of the B-2 Spirit being used in the strikes targeting the Houthis, who have been attacking ships for months in the Red Sea corridor over the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip. The Houthis' al-Masirah satellite news channel reported airstrikes around Yemen's capital, Sanaa, which the group has held since 2014. They also reported strikes around the Houthi stronghold of Saada. They offered no immediate information on damage or casualties. U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said in a statement that the B-2 bombers targeted 'five hardened underground weapons storage locations in Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen.' The strike also appeared to be an indirect warning to Iran, the Houthis' main benefactor, which has targeted Israel with ballistic missile attacks twice over the past year. The B-2 would be used in any American attack on hardened Iranian nuclear facilities like Natanz or Fordo given it is the only aircraft in service that can drop the GBU-57, known as the 'Massive Ordnance Penetrator.' 'This was a unique demonstration of the United States’ ability to target facilities that our adversaries seek to keep out of reach, no matter how deeply buried underground, hardened, or fortified,' Austin said. Austin and the U.S. military's Central Command offered no immediate assessment on the damage done. However, Central Command said in a statement that initial assessments suggested no civilians had been killed. The Red Sea has become a battlefield for shippers since the Houthis began their campaign targeting ships traveling through the waterway, which once saw $1 trillion of cargo pass through it yearly. Houthis have targeted more than 80 merchant vessels with missiles and drones since the war in Gaza started in October 2023. They have seized one vessel and sunk two in the campaign that has also killed four sailors. Other missiles and drones have either been intercepted by a U.S.-led coalition in the Red Sea or failed to reach their targets, which have included Western military vessels. The rebels maintain that they target ships linked to Israel, the U.S. or the United Kingdom to force an end to Israel’s campaign against Hamas in Gaza. However, many of the ships attacked have little or no connection to the conflict, including some bound for Iran. The Houthis also continue to launch missiles targeting Israel and have shot down a number of U.S. military MQ-9 Reaper drones. The rebels have threatened new attacks in response to Israel's ground invasion of Lebanon and its killing of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah. The description and locations named by the Houthis on Thursday correspond to known underground bases operated by the rebels, who have been locked into a stalemated war with a Saudi-led coalition since 2015 that’s decimated the Arab world’s poorest nation. The Houthis have refurbished tunnels that once held Scud missiles for Yemen when it was ruled by strongman Ali Abdullah Saleh during his 33-year reign, according to an analysis in April by the International Institute for Strategic Studies. Those sites include the al-Hafa and Jabal Attan military bases, the former Presidential House and the Yemen state television compound in Sanaa, analyst Fabian Hinz wrote. The Houthis have built what appears to be their own large-scale tunnel network near Saada as well, Hinz added. 'The fact that the Houthis began constructing major new installations after the agreement of the cease-fire with the Saudi-led coalition suggests that the group is focused on entrenching themselves and bolstering their military capabilities,' he wrote. Iran similarly relies on a network of underground missile bases. The nuclear-capable B-2, which first saw action in 1999 in the Kosovo War, is rarely used by the U.S. military in combat as each aircraft is worth some $1 billion. It has dropped bombs in Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya as well. The aircraft are based at Whiteman Air Base in Missouri and typically conduct long-range strikes from there, though some B-2s were in Australia in September.	https://apnews.com/article/us-airstrikes-yemen-houthi-rebels-israel-hamas-war-99721f7f952d66d6da27e24dc3c189c3	2024-10-16T18:18:47-07:00	
Aging farmers face extreme temperatures as they struggle to maintain Japan's rice crop	KAMIMOMI, Japan (AP) — In the remote village of Kamimomi in Japan’s western Okayama prefecture, a small group of rice farmers began their most recent harvest in sweltering heat, two weeks sooner than usual. The prefecture is called 'the Land of Sunshine' because of its pleasant climate, but farmers working among the paddy fields and ancient rice terraces say that climate change is hurting the harvest of rice, long a cornerstone of Japan’s diet. 'Last year, an exceptional heat wave took the water out of the rice, which became small and thin,' rice farmer Joji Terasaka said. 'So I am worried about that this year because it will be just as hot.' This year Japan experienced its hottest July on record, with temperatures reaching 2.16 C (3.9 F) higher than average, according to the Japan Meteorological Agency. The globe has seen a 1.2 C (2.2 F) rise in average temperature since preindustrial times, and scientists agree that warming needs to be capped at 1.5 C (2.7 F) to stave off the worst effects of climate change. That includes even more powerful heat, storms and irreversible ice melt. Last year, Japan recorded a poor rice harvest nationwide because of exceptionally hot weather. Ministry data showed the country’s private-sector rice inventory fell to 1.56 million tons in June, the lowest level since records began in 1999. Last year was the hottest on record globally, though it’s feared that this year may top it. The drop in harvest in Japan was partly to blame for this year’s widespread summer rice shortage, according to officials. There were empty shelves in supermarkets, and some retailers are still enforcing purchase limits of one rice bag per customer. 'Perhaps people think that an increase of one degree Celsius in average temperature isn’t much. But it’s quite a big change for plants and crops,' says Yuji Masutomi, a researcher at the National Institute for Environmental Studies in Tsukuba, north of Tokyo. Masutomi said the rising temperatures not only influence the growth cycle and yield of rice, but also hurt the quality of the grain. When temperatures rise above 27 C, the buildup of starch inside rice grains is reduced. That causes the crop to take on a chalky appearance, and its value is reduced. At least a fifth of rice farms have reported a drop in quality from rising temperatures, according to a farming ministry report last year. 'Not only is the appearance not good; people say the taste drops too,' Masutomi said. For farmers in Kamimomi, there's another problem with working under exceptional heat. The average age of agricultural workers in Japan is nearly 69, among the oldest in the world, and older people are especially vulnerable to heatstroke. Toshimi Kaiami led a community project in Kamimomi that involved reviving some of the paddy fields abandoned because of the aging population. 'There are no longer any successors,' says Kaiami. 'We are heading toward extinction.' The community project divides labor among Kamimomi's farmers. But preparations for the harvest coincided with the hottest months of the year — April to September. 'It takes a half year to produce rice. The heat and the work that we have to endure during that time is really tough,' said rice farmer Mitsumasa Sugimoto, 77. To deal with climate change, the government is promoting the adoption of heat-resistant rice variants, including Sai no Kizuna, which was developed by a research center in Saitama prefecture, near Tokyo. Research organizations around the world have worked to produce more resilient strains of essential food like rice while introducing more heat and drought resistant grains like sorghum or millet. 'Last year and this year have been extremely hot, but even in those conditions, Sai no Kizuna maintained a certain level of quality,' said Naoto Ohoka, who manages rice breeding at Saitama’s Agricultural Technology Research Center. 'Its other characteristic is that it is very delicious.' The center cultivates more than a thousand types of rice strains, and through cross-pollination officials assess and select the best performers to develop new varieties. Sai no Kizuna was developed in 2012 to better withstand heat, a trait that has become more widely recognized recently as Japan sees hotter summers. The strain also stands up well against typhoon wind and certain pests and diseases. Researchers want to develop more resilient strains against heat as temperatures are projected to continue rising. Masutomi recommends that variants tolerant of temperatures up to 3 degrees Celsius higher should be introduced across Japan by the 2040s. But it’s a long process. It can take up to 10 years to develop a new variant. Once it’s approved for the market, farmers must then be convinced to switch to the new strain. The most widely grown variety is Koshihikari, which is less heat resistant. Even so, older farmers have shown a reluctance to switch to other varieties. Farming ministry data show that only around 15% of Japanese paddy fields have adopted heat resistance variants.	https://apnews.com/article/japan-climate-change-rice-farming-struggle-a569237462e65426587d48876145e825	2024-10-16T18:09:13-07:00

Liam Payne, former One Direction member, dies at 31 in Argentina hotel fall	BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) — Former One Direction singer Liam Payne, 31, whose chart-topping British boy band generated a global following of swooning fans, was found dead Wednesday after falling from a hotel balcony in Buenos Aires, local officials said. Buenos Aires police said in a statement that Payne fell from the third floor of the Casa Sur Hotel in the trendy Palermo neighborhood of Argentina's capital, resulting in 'extremely serious injuries.' Medics confirmed his death on the spot, the statement said. Pablo Policicchio, the communications director for the Buenos Aires Security Ministry, said in a statement to The Associated Press that Payne 'had jumped from the balcony of his room.' Police rushed to the hotel in response to an emergency call just after 5 p.m. local time, he said, warning of an 'aggressive man who could be under the influence of drugs or alcohol.' The hotel manager can be heard on a 911 call obtained by the AP saying they had 'a guest who is overwhelmed with drugs and alcohol ... He’s destroying the entire room and, well, we need you to send someone, please.' The manager's voice became more anxious as the call went on, noting the room had a balcony. Alberto Crescenti, head of the state emergency medical system, told Argentina’s Todo Noticias TV channel that authorities were investigating the circumstances of his death and conducting an autopsy. Payne had been vocal about struggling with alcoholism, posting a video in July 2023 to his YouTube channel where he said he had been sober for six months after receiving treatment. Representatives for Payne did not immediately return emails and calls. Dozens of One Direction fans flocked from across Buenos Aires to the Casa Sur Hotel after the news broke, forming lines that spilled into the cordoned-off street outside the hotel where police stood sentinel. Forensic investigators were seen exiting the hotel, from where Payne’s body was removed around three hours after the fall. Young women filming with their cellphones expressed shock and heartbreak as a makeshift memorial with rows of candles and bouquets quickly grew outside the hotel. 'I didn’t think he was going to die so young,' 21-year-old Isabella Milesi told the AP. Payne was one of five members of One Direction, which formed when they each auditioned for the British singing competition series 'The X Factor' in 2010, two years after Payne's first attempt to get on the show. At 16 the second time around, Payne sang Michael Bublé’s version of 'Cry Me a River,' appearing nervous at the start but warming up with the audience’s cheers and applause. After each singer failed to make it through the competition as solo acts, Simon Cowell and his fellow judges combined Payne, Zayn Malik, Harry Styles, Niall Horan and Louis Tomlinson into what would become one of the most successful boy bands — even though they lost the competition. Each member had their own persona, with Payne — who hailed from Wolverhampton, a city in the West Midlands region of England — being known as the responsible one. The band became known for their pop sound and romantic hits like 'What Makes You Beautiful,' 'Night Changes' and 'Story of My Life.' Payne had prominent solos on songs including 'Stole My Heart' and 'Change Your Ticket,' co-writing several of the band's hits. They had six Top 10 hits on the Billboard charts by the time they disbanded in 2016 and a highly loyal fan base, known as 'Directioners,' many of whom were teen girls. 'I’ve always loved One Direction since I was little,' said 18-year-old Juana Relh, another fan outside Payne’s hotel. 'To see that he died and that there will never be another reunion of the boys is unbelievable, it kills me.' With his meteoric rise to fame, Payne had said that it took some time to adjust to the public eye. 'I don’t think you can ever deal with that, it’s all a bit crazy for us to see that people get in that sort of state of mind about us and what we do,' he said in a 2013 interview with the AP after recounting an experience where a fan was in a state of shock upon meeting him. After the group's dissolution, Payne — like each of his erstwhile bandmates — pursued a solo career, shifting toward EDM and hip-hop. His 2017 single 'Strip That Down,' featuring Quavo, reached the Billboard Top 10, and stayed on the charts for several months. He put out an album 'LP1' in 2019, and his last release — a single called 'Teardrops' — was released in March. Payne had a 7-year-old son, Bear Grey Payne, with his former girlfriend, the musician Cheryl who was known as Cheryl Cole when she performed with Girls Aloud. She was an 'X Factor' judge during One Direction's season, although their relationship began years later. Payne was previously engaged to Maya Henry, from August 2020 to early 2022. Henry released a novel earlier this year that she said was based on their relationship. In addition to his son, he is survived by his parents, Geoff and Karen Payne, and his two older sisters, Ruth and Nicola. ___ Huamani reported from Los Angeles.

North Korea says its revised constitution defines South Korea as 'hostile state' for first time	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korea confirmed Thursday that its recently revised constitution defines South Korea as 'a hostile state' for the first time, two days after it blew up front-line road and rail links that once connected the country with the South. The back-to-back developments indicate North Korea is intent on escalating animosities against South Korea, increasing the danger of possible clashes at their tense border areas, though it’s highly unlikely for the North to launch full-scale attacks in the face of more superior U.S. and South Korea forces. The official Korean Central News Agency said Thursday that its recent demolition of parts of the northern sections of the inter-Korean road and rail links was 'an inevitable and legitimate measure taken in keeping with the requirement of the DPRK constitution which clearly defines the ROK as a hostile state.' DPRK stands for Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the North's official name, while ROK stands for Republic of Korea, the South's formal name. South Korea’s Unification Ministry condemned North Korea’s constitutional reference to South Korea as a hostile state, calling it 'an anti-unification, anti-national act.' It said the South Korean government will sternly respond to any provocations by North Korea and unwaveringly push for a peaceful Korean unification based on the basic principle of freedom and democracy. North Korea’s rubber-stamp parliament met for two days last week to rewrite the constitution but state media hadn't provided many details about the session. Leader Kim Jong Un had earlier called for the constitutional change at that parliamentary meeting to designate South Korea as the country’s main enemy, remove the goal of a peaceful Korean unification and define North Korea’s sovereign, territorial sphere. Thursday's KCNA dispatch gave no further details of the new constitution, except the description of South Korea. 'There may still be an internal propaganda review underway about the appropriate way to disclose the constitutional revisions, but this confirmation was expected,' said Ankit Panda, an expert with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. Kim’s order in January to rewrite the constitution caught many foreign experts by surprise because it was seen as eliminating the idea of shared statehood between the war-divided Koreas and breaking away with his predecessors’ long-cherished dreams of peacefully achieving a unified Korea on the North’s terms. In the past months, North Korea has torn down monuments symbolizing rapprochement with South Korea and abolished state agencies handling inter-Korean relations. Some experts say Kim likely aims to guard against South Korean cultural influence and bolster his family's dynastic rule. Others say Kim wants legal room to use his nuclear weapons against South Korea by making it as a foreign enemy state, not a partner for potential unification which shares a sense of national homogeneity. They say Kim may also want to seek direct dealings with the U.S. in future diplomacy on its nuclear program, not via South Korea. 'North Korea has fallen so far behind the South that any social exchange or financial integration might look like paths to unification by absorption,' said Leif-Eric Easley, professor of international studies at Ewha Womans University in Seoul. 'Pyongyang’s rejection of peaceful Korean unification is thus a strategy for regime survival and maintaining domestic control. This not only bodes ill for diplomacy but could also become an ideology motivating military aggression against Seoul,' Easley said. KCNA, citing North Korea’s Defense Ministry, reported that North Korea on Tuesday blew up the 60-meter (197 feet)-long sections of two pairs of the roads and railway routes — one pair on the western portion of the inter-Korean border and the other on the eastern side of the border. Largely built with South Korean money, the road and rail links were once a major symbol of now-dormant inter-Korean reconciliation movements. In the 2000s, the two Koreas reconnected the road and rail routes for the first time since the end of the 1950-53 Korean War, but their operations were halted later as the rivals bickered over North Korea's nuclear ambitions and other issues. Last week, North Korea said it would permanently block its border with South Korea and build front-line defense structures. South Korean officials said North Korea had been adding anti-tank barriers and laying mines along the border since earlier this year. Animosities between the Koreas increased in recent days, with North Korea accusing South Korea of flying drones over its capital Pyongyang three times this month and vowing strong military responses if similar incidents happen again. South Korea has refused to confirm whether it sent drones but warned that North Korea will face a regime demise if the safety of South Korean citizens is threatened. Many observers say North Korea won't likely launch a full-blown war because it knows its military is outgunned by the U.S. and South Korean forces, and that North Korea ultimately aims to use its advancing nuclear program as leverage to wrest sanctions relief from the U.S. But they say a miscalculation could still lead to border clashes. Intense outside attention has been on whether the North Korean constitutional change includes new legal, territorial claims around the Koreas' disputed western sea boundary, the site where several deadly skirmishes and bloodsheds happened in the past 25 years. 'South Korea and the United States need not overreact to North Korean moves. The recent drone incident raises the possibility of miscalculation and escalation,' Panda, the expert, said.	https://apnews.com/article/north-korea-constitution-change-enemy-12a1ec860d84b106265d35676cb1a0b3	2024-10-16T12:56:11-07:00	
Helene and Milton are both likely to be $50 billion disasters, joining ranks of most costly storms	Monstrous hurricanes Helene and Milton caused so much complex havoc that damages are still being added up, but government and private experts say they will likely join the infamous ranks of Katrina, Sandy and Harvey as super costly $50-billion-plus killers. Making that even more painful is that most of the damage — 95% or more in Helene's case — was not insured, putting victims in a deeper financial hole. Storm deaths have been dropping over time, although Helene was an exception. But even adjusted for inflation, damages from intense storms are skyrocketing because people are building in harm's way, rebuilding costs are rising faster than inflation, and human-caused climate change are making storms stronger and wetter, experts in different fields said. 'Today’s storms, today’s events are simply vastly different from yesterday’s events. One of the things that we’re seeing is the energy content that these systems can retain is significantly greater than it used to be,' said John Dickson, president of Aon Edge Insurance Agency, which specializes in flood coverage. 'The weather seems to be, in many cases, moving faster than we as a society are able to keep pace with it.' In the last 45 years, and adjusted for inflation, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has counted 396 weather disasters that caused at least $1 billion in damage. Sixty-three of those were hurricanes or tropical storms. The $50 billion mark for direct losses is a threshold that differentiates 'truly historic events,' said Adam Smith, the economist and meteorologist who runs the list out of NOAA's National Center for Environmental Information in Helene-hit Asheville, North Carolina. Only eight hurricanes reached that threshold. Smith said he thought Milton and Helene have 'a very good shot' of joining that list. The first $50 billion hurricane was Andrew in 1992. The U.S. went 13 more years before Katrina topped the damages chart, then seven years until the third costly whopper, Sandy. Helene and Milton would make seven in the last seven years. Calculating damages is far from an exact science. The more complex and nastier storms are — like Milton and Helene — the longer it takes, Smith said. Damage is spread over different places and often a much larger area, with wind damage in some places and flood damage elsewhere. Helene, in particular, caused widespread flooding and in places not used to it. Estimates for those storms from private firms in recent days vary and are incomplete. There's three categories of damage: insured damage, uninsured damage and total economic cost. Many risk and insurance firms only estimate insured losses. Homeowner insurance usually covers wind damage, but not flood. Special insurance has to be bought for that. Flood insurance coverage rates vary by region and storms differ on whether they cause more wind or water damage. Helene was mostly water damage, which is less likely to be covered, while Milton had a good chunk of wind damage. Of the top 10 costliest hurricanes as compiled by insurance giant Swiss Re — not including Helene or Milton yet — insured damage is about 44% of total costs. But with Helene, Aon's Dickson estimated that only 5% of victims had insurance coverage for the type of damage they got. He estimated $10 billion in insured damage so doing the math would put total damage in the $100 billion to $200 billion range, which he called a bit high but in the ballpark. Insured losses for Milton are in the $50 billion to $60 billion range, he said. With Helene, Swiss Re said less than 2% of Georgia households have federal flood insurance, with North Carolina and South Carolina at 3% and 9%. In North Carolina's Buncombe County, where more than 57 people died from Helene's flooding, less than 1% of the homes are covered by federal flood insurance, the agency said. Risk modeling by Moody's, the financial services conglomerate, put a combined two-storm total damage estimate of $20 billion to $34 billion. Karen Clark and Company, a disaster modeling firm that uses computer simulations superimposed on storm and insurance data, wouldn't give total damage estimates for the storms. But the company figured insured losses alone were $36 billion for Milton and $6.4 billion for Helene. 'The economic losses are going up because we're putting more infrastructure and housing in harm's way,' said University of South Carolina's Susan Cutter, co-director of the Hazards Vulnerability and Resilience Institute, who added that climate change also plays a role. 'Human losses and deaths are going down because people are being a little bit more vigilant about paying attention to preparedness and getting out of harm's way.' Much of the damage is because of flooding. Studies show that hurricanes are getting wetter because of the buildup of heat-trapping gases from the burning of coal, oil and gas. Basic physics dictates that clouds hold 4% more moisture for every degree Fahrenheit (7% for every degree Celsius), and that falls as rain. 'There is scientific agreement that floods and flooding from these hurricanes is becoming more frequent and more severe. So it is likely that we’re going to be seeing a higher frequency of storms like Helene in the future,' said Karen Clark, who founded her namesake firm. 'It’s not really an insurance issue because it’s not privately insured. This is really a societal issue and political question. How do we want to deal with this?' Clark and several of the experts said it's time for society to think about where it builds, where it lives and if it should just leave dangerous areas and not rebuild, a concept called 'managed retreat.' 'At what point do you as an individual continue to build, rebuild, rebuild and rebuild versus saying ‘OK, I’ve had enough',' Cutter said. And when it comes to flood insurance, many homeowners in risky areas find it's too expensive, so they don't buy it, Clark said. But when a storm hits them, she said 'all of us as taxpayers, we're going to pay it because we know there are going to be federal dollars coming into those areas to help people rebuild. So all taxpayers, we're actually paying for people to live in risky areas.' __ Read more of AP’s climate coverage at http://www.apnews.com/climate-and-environment ___ Follow Seth Borenstein on X at @borenbears ______ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Trudeau says police went public with Indian diplomat allegations to prevent further violence	TORONTO (AP) — Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Wednesday that Canada's national police force went public with its allegations against Indian diplomats this week because it had to disrupt violent acts in Canada including drive-by-shootings, extortions and even murder. The Royal Canadian Police said Monday it had identified India’s top diplomat in the country and five other diplomats as persons of interest in the June 2023 killing of Sikh activist Hardeep Singh Nijjar. The RCMP also said they uncovered evidence of an intensifying campaign against Canadians by agents of the Indian government. 'We are not looking to provoke or create a fight with India,' Trudeau said. 'The Indian government made a horrific mistake in thinking that they could interfere as aggressively as they did in the safety and sovereignty of Canada. We need to respond in order to ensure Canadians safety.' Niijar's killing has strained bilateral relations between India and Canada for over a year and boiled over this week as the countries expelled each other’s top diplomats over those allegations and other alleged crimes in Canada. Trudeau said he has tried not to 'blow up' relations with India and that Canadian officials provided evidence privately with their Indian counterparts who, he said, have been uncooperative. 'The decision by the RCMP to go forward with that announcement was entirely anchored in public safety and a goal of disrupting the chain of activities that was resulting in drive by shootings, home invasions, violent extortion and even murder in and across Canada,' Trudeau said while testifying Wednesday before the Foreign Interference Commission in Ottawa. Trudeau said Indian diplomats have been passing information about Canadians to the highest levels of the Indian government which was then shared with organized crime, resulting in violence against Canadians. 'It was the RCMP's determination that that scheme needed to be disrupted,' he said. RCMP Commissioner Mike Duheme said Monday police have evidence allegedly tying Indian government agents to other homicides and violent acts in Canada. He declined to provide specifics, citing ongoing investigations, but he said there have been well over a dozen credible and imminent threats that have resulted in police warning members of the South Asian community, notably the pro-Khalistan, or Sikh independence, movement. Trudeau said India has violated Canada’s sovereignty. India has rejected the accusations as absurd. India has repeatedly criticized Trudeau’s government for being soft on supporters of the Khalistan movement who live in Canada. The Khalistan movement is banned in India but has support among the Sikh diaspora, particularly in Canada. Nijjar, 45, was fatally shot in his pickup truck after he left the Sikh temple he led in Surrey, British Columbia. An Indian-born citizen of Canada, he owned a plumbing business and was a leader in what remains of a once-strong movement to create an independent Sikh homeland. Four Indian nationals living in Canada were charged with Niijar’s murder and are awaiting trial. Trudeau noted his government could have gone public with the allegations when Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi hosted the G20 Summit in September 2023, but chose not to. He met with Modi and expressed concerns privately then. 'It was a big moment for India welcoming all the leaders of the world to New Delhi for a very important summit and we had the opportunity of making it a very uncomfortable summit for India if we went public with these allegations ahead of time,' said Trudeau. 'We chose to continue to work with India behind the scenes to try and get India to cooperate with us.' Trudeau said that when he returned home India's response, particularly through the media, was to attack Canada. Trudeau later went public in Parliament with the allegation that the Indian government might have been involved in Niijar’s killing. He said there were about to be media stories detailing the allegation of India's possible involvement in the killing of a Canadian Sikh on Canadian soil. He said he went public because of worries about public safety. Canada’s foreign minister on Monday said violence in Canada has worsened since then. The British government said India should cooperate with Canada’s investigation into accusations that its government has been involved in an escalating number of violent crimes in Canada. In a statement, the British Foreign Commonwealth and Development Office said India's cooperation with Canada’s legal process 'is the right next step.' A U.S. State Department spokesman told a news conference Tuesday that the U.S. had long been asking India to cooperate with Canadian authorities.	https://apnews.com/article/canada-india-diplomats-violence-80e9a0d43faa7db99781563434d0f1e0	2024-10-16T10:35:35-07:00	
Long-ruling party leads in Mozambique's election as opposition candidate calls for strikes	MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) — Mozambique's ruling party candidate held a clear lead in early presidential election results Wednesday as his main challenger said he would not accept them and called them fraudulent. Daniel Chapo of the ruling Front for the Liberation of Mozambique, or Frelimo, is on course to win the vote, according to the provincial results, and succeed President Filipe Nyusi, who has served a maximum two terms. Frelimo has been in power in the southern African nation since independence from Portugal in 1975. Opposition candidate Venancio Mondlane, who is running as an independent, was second behind Chapo in the early count but repeated his claims that last week's election was marred by fraud and manipulation by Frelimo. Mondlane has also called on Mozambicans to hold a national strike on Monday in protest at what he called the 'deceit of the most shameful level of the regime.' Frelimo has often been accused of election rigging, which it denies. Many analysts raised concerns ahead of this election, saying Frelimo manipulates voter lists and traditionally has officials loyal to it working at polling stations. Mondlane and his supporters held a march in the northern city of Nampula on Wednesday, which was broken up by police. Police said Mondlane did not keep to an agreed route for the march and also accused him of encouraging his supporters to confront officers. Four people were arrested, police said. Frelimo has won every national election in Mozambique since the country's first in 1994. Frelimo came to power at independence but then fought a bloody 15-year civil war against rebel group Renamo, which later became the main opposition party and also contested this election. Mondlane was a member of the Renamo party before breaking away months before the election and standing as an independent. ___ AP Africa news: https://apnews.com/hub/africa	https://apnews.com/article/mozambique-election-frelimo-vote-6987692541d92a9c6a287be4af89a524	2024-10-16T10:30:58-07:00	
Italy expands its ban on surrogacy to overseas as critics say it targets same-sex couples	ROME (AP) — Italy on Wednesday criminalized citizens who go abroad to have children through surrogacy, a measure slammed by opponents as 'medieval' and discriminatory to same-sex couples. The measure extending a surrogacy ban in place since 2004 was promoted by Premier Giorgia Meloni's far-right Brothers of Italy party and its conservative coalition partner, the League, asserting that it protects women’s dignity. The Senate after a seven-hour debate passed the bill 84-58, the final step in the process after the Lower House's approval last year. Italians seeking surrogacy in countries such as the United States or Canada, where the practice is legal, can face up to two years in jail and up to 1 million euros ($1.1 million) in fines. The surrogacy ban applies equally to all couples. But same-sex parent advocates say it hits gay families particularly hard in a country struggling with record-low birthrates and where only heterosexual couples are allowed to adopt. Same-sex marriages are also banned in Italy, and LGBTQ+ couples have been fighting to obtain parental rights for the partner who is not the biological parent. Several lawmakers and LGBTQ+ activists protested in front of the Senate to oppose the law, some holding banners that read: 'Parents, not criminals.' 'When protectionism prevails, a social phenomenon is not erased,' opposition lawmaker Riccardo Magi said during the protest. 'It is simply relegated to a dark area, which the law doesn't reach. In that case, it’s easier for exploitation, abuse and rights violations to prevail.' 'We are very saddened because Italy has once again missed an opportunity to demonstrate that it is a country in line with what Europe and the world are,' said Cristiano Giraldi, the father of two 10-year-old children born from a surrogate mother in the U.S. The Catholic Church has strongly opposed surrogacy in Italy and abroad, with Pope Francis calling for a universal ban and criticizing what he called the 'commercialization' of pregnancy. At the same time, the Vatican’s doctrine office has made clear that same-sex parents who resort to surrogacy can have their children baptized. While commercial surrogacy contracts are common in the U.S. — including protections for mothers, guarantees of independent legal representation and medical coverage — they are banned in parts of Europe including Spain and Italy.	https://apnews.com/article/italy-surrogacy-pregnancy-overseas-ban-lgbtq-3f1181480a71a01166b38540e7c25103	2024-10-16T10:08:22-07:00	
A German in charge of England? Nationality matters less than it used to in international soccer	The question was inevitable. At his first news conference as England’s newly appointed head coach, Thomas Tuchel – a German – was asked on Wednesday what message he had for fans who would have preferred an Englishman in charge of their beloved national team. 'I’m sorry, I just have a German passport,' he said, laughing, and went on to profess his love for English football and the country itself. 'I will do everything to show respect to this role and to this country.' The soccer rivalry between England and Germany runs deep and it’s likely Tuchel’s passport will be used against him if he doesn’t deliver results for a nation that hasn’t lifted a men’s trophy since 1966. But his appointment as England’s third foreign coach shows that, increasingly, even the top countries in the sport are abandoning the long-held belief that the national team must be led by one of their own. Four of the top nine teams in the FIFA world rankings now have foreign coaches. Even in Germany, a four-time World Cup winner which has never had a foreign coach, candidates such as Dutchman Louis van Gaal and Austrian Oliver Glasner were considered serious contenders for the top job before the country’s soccer federation last year settled on Julian Nagelsmann, who is German. 'The coaching methods are universal and there for everyone to apply,' said German soccer researcher and author Christoph Wagner, whose recent book 'Crossing the Line?' historically addresses Anglo-German rivalry. 'It’s more the personality that counts and not the nationality. You could be a great coach, and work with a group of players who aren’t perceptive enough to get your methods.' Not everyone agrees. English soccer author and journalist Jonathan Wilson said it was 'an admission of failure' for a major soccer nation to have a coach from a different country. 'Personally, I think it should be the best of one country versus the best of another country, and that would probably extend to coaches as well as players,' said Wilson, whose books include 'Inverting The Pyramid: The History of Football Tactics.' 'To say we can’t find anyone in our country who is good enough to coach our players,' he said, 'I think there is something slightly embarrassing, slightly distasteful about that.' That sentiment was echoed by British tabloid The Daily Mail, which reported on Tuchel’s appointment with the provocative headline 'A Dark Day for England.' While foreign coaches are often found in smaller countries and those further down the world rankings, they are still a rarity among the traditional powers of the game. Italy, another four-time world champion, has only had Italians in charge. All of Spain’s coaches in its modern-day history have been Spanish nationals. Five-time World Cup winner Brazil has had only Brazilians in charge since 1965, and two-time world champion France only Frenchmen since 1975. And it remains the case that every World Cup-winning team, since the first tournament in 1930, has been coached by a native of that country. The situation is similar for the women’s World Cup, which has never been won by a team with a foreign coach, though Jill Ellis, who led the U.S. to two trophies, is a naturalized U.S. citizen born in England. Some coaches have made a career out of jumping from one national team to the next. Lars Lagerbäck, 76, coached his native Sweden between 2000-09 and went on to lead the national teams of Nigeria, Iceland and Norway. 'I couldn’t say I felt any big difference,' Lagerbäck told The Associated Press. 'I felt they were my teams and the people’s teams.' For Lagerbäck, the obvious disadvantages of coaching a foreign country were any language difficulties and having to adapt to a new culture, which he particularly felt during his brief time with Nigeria in 2010 when he led the African country at the World Cup. Otherwise, he said, 'it depends on the results' — and Lagerbäck is remembered with fondness in Iceland, especially, after leading the country to Euro 2016 for its first ever international tournament, where it knocked out England in the round of 16. Lagerbäck pointed to the strong education and sheer number of coaches available in soccer powers like Spain and Italy to explain why they haven’t needed to turn to an overseas coach. At this year’s European Championship, five of the coaches were from Italy and the winning coach was Luis de la Fuente, who was promoted to Spain’s senior team after being in charge of the youth teams. Portugal for the first time looked outside its own borders or Brazil, with which it has historical ties, when it appointed Spaniard Roberto Martinez as national team coach last year. Also last year, Brazil tried — and ultimately failed — to court Real Madrid’s Italian coach Carlo Ancelotti, with Brazilian soccer federation president Ednaldo Rodrigues saying: 'It doesn’t matter if it’s a foreigner or a Brazilian, there’s no prejudice about the nationality.' The United States has had a long list of foreign coaches before Mauricio Pochettino, the Argentine former Chelsea manager who took over as the men’s head coach this year. The English Football Association certainly had no qualms making Tuchel the national team’s third foreign-born coach, after Swede Sven-Goran Eriksson (2001-06) and Italian Fabio Capello (2008-12), simply believing he was the best available coach on the market. Unlike Eriksson and Capello, Tuchel at least had previous experience of working in English soccer — he won the Champions League in an 18-month spell with Chelsea — and he also speaks better English. That won’t satisfy all the nay-sayers, though. 'Hopefully I can convince them and show them and prove to them that I’m proud to be the English manager,' Tuchel said. ___ AP Sports Writer Jerome Pugmire in Paris contributed to this story. ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer	https://apnews.com/article/tuchel-foreign-coaches-445022a9a692846545bb3ccdae6a9b93	2024-10-16T10:04:30-07:00	
A Palestinian student was asleep in his tent at a hospital when an Israeli strike brought an inferno	DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Shaban al-Dalu was sleeping in his tent in a central Gaza hospital's courtyard, still recuperating from wounds from an Israeli strike on a mosque a week earlier, when a new strike hit, setting off an inferno. The 19-year-old university student and his 38-year-old mother, Alaa al-Dalu, were among five people killed as the blaze ripped through a tent camp sheltering hundreds of Palestinian families in the courtyard of the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in the central city of Deir al-Balah. Dozens of others, including children, were severely burned. Al-Dalu and his mother were sleeping in the tent along with his father and three siblings when the strike hit at around 1:30 a.m. on Monday. Mohammed al-Dalu, his fifth sibling, was sleeping nearby at his vendor's table when the explosion jolted him awake. He found his father and uncle, who lived in a neighboring tent, struggling to pull their families out of the fire The father, Ahmed al-Dalu, said he managed to rescue two of his sons and his daughter, but not his wife or eldest child, Shaban. 'My son was being burned in front of me,' he said, speaking at the hospital with burns on his face. 'I accepted the will of God in every sense of the word.' The Israeli military said it targeted militants hiding out among the displaced, without providing evidence to support its claim. It was the 7th Israeli attack on this hospital compound since March; three of them occurred in September, according to Doctors without Borders, which supports the hospital. The war began when Hamas attacked southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250 hostages. Israel’s retaliatory offensive has killed over 42,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which says women and children make up more than half the fatalities. It has displaced more than 1.9 million of Gaza's 2.3 million people. Over the course of the war, the military has repeatedly raided hospitals and struck crowded shelters and tent camps, alleging that Hamas fighters were using them as staging grounds for attacks, without showing evidence. Monday's strike brought chaos at Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital, as firefighters and displaced people attempted for hours to put out the blaze, using small fire extinguishers and buckets of water. Several secondary explosions went off, but their cause was not known. The courtyard was left covered in burned-out wreckage of shed and tents, made of wood and plastic sheets, with people's belongings inside. 'It’s a scene of devastation. Tents caught on fire while people were sleeping,' said Eliza Sabatini, a nurse with Doctors Without Borders who was working at the hospital. More than 60 people, including 10 children and 8 women, were wounded, most suffering severe burns. One man sobbed as he carried a toddler with a bandaged head in his arms. Another small child with a bandaged leg was given a blood transfusion on the floor of the packed Nasser Hospital in southern Gaza, where many wounded were rushed. Shaban al-Dalu, who would have turned 20 on Wednesday, memorized the Quran when he was young and cared for his siblings. A university student studying computer science, he would post videos on social media telling people his family’s displacement stories and his dream of leaving Gaza. In a video posted in March, filmed from their tent in the hospital's courtyard, he said his family fled their home in Gaza City's Rimal neighborhood just after the war began in October last year. Since then, he said, they had moved five times to escape fighting. 'We live in a very hard circumstance,' he said in the video. He launched an online fundraiser hoping to make enough money to get his family to Egypt. By Wednesday, it had raised more than $24,200 — though no one has been been able to leave Gaza since Israeli troops seized the crossing with Egypt in May. 'I used to have big dreams, but the war has ruined them,' he wrote on his GoFundMe page. 'Time feels like it’s stopped in Gaza, and we’re stuck in a never-ending nightmare.' On Oct. 6, he was reciting the Quran in a mosque near the hospital when an Israeli airstrike hit the place of worship, his brother Mohammed said. Shaban suffered a head wound that required 11 stitches and was still recuperating in the tent when Monday's strike hit. Shaban's father and the three siblings in the tent have all been left severely burned, some up to 70% of their body, Mohammed said. The body of his 11-year-old brother Adbel-Rahman is completely covered in bandages, and his sister's back and the left side of her face were badly burned, he said. Shaban's uncle, Abdel-Hayy al-Dalu, recalled how the families had thought they were safe when they arrived at the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital. 'We built tents - me and my brother - and sheltered here,' he said. 'We ruled out that it will be bombed since it’s a hospital.' After rescuing his wife and two daughters, Abdel-Hayy rushed to his brother’s tent, hoping to save his nephew and sister-in-law. 'We couldn’t help them,' he said. 'We were helpless.'	https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-gaza-860f97a1fdab484aaec3a2a66ad39b5e	2024-10-16T09:45:04-07:00	
NATO shows no sign of letting Ukraine join soon and wants more details about its 'victory plan'	BRUSSELS (AP) — NATO showed no sign Wednesday it would invite Ukraine to join anytime soon as allies sought more information from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy about his 'victory plan' for ending the war with Russia. The plan centers on a request for NATO to move forward on the 'accelerated' membership application that Zelenskyy made two years ago to seek protection under the military alliance's security umbrella after Russia launched its full-scale invasion. NATO’s credibility is based on its collective security guarantee, Article 5 of its founding treaty. It’s a commitment by all 32 member countries to come to the aid of any member whose sovereignty or territory might be under attack. However, it does not apply to a partner country like Ukraine. NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte declined to welcome the 'victory plan,' saying only that he and the allies 'take note' of it. He did not discuss when Ukraine might join the world’s biggest military alliance, beyond insisting that it would become a member. 'The plan has many aspects and many political and military issues we really need to hammer out with the Ukrainians to understand what is behind it, to see what we can do, what we cannot do,' Rutte said in his muted response at NATO headquarters in Brussels. 'We are in close contact with allies, with Ukraine, to see how we can take next steps,' he added. He declined to provide details about what more NATO wants to know, telling reporters only: 'I cannot give you all the insights about that.' For now, Rutte said, the focus must be on helping Ukraine to win back more territory and strengthen its hand for any future peace negotiations. Zelenskyy is due to explain elements of his plan on Thursday to leaders of the European Union, most of whom also stand among NATO's ranks. It all comes at a dark time for Ukraine. Its troops are struggling to hold off better manned and equipped Russian forces, especially in the eastern Donetsk region where they are gradually being pushed back. Kyiv is surviving with Western help, but Ukraine says it is coming too slowly. While outlining his plan on Wednesday, Zelenskyy told Ukrainian lawmakers that granting the country a NATO invitation would be a 'testament of (allies’) determination' to support its efforts. 'An invitation is a strong decision that requires nothing but determination,' he said. Ukraine’s future in NATO is something the alliance has weighed for 16 years. At their summit in Washington in July, the 32 members declared Ukraine on an 'irreversible' path to membership. To the uninitiated, however, little seems to have progressed since NATO leaders promised Ukraine and Georgia in 2008 that 'these countries will become members of NATO' one day. For now, NATO is in a holding pattern. Its biggest and most powerful member, the United States, is facing a presidential election. European allies expect little movement on Ukraine until a new president takes office in January. Beyond that, the United States and European heavyweight Germany remain deeply concerned about being dragged into a wider war with nuclear-armed Russia, and they lead a group of countries that oppose allowing Ukraine to join NATO until the conflict ends. In any case, NATO diplomats said, Ukraine’s borders would need to be clearly demarcated before it could join so that there can be no mistaking where the Article 5 guarantee would come into effect. Russian troops have seized about 20% of the country.	https://apnews.com/article/nato-ukraine-membership-russia-7a27716d4838edf2c0ff6d97df50478d	2024-10-16T08:41:05-07:00	
Europe's Airbus to lay off 2,500 as it tries to turn around its space and defense division	European aircraft maker and Boeing rival Airbus said Wednesday that it was laying off 2,500 workers as it tries to turnaround its struggling defense and space division. Airbus said it would implement other organizational changes as it faces ongoing challenges in the defense and space sector, including disrupted supply chains, the rapid evolution of warfare tactics and increasing costs. The announcement comes after the company had already begun making organizational changes in the division last year, which it said have begun 'bearing fruit.' 'We want to shape the division so it can act as a leading and competitive player in this ever-evolving market,' said Mike Schoellhorn, the CEO of Airbus's defense and space division. 'This requires us to become faster, leaner and more competitive.' The company's defense and space business struggled last year, notably taking a 477 million euro ($511 million) loss on the long-troubled A400M military transport plane, in part linked to unusually high inflation. The European space sector also was hit by the loss of access to Russia’s Soyuz rocket launchers and the failure of a new Vega-C rocket soon after takeoff from French Guiana in late 2022. Outside of that division, business has been booming for the aerospace giant. Airbus has outpaced Boeing for five straight years in plane orders and deliveries and its profits have soared. The bigger problem for Airbus has been keeping up with demand for commercial airplanes. As of June, the French manufacturer had an order backlog of 8,585 commercial aircraft. Meanwhile, Boeing can't seem to right its ship. At the beginning of the year, Boeing seemed finally to be recovering from two crashes of Max jets in 2018 and 2019 that killed 346 people in Indonesia and Ethiopia. Then, on Jan. 5, a door plug blew out of an Alaska Airlines 737 Max 9, and the Virginia company has been reeling ever since. Boeing has since slowed manufacturing at the order of the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration. It lost $355 million in the first quarter because of a decline in aircraft deliveries and compensation it paid to airlines for a temporary grounding of Max 9s. The Max was Boeing’s answer to Airbus’ A320 family of planes. Airbus employs more than 150,000 people worldwide, according to FactSet.	https://apnews.com/article/airbus-layoffs-defense-space-boeing-0f2090d5bdde75c4e85e7d48f55e5b31	2024-10-16T08:19:15-07:00	
Biden to travel to Germany this week, Angola in December for visits delayed by Hurricane Milton	WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden is heading to Germany Thursday and will visit Angola the first week in December, rescheduling visits that were postponed so he could remain in Washington to monitor the federal response to Hurricane Milton as it struck Florida. The White House confirmed Biden will depart for his quick trip to Berlin on Thursday. It will offer him the opportunity to huddle with his key ally, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, about their countries' support for Ukraine in its war with Russia as the conflict is at another critical moment. Biden's initial itinerary for the postponed trip included a meeting on the war in Ukraine with allied nations at an American military base in Germany before he was to continue on to Angola. The White House says that the gathering of representatives of the allied nations, partners in the Ukraine Defense Contact Group, will instead take place virtually next month. Still, the war in Ukraine will loom large during Biden's time in Berlin this week. Biden spoke by phone Wednesday with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, but they will not meet while the president is in Germany. The two leaders discussed Zelenskyy's 'victory plan,' shortly after the Ukrainian leader presented it to his parliament . Zelenskyy is scheduled to present the five-point plan to the European Council on Thursday. Zelenskyy had previously spoken to Biden about the proposal. The plan includes an invitation for Ukraine to join NATO and permission to use Western-supplied longer-range missiles to strike military targets deep inside Russian territory — steps that have been met with reluctance by Kyiv’s allies so far. The White House on Wednesday declined to comment about the plan. 'We’re going to let the Ukrainians speak to their victory plan,' White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters. 'What we’re going to continue to do is show our support for the Ukrainians on the battlefield as they continue to beat back Russia.' Zelenskyy said in a statement following the call he also spoke to Biden about the U.S. and Ukraine potentially exploring ways to produce weapons together. The Biden administration also announced a further $425 million in military assistance to Ukraine, bringing its total to more than $64 billion in the two and a half years since Russia’s invasion. Wednesday’s package includes surface-to-air missiles to protect Ukrainian infrastructure from Russian attacks and long range rockets and artillery to help its war effort. Biden and Scholz recently spoke by phone to discuss the need for the countries to 'continue our strong collaboration on geopolitical priorities, including supporting Ukraine’s defense against Russian aggression,' according to the White House. Jean-Pierre said the trip was important to Biden, in part because of Germany's help with a complicated hostage swap with Russia. 'The president really wanted to make sure to go to Germany to thank Chancellor Scholz directly,' she said. Scholz in a speech before the German parliament on Wednesday said he was looking forward to Biden's visit. 'I would like to say that … President Biden stands for an incredible improvement in cooperation over recent years,' said Scholz, adding that he was grateful for the 'good collaboration' forged with the Democratic president. There's a significant measure of anxiety in Europe about what next month's U.S. presidential election could mean for Ukraine. Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee, has been in lockstep with Biden about the need to maintain robust economic and military support for Ukraine. Republican Donald Trump has said he would move to quickly to end the war the war with Russia should he regain the White House. Trump's running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, has said that the plan would include establishing a 'demilitarized zone' and that Ukraine would not reclaim territory that Russia occupies and would agree not to join NATO. Scholz has been one of Biden's closest global allies. In addition to his robust support for Ukraine, Scholz played a critical role in helping free Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, corporate security executive Paul Whelan, and others from Russian prisons in a multinational prisoner swap. As part of the biggest prisoner exchange in post-Soviet history, Scholz agreed to release Vadim Krasikov, a Russian who was convicted of the 2019 murder of a 40-year-old Georgian citizen who had fought Russian troops in Chechnya and later claimed asylum in Germany. Biden has not visited Africa since taking office in early 2021. Jean-Pierre said the coming visit to Luanda aims to 'recognize Angola’s role as a strategic partner and regional leader, and discuss increased collaboration on security, health, and economic partnerships.' ___ AP writers Geir Moulson in Berlin and Colleen Long in Washington contributed.	https://apnews.com/article/biden-germany-scholz-ukraine-angola-hurricane-milton-122b839208dce251e530b4e3d5156396	2024-10-16T07:42:24-07:00	
Cate Blanchett wants you to laugh at politics in ‘Rumours’	NEW YORK (AP) — You’d be hard pressed to find an upcoming film weirder than 'Rumours.' The biting commentary on the emptiness of political statements and the performances politicians put on starts off as a straight political satire focusing on the G7 world leaders, but then slips into a world of slow-yet-terrifying zombies; a mysterious, giant brain found in the middle of a forest with unexplained origins; and an AI chatbot bent on sexual entrapment. It goes from provocative to absurd within a few short scenes, with the G7 leaders no longer the subject of criticism, but the butt of the joke. And that’s kind of the whole point, according to its star and executive producer, Cate Blanchett. 'We’re all in such a state of heightened anxiety and fear with what’s going on with climate, what’s going on with the global political situation. We feel like we’re on the precipice of a world war and there’s a lot of people in positions of power who seem to be relishing that moment,' Blanchett told The Associated Press. She plays a fictional chancellor of Germany named Hilda Orlmann, the host of the conference who's more focused on optics than action. 'I think the audience will come to it with a need for some kind of catharsis. And because the film is ridiculous and terrifying ... I think they’ll be able to laugh at the absurdity of the situation we found ourselves in. I think it’s a very generous film in that way,' she said. The three directors, Guy Maddin and brothers Evan and Galen Johnson, said they wanted the film to feel like it had a 'generic wash of political disrespect' and to include some resonant critiques, but they didn’t want viewers to feel like they were leaving a lecture hall as they walked out of the theater. 'I’m preachy enough when I talk to people. I don’t want to make a movie that’s preachy, you know? I just favor movies that aren’t that. That just hit me with a little mystery of ... ‘What are you doing or seeing? What am I experiencing?’' Evan Johnson, who wrote the script, as well as co-directed, said. As for the more absurd plotlines, Maddin said he and his collaborators share 'a compulsion to come up with an original recipe.' And original it certainly is. In its straightforward opening act, leaders from the Group of 7 meet for their annual summit and try to draft a provisional statement for an unnamed crisis. Then, as the evening goes on and they struggle to string together a couple, meaningful sentences, they find themselves abandoned and subject to attack from 'bog people,' or well-preserved mummified bodies from thousands of years ago. Hijinks — and hilarity — ensue from there. Nikki Amuka-Bird, who plays the fictionalized British Prime Minister Cardosa Dewindt, said that while reading the script, she kept asking herself, 'What’s happening?' But the ridiculous plotline — including the apocalyptic invasion of zombie-like 'bog people' — was only part of the reason why she took on the project. 'This kind of total courage to genre splice in this way takes away any kind of apprehension or fear you might have about it because their (the directors’) tongues are firmly in their cheeks the whole time,' Amuka-Bird said. 'It’s a really imaginative exercise and it’s just fantastic to work with directors who can be that bold and take chances like that.' The cast is rounded out by a starry ensemble: Roy Dupuis is a melodramatic Canadian prime minister, Charles Dance is an American president with an inexplicable British accent, Denis Ménochet is a paranoid French president and Alicia Vikander makes an appearance as a frenetic leader from the European Commission. The title of the movie, Blanchett said, is meant to invoke the revered Fleetwood Mac album of the same name, which was made at a time when the bandmembers were reportedly 'all sleeping together and bickering and breaking up,' she said. 'What was surprising about it is you think, ‘OK, this is a film about the G7,’ but it’s like a sort of a daytime soap opera with these sort of trysts and liaisons and petty squabbles,' Blanchett said. 'It was such an unusual way to look at the mess we’re all in and the leadership that’s led us here.'	https://apnews.com/article/cate-blanchett-rumours-movie-politics-satire-guy-b87817592defdf14a839ef0a4e9c7f81	2024-10-16T07:11:23-07:00	
Q&A: Diego Luna and Gael García Bernal's 'La Máquina' explores masculinity and aging in boxing story	WEST HOLLYWOOD, Calif. (AP) — Separately, Diego Luna and Gael García Bernal are highly regarded actors. Together, they are a force to be reckoned with since starring in Alfonso Cuarón’s 2001 cult classic 'Y tu mamá también.' They have embarked on another on-screen project, co-starring in Hulu’s first Spanish-language production, 'La Máquina,' now streaming. That's 12 years after working together on the 2012 film 'Casa de Mi Padre.' 'Working with Gael is that. It’s returning to the familiar, to what has always been there,' Luna said at the series’ Los Angeles premiere. 'We’ve continued this connection and maintained it very easily.' 'La Máquina' tells the story of an aging boxer (García Bernal) whose manager and close friend (Luna) secures him one last chance at a comeback. Their final shot at victory is challenged when mysterious forces threaten the fight and life itself. The show is produced by Searchlight Television, along with Luna and García Bernal's production company El Corriente de Golfo. On set, showrunner Marco Ramirez says the synergy between Luna and García Bernal had him replacing scripted lines for the duo’s playful banter. 'They were kind of born to work together and born to riff with each other,' Ramirez said. 'I would be like, ‘This scene is fine. The writing is okay, but what they’re doing is so much better.'' Luna and García Bernal spoke with The Associated Press about how the series deals with aging and body image, as well as the role activism plays in their lives as actors and producers. The interview has been edited for clarity and brevity. AP: Your characters explore the themes of body image and aging from different points of view. Why was it important for you to share your character's perspective, and more broadly, a male perspective? LUNA: There is this monster we have to fight which is a pressure of like, ‘How do we look?’ We are on screens all the time and and we are televised 24/7. These two characters are struggling to let go and move into the next stage. It’s fascinating to create a parallel — and at the same time, make characters so different. This man, Andy, the guy that I portray, he's a guy who wishes to be seen, but he’s looking in the wrong places. It has to start from the inside, but he’s just looking at the outside — which is a metaphor for the world we’re living in, which stays on the surface so much. We’re so afraid of digging further or of going deeper. GARCÍA BERNAL: In regards to Esteban, the concept of aging comes for men in sports, particularly in boxing, in these contact sports. For women it's beauty and for men it's sports, where it kind of manifests in a very natural way. It’s incredible that at that point in your life — the athlete is finally enjoying what they're doing. You're finally starting to have fun — but that’s when the body is just not responding. It is a quite incredible process; you have your whole life in front of you but you have to step away from what you loved. You have to say goodbye — to success as well, which is really complicated. And sports is very, very cruel in that sense. AP: How do you combat that as an actor? In Hollywood, you’re in front of the camera all the time. How do you keep yourself from taking on the mindsets these characters have about aging? LUNA: We are in a very luxurious position, where what we do gets better and better with time. The characters that I can do now are the ones that I’ve been wanting to do for a long time. Just as life gets more complex, as maturity comes, your characters become more complex and interesting. There are some things I can do now that I'm a father. There's just some relations I understand much better now that I went through a long relation with my father. I lost him. Now, I have a lot to say there. The line between the professional and the personal is blurry in this journey we have — as actors or as storytellers. GARCÍA BERNAL: It is a privilege to be able to sublimate that as actors. Also, we had the fortune of growing up in very loving environments where we're not forced to think about (the negative aspects of aging). We're really far away from those concepts, but they might affect us in other ways. But there’s that moment that as friends, Diego and I have confessed to each other as friends like, ‘Man, I don’t play fútbol anymore. Why? Because I get hurt. And I cannot work if I'm—' It's a bit sad but it happens to everybody. LUNA: Now, I have to stretch in the mornings. AP: You chose to explore the dangers that journalists face in Mexico through Eiza González's character. What made you want to focus on this narrative approach? LUNA: To me, Eiza’s role is really important because it’s crucial — media plays a very important role in sports. It’s not a story about boxing, you know, but about what boxing generates in a community. Are we telling the story from the right angle? Are we really paying respect to those who dedicate their lives to sports? Inevitably, we talk about the country, and Mexico is an important subject of this TV series. What journalists are facing in Mexico is happening today and therefore it's a part of everything. AP: There's synergy to your working dynamic as producers. How do you use the platform you both have built to focus on injustices that are happening? GARCÍA BERNAL: It’s a natural part of our unspoken sort of deal with each other. It was in everything from the beginning. We were both interested in our environment, in what’s happening. And we found, in the cinema, a great way to express ourselves with complete and absolute freedom. And so we purposely always search for films that actually shed a light on all the gray areas that exist — to understand things a little bit more. LUNA: We’re part of the audience and as part of the audience, we are searching for that opportunity. The approach we have is to always be aware of that beautiful thing that happens in cinema when you find someone else’s story, when you give yourself the time, when you have the curiosity to listen and to get affected. AP: Diego, you go through a huge physical transformation with the prosthetics. What was an element for you, that last piece that helped you get fully into character as Andy? LUNA: It was the butt. Definitely. GARCÍA BERNAL: (laughs) LUNA: I was like, putting too many things (prosthetics) on the face, and suddenly the butt came in. I was like, ‘Oh, no, let’s get rid of this and this.’ We went too far and then pulled back a bit. If you see the real references we had, we basically stopped half way. It was an interesting process, an exciting one, a scary one also because, it took time to actually see it working. It wasn’t until I got a reaction from Gael and the rest that I was like, ‘Okay, I think we got it. This is working.’	https://apnews.com/article/la-maquina-gael-garcia-bernal-diego-luna-2eec1bcb2110bf20a7b76b326021079d	2024-10-16T06:44:55-07:00	
Amazon, Google make dueling nuclear investments to power data centers with clean energy	Amazon on Wednesday said that it was investing in small nuclear reactors, coming just two days after a similar announcement by Google, as both tech giants seek new sources of carbon-free electricity to meet surging demand from data centers and artificial intelligence. The plans come as the owner of the shuttered Three Mile Island nuclear power plant said last month it plans to restart the reactor so tech giant Microsoft can buy the power to supply its data centers. All three companies have been investing in solar and wind technologies, which make electricity without producing greenhouse gas emissions. Now they say they need to go further in the search for clean electricity to meet both demand and their own commitments to cut emissions. Nuclear energy is a climate solution in that its reactors don’t emit the planet-warming greenhouse gases that come from power plants that burn fossil fuels, such as oil, coal and gas. The demand for power is surging globally as buildings and vehicles electrify. People used more electricity than ever last year, placing strain on electric grids around the world. Much of the demand also comes from data centers and artificial intelligence. The International Energy Agency forecasts that data centers’ total electricity consumption could reach more than 1,000 terawatt hours in 2026, more than doubling from 2022. Estimates suggest one terawatt hour can power 70,000 homes for a year. 'AI is driving a significant increase in the amount of data centers and power that are required on the grid,' Kevin Miller, Amazon Web Services’ vice president of global data centers, told The Associated Press, adding: 'We view advanced new nuclear capacity as really key and essential.' The United States is pursuing small modular reactors, a type of nuclear reactor that can generate up to roughly one-third the amount of power of a traditional reactor. Developers say small reactors will be built faster and at a lower cost than large power reactors, scaling to fit needs of a particular location. They aim to start spinning up electricity in the early 2030s, if the Nuclear Regulatory Commission gives permission to build and operate their designs and the technology succeeds. If new, clean power isn’t added as data centers are developed, the U.S. runs the risk of 'browning the grid,' or including more power that isn't made from clean sources, said Kathryn Huff, a former U.S. assistant secretary for nuclear energy who is now an associate professor at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. The reactors are currently under development, with none currently providing power to the electric grid in the U.S. Big investors can help change that, and these announcements could be the 'inflection point' that makes scaling up this technology truly possible, Huff said. Jacopo Buongiorno, professor of nuclear science and engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, echoed that, saying the industry needs customers who value the reliability and carbon-free attributes of nuclear and are willing to pay a premium for it at first, until a number of the next-generation reactors are deployed and the cost comes down. On Monday, Google said it was signing a contract to purchase nuclear energy from multiple small modular reactors that Kairos Power, a nuclear technology company, plans to develop. The news highlights 'the technologies that we’re going to need to achieve round the clock clean energy, not only for Google but for the world,' Michael Terrell, Google's senior director of energy and climate, told the AP. With Kairos, Google said it expects to bring the first small modular reactor online by 2030, with more to come through 2035. The deal is projected to bring 500 megawatts of power to the grid. For context, Google consumed more than 24 terawatt hours of electricity last year, according to the company's annual environmental report. One terawatt is equal to 1,000,000 megawatts. Meanwhile, Amazon's announcements Wednesday included working with utility Dominion Energy to explore putting a small modular reactor near its existing North Anna nuclear power station in Virginia. It's investing in reactor developer X-energy for its early development work, and collaborating with regional utility Energy Northwest in central Washington to put four of the X-energy reactors there. Combined, the three announcements could account for more than 5,000 megawatts of power by the late 2030s with the possibility of more. All of that is still likely only a small fraction of the company’s total energy consumption, a figure that Amazon does not report publicly. New reactor designs pair well with industrial applications because they can be built on a small footprint and generate reliable power, with some able to provide high-temperature heat too, at the site, said Doug True, chief nuclear officer at the industry trade association, Nuclear Energy Institute. 'It seems like a really good fit to support those facilities, and for a lot of different applications depending upon the amount of power that’s needed by the customer,' he said. Both Amazon and Google have committed to using renewable energy to address climate change. By 2030, Google has pledged to meet net-zero emissions, and run carbon-free energy every hour of every day on every grid where it operates. It says it has already matched 100% of its global electricity consumption with renewable energy purchases on an annual basis. However, the company has fallen short on decreasing its emissions. Amazon has said it would match all of its global electricity consumption with 100% renewable energy by 2030, and recently announced it met that goal early in 2023. Though the company has matched its consumption as far as purchases of an equivalent amount of renewable energy, that does not necessarily mean it is using that to power its operations. Amazon saw its electricity emissions drop 11%, but direct emissions — known as Scope 1 — increased 7%, according to its 2023 sustainability report. The company is also targeting net zero-carbon by 2040. ___ Read more of AP’s climate coverage at http://www.apnews.com/climate-and-environment ___ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

US official warns of growing North Korean military support for Russia's war	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell said Wednesday that Washington and its allies are 'alarmed' by North Korea’s nuclear and missile threats as well as its increasing military support for Russia's war in Ukraine, but said he couldn’t confirm Ukrainian claims that Pyongyang was also sending soldiers to fight for Moscow. Campbell spoke with reporters following discussions with South Korean and Japanese counterparts on reinvigorating an international pressure campaign against North Korea, which faltered in recent years amid a deepening divide at the U.N. Security Council. Earlier on Wednesday, Washington, Seoul and Tokyo announced plans with eight Western governments to launch a new multinational team to monitor the enforcement of sanctions against North Korea. Russia in March vetoed a U.N. resolution in a move that effectively abolished monitoring by U.N. experts of Security Council sanctions against North Korea, which prompted Western accusations that Moscow was acting to shield its arms purchases from Pyongyang to fuel its war in Ukraine. Campbell said there are signs that North Korea was increasing its support of materials, including artillery and missiles, to support Russia’s war on Ukraine, which he said was 'creating further instability in Europe.' He said the U.S. was still evaluating reports that North Korea was also sending personnel. 'We are concerned by them and ... we agreed that we will continue to monitor the situation closely,' Campbell said about the claims. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has claimed that North Korea is sending military personnel to help Russia’s war effort without providing details. Ukrainian media reported earlier this month that six North Koreans were among those killed after a Ukrainian missile strike on Oct. 3. North Korea has also been making increasingly provocative threats against rival South Korea, including accusing the South of infiltrating drones to drop anti-North Korean propaganda leaflets over Pyongyang and threatening to attack the South if it happens again. North Korea also on Tuesday blew up the northern sections of unused road and rail routes that once linked it with South Korea, in a choreographed demolition aimed at demonstrating its growing anger with South Korea’s conservative government. Tensions on the Korean Peninsula have spiked since 2022 as North Korean leader Kim Jong Un used Russia’s war on Ukraine as a window to dial up his weapons testing activities and threats. Washington, Seoul and Tokyo have strengthened their combined military exercises in response and took steps to sharpen their nuclear deterrence strategies built around strategic U.S. assets. Following his talks with Campbell and Japanese Vice Foreign Minister Masataka Okano, South Korean Vice Foreign Minister Kim Hong Kyun said that the countries condemn the North’s 'intentional moves to create tensions.' 'We have agreed to maintain a solid South Korea-U.S. combined posture to respond firmly to North Korean provocations and strengthen security cooperation through close coordination between South Korea, the U.S., and Japan,' Kim said.	https://apnews.com/article/us-south-korea-north-korea-russia-ukraine-campbell-103e27e415d8253c05d60514a0dec41a	2024-10-16T02:57:42-07:00	
China's leader makes rare visit to province facing Taiwan following major war exercises	TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) — China’s President Xi Jinping made a rare visit to a province facing Taiwan following military exercises that mobilized China's navy, air force, missile force and land troops to simulate a blockade of the self-governing island democracy that Beijing claims as its own territory and threatens to annex by force. Xi did not comment on the military exercises during his visit to Fujian province, according to the official Xinhua News Agency, but his visit came on the heels of China’s dispatch of a record 125 aircraft, as well as its Liaoning aircraft carrier and ships, in large-scale military exercises surrounding Taiwan and its outlying islands Monday. Xi has largely avoided public appearances and foreign travel over the past year, but bringing Taiwan under Beijing's control remains a priority for his administration as head of the ruling Communist Party and its military, the People's Liberation Army. Taiwan’s newly elected president Lai Ching-te has been vociferously criticized by Beijing for rejecting its position that Tawian is a part of China. The drills came four days after Taiwan celebrated the founding of its government on its National Day, when Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te said in a speech that China has no right to represent Taiwan and declared his commitment to 'resist annexation or encroachment.' Taiwan was a Japanese colony before being unified with China at the end of World War II. It split away in 1949 when Chiang Kai-shek’s Nationalists fled to the island as Mao Zedong’s Communists defeated them in a civil war and took power.	https://apnews.com/article/taiwan-china-xi-jinping-visit-fujian-8957861a959469918991eaca8b773616	2024-10-16T02:20:08-07:00	
Italy approves tight budget partly funded by a levy on banks and insurers	ROME (AP) — Italy’s far-right government has approved a budget for next year of about 30 billion euros ($33 billion), which officials say will be partly funded by a levy on Italian banks and insurers. Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said late Tuesday that the government expected to raise some 3.5 billion euros from banks and insurance companies to ensure better public services, especially the country's struggling health service, and help the most vulnerable citizens. 'As we promised, there will be no new taxes for citizens,' Meloni wrote in a post on X. The 2025 budget law was agreed by ministers at a cabinet meeting late Tuesday, just in time to meet a deadline to submit the plan to the European Union. The measures still need to be approved by the Italian parliament, with a final vote expected by the end of the year. Economy and Finance minister Giancarlo Giorgetti had been under intense pressure for weeks to reconcile the need to speed up Italy’s deficit reduction — closely watched by the EU — with the government’s expensive electoral promises. 'Someone would call it an extra profit (tax), I call it a sacrifice,' Giorgetti said at a press conference on Wednesday, commenting on the new levy on banks and insurers. Government officials didn’t release details on the new financial levy. But some Italian media reported it would focus on temporarily removing deductions for lenders’ so-called deferred tax assets and increasing taxes on bankers’ stock options. The minister revisited a prior plan by the right-wing government, which has repeatedly criticized banks for gaining excessively from higher interest rates. A first attempt to tap lenders with a 40% windfall tax failed last year, after the move sparked a major selloff in Italian banking stocks, forcing the government to withdraw the plan. Vice-Premier Antonio Tajani said in a post on X that the new contribution from banks will 'not frighten the markets.' Giorgetti said on Wednesday that additional resources will also come from a 'spending review' imposed on Italian ministries, which have been asked to tighten their belts and propose spending cuts. The 2025 budget also includes permanent cuts to income tax and social contributions for middle- and low-income earners, one of Meloni's main electoral pledges. To fund the new package of measures, Italy will widen next year’s deficit to 3.3% of gross domestic product from an estimated 2.9%. Rome is under pressure to keep its accounts under control, after having being placed under special monitoring by Brussels for running deficits far in excess of the EU’s 3% limit and for not reducing its mammoth debt, now close to 3 trillion euros.	https://apnews.com/article/italy-budget-banks-insurers-levy-deficit-eu-taxes-f1535a88005a70dc9d30b25cbea9ba39	2024-10-16T02:17:02-07:00	
Students are injured in clashes with Pakistani police over reports of an on-campus rape	LAHORE, Pakistan (AP) — More than two dozen college students were injured in clashes with Pakistani police over reports of an on-campus rape of a young woman, officials said Wednesday. The students were hurt on Monday and Tuesday in the eastern city of Lahore in Punjab province after reports about the alleged rape spread on social media. Students initially protested on the campus of the private college but later gathered outside the provincial assembly, where they clashed with police. The college administration denied there was an assault, as did the young woman's parents. Sexual violence against women is common in Pakistan but is underreported because of the stigma attached to it in the conservative country. Protests about sexual violence against women are uncommon. A special committee formed by the provincial government said the alleged victim said she slipped at her home on Oct. 2 and was taken to a hospital, where she was treated until Oct. 11. It said the student was absent from college from Oct. 3 to 15. The Federal Investigation Agency said it was looking into the case, including identifying people who spread the reports on social media. Punjab's chief minister, the province's most senior official, said no rape had taken place. Maryam Nawaz, who is the niece of the current prime minister and daughter of a former prime minister, asserted that a vile and dangerous plan was hatched to mislead students. 'An incident happened and a security guard was arrested and accused of being involved,' Nawaz told a press conference on Wednesday. The Sustainable Social Development Organization said last month that there were 7,010 rape cases reported in Pakistan in 2023, almost 95% of them in Punjab. 'However, due to social stigmas in Pakistan that discourage women from getting help, there is a high chance that due to underreporting the actual number of cases may be even higher,' it said. This week's protests came less than a month after a woman said she was gang-raped when on duty during a polio vaccination drive in southern Sindh province. Police arrested three men. Her husband threw her out of the house after the reported assault, saying she had tarnished the family name.	https://apnews.com/article/pakistan-students-protest-campus-rape-lahore-241177c92924df13174f7247b73ba79d	2024-10-16T01:17:09-07:00	
More than 100 killed and 50 injured after a gasoline tanker explodes in Nigeria	ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) — More than 100 people were killed and 50 others injured in northwestern Nigeria as they tried to scoop up fuel from an overturned petrol tanker, causing the vehicle to explode in flames, the emergency services said Wednesday. The accident occurred at midnight in Jigawa state's Majiya town after the tanker driver lost control of the vehicle while traveling on a highway, local police spokesperson Lawan Adam said. Ninety-seven people were 'burned to ashes' at the scene while eight others died at the hospital, Dr. Haruna Mairiga, head of the Jigawa State Emergency Management Agency, told The Associated Press. Deadly tanker accidents are common in Nigeria, Africa’s most populous country, where traffic regulations are not strictly enforced in many places and there is a lack of alternatives such as an efficient railway system to transport cargo. It is also common for people to salvage fuel with cups and buckets to take home after such accidents. The practice has become more common amid Nigeria's soaring fuel prices, which have tripled since the start of last year as Nigeria ended costly gas subsidies. The driver involved in the latest accident had traveled about 110 kilometers (68 miles) from the neighboring Kano state, police said. Residents who heard about the accident rushed to the scene and were scooping up fuel, 'sparking a massive inferno,' police spokesman Lawan Adam said. Videos that appeared to be from the scene showed a massive fire stretching across the entire area, with what appeared to be bodies littered at the scene. Residents in Majiya town were in mourning on Wednesday morning as locals held a mass burial for the victims. Most of the bodies were unrecognizable, the emergency services said. 'If they knew (about the danger), they wouldn’t have gone to fetch (the fuel),' said Mairiga, head of the emergency services. He said emergency services only arrived at the scene several hours after the accident. 'But the incident had already happened ... those caught up (in the fire) were burned to ashes,' Mairiga said. In one of the videos, the person who recorded the clip appeared to try to mobilize others to help the victims. 'It’s burning the body!' he shouted. 'He will die ... when the vehicle explodes there will be a problem.' Resident Sani Umar told the local Channels Television how the fire 'spread so quickly that many couldn’t escape.' 'People were running in all directions, screaming for help,' Umar said. 'This is a heartbreaking moment for us all,' said state police commissioner Ahmadu Abdullahi.	https://apnews.com/article/nigeria-gasoline-tanker-explosion-7af046fdb8016e79d14744666013fbf2	2024-10-16T00:21:36-07:00	
UK inflation falls to lowest level in over 3 years, cementing expectations for another rate cut	LONDON (AP) — Inflation in the U.K. has fallen to its lowest level for more than three years, official figures showed Wednesday, a drop that has cemented market expectations that the Bank of England will lower interest rates at its next policy meeting. The Office for National Statistics said consumer prices rose 1.7% in September, down from 2.2% the previous month, largely as a result of lower air fares and petrol prices. The decline was bigger than the 1.9% analysts had anticipated, and means that inflation is below the central bank's target rate of 2% for the first time since 2021. As a result, the bank's rate-setting panel is expected to further reduce its main interest rate when it meets again in early November to 4.75% from 5%. It previously cut borrowing costs in August, the first reduction since the early days of the coronavirus pandemic in early 2020. 'A quarter-point rate cut in November is now effectively a done deal, and this report certainly makes the path to a consecutive cut in December much clearer,' said Luke Bartholomew, deputy chief economist at abrdn, formerly Aberdeen Asset Management. Central banks around the world dramatically increased borrowing costs from near zero during the coronavirus pandemic when prices started to shoot up, first as a result of supply chain issues built up and then because of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine which pushed up energy costs. As inflation rates have fallen from multi-decade highs recently, they have started cutting interest rates. The bank is widely expected to reduce borrowing costs again at its next meeting in November, especially as it will have details of the government’s budget on Oct. 30. The new Labour government has said that it needs to plug a 22 billion pound ($29 billion) hole in the public finances and has indicated that it may have to raise taxes and lower spending, which would likely weigh on the near-term outlook for the British economy and put downward pressure on inflation.	https://apnews.com/article/britain-economy-inflation-interest-rates-b1151fecc47f2ac4747dc07ba3504987	2024-10-15T21:42:16-07:00	
First Italian ship with 16 intercepted migrants docks at Albanian port to process asylum request	SHENGJIN, Albania (AP) — An Italian navy ship on Wednesday docked at the Albanian port of Shengjin to bring the first group of 16 migrants intercepted in international waters. The naval ship Libra left the port of Lampedusa on Monday with 16 men — 10 from Bangladesh and six from Egypt — who were rescued at sea after departing from Libya, a ministry spokesman said. Last week Italy formally opened two centers in Albania where it plans to process thousands of asylum-seekers outside its borders. The centers will only house adult men, while vulnerable people such as women, children, the elderly and those who are ill or victims of torture will be accommodated in Italy. Families will not be separated. Italian Ambassador to Albania Fabrizio Bucci said Friday the two centers were ready to process migrants after the opening was delayed for months to consolidate the crumbling soil at one center, in Gjader where they will be accommodated. Though the center in Gjader has capacity for 3,000 migrants, it will start with 400 and increase to 880 in a few weeks. The number of people reaching Italy along the central Mediterranean migration route from North Africa has fallen by 61% in 2024 from 2023. According to the Italian Interior Ministry, as of Oct. 15, 54,129 migrants have arrived in Italy by sea this year, compared to 138,947 by the same date last year. Under a five-year deal signed last November by Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni and her Albanian counterpart, Edi Rama, up to 3,000 migrants picked up by the Italian coast guard in international waters each month will be sheltered in Albania. They will be screened initially on board the ships that rescue them before being sent to Albania for further screening. The two centers will cost Italy 670 million euros ($730 million) over five years. The facilities are run by Italy and are under Italian jurisdiction, while Albanian guards provide external security. The first center, an area in Shengjin, 66 kilometers (40 miles) northwest of the capital, Tirana, is used for screening newcomers. While the other center, about 22 kilometers (14 miles) to its east near the former military airport in Gjader, accommodates migrants during the processing of their asylum requests. Italian officials expect the Gjader center will never be at full occupancy but that depends on the flow of migrants brought to Albania. In Albania, the migrants retain their right under international and European Union law to apply for asylum in Italy and have their claims processed there, a move expected to take a maximum of 28 days, including any appeal case, to process. Italy has agreed to welcome those who are granted asylum. Those whose applications are rejected face deportation directly from Albania. The controversial agreement to outsource the housing of asylum-seekers to a non-EU member country has been hailed by some countries that, like Italy, are suffering a heavy burden of refugees. The agreement was endorsed by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen as an example of 'out-of-box thinking' in tackling the issue of migration into the European Union. But it has been slammed by human rights groups as setting a dangerous precedent. Rama has made it clear that no other country will be able to have such centers in Albania. He said Albania felt an expression of gratitude for the tens of thousands of Albanians who were welcomed by Italy when communism fell in 1991, or support extended by Rome during the economic turmoil in 1997 and in the aftermath of the 2019 earthquake. Meloni and her right-wing allies have long demanded that European countries share more of the migration burden. She has held up the Albania agreement as an innovative solution to a problem that has vexed the EU for years. ___ Follow Llazar Semini at https://x.com/lsemini	https://apnews.com/article/italy-albania-migrants-asylum-request-centers-arrival-3dd82dfd6414f8cee84b74ca15fa0b31	2024-10-15T21:15:04-07:00	
Israel strikes southern suburbs of Beirut for the first time in nearly a week	BEIRUT (AP) — Israeli jets struck the southern suburbs of Beirut early Wednesday for the first time in six days, Lebanese state media reported. The casualty count was not yet clear. The attack comes just one day after caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati said the United States government gave him some assurances of Israel easing its strikes in the Lebanese capital. Israel says it is striking Hezbollah assets in the suburbs, where the militant group has a strong presence, but it is also a busy residential and commercial area. The Israeli military said the Wednesday strike hit a weapons warehouse under a residential building. The Israeli military posted an evacuation warning on the X platform saying it is targeting a building in the Haret Hreik neighborhood. An Associated Press photographer who witnessed the strikes said there were three in the area. The first strike was documented less than an hour after the notice. Hezbollah began firing rockets into Israel on Oct. 8 in solidarity with the Palestinian militant group Hamas, following their surprise attack on southern Israel. A year of low-level fighting escalated into all-out war last month, and has displaced some 1.2 million people in Lebanon. Elsewhere, Israeli strikes late Tuesday in the southern town of Qana killed 10 people and wounded 15 others, Lebanon’s state-run National News Agency said. Nuhad Bustanji, a spokesperson for the Lebanese Civil Defense, said one person was killed and 34 wounded, with the toll likely to rise as rescue efforts continue. It was not immediately possible to resolve the different tolls provided by authorities. Videos shared on social media showed the smoking ruins of what appears to be a building targeted in the strike with surrounding structures damaged as well. Local media said there were several strikes in the southern town Tuesday night. Qana was the site of an Israeli artillery strike on a United Nations compound that killed dozens of civilians in 1996.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-lebanon-hezbollah-news-10-16-2024-f18b2e0f5e05eb11a3c2ee29c16ed867	2024-10-15T21:10:50-07:00	
Stock market today: Asian shares track Wall St decline, as selling hits tech companies	BANGKOK (AP) — Markets were mostly lower in Asia on Wednesday after U.S. stocks pulled back from their records, dented by selling of technology and energy sector shares. Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 index fell 1.8% to 39,210.61, leading the declines, as tech stocks fell after Dutch computer chip equipment supplier ASML warned of a slower recovery in demand for semiconductors outside of the AI boom. Chip maker Tokyo Electron sank 9.8% and Lasertec Corp., which makes equipment to inspect chips, lost 13.4%. Australia's S&amp;P/ASX 200 slipped 0.2% to 8,301.80. In Seoul, the Kospi shed 0.4% to 2,622.27, while Taiwan's Taiex slipped 0.5%. India's Sensex lost 0.2%. Chinese shares mostly advanced, rebounding after recent losses. Hong Kong's Hang Seng surged 0.9% to 20,501.77, while the Shanghai Composite index gained 0.4% to 3,214.01. On Tuesday, Wall Street pulled back from its records, with the S&amp;P 500 falling 0.8% to 5,815.26, a day after setting an all-time high for the 46th time this year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0.8% to 42,740.42, and the Nasdaq composite sank 1% to 18,315.59. Exxon Mobil dropped 3%, and energy stocks fell to some of Wall Street’s sharpest losses after oil prices tumbled more than 4%. A barrel of Brent crude, the international standard, has fallen back below $75 from more than $80 last week. Crude prices have been weakening as China’s flagging economic growth raises concerns about demand for oil. At the same time, worries have receded about Israel possibly attacking Iranian oil facilities as part of its retaliation against Iran’s missile attack early this month. Iran is a major producer of crude, and a strike could upend its exports to China and elsewhere. However, oil recovered in early Wednesday trading, with benchmark U.S. crude oil up 29 cents at $70.86 per barrel. Brent crude gained 26 cents to $74.51 per barrel. Nvidia was the heaviest weight on the S&amp;P 500 and fell 4.5%. The chip company's stock is still up 166.2% for the year so far on euphoria about the profits created by the boom around artificial-intelligence technology. In reporting ASML's latest quarterly results, its CEO Christophe Fouquet said AI continues to offer strong upside potential, but 'other market segments are taking longer to recover.' ASML’s stock traded in the United States fell 16.3%. 'Anxiety has also intensified with reports that the U.S. is considering new restrictions on chip exports to specific countries, particularly targeting Nvidia and AMD, citing national security concerns,' Anderson Alves of ActivTrades said in a commentary. Traders are watching for an earnings report from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp., due Thursday. TMSC's shares fell 1.9% on Wednesday. U.S. chipmaker Wolfspeed jumped 21.3% on Tuesday, trimming its loss for the year to 68.3%, after the Biden-Harris administration announced plans to provide up to $750 million in direct funding to the company. The money will support its new silicon carbide factory in North Carolina that makes the wafers used in advanced computer chips. Charles Schwab jumped 6.1%. More customers opened brokerage accounts at the company, helping to bring its total client assets to a record $9.92 trillion. Bank of America added 0.5%, and CEO Brian Moynihan said his company benefited from higher average loans and fees for investment banking and asset management. Walgreens Boots Alliance was another winner, up 15.8%, after topping analysts’ forecasts. The drugstore chain also said it will close about 1,200 locations over the next three years as it tries to turn around its struggling U.S. business. In the bond market, trading of Treasurys resumed after a holiday on Monday, and yields sank following a weaker-than-expected report on manufacturing in New York state. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.03% from 4.10% late Friday. Early Wednesday, the dollar was trading at 149.19 Japanese yen, down from 149.22 yen.

Mexico’s ex-public security chief sentenced to 38-plus years in US for taking cartel bribes	NEW YORK (AP) — The man once heralded as the architect of Mexico’s war on drug cartels was sentenced to more than 38 years in a U.S. prison on Wednesday for taking massive bribes to aid drug traffickers. Genaro García Luna, Mexico’s former secretary of public security, was convicted by a New York jury in 2023 of taking millions of dollars in bribes to protect the violent Sinaloa cartel that he was supposedly combating. He is the highest-level Mexican government official to be convicted in the United States. At his sentencing hearing before a federal judge in Brooklyn on Wednesday, García Luna continued to maintain his innocence and said the case against him was based on false information from criminals and the Mexican government. 'I have a firm respect for the law,' he said in Spanish. 'I have not committed these crimes.' García Luna, 56, led Mexico’s federal police before he served in a cabinet-level position as the top security official from 2006 to 2012 under then-President Felipe Calderón. At the time, García Luna was hailed as an ally by the U.S. in its fight on drug trafficking. But U.S. prosecutors said that in return for millions of dollars, he provided intelligence about investigations against the cartel, information about rival gangs and the safe passage of massive quantities of drugs. After the sentencing, Calderón said via the social platform X that he respects the court's decision but he never had 'verifiable evidence' of García Luna's criminal activities. Calderón said taking on the cartels 'was one of the most difficult decisions of my life. But I would do it again, because it is the right thing to do.' Earlier outside the courthouse, a group of about 15 protesters celebrated the verdict. Some held a banner that said, in Spanish, 'Calderon did know,' while others brandished signs denouncing his political party. Prosecutors had asked for a life sentence. García Luna's lawyers had argued that he should get no more than 20 years. U.S. District Judge Brian Cogan said he wasn't moved by past accolades that García Luna received for his work in the war on drugs. 'That was your cover,' Cogan said before imposing the sentence. 'You are guilty of these crimes, sir. You can’t parade these words and say, ‘I’m police officer of the year.’' Besides the sentence of 38 years and four months, the judge imposed a $2 million fine. During the trial, photos were shown of García Luna shaking hands with former President Barack Obama and speaking with former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and former Sen. John McCain. But prosecutors said García Luna secretly advanced a drug trafficking conspiracy that resulted in the deaths of thousands of American and Mexican citizens. He ensured that drug traffickers were notified in advance of raids and sabotaged legitimate police operations aimed at apprehending cartel leaders, they said. Drug traffickers were able to ship over 1 million kilograms of cocaine through Mexico and into the United States using planes, trains, trucks and submarines while García Luna held his posts, prosecutors said. During former Sinaloa kingpin Joaquin 'El Chapo' Guzmán’s trial in the same court in 2018, a former cartel member testified that he personally delivered at least $6 million in payoffs to García Luna and that cartel members agreed to pool up to $50 million to pay for his protection. 'He enabled the cartel. He protected the cartel. He was the cartel,' Assistant U.S. Attorney Saritha Komatireddy told the judge Wednesday. García Luna enabled a corrupt system that allowed violent cartels to thrive and distribute drugs that killed multitudes of people, she added. 'It may not have been the defendant pulling the trigger, but he has blood on his hands,' Komatireddy said. Prosecutors also said García Luna plotted to undo last year's verdict by seeking to bribe or corruptly convince multiple inmates at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn to support false allegations that two government witnesses communicated via contraband cellular phones in advance of the trial. García Luna’s lawyer, Cesar de Castro, said the defense intends to appeal the sentence. He said his client is someone who 'has served his country' and has now lost his money, his reputation as well as policies he championed in Mexico. 'He has lost close to everything. All that remains is his wonderful family,' de Castro said. In Mexico, newly inaugurated President Claudia Sheinbaum briefly commented on the case Tuesday, saying: 'The big issue here is how someone who was awarded by United States agencies, who ex-President Calderón said wonderful things about his security secretary, today is prisoner in the United States because it’s shown that he was tied to drug trafficking.' García Luna’s arrest and conviction became a political cudgel that the governing party of Sheinbaum and her predecessor, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, used in this year’s Mexican presidential election against Calderón’s weakened National Action Party. They sought to paint García Luna as the poster child of corruption and Calderón as the man responsible for soaring violence from the drug war. López Obrador and now Sheinbaum turned away from direct confrontation with the cartels, instead focusing on what they consider root causes of violence, such as poverty. But the new strategy has failed to significantly lower the level of violence. López Obrador had a very different reaction in 2020 when U.S. authorities arrested former Mexican Defense Secretary Salvador Cienfuegos for allegedly colluding with a drug cartel. In that case, López Obrador accused the Drug Enforcement Administration of fabricating evidence against Cienfuegos and protested until the U.S. government dropped the charges. He was returned to Mexico, where he was promptly cleared and released. ___ Associated Press writers Fabiola Sánchez, María Verza and Christopher Sherman in Mexico City contributed.	https://apnews.com/article/genaro-garcia-luna-sentence-mexico-cartel-drugs-7be324edd8561f05c74e7437f62994df	2024-10-15T19:25:44-07:00	
A full-scale replica of Anne Frank's hidden annex is heading to New York for an exhibition	AMSTERDAM (AP) — The annex where the young Jewish diarist Anne Frank hid from Nazi occupiers during World War II is heading to New York. A full-scale replica of the rooms that form the heart of the Anne Frank House museum on one of Amsterdam's historic canals is being built in the Netherlands and will be shipped across the Atlantic for a show titled ' Anne Frank The Exhibition ' at the Center for Jewish History in Manhattan. 'For the first time in history, the Anne Frank House will present what I would call a pioneering experience outside of Amsterdam. To immerse visitors in a full-scale, meticulous recreation of the secret annex. Those rooms where Anne Frank, her parents, her sister, four other Jews, spent more than two years hiding to evade Nazi capture,' Anne Frank House director Ronald Leopold told The Associated Press in an interview detailing the upcoming exhibition. In July 1942, Anne Frank, then aged 13, her parents Otto and Edith, and her 16-year-old sister Margo went into hiding in the annex. They were joined a week later by the van Pels family — Hermann, Auguste and their 15-year-old son, Peter. Four months later, Fritz Pfeffer moved into the hiding place, also seeking to evade capture by the Netherlands' Nazi German occupiers. They stayed in the annex of rooms until they were discovered in 1944 and sent to the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration and extermination camp. Anne and her sister Margot were then moved to the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, where they both died of typhus in February 1945. Anne was 15. Her father, Otto, the only person from the annex to survive the Holocaust, published Anne's diary after the war and it became a publishing sensation around the world as a symbol of hope and resilience in the face of tyranny. Leopold said the New York exhibit promises to be 'an immersive, interactive, captivating experience' for visitors. It opens on Jan. 27, International Holocaust Remembrance Day, to mark the 80th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz. While the faithfully rebuilt annex of rooms will be the heart of the exhibit, it also will trace the history of Anne's family from their time in Germany, their move to the Netherlands and decision to go into hiding, to their discovery by Nazis, deportation, Anne's death and the postwar decision by her father to publish her diary. 'What we try to achieve with this exhibition is that people, our visitors will learn about Anne not just as a victim, but through the multifaceted lens of a life, as a teenage girl, as a writer, as a symbol of resilience and of strength. We hope that they will contemplate the context that shaped her life.' The exhibition comes at a time of rising antisemitism and anger at the devastating war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza that has now spread to the Hezbollah militia in Lebanon following the deadly Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas-led attacks in southern Israel. 'With ever fewer, fewer, survivors in our communities, with devastating antisemitism and other forms of group hatred on the rise in the U.S. but also across the world, we feel ... our responsibility as Anne Frank House has never been greater,' Leopold said. 'And this exhibition is also in part a response to that responsibility to educate people to stand against antisemitism, to stand against group hatred.' Anne's diary will not be making the transatlantic trip. 'We unfortunately will not be able to travel with the diary, writings, the notebooks and the loose sheets that Anne wrote.

Takeaways from AP's report on euthanasia, doctors and ethics in Canada	TORONTO (AP) — Canada has arguably the world's most permissive system of euthanasia — the practice of doctors and nurse practitioners killing patients with an injection of drugs at their request. Canada allows euthanasia for people who aren't terminally ill but are suffering unmanageable pain. As Canada pushes to expand euthanasia and more countries move to legalize it, health care workers here are grappling with requests from people whose pain might be alleviated by money, adequate housing or social connections. And internal data obtained exclusively by The Associated Press from Canada’s most populous province suggest a significant number of people euthanized when they are in unmanageable pain but not about to die live in Ontario’s poorest areas. Here’s a look at the main takeaways from an AP investigation into euthanasia in Canada, commonly known there as medical assistance in dying, or MAiD. Some doctors fear providing euthanasia, even in legal cases Canada allows euthanasia for people with 'irremediable suffering' from serious but nonfatal medical conditions and disabilities. After euthanasia was legalized in 2016, doctors and nurses set up email discussion groups as confidential forums to discuss potentially troubling cases, with limited patient details. They're now run by the Canadian Association of MAiD Assessors and Providers, an educational and research organization. Dozens of messages provided to the AP by a participant in the forums — on condition of anonymity, due to the confidential nature of the messages and cases — show a fraught process where medical professionals test the limits of what conditions warrant euthanasia. In one case, a middle-aged worker whose ankle and back injuries made him unable to resume his previous job told his doctor the government’s measly support was 'leaving (him) with no choice but to pursue MAiD.' His doctor told forum participants the patient met legal criteria, with severe pain, strained social relationships and inability to work. Others agreed, but the doctor hesitated because the man cited reduced government payments as a key factor — and the doctor noted fear of being portrayed in the media as having euthanized someone 'in a case where services were inadequate.' Case of homeless people spark debate Cases of homelessness appear regularly on the private forums. One doctor wrote that although his patient had a serious lung disease, his suffering was 'mostly because he is homeless, in debt and cannot tolerate the idea of (long-term care) of any kind.' A respondent questioned whether the fear of living in a nursing home was truly intolerable. Another said the prospect of 'looking at the wall or ceiling waiting to be fed … to have diapers changed' was sufficiently painful. One provider said any suggestion they should provide patients with better housing options before offering euthanasia 'seems simply unrealistic and hence, cruel,' amid a national housing crisis. Data suggest marginalized people are affected Government officials have largely refuted the idea that socially disadvantaged people are being euthanized. But in Ontario, more than three-quarters of people euthanized when their death wasn’t imminent required disability support before their death in 2023, according to data from a slideshow presentation by the province’s chief coroner, shared with AP by both a researcher and a doctor on condition of anonymity due to its sensitive nature. Of people killed when they weren’t terminally ill, nearly 29% lived in the poorest parts of Ontario, compared with 20% of the province’s general population living in the most deprived communities, the data show. The figures suggest poverty may be a factor in Canada’s nonterminal euthanasia cases. But Dr. Dirk Huyer, Ontario's chief coroner, told AP that the data was only an early analysis and 'it’s tough to know exactly what it means,' saying that his job was only to present the statistics. Poverty doesn’t appear to disproportionately affect patients with terminal diseases who are euthanized, according to the leaked data. Experts say no other country with legal euthanasia has seen a marked number of deaths in impoverished people. Overall for Ontario, the data show, nonterminal patients account for a small portion of all euthanasia cases: 116 of 4,528 deaths last year. But the presentation and discussion among Ontario officials and medical professionals show rising awareness of euthanasia deaths for social reasons. Privately, officials admit concern Canadian officials have examined worrisome cases that haven't been publicly disclosed. A document from the Ministry of the Solicitor General in Ontario sent to all euthanasia providers in the province in May noted two cases of 'lessons learned' in nonterminal cases. The document was shared with AP by a doctor on condition of anonymity because it wasn’t authorized for release. In one, a 74-year-old patient who'd suffered blood pressure, a stroke and blindness was increasingly dependent on their spouse. The patient told their doctor they were interested in euthanasia, citing deteriorating vision loss and quality of life. Among other issues identified, officials wrote the patient's euthanasia was scheduled 'based on the spouse’s preference of timing' and questioned whether 'the patient’s death was genuinely voluntary.' Canada pushes boundaries Theo Boer, professor of health care ethics at Groningen University in the Netherlands, said that unlike other countries with legal euthanasia, Canada appears to be providing it for social reasons in some cases. 'That may be what Canadians want, but they would still benefit from some honest self-reflection about what is going on,' he said. Some of that reflection is happening in the confidential providers’ forums. They’ve debated whether it’s valid to euthanize people for obesity in several cases. They've also beem divided over ending the lives of people in mourning. Canada's government said it legalized euthanasia to reduce suffering and support individual autonomy — and polls have consistently shown public approval. But its laws are now being challenged on all sides. The advocacy group Dying with Dignity filed an August lawsuit in Ontario, alleging it’s 'discriminatory' to exclude mentally ill people from euthanasia. Meanwhile, a coalition of disability-rights organizations in another lawsuit argued that euthanasia legislation has resulted in the premature deaths of people with disabilities. ____ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.

Years of war in Congo have created a dire mental health crisis. But little support is available	GOMA, Congo (AP) — For Nelly Shukuru, there was no way out. The fighting that forced her from her home, the squalid conditions in the displacement camp in eastern Congo, the hunger, all felt inescapable. The 51-year-old planned to hang herself. She said a neighbor stopped her just in time. 'In my mind, the suffering was permanent,' said the mother of six, seated in a health clinic. 'The people who have died are better off than I am.' Years of conflict in eastern Congo have created a dire mental health crisis. Aid groups say the number of people seeking care has spiked as fighting intensifies. Some of the worst affected struggle to survive in cramped, violent displacement sites that aren't conducive to recovery. The number of people who received psychosocial support in camps around the main city of Goma increased more than 200% between January and June compared to the same period last year — from 6,600 to more than 20,000 — according to aid group Action Against Hunger. The number of people reporting suicidal thoughts has jumped from about five a month at the beginning of the year to more than 120, it said. More than 100 armed groups have been vying for a foothold in mineral-rich eastern Congo near the border with Rwanda. The violence has escalated as the M23 rebel group, backed by Rwanda, has reemerged. The fighting has displaced millions. Over 600,000 shelter in camps near Goma. More people are experiencing anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder as well as insomnia and excessive alcohol and drug consumption, psychologists say. 'All around us there is war, and the number of people facing difficulty is increasing daily,' said Innocent Ntamuheza, a psychologist with Action Against Hunger. But little mental health support is available. Less than 30% of the requested $180 million for protection — which includes mental health services — in the humanitarian response plan has been funded this year, said the United Nations, which calls Congo one of the world’s most neglected crises. Shukuru said she considered killing herself in August after her drunk 21-year-old son struck her head with a rock because of a fight over a radio. Her children’s drinking had worsened since arriving in the camp because they were idle, she said. The family used to farm and attend church in their hometown of Sake but fled in February when it was bombed. Her husband, a construction worker, struggles to find jobs. The aid they receive isn't enough. Some of the camps for displaced families are less than a day's walk from the front lines. The camp where Shukuru lives was struck by shells in May that killed some 40 people and injured others, locals and aid groups said. Some armed men live among the camps' population. During a visit in August, The Associated Press saw men carrying guns and a truck of people in military fatigues drive through, chanting war songs. It wasn't clear if the people were with the military or self-defense groups. In the government's attempt to push back M23, it's been supporting militia groups under a coalition called the Wazalendo. But the groups, who previously fought government forces and each other, are accused of committing human rights abuses, locals and aid groups said. Some fighters and members of Congo's army, often stationed nearby, are also accused of sexual assault. A 38-year-old said she was raped by three armed men in a field while she was looking for food in May. The AP does not name people who have been sexually assaulted. The mother of eight has been seeking help at a clinic run by Doctors Without Borders, also known by its acronym MSF, but said she often can’t sleep at night and sees the men in her dreams. The constant presence of armed men in the camp makes it worse. 'It reminds me of the men who raped me,' she said. People relive traumatic incidents especially when it comes to rape, said Clementine Sifa, the mental health supervisor for MSF. In September, MSF said it treated an unprecedented number of survivors of sexual violence in Congo last year — more than 25,000 — with the trend continuing this year. The majority of people were treated in displacement camps in Goma. Lt. Col. Guillaume Ndjike, spokesman for Congo's army in the east, said the army is trying to protect people in the camps by conducting night patrols and setting up mobile police stations. He said armed men aren't allowed in the sites, and people accused of sexual assault or murder are apprehended and held accountable. Locals and aid workers say there is little accountability. Some aid groups are training community leaders to spot signs of people who might need mental health support and refer them to a clinic. They watch for people who are isolated, look stressed or have lost their jobs. Stigma surrounding mental health sometimes keeps people from proactively seeking it, they said. Those who have sought treatment say it's been helpful to learn ways to cope with anxiety and negative thoughts, including breathing techniques. Wrapping her arms around her chest and tapping her shoulders, Josephine Mulonda said the technique called 'butterfly hug' has helped reduce heart palpitations triggered by her husband's killing in January. The 52-year-old had depressive thoughts and worried how she would support their eight children. War Child, an organization focused on helping children in conflict, uses movement, song and play to help troubled youth express themselves. Dancing in a circle at a displacement site, children chant 'Let me cry, I’m crying.' The group also gives parents advice on listening to their children, said Isaac Rwamakuba, War Child's coordinator in Goma for emergency responses. But he said some of the most affected children lost families through death or separation. Last November, a 14-year-old was separated from her family when her town was attacked. The AP is not using her name due to the sensitivity of her situation. She is cared for by another family but fears being attacked when she walks for hours into the bush to find firewood to sell. She's considered ending her life to stop the suffering, she said. The psychological support from War Child helps at least momentarily, she said. She has no idea if her mother is alive. ___ The Associated Press receives financial support for global health and development coverage in Africa from the Gates Foundation.

Canadian doctors who provide euthanasia struggle with the ethics of killing vulnerable patients	TORONTO (AP) — A homeless man refusing long-term care, a woman with severe obesity, an injured worker given meager government assistance, and grieving new widows. All of them requested to be killed under Canada’s euthanasia system, and each sparked private debate among doctors and nurses struggling with the ethics of one of the world’s most permissive laws on the practice, according to an Associated Press investigation. As Canada pushes to expand euthanasia and more countries move to legalize it, health care workers here are grappling with requests from people whose pain might be alleviated by money, adequate housing or social connections. And internal data obtained exclusively by AP from Canada’s most populous province suggest a significant number of people euthanized when they are in unmanageable pain but not about to die live in Ontario's poorest and most deprived areas. Some doctors fear moving forward even with cases that meet Canada’s legal requirements, which allow euthanasia for people with 'irremediable suffering' from serious but nonfatal medical conditions and disabilities. On private forums, doctors and nurses have expressed deep discomfort with ending the lives of vulnerable people whose deaths were avoidable, according to messages provided to AP by a participant on condition of anonymity due to their confidentiality. Some of the requests from the forums were approved and acted upon. Others were denied. But the discourse about patients who are poor, disabled or lonely shows a fraught process where medical professionals test the limits of what conditions warrant euthanasia. The controversial cases in the forums have never been disclosed through Canada’s oversight system, even in an anonymized manner. When Canada legalized assisted dying in 2016, officials said they wanted to reduce suffering and support individual autonomy and freedom of choice — and polls have consistently shown public approval. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau promised then that safeguards would prevent vulnerable people from being euthanized 'because you’re not getting the support and care you actually need.' But experts tasked with delivering euthanasia to people who aren't dying have called it 'morally distressing' and say the legal provisions are too vague to be protective, obliging doctors and nurses to at times end the lives of people they believe might otherwise be saved. 'I don’t want (euthanasia) to become the solution to every kind of suffering out there,' a physician wrote to colleagues on one of the private forums. Euthanasia programs are increasing Canada has the world’s fastest-growing program for euthanasia, the practice of doctors and nurse practitioners killing patients with an injection of drugs at their request. Medically assisted suicide — patients themselves taking prescribed, lethal medication — also is legal. But virtually all of Canada’s MAiD cases — as it’s widely known here, for medical assistance in dying – are euthanasia, with a doctor or nurse practitioner giving the fatal injection. Unlike many other countries, Canada doesn't require that patients exhaust all medical treatments before seeking death. After legalizing euthanasia in 2016, Canada broadened its law in 2021 to allow people with incurable, but not terminal, conditions – including disability alone – to seek a way to die. This vastly expanded the number of people eligible, and medical groups in some territories and provinces require doctors to inform, offer or help provide euthanasia to any patients who might qualify. Adults with serious, incurable conditions must have a written request approved by two independent doctors or nurse practitioners. Those with nonterminal cases must be informed of other ways to relieve their suffering, among other requirements, and there’s a minimum 90-day assessment period. As the eligibility pool has grown, so has criticism among academics, disability advocacy groups and religious communities. Doctors and nurses 'do not treat MAiD as an option of last resort,' said an August report published by the Christian think tank Cardus. The nonprofit organization Inclusion Canada regularly hears from people with disabilities who are offered euthanasia, including one disabled woman whose physiotherapist suggested it when she sought help for a bruised hip, said executive vice president Krista Carr. 'Our response to the intolerable suffering of people with disabilities is: 'Your life is not worth living,’' she said. 'We'll just offer them the lethal injection, and we'll offer it readily.' Doctors privately debate euthanasia cases When euthanasia was legalized, doctors and nurse practitioners set up email discussion groups as confidential forums to discuss potentially troubling cases, with limited patient details for privacy. They're now run by the Canadian Association of MAiD Assessors and Providers. Association President Dr. Konia Trouton told AP via email that providing euthanasia for vulnerability or financial reasons alone is 'completely forbidden.' Trouton said doctors and nurse practitioners consult with one another on the forums 'to gain insights and learn from the experiences of others.' The participant who shared some of the email discussions with AP provided dozens of messages raising questions about the medical and ethical complexities of euthanasia requests from people nationwide who weren't terminally ill. A middle-aged worker whose ankle and back injuries made him unable to resume his previous job told his doctor that the government’s measly support was 'leaving (him) with no choice but to pursue MAiD.' His doctor told forum participants the patient met legal criteria, with severe pain, strained social relationships and inability to work. Others agreed and assured the doctor the man was clearly in pain. But the doctor was hesitant because the man cited reduced government payments as a key factor. Cases of homelessness appear regularly and spark some of the most heated debate. One doctor wrote that although his patient had a serious lung disease, his suffering was 'mostly because he is homeless, in debt and cannot tolerate the idea of (long-term care) of any kind.' A respondent questioned whether the fear of living in the nursing home was truly intolerable. Another said the prospect of 'looking at the wall or ceiling waiting to be fed … to have diapers changed' was sufficiently painful. The man was eventually euthanized. One provider said any suggestion they should provide patients with better housing options before offering euthanasia 'seems simply unrealistic and hence, cruel,' amid a national housing crisis. Physicians said keeping their opinions out of assessments was difficult — and painful, given patients' emotions and desperation. Experts not linked to the forums said that while doctors and nurses need private space for discussion, the lack of transparency about controversial cases is alarming. 'The question about who gets euthanasia is a societal question,' said Kasper Raus, a researcher at Ghent University’s Bioethics Institute in Belgium. 'This is a procedure that ends people’s lives, so we need to be closely monitoring any changes in who is getting it. 'If not, the entire practice could change and veer away from the reasons that we legalized euthanasia.' Data suggest marginalized people are affected Critics have long warned that Canada’s policies have led to euthanasia among disadvantaged people whose deaths weren't imminent. Despite publicized cases of people asking to be killed because of insufficient support, government officials have largely refuted the idea that socially disadvantaged people are being euthanized. But in Ontario, more than three quarters of people euthanized when their death wasn't imminent required disability support before their death in 2023, according to data from a slideshow presentation by the province’s chief coroner, shared with AP by both a researcher and a doctor on condition of anonymity due to its sensitive nature. Of people killed when they weren’t terminally ill, nearly 29% lived in the poorest parts of Ontario, compared with 20% of the province's general population living in the most deprived communities, the data show. People euthanized with nonterminal conditions were 'more likely to live in neighborhoods where there’s higher levels of residential instability, higher material deprivation and greater dependency on government support,' Ontario Chief Coroner Dr. Dirk Huyer said during his May presentation. The figures suggest poverty may be a factor in Canada’s nonterminal euthanasia cases. But Huyer told AP that the data was only an early analysis and 'it’s tough to know exactly what it means,' saying that his job was only to present the statistics. Poverty doesn't appear to disproportionately affect patients with terminal diseases who are euthanized, according to the leaked data. And experts say no other country that has legalized euthanasia has seen a marked number of deaths in impoverished people. Overall for Ontario, the data show, nonterminal patients account for a small portion of all euthanasia cases: 116 of 4,528 deaths last year. But the presentation and discussion among Ontario officials and medical professionals show rising awareness of euthanasia deaths for social reasons. Privately, officials admit concern Health Canada, the government agency responsible for national health policy, publishes yearly reports of euthanasia trends but hasn’t released any review of cases that triggered ethical concerns. Marie-Pier Burelle, a spokeswoman for Health Canada, said in an email that 'lack of access to social supports or to health services is not and would never be part of eligibility criteria' for euthanasia. Burelle cited 'stringent safeguards to affirm and protect the inherent and equal value of every person’s life.' In private, though, Canadian officials have examined worrisome cases. A document from the Ministry of the Solicitor General in Ontario sent to all euthanasia providers in the province in May noted two cases of 'lessons learned' in nonterminal cases. The document was shared with AP by a doctor on condition of anonymity because it wasn’t authorized for release. In one, a 74-year-old patient who’d suffered high blood pressure, a stroke and blindness, among other difficulties, was increasingly dependent on their spouse and 'expressed their interest in MAiD to their family physician, due to their vision impairment and loss of hope for improvement of their vision and quality of life.' The report cited three instances where legally mandated safeguards were not met. Among them: No assessor or expert versed in the nonterminal condition was involved, and efforts to discuss alternatives to death were 'limited.' The report also said the procedure was scheduled 'based on the spouse’s preference of timing.' Officials questioned whether 'the patient’s death was genuinely voluntary and free of coercion.' Independent legal experts said those breaches could constitute violations of criminal law. Some push for more reflection Polls show that expanding access to euthanasia has long been supported across Canada. But the country appears to be pushing the boundaries of what’s socially acceptable, experts say, and that could have global implications, as countries including Britain and France move towards legalization. 'Canada seems to be providing euthanasia for social reasons, when people don't have the financial means, which would be a big taboo in Europe,' said Theo Boer, professor of health care ethics at Groningen University in the Netherlands. 'That may be what Canadians want, but they would still benefit from some honest self-reflection about what is going on.' Some of that reflection is happening in the confidential providers’ forums. They’ve debated whether it’s valid to euthanize people for obesity in several cases. One woman with severe obesity described herself as a 'useless body taking up space' — she'd lost interest in activities, became socially withdrawn and said she had 'no purpose,' according to the doctor who reviewed her case. Another physician reasoned that euthanasia was warranted because obesity is 'a medical condition which is indeed grievous and irremediable.' When a health worker inquired whether anyone had euthanized patients for blindness, one provider reported four such cases. In one, they said, an elderly man who saw 'only shadows' was his wife’s caregiver when he requested euthanasia; he wanted her to die with him. The couple had several appointments with an assessor before the wife 'finally agreed' to be killed, the provider said. She died unexpectedly just days before the scheduled euthanasia. Providers on the forum were divided over ending the lives of people in mourning. One case involved a woman in her 80s who required dialysis and lost her husband, sibling and cat in a six-week period. Her assessor said her suffering and request to die were tied to her husband’s death rather than any medical conditions. Some doctors said because she lost her husband — the protective factor that would make the other losses and suffering bearable — she qualified. Others recommended grief counseling instead. A provider referenced a similar case, in which a widow requested euthanasia within weeks of her husband’s death: 'Her whole life system crashed. I felt much ease in providing for her and had no pushback from the coroner.' Dr. Ellen Wiebe, who has euthanized more than 400 people in Canada, told AP that while poverty inevitably exacerbates suffering, improved housing and social situations have never changed a patient’s mind. 'The idea that because I’m disabled, I should lose my rights that undisabled people have is outrageous,' said Wiebe, who suffers from heart disease and uses a wheelchair. She predicted legal consequences if officials introduce more safeguards for euthanasia: 'We’ll just be back in court with somebody saying, ‘You interfered with my basic human rights.’' The government already faces challenges to its euthanasia laws on all sides. The advocacy group Dying with Dignity filed an August lawsuit in Ontario, alleging it's 'discriminatory' to exclude mentally ill people from euthanasia. A coalition of disability-rights organizations in a lawsuit last month argued that euthanasia legislation has resulted in premature deaths of people with disabilities. On euthanasia forums, doctors and nurses continue to struggle with cases of patients who aren’t fatally ill, lamenting that Canada’s health and social services can seem woefully inadequate. 'I have great discomfort with the idea of MAiD being driven by social circumstances,' one provider said. 'I don’t have a good solution to social deprivation either, so I feel pretty useless when I receive requests like this.' ____ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.

In the heartland of Mexico's Sinaloa cartel, the old ways have changed and violence rages	MEXICO CITY (AP) — Cellphone chats have become death sentences in the continuing, bloody factional war inside Mexico's Sinaloa drug cartel. Cartel gunmen stop youths on the street or in their cars and demand their phones. If they find a contact who’s a member of a rival faction, a chat with a wrong word or a photo with the wrong person, the phone owner is dead. Then, they’ll go after everyone on that person's contact list, forming a potential chain of kidnapping, torture and death. That has left residents of Culiacan, the capital of Sinaloa state, afraid to even leave home at night, much less visit towns a few miles away where many have weekend retreats. 'You can’t go five minutes out of the city, ... not even in daylight,' said Ismael Bojórquez, a veteran journalist in Culiacan. 'Why? Because the narcos have set up roadblocks and they stop you and search through your cellphone.' And it’s not just your own chats: If a person is traveling in a car with others, one bad contact or chat can get the whole group kidnapped. That’s what happened to the son of a local news photographer. The 20-year-old was stopped with two other youths and something was found on one of their phones; all three disappeared. Calls were made and the photographer’s son was finally released, but the other two were never seen again. Residents of Culiacan had long been accustomed to a day or two of violence once in a while. The presence of the Sinaloa cartel is woven into everyday life there, and people knew to stay indoors when they saw the convoys of double-cab pickups racing through the streets. But never have they seen the solid month of fighting that broke out Sept. 9 between factions of the Sinaloa cartel after drug lords Ismael 'El Mayo' Zambada and Joaquín Guzmán López were apprehended in the United States after flying there in a small plane on July 25. Zambada later claimed he was kidnapped and forced aboard the plane by Guzmán López, causing a violent battle between Zambada’s faction and the 'Chapitos' group led by the sons of imprisoned drug lord Joaquin 'El Chapo' Guzmán. Residents of Culiacan are mourning their old lives, when the wheels of the local economy were greased by cartel wealth but civilians seldom suffered — unless they cut off the wrong pickup truck in traffic. Juan Carlos Ayala, an academic who studies the anthropology of the drug trade at the Autonomous University of Sinaloa, said that following the arrests of Guzmán López and Zambada in July, a new generation of younger, more flashy and cosmopolitan drug lords have taken over. They fight with extreme violence, kidnapping and cellphone tracking — not the old kind of handshake deals their elders used alongside shootouts to settle matters. 'There is a new generation of leaders of drugs and organized crime here, that has other strategies,' Ayala said. 'They see that the tactic of shootouts hasn’t worked for them, so they go for kidnapping.' 'They catch one person, and he has messages from the rival group,' said Ayala. 'So they go after him to squeeze more information, and that starts a chain of hunting, to catch the enemy.' The new tactics are reflected in the huge wave of armed carjackings in and around Culiacan. Cartel gunmen used to steal the SUVs and pickups they favor for use in cartel convoys; but now they focus on stealing smaller sedans. They use these to go undetected in their silent, deadly kidnappings. Often, the first a driver knows is when a passing car tosses out a spray of bent nails to puncture his tires. Vehicles pull up front and rear to cut him off. The driver is bundled into another car. All that is left for neighbors to find is a car with burst tires, the doors open, the engine running, in the middle of the street. The State Council on Public Safety, a civic group, estimates that in the past month there have been an average of six killings and seven disappearances or kidnappings in and around the city every day. The group said about 200 families have fled their homes in outlying communities because of the violence. Culiacan is no stranger to violence — shooting broke out across the city in October 2019 when soldiers mounted a failed attempt to arrest another of Chapo Guzmán’s sons, Ovidio. Fourteen people were killed that day. A few days later, civic activist Estefanía López arranged a peace march and 4,000 residents turned out for it. When she tried to do something similar this year, she could get only about 1,500 people to attend a similar demonstration. 'We got a lot of messages beforehand from a lot of people who said they wanted to join and march, to support the cause, but who were afraid to come,' López said. There’s reason to be afraid: Last week, gunmen burst into a Culiacan hospital to kill a patient previously wounded by gunshots. In a town north of Culiacan, drivers were astonished to see a military helicopter seeking to corral four gunmen in helmets and tactical vests just yards from a highway; the gunmen were shooting back at the chopper. The government’s response to all this has been to blame the United States for stirring up trouble by allowing the drug lords to turn themselves in, and to send in hundreds of army troops. But irregular urban combat in the heart of a city of 1 million inhabitants — against a cartel that has lots of .50-caliber sniper rifles and machine guns — is not the army’s specialty. Squads of soldiers went into a luxury apartment complex in the city’s center to detain a suspect and they wound up shooting to death a young lawyer who was merely a bystander. López, the peace activist, has been asking for soldiers and police to be posted outside schools, so children can return to classes — most are currently taking classes online because their parents judge it too dangerous to take them to school. But police can’t solve the problem: Culiacan’s entire municipal force has been temporarily disarmed by soldiers to check their guns, something that’s been done in the past when the army suspects policemen are working for drug cartels. The local army commander recently acknowledged that it's up to the cartel factions — not authorities — when the violence will stop. 'In Culiacan, there is not even faith anymore that we will be safe, with police or soldiers,' López said, noting that that has had a clear effect on daily life and the economy. 'A lot of businesses, restaurants and nightclubs have been closed for the past month.' Laura Guzmán, the leader of the local restaurant chamber, said about 180 businesses in Culiacan have closed, permanently or temporarily, since Sept. 9 and almost 2,000 jobs have been lost. Local businesses tried to organize evening 'tardeadas' — long afternoons — for residents who were afraid to go out after dark, but they didn’t draw enough customers. 'Young people are not interested in going out right now,' Guzmán said. For those looking to get away from the violence temporarily, the seaside resort of Mazatlan used to be only 2½ hours away by car. But that’s not an option since last month when cartel gunmen hijacked passenger buses, forced the tourists off and burned the vehicles to block the road to Mazatlan.

Zelenskyy to unveil 'victory plan' to Ukrainian lawmakers after presenting it to Western allies	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was set to at least partially unveil a plan to win the war against Russia to his country's Parliament on Wednesday after weeks of dropping hints about the blueprint to lukewarm Western allies, including U.S. President Joe Biden. The plan — comprising military, political, diplomatic and economic elements — is considered by many as Ukraine’s last resort to strengthen its hand in any future cease-fire negotiations with Russia. Thus far, however, no country has publicly endorsed it or commented on its feasibility. Zelenskyy is keen to get the 'victory plan' in place before a new U.S. president is sworn in next year, though Ukrainian officials say neither presidential candidate will necessarily improve Kyiv’s standing in the war. Zelenskyy’s presentation to Parliament, announced on Monday by presidential adviser Serhii Leshchenko, comes during a bleak moment in Ukraine. The country’s military is suffering losses along the eastern front as Russian forces inch closer to a strategically significant victory near the crucial logistics hub of Pokrovsk. At every turn, Kyiv is outnumbered by Moscow: The country is struggling to replenish ranks with an unpopular mobilization drive; its ammunition stocks are limited; and Russia’s superiority in the skies is wreaking havoc for Ukrainian defensive lines. It’s not clear how much of his victory plan Zelenskyy will reveal on Wednesday; Leshchenko indicated that it would be fully unveiled, while other officials suggested that the president would not divulge its most sensitive elements to all lawmakers. Either way, the plan essentially puts Kyiv’s future in the hands of its allies. Without it, any deal with Russia would almost certainly be unfavorable for Ukraine, which has lost a fifth of its territory and tens of thousands of lives in the conflict. Kyiv would be unlikely to ever recover occupied territory, or receive reparations for widespread destruction across the country. Several elements of the plan have already come to light: making Ukraine a member of NATO; allowing the country to use Western long-range weapons to strike deep inside Russia; providing resources to strengthen Ukraine's air and other defenses, and intensifying sanctions against Russia. Ukraine's surprise military incursion into Russia’s Kursk region in August was also part of the plan, Zelenskyy told reporters. He said the 1,000 square kilometers (386 square miles) of territory captured by Ukraine — along with other provisions of the plan — will likely serve as a bargaining chip in negotiations with Russia. NATO’s Article 5 states that an attack against one member is considered an attack against all. Ukraine's inclusion in the alliance would deter Russian President Vladimir Putin from invading again, Ukrainian officials argue. Western leaders have so far been reluctant to guarantee an invitation, fearing escalation from Putin. Ukrainian officials were expecting feedback from Western allies at a meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group at Ramstein Air Base in Germany, during which defense leaders from 50-plus partner nations gather to coordinate weapons aid for the war. Scheduled for this past weekend, the summit was postponed after Biden canceled his attendance in response to Hurricane Milton in the U.S. Zelenskyy has since toured Western capitals to present other key allies an outline of his vision. But none so far have given any indication they will support the plan. Some expressed concerns over the tight deadline set by Zelenskyy, who gave allies just three months to adopt the blueprint’s main tenets in late September. Thus far, the U.S. has been Kyiv’s main backer during the two-and-a-half-year war. But Biden has balked at the request to use long-range weapons to strike specific targets inside Russia, fearing a possible escalation in the war. Meanwhile, an intensifying conflict in the Middle East between Israel and Hezbollah that risks embroiling Iran has diverted Washington’s attention. Many expect Democratic nominee and Vice President Kamala Harris to continue Biden’s policy and maintain the status quo. Under Biden, U.S. assistance to Kyiv, though substantial, has consistently arrived too late to make a significant difference for Ukrainian forces. Republican nominee and former President Donald Trump has only said that he’d end the war quickly, without saying how. Meanwhile, Brazil and China have proposed alternate peace plans that Zelenskyy has rejected, saying they would merely pause the war and give Moscow time to consolidate its battered army and defense industry. ___ Follow AP's coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine	https://apnews.com/article/ukraine-victory-plan-unveiled-zelenskyy-parliament-f3525550f6986f590777193a7385c0c5	2024-10-15T19:03:35-07:00

An inmate convicted of the 1994 killing of a Japanese psychic was found dead in a Hawaii prison cell	HONOLULU (AP) — A Hawaii inmate convicted of the 1994 murder of a Japanese psychic and her son was killed in prison, authorities said. Staff at the Halawa Correctional Facility in Honolulu found Raita Fukusaku, 59, bleeding on the floor of his cell with head and neck trauma early Monday, according to the state Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. 'It was determined that the victim had been assaulted and stabbed by his cellmate, a 38-year-old male,' Honolulu police said in a public information bulletin. The cellmate was immediately removed and placed in a holding unit, the corrections department said. Authorities were still investigating Tuesday. The Honolulu medical examiner's office had not yet released a cause of death. Fukusaku was the first Japanese national to be extradited to the United States and convicted of murder, Hawaii News Now reported. He was serving a prison sentence for two counts of second-degree murder. He was found guilty in 1995 of killing Kototome Fujita and her son Goro Fujita, according to KITV, which reported that Kototome Fujita was found shot in her penthouse and that her son was found dead in his car in a parking structure of a Waikiki hotel. The condo unit and Goro Fujita's car were set on fire. Myles Breiner, Fukusaku's former attorney, told KHON-TV he never had any problems in the 30 years he's been in prison. 'He wasn’t gang-related, he seemed to rise above all that. He got along with all the staff,' Breiner said. 'I’m not satisfied with the fact that this occurred. This should not have occurred.'	https://apnews.com/article/hawaii-inmate-murder-japan-psychic-2d58d6c2fbb8b2053138f4e79b04a235	2024-10-15T14:04:29-07:00	
Japan’s Toho acquires North American animation company GKIDS, Studio Ghibli's US steward	The Japanese entertainment giant Toho has reached an agreement to acquire the Oscar-winning animation outfit GKIDS, the companies said Tuesday. The deal gives Toho an established North American distributor and sales operation in GKIDS, which has become a force in animation since its founding in 2008. As producer and distributor of artist-driven animation, GKIDS has brought acclaimed films like 'Song of the Sea,' 'The Breadwinner' and 'Wolfwalkers' to North American audiences and operated as the domestic stewards of the Studio Ghibli catalog. After 13 best animated feature Oscar nominations, GKIDS won the award earlier this year for Hayao Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli’s 'The Boy and the Heron.' Toho, meanwhile, is home to internationally recognized brands, from Godzilla to popular anime franchises like 'My Hero Academia' and 'Jujutsu Kaisen.' The company is hoping to grow and expand outside of Japan and had already worked with GKIDS for years, on releases like 'Weathering With You' and 'Spirited Away: Live on Stage.' Toho president and CEO Hiro Matsuoka said in a statement that GKIDS’ unique position in the U.S. market, 'dovetails perfectly with Toho’s own strengths and strategic mission. This partnership accelerates Toho’s goals to prioritize animation, develop international markets, and support IP creation, while bringing exceptional Japanese and animated content to global audiences.' GKIDS founder Eric Beckman will remain CEO, and Dave Jesteadt will stay president. Both said that the company will continue to operate as they have, 'but now with the backing of a highly complementary and legendary parent company.' The financial terms were not disclosed.	https://apnews.com/article/toho-acquires-gkids-f9fdd050059e585560aaf647d78fac86	2024-10-15T12:14:04-07:00	
Trump says it would be a 'smart thing' if he spoke to Putin, though he won't confirm he has	CHICAGO (AP) — Former President Donald Trump on Tuesday refused to say whether he's spoken with Russian President Vladimir Putin since leaving office, as reported in journalist Bob Woodward's latest book. But if the two did speak, Trump said, it would be 'a smart thing' for the United States. Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, was pressed on his communication with the Russian president during a wide-ranging — and sometimes contentious — interview with Bloomberg editor-in-chief John Micklethwait at the Economic Club of Chicago. Woodward reports in his book 'War' that Trump has had as many as seven private phone calls with Putin since leaving the White House and secretly sent the Russian president COVID-19 test machines during the height of the pandemic. A Trump campaign spokesperson previously denied the report. During Tuesday's interview, Micklethwait posed the question to Trump directly: 'Can you say yes or no whether you have talked to Vladimir Putin since you stopped being president? 'I don’t comment on that,' Trump responded. 'But I will tell you that if I did, it’s a smart thing. If I’m friendly with people, if I can have a relationship with people, that’s a good thing and not a bad thing in terms of a country.' Trump said that Putin, who invaded neighboring Ukraine and who has been accused of war crimes by the International Criminal Court, is well respected in Russia and touted his relationship with him, as well as the authoritarian leaders of North Korea and China. 'Look, I had a very good relationship with President Xi and a very good relationship with Putin, and a very good relationship with Kim Jong Un,' he said. Of Putin, he later added, 'Russia has never had a president that they respect so much.' Woodward reported that Trump asked an aide to leave his office at his Florida resort, Mar-a-Lago, so that the former president could have a private call with Putin in early 2024. The aide, whom Woodward doesn’t name, said there have been multiple calls between Trump and Putin since Trump left office, perhaps as many as seven, according to the book, though it does not detail what they discussed. Trump spokesperson Steven Cheung called the reporting false. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said the reporting about the calls was 'not true.' Trump’s relationship with Putin has been scrutinized since his 2016 campaign for president, when he memorably called on Russia to find and make public missing emails deleted by Hillary Clinton, his Democratic opponent. Trump publicly sided with Putin over U.S. intelligence officials on whether Russia had interfered in the 2016 election to help him, and Trump has criticized U.S. aid to Ukraine as it tries to fend off Russia's attack. Later in Tuesday's interview, Trump refused to say whether he would commit to a peaceful transfer of power should he lose the November election. He also claimed there was a peaceful transfer of power after the 2020 election, despite his supporters' violent attack on the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. 'Come on. You had a peaceful transfer of power compared to Venezuela,' Micklethwait responded. ___ Peoples reported from New York.	https://apnews.com/article/trump-putin-call-bob-woodward-war-e5c800ac94df73dc599b0dc8be8a3fb0	2024-10-15T10:09:18-07:00	
Mexican president acknowledges army killings of 3 civilians in a violent border city	MEXICO CITY (AP) — Mexico’s new president acknowledged Tuesday that three civilians including a child died in two shootouts involving the military last week in a violent border city. President Claudia Sheinbaum said a soldier was killed in one of the shootouts, as well as two adults and an 8-year-old girl. She said the events on Friday and Saturday are under investigation. But Sheinbaum gave no sign of backing away from the outsized role that she and her predecessor have given to the armed forces. The events in Nuevo Laredo, across the border from Laredo, Texas, started Friday when a nurse, her husband and son found themselves on a road where soldiers were pursuing suspects’ vehicles. The husband, Víctor Carrillo Martínez, told local media there was a confrontation and his wife died in the crossfire. Sheinbaum said the soldier was apparently killed in an exchange of gunfire. 'It had to do with criminals who opened fire on an army vehicle,' she said. 'It is very important to say that Nuevo Laredo is where criminal groups have carried out the most attacks on the army and the National Guard.' The city has long been in the grip of the Northeast Cartel, an offshoot of the old Zetas gang. The second incident in Nuevo Laredo happened Saturday, when the 8-year-old and her grandmother were driving to a store and were caught in the middle of a pursuit by soldiers or National Guard officers. The grandmother told reporters that a military vehicle was pursuing an SUV and her car got stuck between them and the military opened fire. The Human Rights Commission of Nuevo Laredo said a young man’s tortured body was found nearby in a truck that the army and National Guard had been pursuing. Sheinbaum confirmed the two deaths, saying the shootings had involved the militarized National Guard. 'In case there has been any misbehavior by any member of the guard or the army, or any official, it will be punished,' she said. The Defense Department, which controls the National Guard, said it had no immediate comment on the shootings. Last week, the army was involved in another shooting that killed six migrants and wounded 10. In the incident near Tapachula, close to the border with Guatemala. soldiers claimed they heard 'detonations' and opened fire on a truck carrying migrants from Egypt, Nepal, Cuba, India, Pakistan and El Salvador. The dead included an 11-year-old Egyptian girl. The area is often used by migrant smugglers, but warring drug cartels also operate in the region. Former president Andrés Manuel López Obrador, who left office Sept. 30, gave the military an unprecedentedly wide role in public life and law enforcement. He created the militarized Guard and used the combined forces as the country’s main law enforcement agencies, supplanting police. But critics say the military is not trained to do civilian law enforcement work. 'For decades, when the army and the marines have been used in law enforcement, complaints of human rights violations have skyrocketed,' said security analyst David Saucedo. 'The armed forces operate with an extermination logic ... that is one of the reasons that many of us oppose militarization.' Military analyst Juan Ibarrola denied there was a lack of discipline on the part of the army. 'This is not a lack of training. Remember, Mexican soldiers have been in the streets and on the highways for 30 years,' Ibarrola said. 'A soldier knows very well he will not escape justice, unlike some others in Mexico.' But both said it reflected the severity of attacks that soldiers deal with in some parts of Mexico. 'There is also a problem of increased criminal activity,' said Saucedo. 'The National Guard, the army and the marines have been outgunned.' 'That is why these soldiers are on the defensive, on alert, and they open fire against the slightest indication of an attack against them.' The head of the Nuevo Laredo rights committee, Raymundo Ramos, said the armed forces have been allowed to operate above any civilian authority. 'It appears nobody wants to touch the military in this country,' he said. ____ Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america	https://apnews.com/article/mexico-border-nuevo-laredo-soldiers-civilians-killings-d8f454c1cbcd8f2a95a3901e44f206e2	2024-10-15T09:25:06-07:00	
Becky G says 'Encuentros,' her second album of regional Mexican music, is a celebration of culture	MEXICO CITY (AP) — Last year, Mexican American singer Becky G released her first album of regional Mexican music, 'Esquinas.' Her newest album, 'Encuentros,' makes it clear that this is not a temporary interest: She's dedicated to exploring the folk music in depth, and by adding modern fusions. 'Obviously, a lot of people can say ‘You do it because it’s trendy,’' Becky G said in Spanish during a video interview from Los Angeles before the last Friday release of the album. 'I think what I found in myself, when we were creating ‘Esquinas,’ was something so real to me, something so sincere, something so vulnerable as an artist, that I felt so obsessed with the process. And we didn’t want to stop.' She says her fans have told her that when she sings regional Mexican music, they notice her voice takes on a different tone. She says they can hear Rebbeca — her real name — and her true essence beyond the Becky G pop persona. The album starts with 'XLAS NUBES,' which translates to 'By the Clouds,' a song that stands out for its acoustic guitar arrangements. According to Becky G, it stemmed from the vision of a person falling through the clouds, as if in a dream. 'Every song has a thread that takes you on that adventure,' she said. 'We decided to mix instruments from other genres and a production style in my vocals that makes it feel a little more modern. And that, for me, was a lot of fun.' The album, produced by Adrián Pieragostino, features ranchera, mariachi and contemporary corridos fused with other genres such as bolero, cumbia and Colombian vallenato. 'When I was creating music in the other genres, if it was pop music, if it was reggaeton, we were always playing and mixing genres. So, I decided, ‘Why not do it with regional music?’' she said. Still, there are traditional moments on the album, like the accordion-fueled ranchera 'Desierto' ('Desert'), where she sings about wanting an ex to run out of water in the desert. Her siblings approved the song, she said, and told her she should include it in her concerts. 'It reminds me a lot of the music I listened to when I was a child. That’s the music that my grandmother listened to, that my mom listened to,' she said, describing the song as 'cortavena' ('cutting veins') music — spiteful songs that are a part of regional Mexican music's cathartic appeal. 'Todo' ('All') features Delilah, a rising artist. 'We wanted it to sound like when you’re singing near someone,' Becky G said. 'It’s a very big song, but very quiet. It’s a very difficult style to achieve, but I think we did it really well, because it feels so big, it feels like a Disney song. I’m obsessed with her voice, Delilah’s voice. I think our voices together is magic.' The concept of the album started with 'Mercedes,' featuring Oscar Maydon, where Becky G shines atop regional Mexican instrumentation. For her, it is a perfect song to listen to in the car, hence the Mercedes Benz-referencing title. Visually, Becky G said she wanted to make her music videos and album artwork appear narrative, reflecting her city, community and culture in Los Angeles. 'Anyone who sees this, if they live in London, anywhere in the world, they’re going to see it, and they’re going to understand who Becky G is,' she said. That also translates to the album cover, in which she appears posing under the sun, with LA in the background. She's already thinking about the concept and title of the next album — and won't rule out whether it will be called another word that begins with the letter 'E.' 'I don’t want to stop, this is what I love, it’s everything to me,' she said. 'And having these opportunities to continue learning from my art and representing our stories, expressing myself and finding myself as a woman is a very beautiful process.' Becky G is currently on tour in the U.S., performing 'Encuentros' songs live, as well as those from 'Esquinas' and her pop and reggaeton eras. 'I always say that my shows are how I like my tacos,' she said, 'with a little bit of everything.'	https://apnews.com/article/becky-g-encuentros-interview-cf7ac8ca422573eb53e6aae4b11adeec	2024-10-15T09:03:19-07:00	
$55 million plan to give Notre Dame area a green facelift is part of Paris-wide eco plan	PARIS (AP) — As Notre Dame gears up to reopen its doors in December, Paris is on the verge of a remarkable eco-revival, bringing nature back to the forefront of the City of Light. Beyond restoring the cathedral's iconic spire and medieval charm, the city announced plans Tuesday to revamp Notre Dame's surroundings — to a tune of 50 million euros ($55 million) — into a serene, green oasis. The project echoes a broader, post-Olympics eco-facelift that’s reshaping Paris from its historic monuments to its bustling avenues. Among the key elements of this broader transformation are the revitalization of historic spaces like the Champs-Elysees and Place de la Concorde, a redesign aimed at reducing traffic around the Arc de Triomphe, and green promenades connecting the French capital's landmarks. Here's a look at some of the eco plans for Paris in the coming years: Notre Dame Cathedral: a rebirth in green The reopening on Dec. 8 promises to be a historic moment for Paris, fulfilling President Emmanuel Macron’s vow made after the devastating 2019 fire for a five-year timeline. While the cathedral’s spire and oak-framed roof have been restored to their prefire glory, Paris City Hall's plans for the area around Notre Dame are bringing something new. The ambitious, future-facing project will create 1,800 square meters (around 20,000 square feet) of green space and plant 160 trees, according to a news conference at City Hall that featured speeches from Paris officials, including mayor Anne Hidalgo on Tuesday. Hidalgo stated that the redesign will integrate nature and the Seine more fully into the area. Hidalgo emphasized that this transformation aims 'to better highlight our beautiful cathedral and do it justice, while respecting its history.' The redesign includes transforming the underground parking area into a visitor space complete with services and amenities. Additionally, the Seine’s adjacent quays will be revitalized, offering a new promenade along the river. A belvedere will provide panoramic views of the Ile Saint-Louis and the Seine, further enhancing the visitor experience. The project will unfold in two phases, with the first, focusing on the parvis and surrounding streets, expected to be completed by the end of 2027. The second phase, which will include the renovation of Square Jean-XXIII and other nearby areas, is set to finish by 2030. Place de la Concorde: A transformation At the heart of Paris, the Place de la Concorde — home to the 3,300-year-old Luxor Obelisk — will undergo a significant overhaul between 2026 and 2027. Paris officials have enlisted the input of a dozen architectural experts to envision how to preserve its rich history, while aligning the plaza with the city’s modern green ambitions. Expect more greenery and less traffic as the revamp balances historical significance with a fresh eco-friendly design. Eiffel Tower dispute Not everything has been a picnic in Paris’s post-Olympics makeover. Two of France’s most high-profile female politicians — Hidalgo and Culture Minister Rachida Dati — are engaged in a fierce battle over the future of the Eiffel Tower, casting a shadow over the city’s plans for its famed monument. Hidalgo has proposed to keep the Olympic rings affixed to the Eiffel Tower beyond the Games, which ended in August. She argues that the rings symbolize the 'festive spirit' of the successful Paris Olympics and wants them to remain at least until the next Summer Games in Los Angeles in 2028. Critics, however, say Hidalgo is using the Eiffel Tower as a political billboard to boost her image before the 2026 mayoral election, in which she is expected to face off against Dati. Dati has been vocal in opposing the plan, arguing that the tower is a protected heritage site and can't be altered without proper consultation. She has accused Hidalgo of using the monument as a 'personal campaign poster,' while Hidalgo counters that the rings are a harmless tribute to Paris’ Olympic success. Dati has gone further, launching an ultimatum to push for the Eiffel Tower to be classified as a full historical monument — something Hidalgo has resisted. This would add extra layers of bureaucratic protection and control, potentially thwarting Hidalgo’s plans. Champs-Elysees: A greener avenue Paris’ Champs-Elysees, sometimes called 'the most beautiful avenue in the world,' is receiving a 30-million-euro facelift, beginning with the renovation of its sidewalks, tree bases, and gardens that began in preparation for the Olympics. With 150 proposals to 're-enchant the Champs-Elysees' over the coming years, this project aims to add even more green spaces and revive its historic charm, reinforcing its reputation as the world’s most beautiful avenue. Arc de Triomphe: reducing traffic Changes to the Arc de Triomphe’s bustling roundabout are designed to reduce traffic flow and calm the surrounding environment. Traffic lanes encircling the famous monument will be trimmed, while the central ring will be widened, allowing for a quieter, more accessible space. Leading from the Arc de Triomphe to the Bois de Boulogne, the Avenue de la Grande Armee is also getting the green treatment. Authorities plan to recreate a historic green promenade, transforming this major traffic artery into a lush, tree-lined boulevard that reconnects the avenue with the nearby forest, historically converted into a public park in the 19th century under Napoleon III. Louvre Museum to go eco-friendly Paris’ Louvre Museum, the world’s most visited, will undergo its own transformation under the 'Louvre 2030' project. Though specific details remain sparse, the project aims to address the growing influx of visitors, with a significant redesign of Place du Louvre planned to help manage the crowds and provide a more tranquil, green environment for visitors.	https://apnews.com/article/france-paris-notre-dame-green-ecology-2b1930e4630e48994a6bd758a747ebbc	2024-10-15T08:56:50-07:00	
Belarus adds 1 year to imprisoned opposition activist's sentence	TALLINN, Estonia (AP) — A court in Belarus on Tuesday sentenced an imprisoned opponent of hardline President Alexander Lukashenko to an additional year behind bars for disobeying prison officials. Palina Sharenda-Panasyuk was arrested in 2021 during the crackdown on opposition that began after nationwide demonstrations broke out to protest the results of the disputed 2020 election that gave Lukashenko a sixth term in office. Sharenda-Panasyuk initially was convicted of insulting the president and assaulting a police officer. Prior to Tuesday's verdict, her sentence had been extended by two years for disobeying prison guards. It was not immediately clear when she's now expected to be released. She has pancreatitis and chronic back pain and has reported harsh conditions in prison, with inmates sleeping on metal slabs without mattresses or bedding. 'The new sentence sounds like a death sentence, because Palina physically may not be able to withstand another circle of hell,' her husband, Andrei Sharenda, told The Associated Press. Representatives of European Union nations traveled to her trial in the town of Rechitsa. The German Embassy in a statement said 'the mother of two minor children, despite having already served a prison sentence, is forced to appear before the court again, which demonstrates the ruthlessness of the Belarusian regime toward dissidents.' Lukashenko has consistently suppressed opposition and independent news media since coming to power in 1994. The human rights organization Viasna counts nearly 1,300 political prisoners in Belarus, including its Nobel Peace Prize-winning founder Ales Bialiatski.	https://apnews.com/article/belarus-lukashenko-prisoner-crackdown-9e167cb384341d1a02c114e66fead0ab	2024-10-15T08:33:06-07:00	
US warns Israel to boost humanitarian aid into Gaza or risk losing weapons funding	WASHINGTON (AP) — The Biden administration has warned Israel that it must increase the amount of humanitarian aid it is allowing into Gaza within the next 30 days or it could risk losing access to U.S. weapons funding. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin warned their Israeli counterparts in a letter dated Sunday that the changes must occur. The letter, which restates U.S. policy toward humanitarian aid and arms transfers, was sent amid deteriorating conditions in northern Gaza and an Israeli airstrike on a hospital tent site in central Gaza that killed at least four people and burned others. A similar letter that Blinken sent to Israeli officials in April led to more humanitarian assistance getting to the Palestinian territory, State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said Tuesday. But that has not lasted. 'In fact, it’s fallen by over 50% from where it was at its peak,' Miller said. 'So the secretary, along with Secretary Austin, thought it was appropriate to make clear to the government of Israel that there are changes that they need to make again, to see that the level of assistance making it into Gaza comes back up from the very, very low levels that it is at today.' For Israel to continue qualifying for foreign military financing, the level of aid getting into Gaza must increase to at least 350 trucks a day, Israel must institute additional humanitarian pauses and provide increased security for humanitarian sites, Austin and Blinken said in their letter. They said Israel had 30 days to respond to the requirements. 'We are making clear to the government of Israel that there are these changes that need to be implemented, that we give them an appropriate period of time to implement it,' Miller said. An Israeli official confirmed a letter had been delivered but did not discuss the contents. That official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss a diplomatic matter, confirmed the U.S. had raised 'humanitarian concerns' and was putting pressure on Israel to speed up the flow of aid into Gaza. The letter, which an Axios reporter posted a copy of online, was sent during a period of growing frustration in the administration that despite repeated and increasingly vocal requests to scale back offensive operations against Hamas, Israel’s bombardment has led to unnecessary civilian deaths and risks plunging the region into a much wider war. 'We are particularly concerned that recent actions by the Israeli government, including halting commercial imports, denying or impeding 90 percent of humanitarian movements' and other restrictions have kept aid from flowing, Blinken and Austin said. The Biden administration is increasing its calls for its ally and biggest recipient of U.S. military aid to ease the humanitarian crisis in Gaza while assuring that America's support for Israel is unwavering just before the U.S. presidential election in three weeks. Funding for Israel has long carried weight in U.S. politics, and Biden said this month that 'no administration has helped Israel more than I have.' Humanitarian aid groups fear that Israeli leaders may approve a plan to seal off humanitarian aid to northern Gaza in an attempt to starve out Hamas, which could trap hundreds of thousands of Palestinians who are unwilling or unable to leave their homes without food, water, medicine and fuel. U.N. humanitarian officials said last week that aid entering Gaza is at its lowest level in months. About 80 trucks carrying aid have entered through crossings in Gaza’s north since Oct. 1, down from roughly 60 trucks a day previously, according to the U.N. website tracking deliveries. COGAT, the Israeli body facilitating aid crossings into Gaza, denied that crossings to the north have been closed. U.S. officials said the letter was sent to remind Israel of both its obligations under international humanitarian law and of the Biden administration’s legal obligation to ensure that the delivery of American humanitarian assistance should not be hindered, diverted or held up by a recipient of U.S. military aid. Israel’s retaliatory offensive since the Oct. 7, 2023, attacks by Hamas has killed over 42,000 people in Gaza, according to the territory’s Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in its count. The Hamas attacks that launched the war killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and militants abducted another 250. The United States has spent a record of at least $17.9 billion on military aid to Israel since the war in Gaza began and led to escalating conflict around the Middle East, according to a report for Brown University’s Costs of War project. That aid has enabled Israel to purchase billions of dollars worth of munitions it has used in its operations against Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon.

UN says deadly Israeli strike in northern Lebanon should be investigated	AITO, Lebanon (AP) — An Israeli airstrike on an apartment building in northern Lebanon that killed at least 22 people needs to be independently investigated, the United Nations’ human rights office said Tuesday. 'We have real concerns with respect to … the laws of war,' Jeremy Laurence, a spokesperson for the U.N.'s human rights office in Geneva said a day after the strike, as rescue workers searching through the rubble found more bodies and remains. Laurence said the U.N. had received credible reports that a dozen women and children were among the dead. The Israeli military said it 'struck a target belonging to the Hezbollah terrorist organization' and that it would look into reports of civilian deaths. The apartment building hit in the airstrike was in the small village of Aito, in the country’s Christian heartland and far from Hezbollah’s main areas of influence in Lebanon's south and east. The strike was a shock to residents, and it exacerbated fears that Israel would expand its offensive deeper into Lebanon. 'I heard a loud noise, like a boom,' said Dany Alwan, who lives next door. 'We ran outside, I saw the dust and the smoke and the rubble. There was a body here, another one there. It was a really ugly and painful scene.' The three-story building had been rented out to the Hijazi family, which fled their home in the southern village of Aitaroun, according to Elie Alwan, Dany Alwan's brother and the building's owner. Some 1.2 million people have fled southern and eastern Lebanon, where the fighting between Israel and Hezbollah has been concentrated. As rescue workers rummaged through the debris on Tuesday, they found the body of a child, and later a small leg and other remains that they put together in a white bag. The Lebanese military watched as a bulldozer cleared heaps of twisted steel, destroyed olive trees, and crushed rocks. Over the past year, 2,350 people in Lebanon have been killed in Israeli airstrikes, according to the country's Health Ministry, which says roughly 25 percent have been women and children. Hezbollah's acting leader vows to step up strikes against Israel Earlier on Tuesday, the acting leader of Hezbollah said the militant group would fire rockets into more areas of Israel until it ceases its airstrikes and ends its ground invasion of Lebanon. Naim Kassem said Hezbollah is focused on 'hurting the enemy,' comments made in a pre-recorded televised speech delivered on the same day the United States said it sent a small team of troops to Israel to support an American-made missile-defense system. Hezbollah has fired thousands of rockets into Israel over the past year in support of Hamas' war with Israel in Gaza. Tens of thousands of northern Israelis have been displaced from their homes by those attacks — and Israel has said its war with Hezbollah is aimed at stopping those rockets so families can return home. On Tuesday, Kassem signaled that Hezbollah would ramp up attacks further south in Israel, which it has already done by targeting Tel Aviv and Haifa. Kassem has headed the militant group since Sept. 27, when its longtime leader, Hassan Nasrallah, was assassinated in an Israeli airstrike. Hezbollah began targeting Israel with rockets on Oct. 8, 2023, a day after the Hamas attack on Israel that left 1,200 dead and 250 as hostages in Gaza. Israel's ensuing war against Hamas has left more than 42,000 people dead in Gaza, according to local health officials. They do not differentiate between fighters and civilians, but have said a little more than half the dead are women and children. Hezbollah has insisted it will continue to target Israel until a cease-fire in Gaza is reached. 'We cannot separate Lebanon from Palestine, or Palestine from the world,' Kassem said. Also on Tuesday, Pentagon press secretary Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder announced the arrival of U.S. troops in Israel on Monday. The team will operate a Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense battery there to defend against ballistic missile attacks from Iran, which backs both Hezbollah and Hamas, and has launched two missile attacks on Israel. 'Over the coming days, additional U.S. military personnel and THAAD battery components will continue to arrive in Israel,' Ryder said. Iran has warned U.S. troops would be in harm’s way if they launch another attack. In Lebanon, Israel's bombardment and ground invasion have displaced more than 400,000 children in the past three weeks, according to Ted Chaiban, deputy executive director at UNICEF, the U.N. children's agency.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-lebanon-aito-war-hezbollah-7d497b9c3c5a7429b3ac1fd3560f89be	2024-10-15T07:46:20-07:00	
Countries that have cashed in on their top-level domain names	LONDON (AP) — Anguilla is raking in extra revenue from registration fees for its .ai web domain thanks to the artificial intelligence boom, but it's not the only place cashing in on demand for websites with distinctive address endings. Here's a look at some other places cashing in on their unique top-level domains: TUVALU Tuvalu is a string of coral atolls, scattered over hundreds of miles in the Pacific Ocean, located midway between Australia and Hawaii. It has one of the world's smallest economies and its low-lying islands are vulnerable to climate change, but it does have a very valuable resource: the .tv web domain. Royalties from .tv, which web users might assume is short for television, have been climbing, especially after videogame streaming platform Twitch licensed the web address twitch.tv. LIBYA The North African country, which has been plagued by turmoil since longtime dictator Moammar Gadhafi's death in 2011, isn't readily associated with internet culture. But Libya controls web addresses that end in .ly, which have become widely used as a so-called domain hack for websites with English names that end in -ly. Well-known examples include bit.ly, used by the weblink shortening service Bitly, and parse.ly, the website for online analytics platform Parse.ly. MONTENEGRO This Balkan country became an independent nation after the breakup of Yugoslavia. It's one of Europe's smaller countries — about 620,000 people — bordered by the Adriatic Sea, Bosnia, Kosovo, Serbia and Albania. Montenegro was assigned the .me web domain, which has become popular with people who want to claim their pronoun for personal branding. Websites ending in .me are 'often used for personal websites, portfolios, blogs and online resumes or portfolios because ‘me’ can be seen as a way to personalize an online presence,' website builder Wix says. COLOMBIA Websites that end in .co aren't from a generic web domain for companies, like .com sites. The .co domain is assigned to Colombia, but the South American country allows anyone to sign up for its web addresses. Internet registrar GoDaddy says more than 2 million .co web domains have been claimed, including addresses claimed by Big Tech names like Amazon which uses it to redirect online shoppers to its .com home page. Google, meanwhile, informs visitors to g.co that the link is it's official shortcut.	https://apnews.com/article/countries-popular-top-level-domain-names-2a6044ed4082e866ccf675e79a57e6f4	2024-10-15T07:31:41-07:00	
Egypt's long-delayed mega-museum will open some of its main galleries, a trial run for full opening	CAIRO (AP) — The Grand Egyptian Museum will partially open its main galleries on Wednesday, including 12 halls that exhibit aspects of ancient Egypt, as part of a trial run, officials said Tuesday. The museum, a mega-project near the famed Giza Pyramids which has cost well over $1 billion so far, will open the halls for 4,000 visitors as a trial run until the official opening date, which is yet to be announced, according to Al-Tayeb Abbas, assistant to the minister of antiquities. The opening of the museum, which has been under construction for more than a decade, has been repeatedly delayed for various reasons, including the COVID-19 pandemic. More than 100,000 artifacts of Egypt’s ancient treasures will be displayed in the world’s largest archaeological museum, according to the Egyptian state information website. Abbas told the AP that the trial run starting Wednesday would help prepare for the full opening by providing a deeper understanding of issues related to operations such as identifying overcrowded areas across the museum. The displays across the 12 halls tap into issues related to society, religion, and doctrine in ancient Egypt, he added. All open-style halls have been classified by dynasty and historical order, and each will showcase at least 15,000 artifacts. Eras that will be exhibited in the main galleries include the Third Intermediate Period (about 1070-664 B.C.), Late Period (664-332 B.C.), Graeco-Roman Period (332 B.C.-395 A.D.), New Kingdom (1550-1070 B.C.), Middle Kingdom (2030-1650 B.C.), and Old Kingdom (2649-2130 B.C.). One of the halls displays statues of 'Elite of the King,' members of the royal family and high-ranking officials who worked in the army, priesthood, and the government. Parts of the site have already been open for limited tours since late 2022 to test visitors’ experience and the museum’s operational preparedness. Aude Porcedde, a Canadian tourist who visited several sections, told the AP she was amazed by the museum, adding that Egyptian civilization is important for her and for the world to know more about. 'There is a lot of history and a lot of things we are not aware of, especially coming from the other side of the world, and seeing everything here and learning from the locals has been great,' said Costa Rican tourist Jorge Licano. The grand staircase, six stories high and with a view of the pyramids, and the commercial area are open to the public, showcasing monuments and artifacts that include sarcophagi and statues. Other parts of the museum, including the King Tutankhamun treasure collection, are set to open at later dates. All halls are equipped with advanced technology and feature multimedia presentations to explain the lives of the ancient Egyptians, including its kings, according to Eissa Zidan, Director-General of the Preliminary Restoration and Antiquities Transfer at the museum. One of the halls will use virtual reality to explain the history of burial and its development throughout ancient Egypt. 'The museum is not only a place to display antiquities, but it also aims to attract children to learn about ancient Egyptian history ... The museum is a gift to all the world,' Zidan told the AP. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Associated Press journalist Fatma Khaled contributed to this report from Cairo.	https://apnews.com/article/egypt-grand-egyptian-museum-antiquities-giza-pyramids-be3938b7d6ce96b1aa03693c0440a0f1	2024-10-15T07:24:11-07:00	
Israel assures US it won't strike Iranian nuclear or oil sites, US officials say	WASHINGTON (AP) — The Biden administration believes it has won assurances from Israel that it will not hit Iranian nuclear or oil sites as it looks to strike back following Iran's missile barrage earlier this month, two U.S. officials said Tuesday. The administration also believes that sending a U.S. Terminal High Altitude Area Defense battery to Israel and roughly 100 soldiers to operate it has eased some of Israel’s concerns about possible Iranian retaliation and general security issues. The Pentagon on Sunday announced the THAAD deployment to help bolster Israel’s air defenses following Iran’s ballistic missile attacks on Israel in April and October, saying it was authorized at the direction of President Joe Biden. However, the U.S. officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss private diplomatic discussions, cautioned that the assurance is not ironclad and that circumstances could change. The officials also noted that Israel’s track record on fulfilling assurances in the past is mixed and has often reflected domestic Israeli politics that have upended Washington’s expectations. The most recent example of that was last month when U.S. officials were told by their Israeli counterparts that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu would welcome a U.S.- and French-led temporary cease-fire initiative for Lebanon only to see Israel launch a massive airstrike that killed Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah two days later. Netanyahu’s office said in a statement that '‏we listen to the opinions of the United States, but we will make our final decisions based on our national interests.' The Middle East has been bracing for an expected response from Israel after Iran launched roughly 180 ballistic missiles on Oct. 1, which the United States helped to fend off. The tit-for-tat strikes and uncertainty about whether Israel might strike strategically important energy and nuclear sites in Iran have raised fears about escalation into an all-out regional war. Israel’s offensive against Iranian-backed Hamas militants in Gaza has expanded into a ground invasion of Lebanon targeting Hezbollah, another Iranian proxy that has been firing into Israel since the conflict in Gaza started a year ago in solidarity with Hamas. Biden has said he would not support a retaliatory Israeli strike on sites related to Tehran’s nuclear program and urged Israel to consider alternatives to hitting Iran’s oil sector. Such a strike could affect the global oil market and boost pump prices just ahead of the U.S. presidential election. Biden and Netanyahu spoke by phone last week for the first time in seven weeks, while Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has been speaking regularly with his Israeli counterpart, Yoav Gallant. The Pentagon said in a readout of a call from Sunday that the U.S. has reaffirmed its support for Israel’s security but urged it to ensure protections for U.N. peacekeepers in southern Lebanon, shift from military operations to a diplomatic solution and 'raised concern for the dire humanitarian situation in Gaza and stressed that steps must be taken soon to address it.' The White House National Security Council declined to confirm that Netanyahu offered Biden any assurances about targets. 'Our commitment to Israel’s defense is ironclad,' the White House National Security Council said in a statement. 'We will not discuss private diplomatic discussions and would refer you to the Israeli government to speak to their own potential military operations.' ___ AP reporter Julia Frankel contributed from Jerusalem.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-iran-oil-nuclear-sites-biden-f5dd702de7d990dd1d00f665e1484dee	2024-10-15T07:04:08-07:00	
Hereditary nobles have sat in Britain's Parliament for centuries. Their time may be up	LONDON (AP) — Like his ancestors for centuries, the Earl of Devon serves in Parliament, helping to make the laws of the land. But not for much longer. British lawmakers voted Tuesday to approve in principle a bill to strip hereditary aristocrats of the right to sit and vote in the House of Lords after more than 700 years. The Labour Party government says the decision will complete a long-stalled reform of Parliament’s upper chamber and remove an 'outdated and indefensible' relic of the past. 'In the 21st century, there should not be places in our Parliament, making our laws, reserved for those who are born into certain families,' Constitution Minister Nick Thomas-Symonds said Tuesday as he opened debate on the bill in the House of Commons. He noted that Britain is one of only two countries — the other is Lesotho — with a hereditary element to its parliament. But Lord Devon thinks it’s risky to tinker with the U.K.'s unwritten constitution, which 'has survived an awful lot of slings and arrows of misfortune over a thousand years.' 'The fact that I am doing a job that was granted by the Empress Matilda to my forebear in 1142, and is still ongoing and is still functioning, is a remarkable example of consistency and continuity,' said the earl, a 49-year-old lawyer whose given name is Charles Peregrine Courtenay. Britain’s Parliament has two chambers: the House of Commons, whose members are directly elected by voters in 650 constituencies across the U.K.; and the unelected Lords. For centuries it was made up of noblemen — women were not allowed until 1963 — whose voting rights were passed down to their children along with their titles. In the 1950s these were joined by 'life peers' — retired politicians, civic leaders and other notables appointed by the government. In 1999 the Labour government of then-Prime Minister Tony Blair evicted most of the more than 750 hereditary peers from the Lords, though to avoid an aristocrats’ rebellion, 92 were allowed to remain temporarily. A quarter-century on, 88 hereditaries are still there, an all-male group with an average age of almost 70. When one dies or retires, their fellow bluebloods hold elections to replace them. Courtenay joined the House of Lords in 2018 after winning an election in which there were 19 candidates and 31 eligible voters. Peers who sit in the ornate, gilded Lords chamber do not get a salary but can claim 361 pounds ($472) a day in expenses and can enjoy Parliament’s subsidized bars, tea rooms and restaurants. It’s a job for life, unless members choose to retire or — in a recent change — are expelled for non-attendance. The appointment of peers by successive governments means the Lords is overstuffed, with about 800 members — the second-largest legislative chamber in the world after China’s National People’s Congress. The opposition Scottish National Party has filed a motion to abolish the House of Lords altogether, though that stands little chance of passing. Labour remains committed eventually to replacing the Lords with 'an alternative second chamber that is more representative of the U.K.' While more Lords support the Conservatives than any other party — others, like Courtenay, are nonaligned — some on the left of British politics have come to value the upper house for its role in helping to moderate controversial plans by the previous Conservative government over Brexit and immigration. Labour's large House of Commons majority meant lawmakers overwhelmingly approved sending the bill on for further scrutiny after rejecting a Conservative attempt to block it. 'The checks and balances of the Lords — its tried and tested conventions — work,' said Conservative lawmaker Oliver Dowden, a former deputy prime minister. 'We should only fix what is broken and be cautious about rushing into change.' To become law, the bill also has to get through the House of Lords, which has the power to delay and amend legislation approved by the Commons, but ultimately can’t block it. It is likely to become law in the coming year. Courtenay, who owns Powderham Castle and its 3,500 acre (1,400 hectare) estate in the southwest England county of Devon, is sanguine about becoming the last in his storied family to sit in Parliament. 'We were responsible for crowning Henry VII. We fought alongside the Black Prince at the Battle of Crécy, and we financed the Agincourt campaign in 1415. And we were first cousins of Henry VIII until he chopped our head off,' he said. 'So we’ve been somewhat involved in the workings of government over a long, long time. 'And outside of those moments in the spotlight, there’s been an awful lot of plodding along, trying to support Devon and help the community … a long and satisfying service, which will continue.'	https://apnews.com/article/uk-lords-hereditary-aristocrats-eebad806ed864e2da361c94e9526822e	2024-10-15T04:41:49-07:00	
4 people die in a migrant boat accident off a Greek island	ATHENS, Greece (AP) — Four people, including two children, died Tuesday off the Greek island of Kos in an accident involving a migrant smuggling boat crossing from nearby Turkey, Greek authorities said. A coast guard statement said 27 people were rescued and nobody was listed as missing. It said that according to survivors, the accident occurred when the person steering the small boat made a clumsy maneuver just off Kos. Ten passengers fell into the water and two women and two children died, the coast guard said. The survivors were picked up by coast guard vessels. Greek authorities are bracing for a possible surge in migrant arrivals due to the ongoing fighting in Lebanon and Gaza. Earlier Tuesday, an official warned that wars in the Middle East and Africa, combined with the effects of climate change, will put Europe under continuous long-term pressure from immigration. Sofia Voultepsi, a deputy minister for migration, also said a landmark European Union migration pact earlier this year remained lacking in practical terms. 'We got the (agreement), but the basic piece is still missing: Returns,' Voultepsi said. 'We must have a common system for asylum, a common system for returns and a common system for integration.' The EU migration pact is due to take effect in mid-2026 following a new round of negotiations with the bloc's 27 member states expected to last about a year. Voultepsi also expressed alarm at the growing number of refugees in Lebanon because of ongoing Israeli airstrikes targeting the militant group Hezbollah. Greece is a major entry point for migrants into the EU, with most crossing from Turkey and Libya in unsafe boats. Earlier Tuesday, the coast guard said 81 migrants were rescued from a stranded vessel traveling from Turkey to Italy. The rescue was carried out Sunday with the assistance of two merchant vessels. The rescued migrants told Greek authorities they had paid $8,500 each for the trip. Elsewhere in Europe, an Italian navy ship was expected to dock at an Albanian port with a first group of 16 migrants intercepted in international waters. Their asylum applications will be processed in Albania instead of Italy under a five-year agreement between the two countries. In Poland, Prime Minister Donald Tusk plans to temporarily suspend the right to asylum. The new migration policy was presented at Cabinet meeting on Tuesday. ___ Follow AP’s coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/migration	https://apnews.com/article/greece-migration-european-union-policy-6e4dff2bb4e88a4c24d6dd056f7f6b22	2024-10-15T04:07:09-07:00	
How the tiny Caribbean island of Anguilla has turned the AI boom into a digital gold mine	The artificial intelligence boom has benefited chatbot makers, computer scientists and Nvidia investors. It's also providing an unusual windfall for Anguilla, a tiny island in the Caribbean. ChatGPT's debut nearly two years ago heralded the dawn of the AI age and kicked off a digital gold rush as companies scrambled to stake their own claims by acquiring websites that end in .ai. That's where Anguilla comes in. The British territory was allotted control of the .ai internet address in the 1990s. It was one of hundreds of obscure top-level domains assigned to individual countries and territories based on their names. While the domains are supposed to indicate a website has a link to a particular region or language, it's not always a requirement. Google uses google.ai to showcase its artificial intelligence services while Elon Musk uses x.ai as the homepage for his Grok AI chatbot. Startups like AI search engine Perplexity have also snapped up .ai web addresses, redirecting users from the .com version. Anguilla's earnings from web domain registration fees quadrupled last year to $32 million, fueled by the surging interest in AI. The income now accounts for about 20% of Anguilla's total government revenue. Before the AI boom, it hovered at around 5%. Anguilla’s government, which uses the gov.ai home page, collects a fee every time a .ai web address is renewed, Identity Digital Chief Strategy Officer Ram Mohan said the fee — $140 for two years — won’t change. It also gets paid when new addresses are registered and expired ones are sold off. Some sites have fetched tens of thousands of dollars. The money directly boosts the economy of Anguilla, which is just 35 square miles (91 square kilometers) and has a population of about 16,000. Blessed with coral reefs, clear waters and palm-fringed white sand beaches, the island is a haven for uber-wealthy tourists. Still, many residents are underprivileged and tourism has been battered by the pandemic and, before that, a powerful hurricane. Anguilla doesn't have its own AI industry though Premier Ellis Webster hopes that one day it will become an hub for the technology. He said it was just luck that it was Anguilla, and not nearby Antigua, that was assigned the .ai domain in 1995 because both places had those letters in their names. Webster said the money takes the pressure off government finances and helps fund key projects, but cautioned that 'we can’t rely on it solely.' 'You can’t predict how long this is going to last,' Webster said in an interview with the AP. 'And so I don’t want to have our economy and our country and all our programs just based on this. And then all of a sudden there’s a new fad comes up in the next year or two, and then we are left now having to make significant expenditure cuts, removing programs.' To help keep up with the explosive growth in domain registrations, Anguilla said Tuesday it's signing a deal with a U.S.-based domain management company, Identity Digital, to help manage the effort. They said the agreement will mean more revenue for the government while improving the resilience and security of the web addresses. Identity Digital, which also manages Australia's .au domain, expects to migrate all .ai domain services to its systems by the start of next year, Mohan said in an interview. A local software entrepreneur had previously helped Anguilla set up its registry system decades earlier. There are now more than 533,000 .ai web domains, an increase of more than 10-fold since 2018. The International Monetary Fund said in a May report that the earnings will help diversify the economy, 'thus making it more resilient to external shocks. Webster expects domain-related revenues to rise further, and could even double this year from last year's $32 million. He said the money will finance the airport's expansion, free medical care for senior citizens and completion of a vocational technology training center at Anguilla's high school. The income also provides 'budget support' for other projects the government is eyeing, such as a national development fund it could quickly tap for hurricane recovery efforts. The island normally relies on assistance from its administrative power, Britain, which comes with conditions, Webster said. Mohan said working with Identity Digital will also defend against cyber crooks trying to take advantage of the hype around artificial intelligence. He cited the example of Tokelau, an island in the Pacific Ocean, whose .tk addresses became notoriously associated with spam and phishing after outsourcing its registry services. 'We worry about bad actors taking something, sticking a .ai to it, and then making it sound like they are much bigger or much better than what they really are,' Mohan said, adding that the company's technology will quickly take down shady sites. Another benefit is .AI websites will no longer need to connect to the government’s digital infrastructure through a single internet cable to the island, which leaves them vulnerable to digital bottlenecks or physical disruptions. Now they’ll use the company’s servers distributed globally, which means it will be faster to access them because they’ll be closer to users. 'It goes from milliseconds to microseconds,' Mohan said.	https://apnews.com/article/anguilla-artificial-intelligence-ai-internet-29d4ca2bb740d0425ffb8355811a6976	2024-10-15T03:59:04-07:00	
Canada-India ties could take a long time to recover	NEW DELHI (AP) — A diplomatic row that has strained bilateral relations between India and Canada for over a year has boiled over as the countries expelled each other’s top diplomats over the killing of a Sikh activist in Canada and allegations of other crimes. Experts say the diplomatic standoff will make it difficult for both countries to move forward with a once-promising partnership, and could impact India’s ambitions as it tries to project itself as a rising world power. 'India-Canada bilateral relations, which have been on a downslide since last year, will take a further hit which will take a long time to repair,' said Praveen Donthi, senior analyst with the International Crisis Group. Monday’s tit-for-tat expulsions came after Canada told India on Sunday that its top diplomat in the country is a person of interest in the 2023 assassination of Sikh activist Hardeep Singh Nijjar, and that police have uncovered evidence of an intensifying campaign against Canadian citizens by agents of the Indian government. Canadian Foreign Minister, Mélanie Joly also tied five other expelled Indian officials to Nijjar’s assassination and said Canada had gathered 'ample, clear and concrete evidence which identified six individuals as persons of interest in the Nijjar case.' India foreign ministry rejected the accusations as absurd, and said it was expelling Canada’s acting high commissioner and five other diplomats in response. New Delhi’s anxieties about Sikh separatist groups have long been a strain on its relationship with Canada, where some 2% of the population is Sikh. India has increasingly accused Justin Trudeau’s government of giving free rein to Sikh separatists from a once-strong movement to create an independent Sikh homeland known as Khalistan. Nijjar was a local leader of the Khalistan movement, which is banned in India. India designated him a terrorist in 2020, and at the time of his death was seeking his arrest for alleged involvement in an attack on a Hindu priest in India. Canadian police said Nijjar was shot as he was leaving the parking lot of the Sikh temple where he served as president in British Columbia on June 18, 2023. He suffered multiple gunshot wounds and died at the scene. India’s foreign ministry in its statement Monday ascribed Canada’s allegations to the 'political agenda of the Trudeau government.' The Canadian leader faces national elections next year. Michael Kugelman of the Wilson Center, an American think tank, said India's strong reaction is partly explained by how publicly Canada has made its accusations. 'New Delhi is extremely sensitive to any external criticism of its policies. And yet Canada isn’t only criticizing Indian policy. Its government, on the highest levels, is publicly voicing some of the most serious allegations that another government can make,' he said. Last year, in response to similar allegations made by Trudeau, India told Canada to remove 41 of its 62 diplomats in the country. Kugelman said the relationship is on 'life support right now' and India’s concerns about the Khalistan movement in Canada 'is essentially holding the relationship hostage.' Canada is not the only country that has accused Indian officials of plotting an association on foreign soil. Last year, U,S, prosecutors said an Indian government official directed a failed plot to assassinate another Sikh separatist leader in New York. The official was neither charged nor identified by name, but was described as a 'senior field officer' with responsibilities in security management and intelligence. New Delhi at the time expressed concern after the U.S. raised the issue and said India takes it seriously. On Monday, the U.S. State Department said in a statement that an Indian inquiry committee set up to investigate the plot would travel to Washington on Tuesday as part of its ongoing investigations. Canada’s foreign minister on Monday noted that India is cooperating with U.S. officials but said it had refused to cooperate in the Canadian investigation. Donthi said India’s diplomatic posturing against Canada was more aggressive because of the relatively low stakes. 'The U.S.-India relations also have a larger geopolitical framework and context, unlike India’s relations with Canada,' Donthi said, adding that India's strong reaction was also meant to deliver a message to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's supporters at home. 'Any public criticism is anathema to the Indian government, which is personified Modi. Such aggressive reaction is aimed at the international community and, more importantly, at Modi’s domestic constituency,' he said. Yet, experts say the standoff could have ramifications for Modi's global ambitions as he seeks to cast India as a rising global power and grows closer to the U.S., which like India is watching China’s growing assertiveness with concern. Donthi said the growing rift between India and Canada will also 'impact the growing strategic understanding between the U.S. and Western democracies' that are wooing New Delhi as a counterweight to Beijing. 'The Canadian allegations against India come against the grain, as New Delhi has been enjoying a favorable external environment,' Donthi said. 'This will throw a spanner in the works for India’s great power ambitions.'	https://apnews.com/article/india-canada-diplomats-expelled-sikh-assassination-42080eab5c86b861f44ed7bb3f33b4e7	2024-10-15T03:02:11-07:00	
Southern Africa is enduring its worst hunger crisis in decades due to El Niño, the UN says	CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) — Months of drought in southern Africa triggered by the El Niño weather phenomenon have had a devastating impact on more than 27 million people and caused the region's worst hunger crisis in decades, the United Nations' food agency said Tuesday. The World Food Program warned it could become a 'full-scale human catastrophe.' Five countries — Lesotho, Malawi, Namibia, Zambia and Zimbabwe — have declared national disasters over the drought and resultant hunger. The WFP estimates that about 21 million children in southern Africa are now malnourished as crops have failed. Tens of millions in the region rely on small-scale agriculture that is irrigated by rain for their food and to make money to buy provisions. Aid agencies warned of a potential disaster late last year as the naturally occurring El Niño led to below-average rainfall across the region, while its impact has been exacerbated by warming temperatures linked to climate change. 'This is the worst food crisis in decades,' WFP spokesperson Tomson Phiri said. 'October in southern Africa marks the start of the lean season, and each month is expected to be worse than the previous one until harvests next year in March and April. Crops have failed, livestock have perished and children are lucky to receive one meal per day.' The five countries that declared drought-related disasters have pleaded for international aid, while Angola on the west coast of Africa and Mozambique on the east coast are also 'severely affected,' Phiri said, showing the extent to which the drought has swept across the region. 'The situation is dire,' Phiri said. He said the WFP needs around $369 million to provide immediate help but has only received a fifth of that amid a shortfall in donations. The WFP has begun helping with food assistance and other critical support at the request of various governments in the region, he said. Phiri said southern Africa's crisis came at a time of 'soaring global needs,' with humanitarian aid also desperately required in Gaza, Sudan and elsewhere. Other aid agencies have said the drought in southern Africa is especially harsh, with the United States aid agency, USAID, saying in June it was the most severe drought in 100 years during the January to March agricultural season, wiping out swathes of crops and food for millions. El Niño, a weather phenomenon which warms parts of the central Pacific, has different impacts on weather in different parts of the world. The latest El Niño formed in the middle of last year and ended in June. It was blamed, along with human-caused climate change and overall ocean warmth, for a wild 12 months of heat waves and extreme weather. In southern Africa, food prices have risen sharply in many areas affected by the drought, increasing the hardship. The drought has also had other damaging effects. Zambia has lost much of its electricity and has been plunged into hours and sometimes days of blackouts because it relies heavily on hydroelectric power from the huge Kariba Dam. The water level of the dam is so low that it can hardly generate any power. Zimbabwe shares the dam and is also experiencing power outages. Authorities in Namibia and Zimbabwe have resorted to killing wildlife, including elephants, to provide meat for hungry people. Scientists say sub-Saharan Africa is one of the most vulnerable parts of the world to climate change because of a high dependency on rain-fed agriculture and natural resources. Millions of African livelihoods depend on the climate, while poor countries are unable to finance climate-resilience measures. ___ AP Africa news: https://apnews.com/hub/africa	https://apnews.com/article/drought-southern-africa-food-el-nino-hunger-6a2c8eb3db2e909f098db3a5ce71f6e4	2024-10-15T03:00:05-07:00	
Mexico is struggling to stamp out a homophobic soccer chant ahead of the World Cup	GUADALAJARA, México (AP) — Guadalajara is the capital of a Mexican state that is home to tequila and Mariachi music. It is also considered the birthplace of a less flattering tradition – a homophobic soccer chant that has cost Mexico hundreds of thousands of dollars in fines over the past two decades. It’s no wild guess that the chant, a one-word slur which literally means male prostitute in Spanish, will be heard from the crowd in Guadalajara’s Akron stadium when Mexico hosts the United States in a friendly on Tuesday. Multiple sanctions from FIFA and campaigns by Mexican soccer officials to educate fans have not been able to stamp it out. The chant persists in both club and national team soccer in Mexico, not least in games between the two North American rivals who will co-host the 2026 World Cup together with Canada. The last time the U.S. men’s team played Mexico, in the CONCACAF Nations League final in Texas in March, the referee stopped the game twice due to homophobic chanting by Mexico fans. Last year, a game in Las Vegas between the two sides was cut short for the same reason. In Guadalajara, a city with a strong soccer tradition which has two teams in Mexico’s top soccer league and another two in the second division, many local fans told The Associated Press that they considered the chant to be harmless and only meant to poke fun at opposing teams. 'Soccer is still a party, and the chant is just for fun. People who yell it mean no offense to the rival,' said Luis Gallardo, a 38-year-old who was wearing the Mexico national team’s black away shirt. 'It’s been going on for years and I don’t think it’s going to change.' The slur, typically used when the opposing goalkeeper takes a goal kick, is hardly the only offensive chant heard in soccer stadiums worldwide, but its persistent use at international tournaments has become a costly embarrassment for the Mexican soccer federation. The federation has been fined countless times by FIFA for 'discriminatory behavior' by supporters, including 100,000 Swiss francs ($114,000) for two incidents during the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. Mexico has appealed those penalties. The Mexican soccer federation long argued that the chant wasn’t aimed at gays and that the word had different connotations in contemporary Mexican culture. However, in recent years the federation launched campaigns to make it go away, with stadium announcers urging the crowd to refrain from discriminatory chants and eliciting the help of soccer stars and other celebrities to get the message across. The federation in 2022 threatened fans shouting the slur at games with five-year stadium bans. At the time, then-federation president Yon de Luisa said regardless of the intention of those using the slur, what matters is how it’s received by others. 'If it is discriminatory, we should avoid it,' said De Luisa, who later resigned after Mexico’s poor performance in Qatar where the team was eliminated in the group stage. The origin of the chant is somewhat unclear, but it’s been traced back to a 2004 Olympic qualifier between Mexico and the U.S. in Guadalajara, the capital of the state of Jalisco. It then spread to stadiums across Mexico with fans of Guadalajara soccer club Atlas. Francisco Acuña, a 55-year-old Atlas fan, said the chant was a way for fans to express emotion during the game and shouldn’t be taken too seriously. 'The people who know soccer they know that the game is intense and even players get hot-headed on the field and then they hug each other at the end of the match,' he said. Alejandro Oliva, a 40-year-old soccer fan in downtown Guadalajara, said he didn't understand why some people find the chant offensive. 'It amazes me that outside of Mexico people believe that it’s a homophobic chant. In Mexico it’s normal and it does not offend anyone,' he said. 'I think that even people from the gay community use the word, and they don’t get aggravated.' Not everyone sees it that way. 'It’s clearly homophobic because you are degrading a person with an insult of sexual and negative connotation,' said Andoni Bello, an LGBTQ+ activist and outspoken critic of the chant who played for Mexico in amateur soccer tournaments organized by the International Gay and Lesbian Football Association. He said Mexico must get rid of the chant by the 2026 World Cup when the world’s eyes will be on the country. Mexico is set to host 13 World Cup games, including four in Guadalajara. Bello urged tournament organizers to reach out to the LGBTQ+ community for help in dealing with the issue. 'It’s not just taking their pictures and saying that they are against the homophobia in the stadiums,' he said. 'There is a real opportunity to educate the Mexican fan. In the World Cup in ’86 we were world famous because of the ‘Mexican wave.’ We exported a good celebration, let’s hope to eradicate the chant because being known for homophobia is very sad.' ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer	https://apnews.com/article/mexico-usa-homophobic-chant-soccer-guadalajara-fifa-a811c077084b03beda10515fcd59f8ca	2024-10-15T01:44:53-07:00	
After 67 days adrift, a Russian man was rescued but his brother and nephew are dead	MOSCOW (AP) — A Russian man was rescued in the stormy Sea of Okhotsk after surviving for more than two months in a tiny inflatable boat that lost its engine, but his brother and nephew have died, officials said Tuesday. The prosecutor's office in the far east of Russia said that the man was rescued Monday by a fishing vessel off the Kamchatka Peninsula. It didn't name the survivor, but Russian news reports identified him as 46-year-old Mikhail Pichugin, who in early August set on a journey to watch whales in the Sea of Okhotsk together with his 49-year-old brother and 15-year-old nephew. Their bodies were reportedly found in the boat when the Angel fishing vessel rescued Pichugin. Media reports said the three men traveled to the Shantar Islands off the northwestern shore of the Sea of Okhotsk in early August. They went missing after setting off on their way back to Sakhalin Island on Aug. 9. A rescue effort was launched but failed to locate them. Russian media reported that the trio had a small food ration and about 20 liters (5.2 gallons) of water when their engine failed and they found themselves adrift. Pichugin weighed just about 50 kilograms (110 pounds) when he was found, having lost half of his body weight, news reports said. He didn't immediately say how he managed to survive in the Sea of Okhotsk, the coldest sea in East Asia and known for its gales, and how his brother and nephew died. When the crew of the fishing vessel spotted the tiny inflatable boat on their radar, they initially thought it was a buoy or a piece of junk, the Komsomolskaya Pravda newspaper said, but they turned on the spotlight to make sure and were shocked to see Pichugin. A video released by the prosecutor's office showed an emaciated man in a life jacket desperately shouting 'come here!' and the crew working to pull him back to safety. 'I have no strength left,' Pichugin said as he was taken to safety. Prosecutors said that they launched an investigation into the incident on charges of violation of safety rules that resulted in deaths.	https://apnews.com/article/russia-boat-adrift-rescue-sea-okhotsk-kamchatka-71722cac69b3f5bddb2e9d17cb9ff965	2024-10-15T01:30:18-07:00	
Taliban-run media stops showing images of living beings in some Afghan provinces	ISLAMABAD (AP) — Taliban run-media have stopped showing images of living beings in some Afghan provinces to comply with morality laws, an official confirmed Tuesday. In August, the country’s Vice and Virtue Ministry published laws regulating aspects of everyday life like public transportation, shaving, the media and celebrations reflecting authorities' interpretation of Islamic law, or Sharia. Article 17 bans the publication of images of living beings, sparking concerns about the consequences for Afghan media and press freedom. A spokesman for the Vice and Virtue Ministry, Saif ul Islam Khyber, said government media in the provinces of Takhar, Maidan Wardak and Kandahar have been advised not to air or show images of anything with a soul — meaning people and animals. Khyber told The Associated Press a day earlier that the ministry was responsible for implementing the morality laws. He did not clarify if the rules affected all media, including foreign outlets, or only Afghan channels and websites. Nor did he say how the laws would be enforced or if there was a deadline for compliance. Hujjatullah Mujadidi, the director of the Afghan Independent Journalists Union, said that Vice and Virtue Ministry officials initially told state media to stop running pictures and videos of living beings. This request was later extended to all media in those provinces. 'Last night, independent local media (in some provinces) also stopped running these videos and images and are instead broadcasting nature videos,' Mujadidi said. No other Muslim-majority country imposes similar restrictions, including Iran and Saudi Arabia. During their previous rule in the late 1990s, the Taliban banned most television, radio and newspapers altogether.	https://apnews.com/article/afghanistan-taliban-media-morality-laws-images-baf2dd860fd9c16af765faa6ea9bf8d9	2024-10-15T00:28:43-07:00	
Violence-hit Pakistan locks down the capital for an Asian security meeting	ISLAMABAD (AP) — Shaken by multiple militant attacks, Pakistani authorities have locked down the capital in a major security move as senior officials from several nations arrive for an Asian security group meeting. A three-day holiday started Monday in normally bustling Islamabad and the nearby garrison city of Rawalpindi, and Pakistan has deployed troops and blocked key roads, making it difficult even for ambulances to pass through. Some doctors asked police to remove barricades so that they could go to hospitals, but were instead asked to take longer routes. The main event of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization will be held Wednesday, when leaders and officials discuss how to boost their security cooperation and economic ties. The group was founded in 2001 by China and Russia to counter Western alliances. Other members include Iran, India, Pakistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. Militants in recent weeks have killed dozens of people in multiple attacks in restive northwestern and southwestern Pakistan bordering Afghanistan. Security experts say militants have limited capacity to strike in Islamabad. Pakistan often blames the outlawed Pakistani Taliban, who have sanctuaries in neighboring Afghanistan, for the violence. Afghanistan’s Taliban government says it does not allow anyone to use its soil for attacks against any country. Two Chinese engineers were killed on Oct. 6 in a suicide bombing outside the airport in Karachi, the capital of southern Sindh province. The attack was claimed by a separatist group. In the past, ordinary Pakistanis used to line up on both sides of the main roads to welcome any dignitaries visiting the country, but authorities said they had to take harsh security measures because of fears of militant attacks. Only state media will be allowed to cover the meetings. Among those attending were China’s Premier Li Qiang, Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin, India’s External Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, Iran’s First Vice President Mohammad Reza Aref and the prime ministers of Kyrgyzstan, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan and Mongolia.	https://apnews.com/article/pakistan-shanghai-cooperation-organization-security-meeting-ded90b37a647a03271192d2aa33daf42	2024-10-14T22:16:07-07:00	
Middle East latest: Top leaders attend an Iranian Revolutionary Guard general's funeral	The funeral of an Iranian Revolutionary Guard general killed alongside Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah drew the largest crowd of top leaders in the paramilitary organization together Tuesday for the first time since Tehran launched a ballistic missile attack on Israel. Rumors circulated for weeks over the status of the head of the Guard's expeditionary arm, Gen. Esmail Qaani, but the Quds Force leader was seen in a black bomber jacket wiping away tears early Tuesday morning at the body repatriation at Tehran’s Mehrabad International Airport. Meanwhile, Israeli strikes in the southern Gaza Strip killed at least 15 people overnight, including six children and two women, Palestinian medical officials said Tuesday. In northern Gaza, where Israel has been waging an air and ground campaign in Jabaliya for more than a week, residents said families were still trapped in their homes and shelters. It’s been more than a year since Hamas-led militants blew holes in Israel’s security fence and stormed in, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting another 250. Israel’s offensive in Gaza has killed over 42,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities, who do not say how many were fighters but say women and children make up more than half of the fatalities. The war has destroyed large areas of Gaza and displaced about 90% of its population of 2.3 million people. In solidarity with Hamas, Lebanese militant group Hezbollah has exchanged cross-border fire with Israel almost daily for the past year. Israel escalated its campaign against the group in recent weeks. ___ Here's the latest: Thousands vaccinated against polio in Gaza as the campaign enters a second phase GENEVA — The U.N. health agency says more than 92,000 children aged under 10 in central Gaza received doses of novel oral polio vaccine as a second phase of a vaccination campaign got underway. World Health Organization spokesman Tarik Jasarevic told reporters Tuesday that the kick-off a day earlier to the second round of polio vaccinations was part of efforts to reach over 179,000 kids in central Gaza – and over 590,000 across the entire strip. 'What we have received from colleagues is that the vaccination went without major issues yesterday,' he told reporters at a regular U.N. briefing in Geneva. He expressed hopes that a 'humanitarian pause' will be respected in north and south Gaza over the next six-to-eight days. Jasarevic said 92,821 children aged under 10 received the jabs on Monday, the first day of the new phase of the vaccination campaign. 'No one wants to see any child paralyzed (because of polio),' Jasarevic said. 'But there are so many other problems that people in Gaza are facing, and we need sustained access.' A police officer killed and 4 civilians wounded in a shooting in central Israel JERUSALEM — Israeli police say one officer was killed and four civilians were wounded in a shooting Tuesday on a highway in central Israel. Police did not immediately provide the identity of the shooter, but police spokeswoman, Mirit Ben Mayor, said that it was a militant attack. Police said the attacker approached the highway and shot the officer before firing on civilians, wounding four. The attacker was then shot by a paramedic arriving on the scene, Israel’s rescue services said, without saying whether the attacker was killed. The shooting occurred on a two-lane highway near the city of Yavne, just south of Tel Aviv. Ohad Yehezkeli, a spokesperson for nearby Assuta Hospital, said the officer died on the way there and another civilian was being treated for moderate injuries. He said two more wounded people were being transported to the hospital. Palestinians have carried out dozens of stabbing, shooting and car-ramming attacks against Israelis since Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack triggered the war in Gaza. Israel has ramped up military operations in the occupied West Bank, killing more than 750 Palestinians. Most have been killed during gunbattles with the army or violent protests, but the dead also include civilian bystanders. Iran's general threatens Israelis at a funeral in Tehran DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — A general in Iran’s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard directly threatened the lives of Israelis during a funeral service in Tehran for a general slain alongside Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah. The comment from Gen. Ali Fadavi, a deputy commander in chief of the Guard, comes as Iran awaits a threatened retaliation by Israel over its Oct. 1 ballistic missile attack. 'That land is a small land. It’s not even as big as one of Iran’s small provinces,' Fadavi said. 'If we will, we can obliterate all the Zionists.' Iranian officials routinely refer to Israelis as 'Zionists.' The Guard’s leadership attended a funeral service for Gen. Abbas Nilforushan, who was killed alongside Nasrallah in an airstrike in Beirut. Guard leaders and others in Iran’s theocracy have threatened to destroy Israel in the past during the more than four decades since the country’s 1979 Islamic Revolution. Israeli police accuse Hamas operatives in Turkey for August attack in Tel Aviv JERUSALEM — Israeli police accused Hamas operatives in Turkey of directing a militant attack in August in Tel Aviv in which an explosive went off on a busy street, killing the attacker and wounding a bystander. There was no immediate comment from Turkey. Relations between the two countries have plunged since the start of the war in Gaza. Turkey has long provided political support for Hamas, including welcoming its top leaders on visits, but denies involvement in its military activities. The bomb appeared to have gone off before it was planned to, and it was unclear if the attacker had planned to carry out a suicide bombing or plant the explosives. Both Hamas and the smaller Islamic Jihad militant group claimed the attack. Police said Tuesday that they filed indictments against eight suspects. They said the attacker was a militant from Nablus, in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, who had been directed by an operative in Turkey. They said one of the attack planners had traveled to Turkey several times for explosives training, and that a raid in Nablus uncovered more bombs and funds transferred from Turkey. The police did not provide evidence. 'The findings of this investigation clearly indicate the establishment of Hamas headquarters in Turkey and their extensive efforts abroad to incite violence and carry out bombings in Israel,' the police statement said. First responders recover 11 bodies from a destroyed home in northern Gaza DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — Palestinian first responders say they recovered 11 bodies, nearly all women and children, from a home destroyed in an airstrike in northern Gaza, where Israel has been waging an air and ground operation for over a week. The Gaza Health Ministry’s ambulance service said the dead recovered Tuesday were all from the same family and included seven women and three children. Fares Abu Hamza, head of the emergency service, said ambulances were only able to reach the area in the Jabaliya refugee camp around 12 hours after the airstrike late Monday. He said funeral prayers for the dead, which included a medic killed in Jabaliya, were held Tuesday in the courtyard of the Kamal Adwan Hospital. First responders from the Civil Defense said its teams evacuated three families Tuesday who were stuck inside their homes in Jabaliya for several days because of heavy fighting. Since the start of the war, the Israeli military has carried out several large operations in Jabaliya — a densely populated urban refugee camp dating back to the 1948 war surrounding Israel’s creation — only to return months later after saying militants had regrouped there. Israel launched a large operation there on Oct. 6. Top leaders are among those mourning an Iranian Revolutionary Guard general DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — The funeral of an Iranian Revolutionary Guard general killed alongside Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah drew the largest crowd of top leaders in the paramilitary organization together Tuesday for the first time since Tehran launched a ballistic missile attack on Israel. The Guard’s leadership hasn’t been as visible in the two weeks since Iran’s Oct. 1 attack on Israel. The Guard is the main power behind Iran’s theocracy and oversees its arsenal of ballistic missiles — which would be crucial in any future attack on Israel. At the funeral in Tehran for Gen. Abbas Nilforushan, the Guard’s chief commander, Gen. Hossein Salami, attended alongside President Masoud Pezeshkian and the head of the country’s judiciary. Other Guard generals also attended, including Gen. Esmail Qaani of the Guard’s expeditionary Quds Force, about whom rumors had circulated for days regarding his status after the strike that killed Nasrallah. At least two prominent Guard generals were not on hand: Gen. Amir Ali Hajizadeh, the commander of Guard’s aerospace division that oversees its missile program, and Gen. Ali Reza Tangsiri, commander of the Guard’s navy, did not attend. Iran offered no explanation for their absence, though Israel has threatened to carry out a serious retaliatory strike against Iran. Israeli strikes on south Gaza kill at least 15 overnight DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — Israeli strikes in the southern Gaza Strip killed at least 15 people overnight, including six children and two women, Palestinian medical officials said Tuesday. A strike early Tuesday hit a house in the southern town of Beni Suhaila, killing at least 10 people from one extended family, according to Nasser Hospital in nearby Khan Younis. The dead include three children and one woman, according to hospital records. An Associated Press camera operator at the hospital counted the bodies. In the nearby town of Fakhari, a strike hit a house early Tuesday, killing five people, including three children and a woman, according to the European Hospital, where the casualties were taken. The Israeli military rarely comments on individual strikes. It says it tries to avoid harming civilians and blames their deaths on Hamas, accusing the militants of sheltering in civilian areas. Israeli bombardment around Jabaliya leaves family trapped DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — In northern Gaza, where Israel has been waging an air and ground campaign in Jabaliya for more than a week, residents said families were still trapped in their homes and shelters Tuesday. Adel al-Deqes said his relatives tried to move to another place in Jabaliya in the morning, but the military shelled them. 'We don’t know who died and who is still alive,' he said. Ahmed Awda, another Jabaliya resident, said they heard 'constant bombing and gunfire' overnight and Tuesday morning. He said the military destroyed many buildings in the eastern and northern parts of the camp, which dates back to the 1948 war surrounding Israel’s creation. 'They bombed many buildings; some of them empty buildings,' he said. Iranian paramilitary leader whose status was in question is shown on state TV DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — The head of the expeditionary arm of Iran’s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard has appeared in television footage aired Tuesday by Iranian state television. Rumors circulated for weeks over Gen. Esmail Qaani’s status in the time since an Israeli airstrike that killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut in late September. But Qaani, the head of the Quds Force, was seen in a black bomber jacket, wiping away tears at an event early Tuesday morning at Tehran’s Mehrabad International Airport. While Iranian state television did not acknowledge the rumors, it made a point to film Qaani for over a minute and later share the footage from the airport ceremony online. Qaani was on hand for the repatriation to Iran of the body of Revolutionary Guard Gen. Abbas Nilforushan, 58, who was killed in the airstrike. Australia puts sanctions and travel bans on 5 Iranians WELLINGTON, New Zealand — Australia’s government has imposed targeted financial sanctions and travel bans on five Iranians contributing to the country’s missile defense program, Foreign Minister Penny Wong said Tuesday. Iran’s launch of at least 180 ballistic missiles against Israel on Oct. 1 was 'a dangerous escalation that increased the risk of a wider regional war,' Wong said in a statement. The fresh sanctions target two directors and a senior official in Iran’s Aerospace Industries Organization, the director of the Shahid Bagheri Industrial Group, and the commercial director of the Shahid Hemmat Industrial Group. The decision brings to 200 the number of Iran-linked individuals and entities now sanctioned by Australia. 'Australia will continue to hold Iran to account for its reckless and destabilizing actions,' Wong said.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-hezbollah-mideast-latest-15-october-2024-05d950e5e8f20e154aef36cab210c054	2024-10-14T21:25:02-07:00	
How did a killing at a Sikh temple lead to Canada and India expelling each other's diplomats?	NEW DELHI (AP) — Relations between India and Canada are at a low point as the countries expelled each other's top diplomats over an ongoing dispute about the killing of a Sikh activist in Canada. Canada said it had identified India’s top diplomat in the country as a person of interest in an assassination plot and expelled him and five other diplomats Monday. India has rejected the accusations as absurd, and its foreign ministry said it was expelling Canada’s acting high commissioner and five other diplomats in response. It’s the latest in an escalating dispute over the June 2023 killing of Sikh activist Hardeep Singh Nijjar. What is the dispute about? Nijjar was fatally shot in his pickup truck in June 2023 after he left the Sikh temple he led in the city of Surrey, British Columbia. An Indian-born citizen of Canada, he owned a plumbing business and was a leader in a movement to create an independent Sikh homeland, which is banned in India. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said in September 2023 there were credible allegations that India’s government had links to the killing. India denied the allegations at the time but said Nijjar was involved in 'terrorism.' How did relations get to this point? Canada expelled an Indian diplomat over the dispute last year, and in response India expelled a Canadian diplomat and froze consular services for Canadians for nearly two months. Tensions boiled over again in May, when Canadian police said they had arrested three Indian nationals accused of involvement in Nijjar’s killing and were 'investigating if there are any ties to the government of India.' India rejected the allegations, saying Canada had a 'political compulsion' to blame India. What changed on Monday? Now, Canada says that India's top diplomat in the country is a person of interest in the killing, and that police have uncovered evidence of an intensifying campaign against Canadian citizens by agents of the Indian government. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police said it had found evidence of the involvement of Indian agents 'in serious criminal activity in Canada,' including links 'to homicides and violent acts' and interference in Canada's democratic processes, among other things. Meanwhile, Canada’s foreign minister, Mélanie Joly, tied the Indian officials to Nijjar's assassination and said Canada had gathered 'ample, clear and concrete evidence which identified six individuals as persons of interest in the Nijjar case.' She said India had been asked to waive diplomatic immunity and cooperate in the investigation but refused. In a statement Monday, India’s foreign ministry said that the Canadian government 'has not shared a shred of evidence' with the Indian government, 'despite many requests from our side.' The ministry also called the accusations part of 'a deliberate strategy of smearing India for political gains.' Who was Nijjar? Nijjar was a local leader in what remains of a once-strong movement to create an independent Sikh homeland known as Khalistan. The Khalistan movement is banned in India, but has support among the Sikh diaspora, particularly in Canada. India designated Nijjar a terrorist in 2020, and at the time of his death was seeking his arrest for alleged involvement in an attack on a Hindu priest in India. New Delhi’s anxieties about Sikh separatist groups in Canada have long been a strain on the relationship, but the two countries have maintained strong defense and trade ties, and share strategic concerns over China’s global ambitions. However, India has increasingly accused Canada of giving free rein to Sikh separatists. Sikhs make up nearly 2% of Canada's population, and more than a dozen are members of the country's parliament.	https://apnews.com/article/india-canada-diplomats-expelled-sikh-assassination-67c6ee375f883a81b501cdf2c5bc2b8c	2024-10-14T20:30:34-07:00	
Stock market today: Asian shares are mostly higher after Wall St powers to more records	BANGKOK (AP) — Asian shares advanced on Tuesday after Wall Street rolled to more records, though markets in China were mostly lower. U.S. futures edged higher while oil prices shed more than $2 a barrel. Tokyo's Nikkei 225 index gained 1.3% to 40,125.60, while the Kospi in Seoul gained 0.2% to 2,627.92. In Australia, the S&amp;P/ASX 200 was up 0.8% to 8,321.40. Chinese shares extended losses after the government reported late Monday that growth in exports fell sharply in September, adding to signs of weakness in the economy. The Shanghai Composite index lost 0.5% to 3,267.13 while the Hang Seng in Hong Kong gave up 1.3% to 20,810.11. 'Market participants continue to seek for clarity around fiscal stimulus support from Chinese authorities, but the lack of commitment remains a source of reservation for risk-taking in Chinese equities,' Yeap Jun Rong of IG said in a commentary. Also early Tuesday, the dollar fell to 149.70 Japanese yen from 149.83 yen. The euro slipped to $1.0895 from $1.0911. U.S. benchmark crude dropped $2.25 to $71.58 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, skidded $2.33 to $75.13 per barrel. On Monday, Wall Street rolled to more all-time highs. The S&amp;P 500 climbed 0.8% to build on its record set on Friday, closing at 5,859.85. It’s coming off its fifth straight winning week and is on track for its longest weekly winning streak of the year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.5% to 43,065.22, adding 201 points to its own record. The Nasdaq composite gained 0.9% to 18,502.69. The gains followed relatively quiet trading in Europe, while the U.S. bond market remained closed for the day because of a holiday. Besides oil, prices also fell for copper and other commodities that a healthy Chinese economy would devour. That helped drive down prices for miners, such as Freeport-McMoRan, which fell 2.3% for one of the larger losses in the S&amp;P 500. Boeing lost 1.3% in its first trading since the aerospace giant warned that it expects to report that it burned through $1.3 billion in cash during the latest quarter and lost $9.97 per share. Boeing also said it was laying off 10% of its workforce as it tries to deal with a labor strike that is crippling production of the company’s best-selling airline planes. This week will have few top-tier economic reports outside of an update Thursday on sales at U.S. retailers. That leaves the emphasis on corporate earnings reports, which will pick up the pace this week after big banks began the reporting season last week. Bank of America, Johnson &amp; Johnson and UnitedHealth Group will all report their latest results on Tuesday. Later in the week will come United Airlines, Netflix, American Express and Procter &amp; Gamble. Analysts are looking for S&amp;P 500 companies to deliver overall growth of 4.1% in earnings per share for the latest quarter from a year earlier, according to FactSet. If they’re correct, it would be a fifth straight quarter of growth. Stocks have broadly rallied to records on relief that interest rates are finally heading back down, now that the Federal Reserve has widened its focus to include keeping the economy humming instead of just fighting high inflation. Recent reports showing the U.S. economy remains stronger than expected have also raised optimism that the Fed can pull off a perfect landing where it gets inflation down to 2% without causing a recession that many had thought would be necessary. ___ AP Business Writer Stan Choe in New York contributed.	https://apnews.com/article/stocks-markets-rates-china-earnings-9603ee04b6690dc4e80c22f02f298159	2024-10-14T20:08:54-07:00	
A Hong Kong zoo seeks answers after 9 monkeys die in 2 days	HONG KONG (AP) — Hong Kong's oldest zoo is seeking answers in a monkey medical mystery after nine animals died in two days, including three members of a critically endangered species. Part of the Hong Kong Zoological and Botanical Gardens has been sealed off and disinfected, and experts have been called in to conduct necropsies and toxicological tests, Hong Kong leader John Lee said in his weekly press briefing Tuesday. Eight monkeys were found dead on Sunday, and another died Monday after unusual behavior. The deceased animals included a De Brazza’s monkey, a common squirrel monkey, four white-faced sakis and three cotton-top tamarins — a species listed as critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. 'Whenever we have any news, if there’s a new development, an announcement should be made as soon as possible, so that everyone can know about the facts,' Lee said. On Monday, the government held an urgent interdepartmental meeting about the deaths. It said in a statement that another De Brazza’s monkey’s behavior and appetite were found to be unusual, requiring further observation. But all 80 other animals in the gardens were in normal condition, it added. The Hong Kong Zoological and Botanical Gardens — the oldest park in the former British colony — fully opened to the public in 1871. It is a rare urban oasis in the downtown Central district of the financial hub which returned to Chinese rule in 1997.	https://apnews.com/article/hong-kong-nine-monkeys-died-zoo-endangered-57cb32f0ab09bb5537385f9c6bb145ab	2024-10-14T19:44:06-07:00	
Campaigning begins for Japan's parliamentary election	TOKYO (AP) — Official campaigning for Japan's Oct. 27 parliamentary election began Tuesday with new Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba seeking a mandate for his policies and for reforms after the governing party’s political funds scandal. More than 1,300 candidates were expected to enter the races for the 465-seat Lower House before registration closes later Tuesday. Ishiba called the snap election after he took office as prime minister on Oct. 1. As customary for Liberal Democratic Party leaders over the past decade, he was to start his campaign in Fukushima to renew his pledge to support the area’s recovery from the 2011 nuclear disaster. With the early election, Ishiba is seeking to secure a majority in the lower house, the more powerful of Japan's two parliamentary chambers, before the congratulatory mood fades. The move has been criticized as prioritizing an election rather than policies and for allowing little debate. A majority for the ruling coalition would be 233 seats between his LDP and its junior coalition partner Komeito. Prior to the dissolution, the coalition held 288 seats, including 256 by LDP. The main opposition Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan, which briefly ruled Japan from 2009-2012, sees the public anger over the LDP funds scandal as a rare chance to gain ground by appealing to conservative swing voters. The liberal-leaning CDPJ is making a conservative shift and now has a centrist leader Yoshihiko Noda, also a former prime minister. 'A leadership change is the biggest political reform,' Noda said. Political watchers say Japan’s opposition has remained too fractured to push the governing party out of power, which it has held almost without interruption in postwar times. While support ratings in Kyodo News survey for Ishiba’s new government already dipped from above 50% to 42% just over a week from taking office, LDP was still by far a voter favorite among all political parties. ___ Follow AP's Asia-Pacific coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/asia-pacific	https://apnews.com/article/japan-election-campaign-ishiba-1d98dfc9af7e455ee4c15a0d3ac6f72d	2024-10-14T18:55:40-07:00	
North Korea blows up parts of inter-Korean roads as tensions with South Korea soar	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea said North Korea blew up the northern parts of inter-Korean roads no longer in use on Tuesday, as the rivals are locked in rising animosities over North Korea’s claim that South Korea flew drones over its capital, Pyongyang. South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a brief statement that North Korea blew up parts of the roads on Tuesday. It said South Korea’s military is bolstering its readiness and surveillance posture but gave no further details. The explosions came a day after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un called a meeting with his top military and security officials. During the meeting, Kim described the alleged South Korean drone flights as the 'enemy’s serious provocation' and laid out unspecified tasks related to 'immediate military action' and the operation of his 'war deterrent' for defending the country’s sovereignty, the North's state media reported earlier Tuesday. North Korea earlier put frontline artillery and other army units on standby to launch strikes on South Korea, if drones from South Korea are found over North Korea again. South Korea has refused to confirm whether it sent drones but warned it would sternly punish North Korea if the safety of its citizens is threatened. Destroying the roads would be in line with leader Kim Jong Un’s push to cut off ties with South Korea, formally cement it as his country’s principal enemy and abandon the North’s decades-long objective to seek a peaceful Korean unification. During the previous era of inter-Korean detente in the 2000s, the two Koreas reconnected two road routes and two rail tracks across their heavily fortified border. But their operations later were suspended one by one as the Koreas wrangled over North Korea’s nuclear program and other issues. Last week, North Korea said it would permanently block its border with South Korea and build front-line defense structures to cope with 'confrontational hysteria' by South Korean and U.S. forces. South Korean officials said North Korea had already been adding anti-tank barriers and laying mines along the border since earlier this year. They said North Korea has also planted mines and removed lamps along its sections of the inter-Korean roads and taken out ties on the northern side of the railways. ___ Follow AP's Asia-Pacific coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/asia-pacific	https://apnews.com/article/north-korea-roads-destroys-drones-south-0672f5baf033cf0c4ecb2f1e1b958a41	2024-10-14T18:28:22-07:00	
Who am I? A South Korean adoptee finds answers about the past — just not the ones she wants	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — Rebecca Kimmel sat in a small room, stunned and speechless, staring at the baby photo she had just unearthed from her adoption file. It was a black-and-white shot of an infant, possibly taken at an orphanage in Gwangju, the South Korean city where Kimmel had heard all her life that she’d been abandoned. But something about the photo — the eyes, the ears, an uneasy feeling deep in her gut — confirmed what she’d long suspected: This baby was not her. Overcome, she started howling like a strange, wounded animal. This photo meant that the stories she had been told about herself were a lie. So who was she? Who IS she? Thousands of South Korean adoptees are looking to satisfy a raw, compelling urge that much of the world takes for granted: the search for identity. Like many of them, Kimmel has stumbled into a web of switched photos, made-up stories and false documents, all designed to erase the very identity she desperately wants to find. These adoptees live with the consequences of a tacit partnership by the South Korean government, Western nations and adoption agencies that has supplied some 200,000 children to parents overseas, despite warnings of widespread fraud. For decades, South Korea tried to get rid of children from biracial parents, poor families, orphanages and unwed mothers, ignoring illicit practices. Western families in turn were eager to adopt from abroad, after access to birth control and abortion crushed the supply of domestic babies. While many adoptions ended happily, the desires of both sides also resulted in the unnecessary removal of generations of children from their families based on fake paperwork. As Kimmel sat weeping in that room in the Seoul adoption agency, she knew little of this background. All she knew was that she needed answers. She would find them — just not the ones she wanted. ___ Kimmel, an artist, thinks she is about 49; her exact age is one of the many things about herself she does not know. She throws herself with intensity into almost everything she does, particularly her all-consuming quest for her roots. It wasn’t always that way. Kimmel spent much of her childhood in what many adoptees call 'the fog' — a time of happy ignorance when they are oblivious to questions about their adoption. Her parents told her the origin story they’d gotten from the adoption agency: She had been abandoned as an infant on a street in Gwangju and sent to an orphanage by police. A slip of paper on her clothing listed her birth date as the day before: Aug. 4, 1975. There was no information about her biological mother or father. Her birth name was either Chung Jo Hee or Chung So Hee — the writing on the original paperwork was unclear. She was adopted six months later by a family on the U.S. East Coast. Each Jan. 21, her parents would celebrate 'Arrival Day,' a sort of second birthday that she saw as slightly embarrassing but sweet. They would display her documents and baby pictures. But a small detail nagged at her: One photo that her parents showed from South Korea didn’t look much like those of her in the United States. When she asked why, her parents just told her that babies change. 'I think my parents were just happy to have got a child,' she says, describing them as an idealistic couple who couldn’t have comprehended the deeper problems surrounding adoptions from South Korea. In 1986, the family traveled to South Korea, where adoption workers told them to visit a different orphanage than the one they’d thought Kimmel was from. It was called Namkwang, in Busan. They found no record of Kimmel. Kimmel didn’t think much of it. Back in Maryland, she was living a suburban American childhood of Michael Jackson and Madonna and malls. She went to college, moved to Los Angeles, taught and ran an art school. But a sense of loneliness crept in and became increasingly harder to ignore. Every now and then, the thought occurred to her: Was she just a girl from Maryland? Was that all? 'It didn’t seem very exciting,' she says. 'It just seemed kind of like a blank slate.' Kimmel marks 2017 as the year when the fog began to clear. One day, while searching the web for Korean makeup tutorials, she Googled 'Korean adoptions,' and fell into a whole new world. In 2017, she went to a three-day event in San Francisco with hundreds of Korean adoptees. The new ideas and friendships prompted a deep sense of urgency. She realized she was running out of time. If she was 42, how old would a birth parent be? How late was too late to find your roots? ___ The Korean adoptee diaspora is thought to be the largest in the world, with thousands returning to South Korea in recent years to look for their birth families. Fewer than a fifth of those who asked the South Korean government for help with their search were successful, records show. A big problem is that documents were often left vague or outright falsified to make children look 'abandoned' even when they had known parents. In 2018, Kimmel shut down her art classes and made a trip to South Korea that so many had done before her. She was brimming with excitement. The clinic where Kimmel was supposedly dropped off was closed, but a former doctor who had worked there recalled an orphan who had been found in front of it. 'Oh God, this is me,' Kimmel thought, tears welling in her eyes. But it was the first of many false starts. Unlike Kimmel, that orphan had been looked after by a grandmother for a while. Kimmel next visited Korea Social Service in Seoul, her adoption agency. There, she argued heatedly with a social worker who had started working at KSS in 1976, the year of her adoption. Could she get a copy of her file? No. Could she photograph her file? No. Could the social worker photograph or photocopy her file for Kimmel? No. Kimmel realized the agency did not see her identity as hers. 'Never in my life have I been more angry,' she says. 'There’s always this typical argument between adoptee and a social worker in Korea where the adoptee says, ‘That’s my information.’ And the social worker says, ‘That’s our information. It doesn’t belong to you.’' Kimmel fought until she was allowed to see her file. In the very back, she discovered a small square paper envelope with a photograph. It was similar to the one she had questioned with her parents, but shot from a different angle. And this photo made it clear: The girl was not her. 'I’d opened this Pandora’s box,' she says. 'And I didn’t feel like I could close it.' She joined multiple online forums where adoptees shared stories about their lives, their birth searches, their grievances. She posted photos of the girl in her adoption file and of herself when she first arrived in the United States, asking if they looked like the same person. Some said no. Others, including parents of adoptees, reacted as Kimmel’s parents had, saying 'babies change.' A new hunch began to emerge: Had KSS switched her identity with another girl? It had happened before. During a stay in Europe, Kimmel had been startled to meet several adoptees in Denmark who at the last minute were given the paperwork of other children. Kimmel had her adoption photos cross-checked by a dysmorphologist, a medical expert trained to identify birth defects in children, mainly from facial features. He saw distinctive differences in the ears and the area between the nose and upper lip. His conclusion: These were likely different girls. 'At that point I realized, oh my God, I went through all of this trial and trepidation to photograph a file that’s not really mine,' Kimmel says. 'It has my adoptive parents’ names; it’s a file that’s related to me. But the actual physical child is not me; the identity is not mine.' So who was Kimmel? And who was the other girl? ___ In 2019, she returned to KSS in South Korea. This time, the same social worker allowed Kimmel to search the agency’s file room herself. In the paperwork for 1976, Kimmel found what she believed was her 'real file,' with five identical black-and-white photos of a girl and a slide negative. She was struck by the similarities to early photos of herself in the United States. 'I felt like I was looking into my own soul,' she says. At last, a breakthrough. Yet the details were perplexing. The documents said the girl had serious leg deformities that made her unable to sit. But the medical notes written just days earlier described a healthy girl with nothing more than a cough and diarrhea. Had the agency somehow blended information from two different girls? She again consulted the dysmorphologist, this time to compare the photos she had just found to those of herself in the United States. She expected a match. But once again, he concluded that they were different girls. Kimmel was shaken. She felt such a connection with this girl. Could she be a sibling? Maybe even a twin? ___ Kimmel threw herself into examining the complex numerical system KSS used to log adoption cases, based on hundreds of case numbers she collected from other KSS adoptees. In 2021, she revisited the agency with a long wish list of files. The meeting, which the AP attended, resulted in a tense back-and-forth for hours with the same long-time social worker. Kimmel struggled to contain her fury, waving her hands in disgust. 'You lied,' she fumed. Visibly irritated, the social worker shuttled back and forth from the room to a document storage area. But each of the files she brought out had no information on Kimmel. The social worker looked drained. She denied that the agency was withholding information. But she had no explanation for why it couldn’t present a single document with Kimmel’s information. Or why the photo in her file was of a different girl. Or why KSS had told her adoptive parents she was from the Namkwang orphanage in Busan. The pressure grew until the social worker acknowledged a startling practice: Switching children’s identities was common among South Korean agencies during the adoption rush of the 1970s and 1980s. When children died, became too sick or were retaken by birth families, the agencies simply swapped in other children. Western agencies or adopters were willing to take any child of the same sex or similar age, because 'it would take too much time to start over again,' the KSS social worker said. Could Kimmel have been one of those children? 'I can’t say with confidence that there’s absolutely no possibility that a different child was sent from here,' the worker confessed. The worker has retired, and AP has been unable to reach her since. KSS did not respond to requests for comment. Switched documents may be one reason agencies are so reluctant to fully open their files to adoptees, says Lee Kyung-eun, a former director of childcare policy at South Korea’s Health and Welfare Ministry. Even the agencies can’t tell which records are real. Some adoptees the AP talked with spent years getting to know people they were told were biological parents, only to have DNA tests show they weren’t related. 'It could be less about hiding records,' Lee says, 'and more about not having much to give.' ___ Kimmel was exhausted. But she refused to accept that this was all she was going to get. Still thinking she was a twin, she had been scouring message boards for twin sisters looking for their birth parents, or birth parents looking for twin girls. Now she had one clue left: A message written by an old man named Park Jong-kyun, looking for twin girls relinquished for adoption sometime between 1973 and 1976. Park had left detailed information about his full name, his wife’s names, their sons’ names, their birth dates. He described a small village, which Kimmel tracked down on the southern South Korean resort island of Jeju. Kimmel went. Within hours, with the help of local police, she met Park. Park is a slight man with kind eyes, who lives in a small, weathered house surrounded by tangerine bushes and flowers that remind him of his daughters. His twins were born at a time when he and his late wife were struggling financially to raise three sons. His wife needed an emergency C-section, which the couple couldn’t afford. The hospital persuaded them to give away the twin girls to relieve the financial burden and toll on his wife’s health, Park says. He named his girls after the Korean words for rose and chrysanthemum. He wrote the twins’ birthdate – May 11, 1973 – on two pieces of paper and put them in their clothing, hoping to find them someday. Park searched for the girls for decades, putting in requests with the government and Holt Children’s Services, South Korea’s biggest adoption agency. Government officials told him his twins were likely adopted to the United States through Holt, based on their birthdate and hospital. In 2018, he visited Holt and the government agency that helped with adoption searches. He sent them boxes of Jeju tangerines, hoping they would remember him and look for his daughters. When Kimmel came to Jeju in 2021, Park was excited and very surprised. They spent days together, eating in restaurants, talking and laughing as they communicated with translation apps. Park taped Kimmel’s U.S. baby photos on a wall of his small home. Yet he felt instinctively that she was not his daughter. His doubts were confirmed when a DNA test showed no relation. Kimmel was devastated. But in the wake of her grief, she realized that his twins could still be somewhere out in the world. Kimmel arranged to have kits from an American DNA testing firm sent to South Korea. She traveled back to Jeju to test Park and a nearby island to test his son. It took just three weeks for the company to locate Park’s daughters — Becca Webster and Dee Iraca. ___ The twins are very different. Webster, a nanny with a son in college, is whimsical, chatty and easygoing. Iraca, who works as a chef and dietitian, is meticulous, serious and always on the go. Her nickname is Speedy Dee-Dee. Those differences are what prompted them to take a DNA test in the first place; they wanted to confirm for themselves that they are biological sisters. Adopted by the same American family, their files described them as abandoned in front of a hospital. Anytime they thought about searching for their birth parents, they felt overwhelmed. 'Abandoned is such a hard word….It feels so hollow,' Webster says. 'When you’re told a narrative that you’ve been abandoned, left as a baby, where are you going to go with that?' They traveled to South Korea for the 2018 Winter Olympics and visited Holt’s office in Seoul, just months after Park went there. A social worker for Holt told the twins that the agency had no further documents for them. Which led them to wonder: If they’d just been left on a doorstep, how could anyone have really known they were twins? The results were reassuring; they were indeed sisters. But the test led to a baffling turn: A stranger sent them a note pointing out that the DNA site also registered a man called 'Mr. P' as their father. They were stunned. They asked the DNA company if this was a scam. It wasn’t. The stranger turned out to be Kimmel. She told them that their father had been looking for them for decades. 'Even now sometimes, it feels like a dream,' Iraca says. They felt guilty that so many adoptees, including Kimmel, had been desperately searching for their families, and their father had been searching for them. But they hadn’t been searching. 'It wasn’t about not wanting to know,' Webster says. 'It was about cutting that emotion off because we didn’t think we had a choice.' In October 2022, the twins went to South Korea. Park waited for them anxiously at the airport, holding up a handwritten English sign that read 'Dee, Becca, welcome to Korea.' He brought two bouquets of flowers: one roses and the other chrysanthemums. He made sure to give the right bouquet to the right daughter. He hugged them. 'Thank you for waiting for me,' he said. He spoke only Korean. They spoke only English and came across as unmistakably American. At one point, as they tried to walk inside his home, he said, 'No, no, no, no'; they hadn’t followed the Korean practice of taking off their shoes. But for all the differences, the twins felt an instant connection. Park showed them photos on his wall of his own father and mother. They met their Korean brother and their uncles and aunts, who hosted a welcome party. These strangers who were somehow still family touched the sisters’ faces and speculated on who looked like whom. Park gave each of them a hanbok, a traditional Korean garment. They wore them to a Buddhist temple where there’s a memorial photo of their mother. Back in North Carolina, the sisters are now taking care of their adoptive mother, who has health challenges, and it’s difficult to find the time and money to visit South Korea. But they want to make the effort to get to know their father.. They call him K-Dad, to differentiate from their adoptive father, who died more than a decade ago. He sends them packages of seaweed and green tea. They are left with mixed feelings. After all, they ended up happy in America. Yet their happiness was built on an injustice that hurt thousands, including their birth father. They resent that they learned of their identity from a stranger, and that they were too late to meet their mother. 'We have both built such incredible lives that it’s hard to look at that and anything negative about it,' Webster says. '(Yet) there’s a part of it that we feel sad.' Park, too, has mixed feelings. He wears a huge smile when he talks about meeting his daughters again. Their pictures cover his walls, along with taped memos of English words and expressions. Eager to talk with them, he has bought several English books, but says he isn’t getting anywhere. It was painful for him to see his daughters leave. He’s frustrated that Holt, which didn’t respond to AP’s request for comment, missed an opportunity to reunite them as early as 2018. In his mid-80s and still struggling financially, Park can’t afford a long and expensive trip to America. 'It’s sad,' Park says. 'There’s so little time left for me.' ___ That still leaves Kimmel. She feels a bittersweet thrill that she managed to reunite the twins with their father. They joke that they are triplets — two Beccas and a Dee. Kimmel also spends hours helping and advising other adoptees. She is a key contributor to an adoption-focused website called Paperslip, named after the word that frequently — and sometimes falsely — appears in the files of KSS adoptees described as abandoned. Her adoptive parents, who could not have birth children, have struggled with their unintended role in a deeply flawed system. Her mother is afraid that Kimmel’s obsession with her past has taken a toll on her well-being. Her father says he would not have considered international adoption 'had I known of the deception and what it has done to so many adoptees in their search for their identity.' Kimmel still does not know — and may never know — who she is. All she knows is who she’s not. And that leaves her in limbo, torn between a mind that sees no point in searching further and a heart that can’t seem to give up. 'I’m almost 50 years old, and I still don’t know when I was born, or what city I was born in,' she says. 'I don’t know my birth parents. There’s nothing that I know about myself as real.' She often looks at the photo of the girl she still believes is her twin. Like Kimmel herself — like thousands of others — her story remains a mystery. ___ PBS Frontline’s Lora Moftah contributed to this report.

UN Security Council voices 'strong concern' for UN peacekeepers after Israeli attacks	UNITED NATIONS (AP) — The U.N. Security Council expressed 'strong concern' Monday as Israel has fired on and wounded U.N. peacekeepers in southern Lebanon during intensified fighting, reiterating its support for their role in supporting security in the region. It's the first statement by the U.N.’s most powerful body since Israel's attacks on the positions of the peacekeeping force known as UNIFIL began last week, drawing international condemnation. U.N. peacekeeping chief Jean-Pierre Lacroix told reporters that Secretary-General António Guterres confirmed Monday that peacekeepers will remain in all their positions even as Israel has urged the peacekeepers to move 5 kilometers (3 miles) north during its ground invasion in Lebanon. Israel has been escalating its campaign against Hezbollah in Lebanon across a U.N.-drawn boundary between the two countries. The sides have been clashing since the Iranian-backed militant group started firing rockets a year ago in solidarity with its ally Hamas in Gaza. Hamas' deadly attacks in southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, launched the war. The Security Council statement, issued after emergency closed consultations on Lebanon, did not name either Israel, Lebanon or Hezbollah. Read by Swiss U.N. Ambassador Pascale Baeriswyl, the council's current president, it urges all parties 'to respect the safety and security of UNIFIL personnel and U.N. premises.' The 15-member Security Council has been deeply divided over the war in Gaza, with the United States defending its ally Israel as support for the Palestinians has grown among members and casualties have escalated. The Biden administration has become more critical of civilian deaths as well as the recent attacks on UNIFIL. US. deputy ambassador Robert Wood told reporters that 'it’s good that the council can speak with one voice on what’s on the minds of all people around the world right now — and it’s the situation in Lebanon.' The council's statement sends a message to the Lebanese people 'that the council cares, that the council is watching this issue and that the council today spoke with one voice,' Wood said. Council members also expressed 'deep concern' at civilian casualties and suffering, the destruction of civilian infrastructure and the rising number of internally displaced people. More than 1,400 people in Lebanon, including civilians, medics and Hezbollah fighters, have been killed and 1.2 million displaced in the past month. Around 60 Israelis have been killed in Hezbollah strikes in the past year. Israel says it wants to drive the militant group away from the border so some 60,000 displaced Israelis can return to their homes. The Security Council statement called on all parties to abide by international humanitarian law, which requires the protection of civilians. Council members also called for the full implementation of Security Council Resolution 1701, which ended the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war 'and recognized the need for further practical measures to achieve that outcome.' That resolution calls for the Lebanese army to deploy throughout the south and for all armed groups, including Hezbollah, to be disarmed — neither of which has happened in the past 18 years. Lacroix, the undersecretary-general for peace operations, told reporters after his closed briefing to the Security Council that five UNIFIL peacekeepers have been injured in recent days and that the U.N. has protested to Israel. Israel has indicated 'investigations will be carried out regarding some of these incidents ... and we will see what comes out of this,' he said. Israeli Army spokesman Lt. Col. Nadav Shoshani asserted Sunday that Israel has tried to maintain constant contact with UNIFIL and that any instance of U.N. forces being harmed will be investigated at 'the highest level.' Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has called for UNIFIL to heed Israel’s warnings to evacuate, accusing them of 'providing a human shield' to Hezbollah. 'We regret the injury to the UNIFIL soldiers, and we are doing everything in our power to prevent this injury. But the simple and obvious way to ensure this is simply to get them out of the danger zone,' he said Sunday in a video addressed to the U.N. secretary-general, who has been banned from entering Israel. Lacroix on Monday stressed that all parties have a responsibility to ensure the safety and security of the peacekeepers. He also said it’s important that the peacekeepers stay in their positions 'because we all hope there will be a return to the negotiation table, and that there will be finally a real effort to full implementation of resolution 1701.' —— This story Corrects the first name of the U.N. peacekeeping chief in the third paragraph to Jean-Pierre Lacroix	https://apnews.com/article/un-lebanon-israel-security-council-statement-hezbollah-e391d8ffe57eebcf8bc294310bb922bd	2024-10-14T14:59:13-07:00	
Sending a THAAD air defense system to Israel adds to strain on US Army forces	WASHINGTON (AP) — The deployment of a U.S. Terminal High Altitude Area Defense battery to Israel and roughly 100 soldiers to operate it will add to already difficult strains on the Army's air defense forces and potential delays in modernizing its missile defense systems, Army leaders said Monday. The service's top two leaders declined to provide details on the deployment ordered by Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin over the weekend. But they spoke broadly about their concerns as the demand for THAAD and Patriot missile batteries grows because of the war in Ukraine and the escalating conflict between Israel and Iran-backed Hezbollah and Hamas militants. 'The air defense, artillery community is the most stressed. They have the highest ‘optempo’ really of any part of the Army,' Army Secretary Christine Wormuth said, using a phrase meaning the pace of operations. 'We’re just constantly trying to be as disciplined as we can, and give Secretary Austin the information he needs to accurately assess the strain on the force when he’s considering future operational deployments.' Wormuth said the Army has to be careful about 'what we take on. But of course, in a world this volatile, you know, sometimes we have to do what we have to do.' The Pentagon announced the THAAD deployment Sunday, saying it was authorized at the direction of President Joe Biden. U.S. officials said the system will be moved from a location in the continental United States to Israel and that it will take a number of days for it and the soldiers to arrive. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss details of troop movements. The move adds to what have been growing tensions within the Defense Department about what weapons the U.S. can afford to send to Ukraine, Israel or elsewhere and the resulting risks to America's military readiness and its ability to protect the nation. 'Everybody wants U.S. Army air defense forces,' Gen. Randy George, Army chief of staff, said Monday as he and Wormuth took questions from journalists at the Association of the U.S. Army’s annual conference. 'This is our most deployed formation.' The decision to send the THAAD came as Israel is widely believed to be preparing a military response to Iran’s Oct. 1 attack, when it fired roughly 180 missiles into Israel. Israel already has a multilayered air defense system, but a Hezbollah drone attack on an army base Sunday killed four soldiers and severely wounded seven others, underscoring the potential need for greater protection. Israeli forces and Hezbollah fighters in Lebanon have been clashing since Oct. 8, 2023, when the Lebanese militant group began firing rockets over the border in support of its ally Hamas in Gaza. The Sunday drone attack was Hezbollah's deadliest strike since Israel launched its ground invasion of Lebanon nearly two weeks ago. Since the THAAD deployment only involves about 100 soldiers, it won't add a tremendous amount of additional strain on air defense forces, Wormuth said at the conference. But it adds to the pace of their deployments. Since the frenetic pace of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars has subsided, the military has tried to ensure that service members have sufficient time at home to train and reset between deployments. Shrinking that so-called dwell time can have an impact on the Army's ability to keep good soldiers in the force. 'They're very good, but obviously deploying for a year and coming back for a year and deploying for a year — it's tough to do for anybody,' George said. He said the Army is looking at a range of ways to limit the impact on recruiting and retention, including growing the force and modernizing the systems so that it takes fewer soldiers to operate them. But the repeated deployments makes it difficult to get the systems into the depots where they can be upgraded. As a result, Wormuth said, Army leaders are trying to make their arguments as clear as possible when combatant commanders go to Austin and ask for another Patriot system in the Middle East or another one for Ukraine. 'We need to be able to bring these units home to be able to go through that modernization process,' she said. 'So we’re trying to lay that out for Secretary Austin so that he can weigh those risks — essentially current versus future risks — as he makes recommendations to the president about whether to send the Patriot here or there.'	https://apnews.com/article/army-israel-thaad-air-defense-strains-e49a65aaaf3a4ff051b54eebb869f241	2024-10-14T12:35:08-07:00	
The pandas are coming! The pandas are coming!	WASHINGTON (AP) — The National Zoo's long dark panda drought seems to be coming to an end. Eleven months after the zoo sent its three wildly popular pandas — Mei Xiang, Tian Tian and their cub Xiao Qi Ji — back to China, a new pair of bears is set to arrive. A pair of three-year old giant pandas, named Bao Li and Qing Bao, have left a research facility in the southwestern Chinese city of Dujiangyan and will soon be flown to Washington, according to a statement by the China Wildlife Conservation Association. 'Food prepared for the trip includes corn bread, bamboo and carrots, as well as water and medicine,' the statement said, adding that the partnership will 'make new contributions in protecting global biodiversity and enhance the friendship of the people from the two countries.' It's unclear exactly when the bears will arrive in Washington, but there will likely be an extended quarantine and acclimation period before they are introduced to the public. On Monday evening, the zoo's website posted an alert that the entire facility would be closed Tuesday, without giving a reason. The lead article on the site still said the pandas would be coming sometime before the end of the year. Bao Li (precious vigor) and Qing Bao (green treasure) arrive in Washington as part of a new 10-year agreement with Chinese authorities. The previous deal expired last year, leading to some concern among American panda-lovers that Beijing was gradually pulling its furry friendship ambassadors from American zoos amid rising diplomatic tensions. Breeding pairs in zoos in Memphis and San Diego had already returned to China earlier and the four pandas in the Atlanta zoo left for China last week. That anxiety turned to optimism last November when Chinese President Xi Jinping publicly stated a desire to continue the panda exchange programs. This year, a new pair of bears has been delivered to the San Diego Zoo, while another pair has been promised to San Francisco. In Washington, National Zoo officials remained conspicuously silent about negotiations for a new panda agreement, but they expressed optimism about striking a new deal and launched a multimillion-dollar renovation of its panda enclosure in anticipation. Then in late May, zoo director Brandie Smith teamed up with first lady Jill Biden to announce that Bao Li and Qing Bao would be arriving by the end of this year. The Chinese announcement said the National Zoo had sent 'three experienced keepers and veterinary experts' to China to assist the transport and accompany the bears. Zoo officials on Monday declined to confirm the Chinese announcement. Zoo spokesperson Jennifer Zoon said in an email, 'For the safety of animals and staff, we are not able to confirm any details at this time.' But signs at the zoo and on its social media site have heralded the planned return of the pandas and panda-themed merchandise still dominates the gift shops. 'The giant pandas are an iconic part of the Washington, D.C., story, both for locals and incoming travelers alike,' said Elliott L. Ferguson, II, president and CEO of Destination DC. 'The interest and excitement associated with their return directly benefits the entire city, bringing further interest and visitors to our hotels, restaurants and other attractions.' The exact terms of the deal are still unclear; under previous 10-year agreements the Chinese government receives $1 million per year, per bear. Any cubs born in overseas zoos are typically returned to China before they reach age four. Pandas have become one of the unofficial symbols of the nation's capital, dating back to 1972 when the first pair — Ling Ling and Hsing Hsing — were sent as a gift from Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai following President Richard Nixon's historic diplomatic visit to China. Later, a rolling series of 10-year cooperation agreements was struck. Liu Pengyu, a spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in Washington, credited the decades of cooperation with advancing research into panda preservation and breeding. During the lifespan of these agreements, giant pandas have been reclassified from an endangered species to merely vulnerable. 'The current round of cooperation will focus on prevention and treatment of major diseases, and protection of habitats and wild giant panda populations,' Liu said in an email. 'We hope the arrival of the pandas will inject fresh impetus into exchanges between China and the U.S., and help to stabilize the broader bilateral relationship as well.'	https://apnews.com/article/pandas-national-zoo-china-8537ae9f9be4134c795fc5f007c02064	2024-10-14T10:50:57-07:00	
A bus carrying university students crashes, killing 12 and injuring 33 in Egypt's northeast	CAIRO (AP) — A bus carrying university students crashed and overturned on a highway in northeastern Egypt Monday, killing 12 people and injuring 33 others, the health ministry said in a statement. Students from the Suez-based Galala University were on board. Local media reported they were returning from their classes to their dormitory in Ain Sokhna resort, using the new Galala highway, when the accident happened, and that the driver was arrested as part of an investigation into the crash. The ministry didn’t reveal what caused the accident. The statement Monday night said 28 ambulances rushed to the site and transported the injured to the Suez Medical Complex, but didn't disclose their condition. Minister of Health, Khaled Abdel-Ghaffar, and Minister of High Education, Ayman Ashour, expressed their condolences to the families of the students. Deadly traffic accidents claim thousands of lives every year in Egypt, which has a poor transportation safety record. Speeding, bad roads, and poor enforcement of traffic laws mostly cause the collisions.	https://apnews.com/article/egypt-bus-crash-suez-university-students-7b69d1972f90cd514d558c6d6c8a0ddf	2024-10-14T09:54:26-07:00	
Italy sends the first ship with migrants to Albania as rights groups warn of a dangerous precedent	ROME (AP) — Italy is transferring the first group of migrants to Albania, the Interior Ministry said Monday, as part of a contentious plan to process thousands of asylum-seekers outside its borders. A naval ship departed from the island of Lampedusa with 16 men — 10 from Bangladesh and six from Egypt — who were rescued at sea after departing from Libya. The ship is expected to arrive Wednesday morning, a ministry spokesman said. Premier Giorgia Meloni's far-right government on Friday formally opened the two centers in Albania where Italy plans to process thousands of male migrants requesting asylum after being intercepted in international waters while trying to cross to Europe. The centers can accommodate up to 400 migrants at first, with that expected to increase to 880 in a few weeks, according to Italian officials. Women, children, older people and those who are ill or victims of torture will be accommodated in Italy. Families will not be separated. The five-year deal was endorsed last year by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen as an example of 'out-of-box thinking' in tackling the migration issue, but human rights groups say it sets a dangerous precedent. A spokesman for the U.N. refugee agency, which has expressed serious concerns, said Monday that one of its teams was conducting an 'independent mission' on board the ship to monitor the screening process. The agency also known as UNHCR has agreed to supervise the first three months to help 'safeguard the rights and dignity of those subject to it.' The agreement, signed last year, calls for Albania to house up to 3,000 male migrants while Italy fast-tracks their asylum claims. The migrants will retain their right under international and EU law to apply for asylum in Italy and have their claims processed there. The two centers will cost Italy 670 million euros ($730 million) over five years. The facilities will be run by Italy and are under Italian jurisdiction, while Albanian guards will provide external security. Meloni and her right-wing allies have long demanded that European countries share more of the migration burden. ___ Follow AP coverage of migration: https://apnews.com/hub/migration	https://apnews.com/article/italy-albania-migration-centers-asylum-seekers-fb89f5aece2504bf0267180bc3fd1a7d	2024-10-14T09:45:03-07:00	
Paris Motor Show opens during a brewing EV trade war between the EU and China	PARIS (AP) — Auto manufacturers competing to persuade drivers to go electric are rolling out cheaper, more tech-rich models at the Paris Motor Show, targeting everyone from luxury clients to students yet to receive their driving licenses. The biennial show has long been a major industry showcase, tracing its history to 1898. Chinese manufacturers are attending in force, despite European Union threats to punitively tax imports of their electric vehicles in a brewing trade war with Beijing. Long-established European manufacturers are fighting back with new efforts to win consumers who have balked at high-priced EVs. Here's a look at the show's opening day on Monday. MORE NEW MODELS FROM CHINA Chinese EV startups Leapmotor and XPeng showcased models they said incorporate artificial intelligence technology. Leapmotor, founded in 2015, unveiled a compact electric-powered SUV, the B10. It will be manufactured in Poland for European buyers, said Leapmotor's head of product planning, Zhong Tianyue. Leapmotor didn't announce a price for the B10 that will launch next year. Leapmotor also said a smaller electric commuter car it showcased in Paris, the T03, will retail from a competitive 18,900 euros ($20,620). Those sold in France will be imported from China but assembled in Poland, Zhong said. Leapmotor also announced a starting price of 36,400 euros ($39,700) in Europe for its larger family car, the C10. Sales outside of China are through a joint venture with Stellantis, the world’s fourth largest carmaker. Leapmotor said European sales started in September. XPENG BRACES FOR TARIFF HIT Attending the Paris show for the first time, the decade-old Chinese EV manufacturer XPeng unveiled a sleek sedan, the P7+. CEO He Xiaopeng said XPeng aims to deliver in Europe from next year. Intended European prices for the P7+ weren't given, but the CEO said they will start in China at 209,800 yuan, the equivalent of 27,100 euros, or $29,600. XPeng's president, Brian Gu, said the EU's threatened import duties could complicate the company's expansion plans if Brussels and Beijing don't find an amicable solution to their trade dispute before an end-of-October deadline. Brussels says subsidies help Chinese companies to unfairly undercut EU industry prices, with Chinese-built electric cars jumping from 3.9% of the EV market in 2020 to 25% by September 2023. 'The tariff will put a lot of pressure on our business model. It's a direct hit on our margin, which is already not very high,' Gu said. VEHICLES FOR YOUNG TEENS Manufacturers of small electric vehicles that can be driven in Europe without a license are finding a growing market among teens as young as 14 and their parents who, for safety reasons, prefer that they zip around on four wheels than on motorbikes. Several manufacturers of the two-seaters are showcasing in Paris, including France's Citroen. The starting price for its Ami, or 'Friend,' is just under 8,000 euros ($8,720). Launched in France in 2020, the plastic-shelled vehicle is now also sold in other European markets and in Turkey, Morocco and South America. 'It's not a car. It's a mobility object,' said Citroen's product chief for the Ami, Alain Le Gouguec. European legislation allows teenagers without a full license to drive the Ami and similar buggies from age 14 after an eight-hour training course. They're limited to a top speed of 45 kilometers per hour (28 mph). The vehicles are also finding markets among adults who lost their license for driving infractions or who never got a full license, and outside cities in areas with poor transport. Renault subsidiary Mobilize said that even in winter's energy-sapping cold its two-seater, no-license, plastic-shelled Duo can go 100 kilometers (over 60 miles) between charges. A phone app acts as its door and ignition key. Another French manufacturer, Ligier, sells its no-license two-seaters in both diesel and electric versions.	https://apnews.com/article/paris-motor-show-electric-vehicles-china-tariffs-france-a6499490194344cbbeb233fa75b0eb32	2024-10-14T08:14:55-07:00	
Hezbollah's drones are a fierce and evasive threat to Israel	TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — One of the worst mass casualty strikes on Israel in a year of war came not from dozens of Iranian ballistic missiles nor the repeated barrages of rocket fire launched by Hamas and Hezbollah. Instead, it was a single drone. The unmanned aerial vehicle, laden with explosives, evaded Israel's multilayered air-defense system and slammed into a mess hall at a military training camp deep inside Israel, killing four soldiers and wounding dozens. It’s the latest achievement for Hezbollah’s drone fleet and has shined a light on Israel’s struggle over the past year of war to knock down unmanned aircraft incoming from as far away as Yemen, Iraq and Iran. Over the years, Israel has built up its aerial defense array to provide broad protection against short-range rocket fire and medium- and long-range missiles, although experts caution it is not airtight. While the system has taken down drones repeatedly, many have penetrated Israel's airspace and sidestepped its defenses, in some cases with deadly results. The drone traversed Israeli airspace unimpeded On Sunday evening, reports emerged of a mass casualty event about 65 kilometers (40 miles) from the Lebanese border. A drone had slammed into a mess hall filled with troops eating dinner, according to Israeli media, killing four soldiers and wounding 67 people. Minutes earlier, air raid sirens had blared in northern Israel as the aircraft flew overhead. But no sirens sounded at the base, giving the soldiers no advance warning and indicating that the drone may have fallen off Israel’s radar. An Israeli security official said Israel was still investigating how the drone made it through Israel’s air defenses. A pair of drones initially entered Israeli airspace, but while one was shot down, the other one continued to its target. Hezbollah, which said the attack was in response to Israeli strikes in Lebanon, said the drone was 'able to penetrate the Israeli air defense radars without being detected' and reach its target. It claimed it had outsmarted Israel's air defenses by simultaneously launching dozens of missiles and 'squadrons' of drones simultaneously. It was the second deadly drone strike in just two weeks. Earlier this month, a drone launched from Iraq killed two Israeli soldiers and wounded roughly two dozen, according to Israeli media. On Friday, during a major Jewish holiday, a Hezbollah drone slammed into a nursing home in central Israel, causing damage. 'We already have six dead in the past 10 days from drones. That’s too much,' said Ran Kochav, a former head of the Israeli military’s aerial defense command. Drones, he said, 'have become a real threat.' Drones are harder to detect and track than rockets or missiles Drones, or UAVs, are unmanned aircraft that can be operated from afar. Drones can enter, surveil and attack enemy territory more discreetly than missiles and rockets. Israel has a formidable arsenal of drones, capable of carrying out spy missions and attacks. It has developed a drone capable of reaching archenemy Iran, some 1500 kilometers (1,000 miles) away. But Israel's enemies have caught Israel off-guard on a number of occasions over the past year, often with deadly consequences. In July, a drone launched from Yemen travelled some 270 kilometers (160 miles) from Israel’s southern tip, all the way to Tel Aviv, slamming into a downtown building and killing one person without it having been intercepted. The Israeli security official said drones are harder to detect for a number of reasons: They fly slowly and often include plastic components, having a weaker thermal footprint with radar systems than powerful rockets and missiles. The trajectory is also harder to track. Drones can have roundabout flight paths, can come from any direction, fly lower to the ground and — because they are much smaller than rockets — can be mistaken for birds. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because the investigation into the mess hall strike was still underway. Kochav said that Israel spent years focusing on strengthening its air defense systems to improve protection against rockets and missiles. But drones were not seen as a top priority. During the current fighting, that has meant Israel’s ability to detect and intercept drones is not as successful as its capabilities in the face of rockets and missiles, Kochav said. Hezbollah's drone program receives support from Iran Hezbollah began using Iranian-made drones after Israel withdrew from southern Lebanon in 2000 and sent the first reconnaissance Mirsad drone over Israel’s airspace in 2004. Hezbollah’s drone program still receives substantial assistance from Iran, and the UAVs are believed to be assembled by experts of the militant group in Lebanon. Drones have become an 'Iranian-inspired, strategic system' for Hezbollah, according to Tal Beeri, the director of research for The Alma Research and Education Center, a think tank that studies Hezbollah and Israel's north. The militant group has launched roughly 1,500 surveillance and attack drones since it began striking Israel in October 2023, according to the group's count. The attack drones, which Beeri said often hit civilian targets, have a payload of 10 kilograms (22 lbs) of explosives and can fly hundreds of kilometers (miles). He said Hezbollah in May used for the first and only time a drone that was able to fire an anti-tank missile and that it may possess more. Hezbollah has also used drones to erode Israel’s air-defense capabilities by slamming them into the very batteries and infrastructure meant to take them down. Earlier this year, Hezbollah said it used an Ababil explosive drone to down Israel’s Sky Dew observation balloon, a component of its aerial defense. On Monday evening, Hezbollah released a video showing some of its militants in a warehouse full of drones. The video shows drones on launchers and at the end displays a caption that reads: 'Our capabilities are intact.' Israel says it is working to tackle the threat On Monday, on a visit to the training camp hit by the drone, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant pledged to learn from the strike and said Israel was 'concentrating significant efforts in developing solutions' to tackle the drone threat, without elaborating. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also visited the base and soldiers injured in the attack, noting that Israel had paid 'a painful price.' Kochav said there were ways to combat the drones that could be considered. Detection capabilities could be expanded to include acoustic radars to pick up on the sound of the drone's engine or electro-optics, which could allow Israeli surveillance to better identify them. He said rockets, fighter jets and helicopters could be deployed for interception, and that electronic warfare could be used to overtake the drones and divert them. 'We were busy in recent years ... and unmanned (aerial vehicles) was not a top priority,' he said. 'The results unfortunately are not good.' ___ Associated Press writers Josef Federman in Jerusalem, and Abby Sewell and Bassem Mroue in Beirut, contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/hezbollah-drones-iran-israel-war-hamas-iran-houthi-386ae3c8deeb4c8997e64c954c3670e5	2024-10-14T07:01:59-07:00	
Kenya moves 50 elephants to a larger park, says it's a sign poaching is low	MWEA, Kenya (AP) — As a helicopter hovers close to an elephant, trying to be as steady as possible, an experienced veterinarian cautiously takes aim. A tranquilizer dart whooshes in the air, and within minutes the giant mammal surrenders to a deep slumber as teams of wildlife experts rush to measure its vitals and ensure it's doing OK. Kenya is suffering from a problem, albeit a good one: The elephant population in the 42-square-kilometer (16-square-mile) Mwea National Reserve, east of the capital Nairobi, has flourished from its capacity of 50 to a whopping 156, overwhelming the ecosystem and requiring the relocation of about 100 of the largest land animals. It hosted 49 elephants in 1979. According to the Kenya Wildlife Service Director General Erustus Kanga, the overpopulation in Mwea highlighted the success of conservation effort s over the last three decades. 'This shows that poaching has been low and the elephants have been able to thrive,' Kanga said. Experts started relocating 50 elephants last week to the expansive 780-square-kilometer (301-square-mile) Aberdare National Park in central Kenya. As of Monday, 44 elephants had been moved from Mwea to Aberdare, with six others scheduled for Tuesday. Tourism Minister Rebecca Miano oversaw the move of five of the elephants on Monday, saying: 'This will go down in history as a record, as it is the biggest exercise of its kind. It is the first time we are witnessing the translocation of 50 elephants at a go.' The process started at dawn and involved a team of more than 100 wildlife specialists, with equipment ranging from specially fitted trucks to aircraft and cruisers. A fixed-wing aircraft conducted aerial surveillance to track down herds of elephants, which naturally move in small families of about five. The craft was in constant communication with two helicopters used to herd and separate the elephants to ensure they were relocated with their family units. Aboard one of the helicopters is a spotter, on the lookout for elephants, and a veterinarian with a tranquilizer gun. Once an elephant is sedated, a ground team of veterinary specialists and rangers rushes to find it and clear thickets to make way for transport crews. Its vitals are monitored as another group of rangers works on lifting the massive animal, weighing hundreds of kilograms, onto specialized trucks, to be driven 120 kilometers (74 miles) to their new home. Kanga, the wildlife service director, said the relocation also aimed at curbing human-wildlife conflict. Boniface Mbau, a resident of the area, said: 'We are very happy that the government has decided to reduce the number of elephants from the area. Due to their high numbers, they did not have enough food in the reserve, and they ended up invading our farms.' A second phase to relocate 50 other elephants is planned, but the date has not been disclosed. The project has cost at least 12 million Kenyan shillings ($93,000), the wildlife agency said. Kenya’s national parks and reserves are home to a variety of wildlife species and attract millions of visitors annually, making the country a tourism hotspot. ___ The Associated Press receives financial support for global health and development coverage in Africa from the Gates Foundation.

India recalls ambassador from Canada in growing dispute over assassination of Sikh activist	NEW DELHI (AP) — India said Monday it is recalling its ambassador and other diplomats from Canada, hours after it rejected a Canadian notification that the ambassador was a 'person of interest' in the assassination of a Sikh activist last year. India's foreign ministry said in a statement that it had also summoned the top Canadian diplomat in New Delhi and told him that 'the baseless targeting' of the Indian high commissioner, or ambassador, and other diplomats and officials in Canada 'was completely unacceptable.' 'We have no faith in the current Canadian Government’s commitment to ensure their security,' it said. 'Therefore, the Government of India has decided to withdraw the High Commissioner and other targeted diplomats and officials.' In September last year, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said there were credible allegations that the Indian government had links to the assassination in that country of Sikh activist Hardeep Singh Nijjar. India rejected the accusation as absurd. In Ottawa, messages left for Canada’s foreign ministry, foreign minister and the prime minister’s office seeking comment were not immediately returned.	https://apnews.com/article/india-canada-ambassador-recalled-sikh-assassination-f099e210d2f9df93fea18a9de04e06f8	2024-10-14T05:54:35-07:00	
Body of Scottish independence champion Alex Salmond soon to be flown home from North Macedonia	SKOPJE, North Macedonia (AP) — The body of Alex Salmond, Scotland's former First Minister who died during a conference in North Macedonia, will soon be returned to Scotland by special flight, an official said Monday. Salmond, who as leader of the Scottish National Party took Scotland up to the brink of independence in a 2014 referendum, died suddenly Saturday at the lake resort of Ohrid aged 69. He had been a panelist at a forum and collapsed during a lunch event after apparently suffering a massive heart attack. Boris Josifovski, an aide to North Macedonia’s former president Gjorge Ivanov, who organized the forum, said Monday that procedures for the body's repatriation 'are almost done.' 'All legal procedures and paperwork are nearly finished,' Josifovski told The Associated Press. 'There will be a special flight in the next few days, probably from Ohrid,' to take Salmond's body to Scotland. The official coroner's report on the precise causes of Salmond's death will be delivered to his family, North Macedonia's judiciary said. Salmond, who took the SNP to power from the fringes of Scottish politics, served as first minister from 2007 to 2014. In the referendum Scots ultimately rejected independence, with 55% voting against and 45% in favor. Salmond subsequently resigned and was replaced by his long-time ally, Nicola Sturgeon. Their subsequent split dominated Scottish politics for years.	https://apnews.com/article/alex-salmond-scotland-independence-death-north-macedonia-b8cbfc267e9809269400d21b67d8998b	2024-10-14T04:57:40-07:00	
Polish leader Tusk defends decision to suspend asylum law	WARSAW, Poland (AP) — Poland's Prime Minister Donald Tusk on Monday defended a plan to temporarily suspend the right to asylum as human rights and and civil society organizations express concerns about the move. Poland has struggled since 2021 with migration pressures on its border with Belarus — which is also part of the European Union's external border. 'It is our right and our duty to protect the Polish and European border,' Tusk said Monday on X. 'Its security will not be negotiated.' Successive Polish governments have accused Belarus and Russia of organizing the mass transfer of migrants from the Middle East and Africa to the EU's eastern borders to destabilize the West. They view it as part of a hybrid war that they accuse Moscow of waging against the West as it continues its nearly three-year full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Some migrants have applied for asylum in Poland, but before the requests are processed, they travel across the EU’s border-free travel zone to reach Germany or other countries in Western Europe. Germany, where security fears are rising after a spate of extremist attacks, has recently responded by expanding border controls at all of its borders to fight irregular migration. Tusk called Germany’s move 'unacceptable.' Tusk announced his plan to temporarily suspend the right for migrants to seek asylum at a convention of his Civic Coalition on Saturday. It will be part of a strategy that will be presented to a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday. Dozens of nongovernmental organizations urged Tusk in an open letter to respect the right to asylum guaranteed by international conventions, which Poland signed, including the Geneva Convention on the Status of Refugees and the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, and Poland's own constitution. They argued that fundamental rights and freedoms must be respected. 'It is thanks to them that thousands of Polish women and men found shelter abroad in the difficult times of communist totalitarianism, and we have become one of the greatest beneficiaries of these rights,' the letter said. It was signed by Amnesty International and 45 other organizations that represent a range of humanitarian, legal and civic causes. Tusk argued that Finland also suspended accepting asylum applications after facing migration pressure on its border with Russia. 'The right to asylum is used instrumentally in this war and has nothing to do with human rights,' Tusk said on X on Sunday. A spokesperson for the European Commission, the EU's executive branch, acknowledged the challenge posed by Belarus, but also Russia, and didn't explicitly criticize Tusk’s approach. 'It is important and imperative that the union is protecting the external borders, and in particular from Russia and Belarus, both countries that have put in the past three years, a lot of pressure on the external borders,' Anitta Hipper said during a briefing Monday. 'This is something that is undermining the security of the EU member states and of the union as a whole.' But she also underlined that EU member countries are legally obliged to allow people to apply for international protection. Hipper noted that the commission intends to 'work on ensuring that the member states have the necessary tools to respond to these types of hybrid attacks.' ___ Associated Press writer Lorne Cook in Brussels contributed to this report. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of migration issues at https://apnews.com/hub/migration	https://apnews.com/article/poland-migration-asylum-law-eu-belarus-russia-b247e18632bbae01c7bcca4d2ef6bf8e	2024-10-14T04:00:53-07:00	
Former officer with East Germany’s secret police sentenced to prison for a border killing in 1974	BERLIN (AP) — An 80-year-old former officer with communist East Germany’s secret police, the Stasi, was sentenced Monday to 10 years in prison for the murder of a Polish man at a border crossing in divided Berlin 50 years ago. The Berlin state court said in its ruling that there was no doubt that the then-first lieutenant shot the 38-year-old Polish citizen Czesław Kukuczka in an ambush on March 29, 1974 on behalf of the East German secret police, German news agency dpa reported. 'It was not the act of an individual for personal reasons, but planned and mercilessly executed by the Stasi,' presiding judge Bernd Miczajka said in his sentencing remarks. He said the defendant, whose name was not given in line with German privacy rules, fired the shot 'at the end of a chain of command,' dpa reported. The court fell short of the Berlin public prosecutor’s request for 12 years in prison. The accused’s defense lawyer had demanded an acquittal. According to lawyer Andrea Liebscher, it had not been proven that her client fired the fatal shot, dpa reported. The defendant remained silent in court but his lawyer said at the beginning of the trial that he denied the allegations. The verdict can still be appealed. The case goes back to March 29, 1974, when Kukuczka allegedly took a fake bomb to the Polish Embassy to threaten officials to allow him to leave for West Berlin, and the Stasi decided to pretend it was authorizing his departure. He was provided with exit documents and accompanied to a border crossing at the Friedrichstrasse railway station in East Berlin, according to prosecutors. The defendant — who was 31 at the time — was tasked with rendering the Polish man 'harmless,' prosecutors said. After the Pole had passed the final checkpoint, the suspect allegedly shot him in the back from a hiding place. Authorities made little headway with the case until a decisive tip-off about the identity of the shooter emerged in 2016 from the Stasi’s voluminous archives, dpa reported. Prosecutors initially suspected the case would amount to manslaughter, which unlike murder falls under the statute of limitations in Germany. East Germany built the Berlin Wall in 1961, preventing most of its citizens from traveling to the West. Many tried to escape by tunneling under it, swimming past it, climbing or flying over it. At least 140 people died in the attempt. The heavily fortified border was opened on Nov. 9, 1989, a key moment in the collapse of communism in Europe. Germany was reunited less than a year later.	https://apnews.com/article/germany-poland-stasi-verdict-berlin-border-communist-8cde4b1a8a6537e841977fc4fc442bcf	2024-10-14T03:46:16-07:00	
In Denmark, 50 well-preserved Viking Age skeletons have been unearthed, a rare discovery	AASUM, Denmark (AP) — In a village in central Denmark, archeologists made a landmark discovery that could hold important clues to the Viking era: a burial ground, containing some 50 'exceptionally well-preserved' skeletons. 'This is such an exciting find because we found these skeletons that are so very, very well preserved,' said archeologist Michael Borre Lundø, who led the six-month dig. 'Normally, we would be lucky to find a few teeth in the graves, but here we have entire skeletons.' The skeletons were preserved thanks to favorable soil chemistry, particularly chalk and high water levels, experts from Museum Odense said. The site was discovered last year during a routine survey, ahead of power line renovation work on the outskirts of the village of Aasum, 5 kilometers (3 miles), northeast of Odense, Denmark’s third-largest city. Experts hope to conduct DNA analyses and possibly reconstruct detailed life histories, as well as looking into social patterns in Viking Age, such as kinship, migration patterns and more. 'This opens a whole new toolbox for scientific discovery,' said Borre Lundø as he stood on the muddy, wind-swept excavation site. 'Hopefully we can make a DNA analysis on all the skeletons and see if they are related to each other and even where they come from.' During the Viking Age, considered to run from 793 to 1066 A.D., Norsemen known as Vikings undertook large-scale raids, colonizing, conquering and trading throughout Europe, even reaching North America. The Vikings unearthed at Aasum likely weren’t warriors. Borre Lundø believes the site was probably a 'standard settlement,' perhaps a farming community, located 5 kilometers from a ring fortress in what’s now central Odense. The 2,000-square meter (21,500-square foot) burial ground holds the remains of men, women and children. Besides the skeletons, there are a few cremated bodies. In one grave, a woman is buried in a wagon -- the higher part of a Viking cart was used as a coffin — suggesting she was from the 'upper part of society,' Borre Lundø told The Associated Press. Archeologists also unearthed brooches, necklace beads, knives, and even a small shard of glass that may have served as an amulet. Borre Lundø said the brooch designs suggest the dead were buried between 850 and 900 A.D. 'There’s different levels of burials,' he explained. 'Some have nothing with them, others have brooches and pearl necklaces.' Archeologists say many of the artefacts came from far beyond Denmark’s borders, shedding light on extensive Viking trade routes during the 10th century. 'There’s a lot of trade and commerce going on,' said Borre Lundø. 'We also found a brooch that comes from the island of Gotland, on the eastern side of Sweden, but also whetstones for honing your knife … all sorts of things point to Norway and Sweden.' The burial site was discovered last year, and the dig, which started in April, ended Friday. Boxes of artefacts have shipped to Museum Odense’s preservation labs for cleaning and analysis. Conservator Jannie Amsgaard Ebsen hopes the soil may also hold other preserved organic material on the backs of brooches or knife handles. 'We’re really hoping to gain the larger picture. Who were the people that were living out there? Who did they interact with?' she said. 'It’s a little bit like a jigsaw puzzle: all the various puzzle parts will be placed together.'	https://apnews.com/article/denmark-viking-burial-archeology-skeleton-aasum-dna-b8c29620bb78fd618c1d0f345d4dddfb	2024-10-14T03:30:58-07:00	
French citizen convicted in Russia of collecting military information and gets 3 years in prison	MOSCOW (AP) — A Russian court on Monday convicted a French citizen of collecting military information and sentenced him to three years in prison. Laurent Vinatier, who was arrested in Moscow in June, earlier admitted guilt, setting the stage for a fast-tracked trial. His lawyers’ asked the court to sentence him to a fine. In his remarks before the verdict, Vinatier, speaking Russian, reaffirmed that he fully recognized his guilt and asked the judge for clemency. 'I'm asking the Russian Federation to forgive me for failing to observe Russian laws,' he said. The 48-year-old political scholar said he fell in love with Russia 20 years ago when he began studying the country and concluded his comments with a verse by Russian poet Alexander Pushkin about having patience that better days lie ahead. Detentions on charges of spying and collecting sensitive data have become increasingly frequent in Russia and its heavily politicized legal system since Moscow sent troops into Ukraine in February 2022. Vinatier’s arrest came as tensions flared between Moscow and Paris following French President Emmanuel Macron’s comments about the possibility of deploying French troops in Ukraine. Russian authorities accused Vinatier of failing to register as a 'foreign agent' while collecting information about Russia’s 'military and military-technical activities' that could be used to the detriment of the country’s security. Vinatier is an adviser for the Centre for Humanitarian Dialogue, a Switzerland-based nongovernmental organization. It said in June that it was doing 'everything possible to assist' him. The prosecutors charged that Vinatier had collected military information during his meetings with three Russian citizens in Moscow in 2021-22. The Russian citizens weren’t named in the indictment. The charges carried a prison sentence of up to five years, but the prosecutors asked for 3 1/4 years in prison, given that he had fully admitted his guilt and cooperated with investigators. Still, Vinatier’s lawyers argued the sentence sought by prosecutors was too harsh and asked the judge to sentence him to a fine. They pointed at his career as a political scholar who focused on studying Russia and emphasized that his books and articles have been friendly to the country. While asking the judge for clemency, Vinatier pointed at his two children and his elderly parents he has to take care of. The charges against Vinatier relate to a law that requires anyone collecting information on military issues to register with authorities as a foreign agent. Human rights activists have criticized the law and other recent legislation as part of a Kremlin crackdown on independent media and political activists intended to stifle criticism of its actions in Ukraine.	https://apnews.com/article/russia-france-citizen-prison-term-prosecutors-e22cc1df4f0d0dc8d2f87bd6277a26cd	2024-10-14T02:45:20-07:00	
Russia says it captured a southern Ukraine village in a push before winter comes	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Russia said Monday that it has captured the village of Levadne in southern Ukraine as it probes for weaknesses along the war ’s roughly 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line, including in eastern areas that are the main focus of Moscow’s military effort before winter arrives. Ukrainian authorities, meanwhile, reported no nighttime Shahed drone attacks on the country for the first time in about six weeks, after saying five days ago they struck a Shahed storage facility in Russia’s Krasnodar region where around 400 drones reportedly were being kept. Levadne, in the Zaporizhzhia region, was seized by the Russians early on during the full-scale invasion, which began on Feb. 24, 2022, but was recaptured by Ukrainian forces during a counteroffensive in the summer of 2023. Ukrainian officials made no comment about Levadne’s possible capture, though they had previously noted that the Russian army was assembling troops there and was conducting local assaults at the end of last week. Ukraine’s troops are straining to hold back Russia’s military might, especially in the eastern Donetsk region, and don’t have the manpower or weaponry to launch their own offensive. Though Russia’s gains have been incremental, its steady forward movement is slowly adding up as the Ukrainians are pushed backward. Ukraine says it needs more Western help to have a chance of holding back Russia’s invasion. Russia illegally annexed four regions of Ukraine, including Zaporizhzhia, in September 2022. Russian President Vladimir Putin has demanded the withdrawal of Ukrainian forces from all four regions as the main condition for a prospective peace deal — a demand Ukraine and the West have rejected. Last week, the Ukrainian General Staff reported a direct hit on the Shahed drone warehouse inside Russia. 'The destruction of the Shahed drone storage base will significantly reduce the ability of Russian occupiers to terrorize peaceful residents of Ukrainian cities and villages,' it said at the time. Ukrainian officials are keen to show the West that they aren't giving up the fight against their much bigger neighbor. An incursion into Russia’s Kursk border region has put Ukrainian troops on Russian soil for more than two months. The Russians are managing to retake some territory in Kursk but the Ukrainians are capturing even more, according to Oleksandr Kovalenko, a military analyst from Information Resistance, a Kyiv-based think tank. He told The Associated Press that the onset of winter fog and rain will affect the use of drones — an important element in Ukraine’s military strategy. Ukraine has deployed sophisticated long-range drones to strike targets inside Russia, including airfields, oil refineries and ammunition depots. The Ukrainian Main Directorate of Intelligence said Monday that it destroyed a Russian military transport aircraft, a Tu-134, at a military airfield in Russia’s Orenburg region. Russia, meanwhile, struck port infrastructure in the southern Ukrainian city of Odesa with a ballistic missile Monday, killing one person and wounding eight others, as well as damaging two merchant ships, officials said. The attack damaged grain storage facilities, cargo cranes, administrative buildings, port equipment and vehicles, Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister for Restoration Oleksii Kuleba said on his Telegram channel. Recent attacks on Odesa port facilities appear intended to disrupt the country’s exports of grains and other food staples. ___ Samya Kullab in Kyiv, Ukraine, contributed to this report. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-zaporizhzhia-shahed-drones-f21d12a3751b76282365ddcc2c9a9fd0	2024-10-14T02:27:20-07:00	
Britain hosts an international investment summit and denies snubbing Elon Musk	LONDON (AP) — Britain’s new Labour Party government announced billions of pounds in investment in U.K. artificial intelligence, life sciences and infrastructure on Monday at a business summit attended by executives from major international companies — though it was the absence of Elon Musk that made headlines. Prime Minister Keir Starmer ’s center-left administration is eager to attract investment into Britain’s sluggish economy and to convince corporations that its push to improve workers’ rights won’t come at the expense of businesses. It also needs to reassure trade unions, key Labour backers, that wooing business won’t come at workers’ expense. Starmer told about 300 executives from banks, investment firms, pharmaceutical companies, tech and media firms and others that after several years of economic and political turmoil and 'policy churn' under the Conservatives, Britain is once again a stable place for investors. 'This is the moment to back Britain,' he said, pledging to oversee a 'hard-headed' industrial strategy and 'galvanize growth' by slashing unnecessary regulation. 'We will rip up the bureaucracy that blocks investment,' Starmer said. Unions worry that may mean lowering standards on health, safety and the environment, a claim the government denies. Technology Secretary Peter Kyle said reducing red tape did not mean 'cutting corners or lowering standards, but making sure that the government takes on some of the burden of compliance so that our nation can benefit.' A sign of the tensions facing the government as it tries to please both employers and employees came after Transport Secretary Louise Haigh last week urged people to boycott P&amp;O Ferries, which in 2022 fired 800 seafarers to replace them with cheaper contract staff. Its parent company, Dubai-based DP World, reportedly threatened to pull out of the investment conference because of the remarks. After Starmer rebuked Haigh and reassured the company that hers was 'not the view of the government,' DP World confirmed Monday it would invest in a 1 billion pound ($1.3 billion) expansion of the London Gateway container port. Other deals announced Monday included a life sciences incubator supported by pharma firm Eli Lilly, several new data centers backed by U.S. firms and an expansion of Stansted Airport near London. Business executives attending the summit were rubbing shoulders with government ministers at London’s magnificent medieval Guildhall before a reception at St. Paul's Cathedral attended by King Charles III, with a performance by Elton John. Not among them was Musk, whose social media platform X was used to spread false information during the anti-immigrant violence that erupted in Britain this summer. Musk himself posted messages insulting Starmer and saying the U.K. was headed for civil war. After the BBC reported in September that Musk would not attend the investment summit, the Space X and Tesla boss posted on X: 'I don’t think anyone should go to the UK when they’re releasing convicted pedophiles in order to imprison people for social media posts.' He was apparently referring to the government’s decision to release hundreds of inmates — though not sex offenders — early because of overcrowded prisons. Kyle, the technology secretary, denied Musk had been snubbed for political reasons. 'Elon Musk has never come to any of the past investment summits that have been held under the previous government, he doesn’t tend to do these sort of events,' Kyle said. 'But I stand absolutely ready to engage with him, to talk about any potential global investments he’s making. I’m not aware of any at this moment in time.'	https://apnews.com/article/uk-investment-summit-keir-starmer-elon-musk-c3d3da1a5503019cc79fc6b0718f0857	2024-10-14T01:46:32-07:00	
Udine on high alert for Italy hosting Israel in Nations League	UDINE, Italy (AP) — There were snipers on the roof of the stadium and a heavy police presence throughout the city of Udine for Italy's match against Israel on Monday. In the end, both the game — and an earlier pro-Palestine demonstration — passed without incident as Italy beat Israel 4-1 in the Nations League. Udine was on high alert, with the game being played against the backdrop of the ongoing conflict in the Middle East which has spread to Lebanon after more than a year-long war in Gaza. It was the first match Israel has played outside neutral Hungary this year. After the Israel-Hamas war started on Oct. 7 last year, the national soccer team played in Kosovo and Andorra last November. All Israel matches since then have been in Hungary, including last month’s game against Belgium in the Nations League after the Belgian Football Association refused to host the game for security reasons. 'We are going to play this match with the hope of convincing ever more people of the wrongness of war,' Italy coach Luciano Spalletti said. 'There are many Israelis who don’t want it and we must convince ever more people that this is something that has to stop.' When Spalletti's team played its 'away' match against Israel last month in Hungary, a group of about 50 Italy fans clad in all black turned their backs in apparent protest during Israel’s national anthem. There were boos from some fans in Udine when the Israeli anthem was played on Monday but the rest of the stadium tried to drown that out with loud applause — just as they had done when the Israel team was read out. At least one Palestinian flag was held up. There was a highly visible group of around a dozen Israel fans and they loudly chanted their support. Fewer than 12,000 tickets were sold for Monday's match — less than half the capacity of the 25,000-seater Stadio Friuli — amid stringent security measures, that also included armed military personnel on the roof of the stadium. Areas around the stadium were blocked off 48 hours before kickoff and declared a 'red zone,' and only fans with tickets could pass through the tall metal barriers. Supporters were strongly advised to arrive early because of rigorous checks. Hundreds of extra police officers were called up from surrounding areas. Around 1,000 people took part in a pro-Palestine demonstration earlier in the city center. Among the placards, there were several posters calling on soccer's governing bodies to ban Israel. ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer	https://apnews.com/article/italy-israel-nations-league-db35ac78fcb8ee7d7f4811ced6183bfb	2024-10-14T00:29:37-07:00	
Vial that contained nerve agent that killed UK woman contained enough poison to kill thousands	LONDON (AP) — The lead counsel for a public inquiry into the 2018 death of a British woman poisoned by a Soviet-developed nerve agent said Monday that there was enough poison in the vial she unwittingly opened to kill thousands of people. Dawn Sturgess and her partner collapsed after they came into contact with a discarded perfume bottle containing the nerve agent Novichok in the southwest England town of Amesbury. She had sprayed the contents of the bottle on her wrist and died days later. Her partner survived. 'The evidence will suggest that this bottle — which we shall hear contained enough poison to kill thousands of people — must earlier have been left somewhere in a public place creating the obvious risk that someone would find it and take it home,' lead counsel Andrew O’Connor said. Their exposure came four months after a former Russian intelligence officer, Sergei Skripal, and his daughter were sickened by Novichok in an attack in the nearby city of Salisbury. Britain has blamed Russian intelligence, but Moscow has denied any role. Russian President Vladimir Putin called Skripal, a double agent for the United Kingdom during his espionage days, a 'scumbag' of no interest to the Kremlin because he was exchanged in a spy swap in 2010. The Skripals won't testify during the inquiry out of fear for their safety. But in a witness statement to the inquiry, Skripal said that the attack was a shock because it was 'not honorable'' to kill people who had been exchanged. 'I had received a presidential pardon and was a free man with no convictions under Russian law. I never thought the Russian regime would try to murder me in Great Britain,' Skripal said in a statement read by O'Connor. 'They could have killed me easily if they wanted to when I was in prison.' He said he believed that Putin 'must have at least given permission for the attack.' 'I believe Putin makes all important decisions himself,' his statement said. Heather Hallett, the coroner who held the 2018 inquest into Sturgess’ death, said that a public inquiry was needed to conduct a complete look at how the woman died. Unlike inquests, which are routinely held in cases when the cause of death is unknown or if someone dies violently, public inquiries are allowed to consider sensitive intelligence material. ___ This story has been corrected to show that Sturgess died four months after the attack on the Skripals, not three months.	https://apnews.com/article/britain-russia-poisoned-spy-nerve-agent-d7ae02a79d6be8ed3a1989cbfbf06a86	2024-10-13T23:41:40-07:00	
Nobel economics prize goes to 3 economists who found that freer societies are more likely to prosper	STOCKHOLM (AP) — The Nobel memorial prize in economics was awarded Monday to three economists who have studied why some countries are rich and others poor and have documented that freer, open societies are more likely to prosper. The work by Daron Acemoglu, Simon Johnson and James A. Robinson 'demonstrated the importance of societal institutions for a country’s prosperity,' the Nobel committee of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said at the announcement in Stockholm. Acemoglu and Johnson work at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, while Robinson does his research at the University of Chicago. Jakob Svensson, chair of the Committee for the Prize in Economic Sciences, said their analysis has provided 'a much deeper understanding of the root causes of why countries fail or succeed.' Reached by the academy in Athens, Greece, where he was to speak at a conference, the Turkish-born Acemoglu, 57, said he was astonished by the award. 'You never expect something like this,' he said. Acemoglu said the research honored by the prize underscores the value of democratic institutions. 'I think broadly speaking the work that we have done favors democracy,' he said in a telephone call with the Nobel committee and reporters in Stockholm. But, he added: 'Democracy is not a panacea. Introducing democracy is very hard. When you introduce elections, that sometimes creates conflict.' In an interview with The Associated Press, Robinson, 64, said he doubts that China can sustain its economic prosperity as long as it keeps a repressive political system. 'There’s many examples in world history of societies like that that do well for 40, 50 years,' Robinson said by phone. 'What you see is that’s never sustainable. ... The Soviet Union did well for 50 or 60 years.'' Robinson said many societies have successfully made the transition to what he, Acemoglu and Johnson call an 'inclusive society.’’ 'Look at the United States,' Robinson said. 'This was a country of slavery, of privilege, where women were not allowed to take part in the economy or vote.' 'Every country that is currently relatively inclusive and open made that transition,' he added. 'In the modern world, you’ve seen that in South Korea, in Taiwan, in Mauritius.’’ Acemoglu and Robinson wrote the 2012 bestseller, 'Why Nations Fail: The Origins of Power, Prosperity, and Poverty,' which argued that manmade problems were responsible for keeping countries poor. In their work, the winners looked, for instance, at the city of Nogales, which straddles the U.S.-Mexico border. Despite sharing the same geography, climate and a common culture, life is very different on either side of the border. In Nogales, Arizona, to the north, residents are relatively well-off and live long lives; most children graduate from high school. To the south, in Mexico’s Nogales, Sonora, residents are much poorer, and organized crime and corruption abound. The difference, the economists found, is a U.S. system that protects property rights and gives citizens a say in their government. Acemoglu expressed worry Monday that democratic institutions in the United States and Europe were losing support from the population. 'Support for democracy is at an all-time low, especially in the U.S., but also in Greece and in the UK and France,' Acemoglu said on the sidelines of the conference in an Athens suburb. 'And I think that is a symbol of how people are disappointed with democracy,' he said. 'They think democracy hasn’t delivered what it promised.'' Robinson agreed. 'Clearly, you had an attack on inclusive institutions in this country,' he said. 'You had a presidential candidate who denied that he lost the last election. So President (Donald) Trump rejected the democratic rule of the citizens. ... Of course, I’m worried. I’m a concerned citizen.' Johnson told the AP that economic pressures were alienating many Americans. 'A lot of people who were previously in the middle class were hit very hard by the combination of globalization, automation, the decline of trade unions, and a sort of shift more broadly in corporate philosophy,'' Johnson said. 'So instead of workers being a resource to be developed, which they were in the 19th and early 20th century, they became a cost to be minimized ... Now, that squeezed the middle class.’’ 'We have, as a country, failed to deliver in recent decades on what we were previously very good at, which was sharing prosperity,'' Johnson said. One key for the future, Johnson said, is how societies manage new technologies such as artificial intelligence. 'AI could go either way,' he said. 'AI could either empower people with a lot of education, make them more highly skilled, enable them to do more tasks and get more pay. Or it could be another massive wave of automation that pushes the remnants of the middle down to the bottom. And then, yes, you’re not going to like the political outcomes.’’ In their work, the economists studied institutions that European powers such as Britain and Spain put in place when they colonized much of the world starting in the 1600s. They brought different policies to different places, giving later researchers a 'natural experiment' to analyze. Colonies that were sparsely populated offered less resistance to foreign rule and therefore attracted more settlers. In those places, colonial governments tended to establish more inclusive economic institutions that 'incentivized settlers to work hard and invest in their new homeland. In turn, this led to demands for political rights that gave them a share of profits,' the Nobel committee said. In more densely populated places that attracted fewer settlers, the colonial regimes limited political rights and set up institutions that focused on 'benefiting a local elite at the expense of the wider population,' it said. 'Paradoxically, this means that the parts of the colonized world that were relatively the most prosperous around 500 years ago are now those that are relatively poor,' it added, noting that India’s industrial production exceeded the American colonies’ in the 18th century. The economics prize is formally known as the Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel. The central bank established it in 1968 as a memorial to Nobel, the 19th-century Swedish businessman and chemist who invented dynamite and established the five Nobel Prizes. Though Nobel purists stress that the economics prize is technically not a Nobel Prize, it is always presented together with the others on Dec. 10, the anniversary of Nobel's death in 1896. Nobel honors were announced last week in medicine, physics, chemistry, literature and peace. ___ Corder reported from The Hague, Netherlands, and Wiseman from Washington.

Israeli strike on hospital tent camp kills 4 and ignites a fire that burns dozens	DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — An Israeli airstrike on a hospital courtyard in the Gaza Strip early Monday killed at least four people and triggered a fire that swept through a tent camp for people displaced by the war, leaving more than two dozen with severe burns, according to Palestinian medics. The Israeli military said it targeted militants hiding out among civilians, without providing evidence. In recent months it has repeatedly struck crowded shelters and tent camps, alleging that Hamas fighters were using them as staging grounds for attacks. The Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in the central city of Deir al-Balah was already struggling to treat a large number of wounded from an earlier strike on a school-turned-shelter that killed at least 20 people when the early morning airstrike hit and fire engulfed many of the tents. Several secondary explosions could be heard after the initial strike, but it was not immediately clear if they were caused by weapons or fuel tanks. Associated Press footage showed children among the wounded. A man sobbed as he carried a toddler with a bandaged head in his arms. Another small child with a bandaged leg was given a blood transfusion on the floor of the packed hospital. Hospital records showed that four people were killed and 40 wounded. Twenty-five people were transferred to the Nasser Hospital in southern Gaza after suffering severe burns, according to the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital. Israel is still carrying out near-daily strikes across the Gaza Strip more than a year into the war, and has been waging a major ground assault in the north, where it says militants have regrouped. The war began when Hamas attacked southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, while Palestinian militants abducted around 250 hostages. Around 100 are still being held inside Gaza, a third of whom are believed to be dead. Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed over 42,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not say how many were fighters but says women and children make up more than half the fatalities. Around 90% of Gaza's population of 2.3 million people have been displaced by the war, often multiple times, and large areas of the coastal territory have been completely destroyed. Israel has ordered the entire remaining population of the northern third of Gaza, estimated at around 400,000 people, to evacuate to the south and has not allowed any food to enter the north since the start of the month. Hundreds of thousands of people from the north heeded Israeli evacuation orders at the start of the war and have not been allowed to return. That has raised fears among Palestinians that Israel intends to implement a plan devised by former generals in which it would order all civilians out of northern Gaza and label anyone remaining there a combatant — a surrender-or-starve strategy that rights groups say would violate international law. The plan has been presented to the Israeli government, but it's unclear whether it has been adopted. With no end in sight to the war in Gaza, Israel is also waging an air and ground war in southern Lebanon against the Hezbollah militant group, an ally of Hamas that has been firing rockets into northern Israel for more than a year. Israel has also threatened to strike Iran in retaliation for a ballistic missile attack, raising the prospect of an all-out regionwide war. A Hezbollah aerial attack on an army base in northern Israel killed four soldiers — all of them 19 years old — and severely wounded seven others Sunday, the military said, in the deadliest strike by the militant group since Israel launched its ground invasion of Lebanon nearly two weeks ago. Hezbollah called the attack near Binyamina city retaliation for Israeli strikes on Beirut on Thursday that killed 22 people. It said it targeted Israel’s elite Golani brigade, launching dozens of missiles to occupy Israeli air defense systems during the assault by drones. Israel’s national rescue service said the attack wounded 61. It’s rare for so many people to be wounded by drones or missiles, most of which are intercepted by Israel's multitiered air defenses or fall in open areas. ___ Magdy reported from Cairo. ___ Find more of AP’s war coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-lebanon-hezbollah-news-10-14-2024-70c8cf5a93eec9ea643a5fda5670da93	2024-10-13T21:30:26-07:00	
Stock market today: Asian shares gain after China says more help is needed for its slowing economy	BANGKOK (AP) — Asian shares gained ground on Monday, with stocks in China rising more than 2% after the finance minister said over the weekend that more stimulus is needed for the slowing economy. U.S. futures were little changed and oil prices retreated. China’s finance minister, Lan Foan, said Saturday that the government was considering additional ways to boost the economy, but he didn’t give details of a major new stimulus plan. Stock investors and analysts have been hoping for a plan of up to 2 trillion yuan, or about $280 billion. But any expressions of support by officials tend to push share prices higher, and the 'national team' of big state-run companies and financial institutions tend to weigh in with stock purchases to help stabilize markets, analysts say. 'The devil, as they say, is always in the details — or in this case, the glaring lack of them. When it comes to Chinese policy briefings, it’s usually all sizzle and no steak,' Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management said in a commentary. 'By mid-week, we’ll see if the market bid has legs, and by month’s end, we’ll know for sure if Beijing is delivering the goods or if it’s just more smoke and mirrors.' The Shanghai Composite index rose 2.1% to 3,284.32 and the smaller market in Shenzhen gained 3%. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index lost 0.9% to 21,061.23. China reported that consumer inflation weakened in September and that wholesale prices fell further, reflecting continued weakness in domestic demand that has spurred the government into a flurry of measures meant to revive falling housing sales and other spending. Large-scale Chinese military exercises surrounding Taiwan and its outlying islands on Monday appeared to have scant impact on markets. Taiwan's Taiex was up 0.3%. Tokyo's markets were closed for a public holiday. In South Korea, the Kospi added 1% to 2,623.29, while Australia's S&amp;P/ASX 200 picked up 0.5% to 8,252.80. The advance in Asia followed a strong close on Friday on Wall Street as U.S. stocks rose to records, lifted by strong profits at big banks. The S&amp;P 500 climbed 0.6% to 5,815.03, topping its all-time high set earlier in the week and closing out its fifth straight winning week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 1% to set its own record, at 42,863.86. The Nasdaq composite lagged the market with a gain of 0.3% after a slide for Tesla kept it in check. It closed at 18,342.94. Wells Fargo rose 5.6% after reporting stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. JPMorgan Chase climbed 4.4% after reporting a milder drop in profit than analysts feared. It was the strongest single force pushing upward on the S&amp;P 500. BlackRock, meanwhile, rose 3.6% after likewise delivering better profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. The investment giant ended September managing a record $11.5 trillion in total assets for its customers. The gains for banks helped make up for Tesla's 8.8% tumble after the electric-vehicle maker unveiled its long-awaited robotaxi on Thursday night. Critics highlighted a lack of details about its planned rollout. Following the unveiling of the 'Cybercab,' potential rival Uber Technologies jumped 10.8% and was one of the strongest forces lifting the S&amp;P 500. Lyft rose 9.6%. In the bond market, Treasury yields were mixed following the latest updates on inflation at the wholesale level and on sentiment among U.S. consumers. Prices paid by producers were 1.8% higher in September than a year earlier, improved but not by as much as economists expected.

Pakistan hosts a major security meeting this week as it struggles against rising insurgent violence	ISLAMABAD (AP) — Pakistan is hosting a major security meeting this week, with senior leaders from longtime ally China and archrival India among those attending. The Shanghai Cooperation Organization was established in 2001 by China and Russia to discuss security concerns in Central Asia and the wider region. But it’s Pakistan’s own security that is under the microscope. An attack on a foreign ambassadors’ convoy, violent protests by supporters of an imprisoned former prime minister, and a bombing outside Pakistan’s biggest airport are signs the country is struggling to contain multiplying threats from insurgents. The meeting, which begins Tuesday in Islamabad, comes at a crucial time for the government. Here’s why: Armed groups are outpacing the army Pakistan says it has foiled attacks through intelligence-based operations and preventative measures. It frequently vows 'to root out terrorism.' But the frequency and scale of the recent violence give the impression that the government isn’t in control and raises questions about its ability to protect key sites and foreigners, let alone Pakistanis. In the last few weeks, separatists from Pakistan's southwest Balochistan province have killed Chinese nationals in Karachi, Pakistan’s biggest city, as well as more than 20 miners in an attack on housing at a coal mine, and seven workers in another attack. The outlawed Baloch Liberation Army, or BLA, is better at mobilizing fighters in different areas and its operational capabilities have increased. The group wants independence for the province. It’s not interested in overthrowing the state to establish a caliphate, which is what the Pakistani Taliban want. But the two groups have a common enemy -- the government. Analysts have said the BLA is getting support from the Pakistani Taliban. But, even without an alliance, attacks in the southwest are becoming more audacious and brutal, indicating that the BLA’s tactics are evolving and taking the security apparatus by surprise. The Pakistani Taliban continue their shootings and bombings in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, which borders Afghanistan. It could be difficult for militants to hit the meeting, given the security around it and the areas where delegates will stay. But they could still wreak havoc. Vehicles are often just waved through street checkpoints in Islamabad. Aside from government buildings and top hotels, body searches and under-vehicle scanners are rare. 'At stake for the entire state is the only mission -- how to hold such an event peacefully,' said Imtiaz Gul, the executive director of the Center for Research and Security Studies. 'How to get it done without any unpleasant incidents taking place. It’s going to be a formidable challenge for the government to disprove the notion of failures within the security apparatus.' Pakistan is paying the price for shutdowns Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb said last week that the national economy suffered cumulative daily losses of more than $684 million on account of recent agitation. He was referring to supporters of former Prime Minister Imran Khan reaching the heart of the capital, despite a suspension of cellphone service and placement of shipping containers at access points to the city. The shutdown hit most business sectors, the gig economy, point-of-sale transactions, commuters, students, workers and more. Pakistan can’t afford to incur such losses or deepen people’s grievances. It relies on International Monetary Fund bailouts and multibillion-dollar deals and loans from friendly countries to meet its economic needs. There are regular protests over energy bills and the cost of living. Despite people's hardships, authorities have declared a three-day holiday surrounding the meeting. There have been reports of the government ordering the closure of wedding halls, restaurants, hotels, cafes and markets in Islamabad and the neighboring garrison city Rawalpindi for security reasons. Officials denied the reports, but not very strenuously. 'Generally, high-profile conferences are meant to promote connectivity, trade and improve a country’s image,' said Gul. But not in this case because Islamabad won't look like a normal city, he said. 'It seems they lack innovative thinking,' Gul said. 'They are unable to use smart approaches and that’s why the easier way is to shut everything down.' A seat at the table and saving face The last time Pakistan hosted a major conference was in March 2022, a month before Khan was kicked out of office and a new cycle of upheaval started. The country's security situation and political instability are two factors that have prevented it from holding big international events. Even its best-loved sport, cricket, has suffered. There was a 10-year absence of test matches after terrorists ambushed a Sri Lanka team bus in 2009, killing eight people and injuring players and officials. The meeting is Pakistan’s chance to shine, especially in front of its neighbor China, to whom it is in hock by several billion dollars and whose nationals are prime targets for armed groups, as well as India, which is sending its foreign minister to the country for the first time since 2015. India and Pakistan have fought three wars and built up their armies but also developed nuclear weapons. China and India fought a war over their border in 1962. Pakistan, unused to hosting such a high-level meeting, will have to put its best face forward. Senior defense analyst Abdullah Khan said the government wants to show its international legitimacy amid the domestic crises. 'The presence of heads of state and other senior officials will itself be a success as Pakistan will come out of its so-called isolation,' said Khan. 'A peacefully held SCO will further improve the country’s image.' ___ Associated Press writer Munir Ahmed contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/pakistan-security-shanghai-cooperation-organization-summit-b155bbf6ca89227803545b96e3525dd9	2024-10-13T20:05:33-07:00	
Ailing and silenced in prison, Belarus activist symbolizes the nation's repression	TALLINN, Estonia (AP) — The last time any of Maria Kolesnikova's family had contact with the imprisoned Belarusian opposition activist was more than 18 months ago. Fellow inmates at the penal colony reported hearing her plead for medical help from inside her tiny and smelly cell. Her father, Alexander Kolesnikov, told The Associated Press by phone from Minsk that he knows she's seriously ill and tried to visit her several months ago at the facility near Gomel, where she is serving an 11-year sentence, but has failed whenever he goes there. On his last attempt, he said the warden told him, 'If she doesn't call or doesn't write, that means she doesn't want to.' The 42-year-old musician-turned-activist is known to have been hospitalized in Gomel in May or June, but the outcome was unclear, said a former prisoner who identified herself only as Natalya because she feared retaliation from authorities. 'I can only pray to God that she is still alive,' Kolesnikov said in an interview. 'The authorities are ignoring my requests for a meeting and for letters — it is a terrible feeling of impotence for a father.' Kolesnikova gained prominence when mass protests erupted in Belarus after the widely disputed August 2020 election gave authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko a sixth term in office. With her close-cropped hair, broad smile and a gesture of forming her outstretched hands into the shape of a heart, she often was seen at the front of the demonstrations. She became an even greater symbol of defiance in September of that year when Belarusian authorities tried to deport her. Driven to the Ukrainian border, she briefly broke away from security forces in the neutral zone at the frontier and tore up her passport, then walked back into Belarus. She was convicted a year later of charges including conspiracy to seize power. Natalya, whose cell was next to Kolesnikova’s before being released in August, said she had not heard her talking to guards for six months. Other inmates heard Kolesnikova's pleas for medical assistance, she said, but reported that doctors did not come for 'a very long time.' In November 2022, Kolesnikova was moved to an intensive care ward to undergo surgery for a perforated ulcer. Other prisoners become aware of her movements because 'it feels like martial law has been declared' in the cellblock, Natalya said. 'Other prisoners are strictly forbidden not only to talk, but even to exchange glances with Maria.' Her sister, Tatiana Khomich, said she was told by former inmates that the 5-foot-9-inch Kolesnikova weighed only about 45 kilograms (100 pounds). 'They are slowly killing Maria, and I consider that this is a critical period because no one can survive in such conditions,' said Khomich, who lives outside Belarus. The last time Kolesnikova wrote from prison was in February 2023. Letters to her 'are ripped up before her eyes by prison personnel,' her sister said, relaying accounts from other former inmates. Kolesnikova, who before the 2020 protests was a classical flautist who was especially knowledgable about baroque music, is one of several major Lukashenko opponents to disappear behind bars. The prisons department of the Belarusian Interior Ministry refused to comment on Kolesnikova’s case. The U.N. Human Rights Committee has repeatedly demanded Belarusian authorities take 'urgent protective measures' in relation to Kolesnikova and other political prisoners held incommunicado. In September, the European Parliament demanded that Belarus release all political prisoners. Former inmates say Kolesnikova wore a yellow tag that indicates a political prisoner. That marks them for additional abuse by guards and officials, rights advocates say. The human rights group Viasna counts about 1,300 political prisoners in Belarus, including the group's Nobel Peace Prize-winning founder, Ales Bialiatsky. At least six have died behind bards. 'It was too late to save Alexei Navalny (from prison in Russia), and it was too late for six people in Belarus. We and the Western world don't have much time to save Maria's life,' Khomich said. Amnesty International has begun a campaign to raise awareness about Kolesnikova's fate, urging people to take up her plight with Western officials and politicians. Other prominent opposition figures who are imprisoned and have not been heard from in a year or more include Siarhei Tsikhanouski, who planned to challenge Lukashenko in the 2020 election but was imprisoned; his wife, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, took his place on the ballot and was forced to leave the country the day after the vote. Aspiring opposition candidate Viktar Babaryka also was imprisoned before the election as his popularity among prospective voters soared. Kolesnikova was his campaign manager but then joined forces with Tsikhanouskaya. Prominent opposition figure Mikola Statkevich and Kolesnikova's lawyer, Maxim Znak, are imprisoned and have not contacted the outside world since the winter of 2023. Lukashenko denies Belarus has any political prisoners. At the same time, in recent months he has unexpectedly released 115 prisoners whose cases had political elements; those released had health problems, wrote petitions for pardons and repented. Belarus is deeply integrated with Russia and some observers believe Lukashenko is concerned about the extent of his dependence on Moscow, hoping to restore some ties with the EU by releasing political prisoners ahead of a presidential election next year. 'Minsk is returning to the practice of bargaining with the West to try to soften sanctions and achieve at least partial recognition of the results of the upcoming presidential election,' said Belarusian analyst Alexander Friedman. 'Lukashenko’s regime is interested in not becoming part of Russia and therefore wants at least some communication with the West, offering to talk about political prisoners' Lukashenko’s critics and human rights activists say they see no real change in government policy, since all leading pro-democracy figures are still behind bars and authorities have seized three times as many opposition activists to refill the prisons. 'It is difficult to consider these pardons as a real thaw, since the repressions continue, but the West should encourage Lukashenko to continue releasing political prisoners,' Khomich said. 'The regime is sending clear signals to Western countries about its readiness to release people, and it's very important that (the signal) is heard, and the opportunity is seized.'	https://apnews.com/article/lukashenko-belarus-crackdown-viasna-4c81e46b1ebba8924306c541fb7170db	2024-10-13T19:09:46-07:00	
North Korea is preparing to destroy northern parts of inter-Korean roads, Seoul says	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea said Monday it has detected signs that North Korea is preparing to destroy the northern parts of inter-Korean roads no longer in use, as the rivals are embroiled in soaring tensions over North Korea’s claim that South Korea flew drones over its territory. Destroying the roads would be in line with leader Kim Jong Un’s push to cut off ties with South Korea, formally cement it as his country's principal enemy and abandon the North's decades-long objective to seek a peaceful Korean unification. South Korea's military said Monday that it was observing various activities in North Korea that appeared to be preparations for demolishing the roads, such as installing screens. 'They have installed screens on the road and are working behind those screens, preparing to blow up the roads,' Lee Sung Joon, spokesperson of South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff, told a briefing. He said the demolitions could be carried out as early as Monday. Lee said that the South Korean military believes that the North could also attempt to launch a space rocket, which is viewed by the U.N. as a banned test of long-range missile technology. Lee said North Korea may conduct unspecified 'small provocations' to ramp up pressure on Seoul. It’s not clear how much parts of the roads North Korea would destroy. The development comes as North Korea has recently accused South Korea of launching drones to drop propaganda leaflets over Pyongyang three times this month and threatened to respond with force if it happened again. South Korea has refused to confirm whether it sent drones but warned it would sternly punish North Korea if the safety of its citizens is threatened. In a statement Sunday, the North’s Defense Ministry said that the military had ordered artillery and other army units near the border with South Korea to 'get fully ready to open fire.' The spokesperson said that the entire South Korean territory 'might turn into piles of ashes' following the North’s powerful attack. North Korea often releases warlike rhetoric when animosities with its rivals increase. Experts say it's highly unlikely for North Korea to launch full-scale, preemptive attacks as it military is outmatched by the combined U.S. and South Korean forces. Koo Byoungsam, a spokesperson of South Korea’s Unification Ministry, said Monday that North Korea’s accusation on South Korean drone flights was likely aimed at creating tensions to reinforce its internal unity while stoking instability in South Korea. Koo said North Korea cannot win what it wants from South Korea with threats and provocations. Some observers say anti-Pyongyang activists might have sent drones this month, but North Korea argues the South Korean government cannot still escape responsibility because it must have been aware of such moves. In 2022, South Korea sent surveillance drones across the border into North Korea after it accused North Korea of flying drones into South Korea for the first time in five years. Last week, North Korea said it will permanently block its border with South Korea and build front-line defense structures to cope with 'confrontational hysteria' by South Korean and U.S. forces. It cited various military exercises in South Korea and the temporary deployments of powerful U.S. military assets in South Korea. South Korean officials said North Korea had already been adding anti-tank barriers, planting mines and reinforcing roads on its side of the border since earlier this year in a likely attempt to boost its front-line security posture and prevent its soldiers and citizens from defecting to South Korea. Tensions on the Korean Peninsula are at their highest point in years, with North Korea continuing a run of provocative missile tests and South Korea and the U.S. expanding their military drills. Observers say North Korea could perform major weapons tests ahead of next month’s U.S. presidential election to increase its leverage in future diplomacy with the Americans. In January, Kim Jong Un ordered the revision of North Korea's constitution to remove the goal of a peaceful Korean unification, formally designate South Korea as the country’s 'invariable principal enemy' and define the North’s sovereign, territorial sphere. Kim’s order stunned many North Korea watchers because it was seen as breaking away with his predecessors’ long-cherished dreams of peacefully achieving a unified Korea on the North’s terms. Experts say Kim likely aims to diminish South Korea’s voice in the regional nuclear standoff and seek direct dealings with the U.S. They say Kim also likely hopes to diminish South Korean cultural influence and bolster his rule at home.	https://apnews.com/article/north-korea-roads-destroy-tensions-drones-072433677101dc38e30bb65f908ec631	2024-10-13T17:19:01-07:00

China holds large naval and air force exercises around Taiwan as a warning against independence	TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) — China held large-scale military exercises surrounding Taiwan and its outlying islands Monday in what it called a warning against Taiwan independence. China’s Defense Ministry said the drills were a response to Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te’s refusal to concede to Beijing’s demands that Taiwan acknowledge itself as a part of the People’s Republic of China under the rule of the Communist Party. Taiwan’s Defense Ministry called the drills a provocation and said its forces were prepared to respond. The PLA’s Eastern Theater Command spokesperson Navy Senior Captain Li Xi said the navy, army air force, missile corps were all mobilized for the drills. 'This is a major warning to those who back Taiwan independence and a signifier of our determination to safeguard our national sovereignty,' Li said in a statement on the service’s public media channel. Taiwan was a Japanese colony before being unified with China at the end of World War II. It split away in 1949 when Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalists fled to the island as Mao Zedong's Communists swept to power on the mainland. Lai took office in May, continuing the eight-year rule of the Democratic Progressive Party that rejects China’s demand that it recognize Taiwan is a part of China. China routinely states that Taiwan independence is a 'dead end' and that annexation by Beijing is a historical inevitability.	https://apnews.com/article/taiwan-china-military-drills-053fbadaf1125be4adfee7a7e6d1ce79	2024-10-13T16:15:45-07:00

Pakistani police fire tear gas and charge protesters in Karachi	KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) — Pakistani police fired tear gas and swung batons at thousands of protesters on Sunday in Karachi after the demonstrators tried to break through a security barricade. Around 2,000 supporters of a far-right Islamist party tried to reach the city’s press club to oppose a another demonstration staged by civil society groups about the killing of a blasphemy suspect while he was in custody. Supporters of the Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan party hurled rocks at officers and torched a patrol car when police stopped them from reaching the press club. The party said one of its members died in the violence. Police arrested around 20 people from both demonstrations. Provincial Interior Minister Zia Ul Hassan said authorities feared clashes because both the political party and the civil society groups had issued calls for protests on the same day. Ul Hassan condemned the violence, especially given an upcoming security summit in Islamabad and last week’s deadly attack on a convoy of Chinese nationals outside the city's airport. The TLP supports Pakistan's controversial blasphemy laws, which call for the death penalty for anyone who insults Islam.	https://apnews.com/article/pakistan-protest-police-clash-karachi-8adf76efe4396cf70c21494c5d963c51	2024-10-13T08:09:30-07:00	
US will send a missile defense system and troops to run it to Israel to aid defense against Iran	WASHINGTON (AP) — The United States will send a T erminal High Altitude Area Defense battery to Israel, along with the troops needed to operate it, the Pentagon said Sunday, even as Iran warned Washington to keep American military forces out of Israel. Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder, Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement that Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin authorized the deployment of the THAAD battery at the direction of President Joe Biden. He said the system will help bolster Israel's air defenses following Iran’s ballistic missile attacks on Israel in April and October. The delivery of the sophisticated missile defense system risks further inflaming the conflict in the Middle East despite widespread diplomatic efforts to avoid an all-out war. The Iranian warning came in a post on the social platform X long associated with Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, who noted the earlier reports that the U.S. was considering the deployment. Israeli forces and Hezbollah fighters in Lebanon have been clashing since Oct. 8, 2023, when the Lebanese militant group began firing rockets over the border in support of its ally Hamas in Gaza. Late last month, Israel launched a ground invasion into Lebanon. Israel is widely believed to be preparing a military response to Iran’s Oct. 1 attack when it fired roughly 180 missiles into Israel. In a brief exchange with reporters before leaving Florida on Sunday, Biden said he agreed to deploy the THAAD battery 'to defend Israel.' Biden spoke at MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa after making a quick visit to to see the damage caused by Hurricane Milton and meet with first responders, residents and local leaders. Ryder, in his statement, said the deployment 'underscores the United States’ ironclad commitment to the defense of Israel, and to defend Americans in Israel, from any further ballistic missile attacks by Iran.' It was not immediately clear where the THAAD battery was coming from or when it will arrive. Lt. Col. Nadav Shoshani, an Israeli army spokesman, declined to provide any timeline for its arrival, but thanked the U.S. for its support. The U.S. deployed one of the batteries to the Middle East along with additional Patriot battalions to bolster protections for U.S. forces in the region late last year after the Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel by Hamas militants. Ryder also said that the U.S. sent a THAAD battery to Israel in 2019 for training. It also is not unusual for the U.S. to have a limited number of troops in Israel, which the U.S. considers a key regional ally. There generally has been a small number of forces there consistently as well as routine rotational deployments for training and exercises. The THAAD will add another layer to Israel's already significant air defenses, which include separate systems designed to intercept long-range, medium-range and short-range threats. Israel recently retired its U.S.-made Patriot systems after decades of use. According to an April report by the Congressional Research Service, the Army has seven THAAD batteries. Generally each consists of six truck-mounted launchers, 48 interceptors, radio and radar equipment and requires 95 soldiers to operate. The THAAD is considered a complementary system to the Patriot, but it can defend a wider area. It can hit targets at ranges of 150 to 200 kilometers (93 to 124 miles), and is used to destroy short-range, medium-range and limited intermediate-range ballistic missile threats that are either inside or outside the atmosphere. The U.S. Missile Defense Agency is responsible for developing the system, but it is operated by the Army. An eighth system has been funded and ordered and is expected to be in the field sometime next year. ____ Associated Press writers Jon Gambrell in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, Aamer Madhani in Tampa, Florida, and Josef Federman in Jerusalem contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/thaad-israel-missile-defense-iran-pentagon-34a0b06d82352df6cb0b80d94d4913c8	2024-10-13T07:14:19-07:00	
North Korea says front-line units ready to strike South Korea if more drones appear	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korea said Sunday its front-line army units are ready to launch strikes on South Korea, ramping up pressure on its rival that it said flew drones and dropped leaflets over its capital Pyongyang. South Korea has refused to confirm whether it sent drones but warned it would sternly punish North Korea if the safety of its citizens is threatened. North Korea on Friday accused South Korea of launching drones to drop propaganda leaflets over Pyongyang three times this month and threatened to respond with force if it happened again. In a statement carried by state media Sunday, the North’s Defense Ministry said that the military had issued a preliminary operation order to artillery and other army units near the border with South Korea to 'get fully ready to open fire.' An unidentified ministry spokesperson said the North Korea’s military ordered relevant units to fully prepare for situations like launching immediate strikes on unspecified enemy targets when South Korea infiltrates drones across the border again, possibly triggering fighting on the Korean Peninsula, according to the statement. The spokesperson said that 'grave touch-and-go military tensions are prevailing on the Korean Peninsula' because of the South Korean drone launches. In a separate statement later Sunday, the spokesperson said that the entire South Korean territory 'might turn into piles of ashes' following the North's powerful attack. Also Sunday, the powerful sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un described as 'suicidal' the South Korean Defense Ministry’s reported warning that North Korea would face the end of its regime if it harms South Korean nationals. She warned Saturday that the discovery of a new South Korean drone will 'certainly lead to a horrible disaster.' North Korea often issues such fiery, blistering rhetoric in times of elevated animosities with South Korea and the United States. Ties between the two Koreas remain tense since a U.S.-led diplomacy on ending North Korea's nuclear program fell apart in 2019. North Korea has since pushed hard to expand its nuclear arsenal and repeatedly threatened to attack South Korea and the U.S. with its nuclear weapons. But experts say it's unlikely for North Korea to launch a full-blown attack because its military is outpaced by the combined U.S. and South Korean forces. Observers predicted North Korea would escalate tensions ahead of next month's U.S. presidential election to boost its leverage in future diplomacy with the Americans. Since May, North Korea has floated thousands of balloons carrying rubbish toward South Korea in retaliation for South Korean activists flying their own balloons carrying anti-Pyongyang leaflets. South Korea’s military responded to the North’s balloon campaign by restarting border loudspeakers to blare broadcast propaganda and K-pop songs to North Korea. North Korea is extremely sensitive to any outside criticism of the authoritarian government of Kim Jong Un and his family’s dynastic rule.	https://apnews.com/article/north-south-korea-drones-c923535e6f414674593d74ff935adf41	2024-10-13T07:00:57-07:00	
Netanyahu mulls plan to empty northern Gaza of civilians and cut off aid to those left inside	JERUSALEM (AP) — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is examining a plan to seal off humanitarian aid to northern Gaza in an attempt to starve out Hamas militants, a plan that, if implemented, could trap without food or water hundreds of thousands of Palestinians unwilling or unable to leave their homes. Israel has issued many evacuation orders for the north throughout the yearlong war, the most recent of which was Sunday. The plan proposed to Netanyahu and the Israeli parliament by a group of retired generals would escalate the pressure, giving Palestinians a week to leave the northern third of the Gaza Strip, including Gaza City, before declaring it a closed military zone. Those who remain would be considered combatants — meaning military regulations would allow troops to kill them — and denied food, water, medicine and fuel, according to a copy of the plan given to The Associated Press by its chief architect, who says the plan is the only way to break Hamas in the north and pressure it to release the remaining hostages. The plan calls for Israel to maintain control over the north for an indefinite period to attempt to create a new administration without Hamas, splitting the Gaza Strip in two. There has been no decision by the government to fully carry out the so-called 'Generals’ Plan,' and it is unclear how strongly it's being considered. When asked if the evacuation orders in northern Gaza marked the first stages of the 'Generals' Plan,' Israeli military spokesperson Lt. Col. Nadav Shoshani said no. 'We have not received a plan like that,' he added. But one official with knowledge of the matter said parts of the plan are already being implemented, without specifying which parts. A second official, who is Israeli, said Netanyahu 'had read and studied' the plan, 'like many plans that have reached him throughout the war,' but didn't say whether any of it had been adopted. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity, because the plan isn't supposed to be discussed publicly. On Sunday, Israel launched an offensive against Hamas fighters in the Jabaliya refugee camp north of the city. No trucks of food, water or medicine have entered the north since Sept. 30, according to the U.N. and the website of the Israeli military agency overseeing humanitarian aid crossings. The U.S. State Department spokesperson has said Washington is against any plan that would bring direct Israeli occupation in Gaza. Human rights groups fear the plan's potential toll on civilians Human rights groups say the plan would likely starve civilians and that it flies in the face of international law, which prohibits using food as a weapon and forcible transfers. Accusations that Israel is intentionally limiting food to Gaza are central to the genocide case brought against it at the International Court of Justice, charges Israel denies. So far, very few Palestinians have heeded the latest evacuation order. Some are older, sick or afraid to leave their homes, but many fear there’s nowhere safe to go and that they will never be allowed back. Israel has prevented those who fled earlier in the war from returning. 'All Gazans are afraid of the plan,' said Jomana Elkhalili, a 26-year-old Palestinian aid worker for Oxfam living in Gaza City with her family. 'Still, they will not flee. They will not make the mistake again ... We know the place there is not safe,' she said, referring to southern Gaza, where most of the population is huddled in dismal tent camps and airstrikes often hit shelters. 'That’s why people in the north say it’s better to die than to leave.' The plan has emerged as Hamas has shown enduring strength, firing rockets into Tel Aviv and regrouping in areas after Israeli troops withdraw, bringing repeated offensives. After a year of devastating war with Hamas, Israel has far fewer ground troops in Gaza than it did a few months ago and in recent weeks has turned its attention to Hezbollah, launching an invasion of southern Lebanon. There is no sign of progress on a cease-fire in either front. Israel’s offensive on the strip has killed more than 42,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which doesn't distinguish between civilians and combatants, but says more than half of the dead are women and children. People in northern Gaza could be forced to ‘surrender or starve’ The Generals’ Plan was presented to the parliament last month by a group of retired generals and high-ranking officers, according to publicly available minutes. Since then, officials from the prime minister’s office called seeking more details, according to its chief architect, Giora Eiland, a former head of the National Security Council. Israeli media reported that Netanyahu told a closed parliamentary defense committee session that he was considering the plan. Eiland said the only way to stop Hamas and bring an end to the yearlong war is to prevent its access to aid. 'They will either have to surrender or to starve,' Eiland said. 'It doesn’t necessarily mean that we’re going to kill every person,' he said. 'It will not be necessary. People will not be able to live there (the north). The water will dry up.' He believes the siege could force Hamas to release some 100 Israeli hostages still being held by the group since its Oct. 7 attack that triggered Israel’s campaign. At least 30 of the hostages are presumed dead. Human rights groups are appalled. 'I’m most concerned by how the plan seems to say that if the population is given a chance to evacuate and they don’t, then somehow they all turn into legitimate military targets, which is absolutely not the case,' said Tania Hary, executive director of Gisha, an Israeli organization dedicated to protecting Palestinians’ right to move freely within Gaza. The copy of the plan shared with the AP says that if the strategy is successful in northern Gaza, it could then be replicated in other areas, including tent camps further to the south sheltering hundreds of thousands of Palestinians. When asked about the plan Wednesday, U.S. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said the U.S. was going to 'make absolutely clear that it’s not just the United States that opposes any occupation of Gaza, any reduction in the size of Gaza, but it is the virtual unanimous opinion of the international community.' In northern Gaza, aid has dried up and people are trapped The north, including Gaza City, was the initial target of Israel’s ground offensive early in the war, when it first ordered everyone there to leave. Entire neighborhoods have been reduced to rubble since then. A senior U.N. official said that no aid, except for one small shipment of fuel for hospitals, has entered the north since Sept. 30, whether through crossings from Israel or from southern Gaza. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss confidential information. COGAT, the Israeli body facilitating aid crossings into Gaza, denied that crossings to the north have been closed, but didn't respond when asked how many trucks have entered in recent days. The U.N. official said that only about 100 Palestinians have fled the north since Sunday. 'At least 400,000 people are trapped in the area,' Philippe Lazzarini, head of the U.N.’s agency for Palestinian refugees, wrote on X Thursday. 'With almost no basic supplies available, hunger is spreading.' Troops have already cut off roads between Gaza City and areas further north, making it difficult for people to flee, said two doctors in the far north — Mohammed Salha, director of al-Awda Hospital, and Dr. Rana Soloh, at Kamal Adwan Hospital. 'North Gaza is now divided into two parts,' Soloh said. 'There are checkpoints and inspections, and not everyone can cross easily.' ___ Melanie Lidman contributed to this report from Jerusalem.	https://apnews.com/article/hamas-israel-generals-plan-eiland-gaza-219d7eb9a3050e281ccc032d5a56263c	2024-10-13T04:46:33-07:00	
Middle East latest: US says it will send THAAD defense battery to Israel, along with US troops	The U.S. is sending a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense battery to Israel, along with US troops to operate it. The Pentagon made the announcement just hours after Iran warned the U.S. to keep its military forces out of Israel. Israel is widely believed to be preparing a military response to Iran's Oct. 1 attack when it fired roughly 180 missiles into Israel. Israel has been escalating its campaign against Hezbollah with waves of heavy airstrikes across Lebanon and a ground invasion at the border after a year of exchanges of fire. Israel is now at war with Hamas in Gaza and Hamas’ ally Hezbollah in Lebanon. Israel’s offensive in Gaza has killed over 42,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities, who do not say how many were fighters but say women and children make up more than half of the fatalities. The war has destroyed large areas of Gaza and displaced about 90% of its population of 2.3 million people. It’s been a year since Hamas-led militants blew holes in Israel’s security fence and stormed into army bases and farming communities, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting another 250. They are still holding about 100 captives inside Gaza, a third of whom are believed to be dead. Here's the latest: Rescue service: Nearly 40 people wounded in drone strike in central Israel Israel Rescue Services said that almost 40 people were wounded in a drone strike in the central Israeli city of Binyamina, three of them critically. Israeli media said that two drones were launched from Lebanon. The Israeli military said one drone was intercepted. Israel’s advanced air defense systems mean such a high number of injuries from drones or missiles are exceptionally rare. This is the second time in two days that a drone has struck Israel. On Saturday, during the Israeli holiday of Yom Kippur, a drone struck a retirement home in a suburb of Tel Aviv, causing damage but no injuries Officials: At least 20 people are injured in drone strike in central Israel TEL AVIV, Israel — Israel Rescue Services said that at least 20 people were injured in a drone strike in the central Israeli city of Binyamina, three of them critically. Israeli media said that two drones were launched from Lebanon, and one was intercepted near the coast. This is the second drone strike in two days in Israel. On Saturday, during the Jewish holiday of Yom Kippur, a drone struck a retirement home in a suburb of Tel Aviv, causing damage but no injuries. Israel says it is destroying Hezbollah infrastructure in southern Lebanon Israel’s defense minister says Israel is making sure that Hezbollah militants won’t return to communities in southern Lebanon. Defense Minister Yoav Gallant made the comments Sunday during a visit to forces in northern Israel near the border. Gallant described the 'entire first line of villages' in southern Lebanon as having Hezbollah infrastructure and asserted that Israeli defense forces are currently destroying it above and below ground during their ground invasion. 'I have instructed the IDF at all levels to ensure the destruction of (attack infrastructure) and to ensure that terrorists may not return to these places. This is essential in order to ensure the safety of Israel’s northern communities,' Gallant said. U.S. will send complex defense system to Israel despite Iranian threat The United States will send a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense battery and troops to Israel. The Pentagon made the announcement Sunday, shortly after Iran warned Washington to keep American military forces out of Israel. Pentagon spokesman Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said in a statement that Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin authorized the deployment of the THAAD battery at the direction of President Joe Biden. Ryder said the air defense system will help bolster Israel’s air defenses following Iran’s missile attacks on Israel in April and October. The THAAD is a defensive system that shoots down incoming ballistic missiles. U.N. mission says Israeli tanks forcibly entered gates of one of its bases before leaving The U.N. peacekeeping mission in Lebanon says Israeli tanks forcibly entered the gates of one of its bases in southern Lebanon and destroyed the main gate early Sunday. A UNIFIL statement calls it a 'further flagrant violation of international law.' The tanks later left. Israel has warned the U.N. force to evacuate its positions during its offensive in southern Lebanon against the Hezbollah militant group. International criticism is growing after Israeli strikes wounded five peacekeepers in recent days. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday expressed regret for wounding peacekeepers but accused the U.N. mission of providing a 'human shield' for Hezbollah. Israel has long accused the U.N. of being biased against it, and relations have worsened during the yearlong war in Gaza. UNIFIL was created in 1978 to oversee the withdrawal of Israeli troops after Israel invaded and occupied south Lebanon. Netanyahu says UN peacekeepers are serving as ‘human shields’ for Hezbollah TEL AVIV, Israel — Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has accused U.N. peacekeepers in southern Lebanon of serving as 'human shields' for Hezbollah after Israeli strikes wounded five of them in recent days. The Israeli military has warned UNIFIL to evacuate southern Lebanon as it carries out air and ground operations against Hezbollah militants, but the peacekeepers have so far refused. Netanyahu said Sunday that their refusal to clear out 'has the effect of providing Hezbollah terrorists with human shields,' saying they had become 'hostages of Hezbollah.' 'We regret the injury to the UNIFIL soldiers and we are doing everything in our power to prevent this injury. But the simple and obvious way to ensure this is simply to get them out of the danger zone,' he said in a video addressed to the U.N. secretary-general, who has been banned from entering Israel. The military has ordered the peacekeepers to move five kilometers (three miles) north, which would effectively keep them from doing their mission. They have already halted patrols because of air and ground attacks. Israel has long accused the U.N. of being biased against it and relations have plunged further since the start of the war in Gaza. It has accused the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees of having been infiltrated by Hamas, allegations the agency denies. Italian premier says UN peacekeeper security must be guaranteed ROME — Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni has told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that the security of U.N. forces in southern Lebanon must be 'guaranteed at all times.' In a phone conversation Sunday with Netanyahu, Meloni also stressed that UNIFIL 'acts under a mandate from the Security Council to contribute to regional stability.' She reiterated 'the absolute necessity that the security of UNIFIL personnel be guaranteed at all times.' Netanyahu says Hezbollah uses U.N. peacekeepers as 'human shields' after Israeli strikes wounded five of them in recent days. The Italian premier also said she is convinced that, through the full implementation of U .N. Security Council Resolution 1701, 'we can contribute to the stabilization of the Israeli-Lebanese border and ensure the return home of all displaced persons.' Both Lebanese troops and U.N. peacekeepers are deployed in southern Lebanon to enforce the resolution that ended a bloody monthlong 2006 war between Israel and Hezbollah. Foreign ministers of Iraq, Iran warn Israel against sparking broader war BAGHDAD — Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said Sunday that the Middle East faces 'dangerous challenges' as Tehran anticipates an Israeli strike. 'Iran does not seek war, but we are prepared for war,' Araghchi said at a news conference in Baghdad after meeting with his Iraqi counterpart. Meanwhile, Iraqi Foreign Minister Fouad Hussein said Israel was forbidden from using Iraq’s airspace in any possible strike against Iran. Baghdad’s top diplomat said an outbreak of regional war will create not only a global crisis but also fertile ground for the reemergence of extremist groups like the Islamic State. 'We are trying to keep the conflict away from the region and Iraq,' he said. Iran's foreign minister warns the US against sending forces to operate in Israel DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Iran’s foreign minister indirectly threatened U.S. forces potentially operating in Israel in an online post Sunday. The comments came in a post on the social platform X long associated with Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, who helped reached Iran’s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers. In the message, Araghchi referred to the United States potentially sending one of its Terminal High Altitude Area Defense systems to Israel. Any move of one of the systems, known by the acronym THAAD, to Israel would involve the deployment of soldiers to operate the complex system. 'The US has been delivering record amount of arms to Israel,' the X message read. 'It is now also putting lives of its troops at risk by deploying them to operate US missile systems in Israel.' It added: 'While we have made tremendous efforts in recent days to contain an all-out war in our region, I say it clearly that we have no red lines in defending our people and interests.' Iran’s Foreign Ministry did not respond to a request for comment over the remarks, which were carried by Iranian state media. Israel is widely believed to be planning to attack Iran over its missile barrage on Israel earlier this month, its second direct attack on Israel during the ongoing Israel-Hamas war that’s widened to Lebanon and involved other Iranian-backed militant groups in the region. The THAAD is a defensive system that shoots down incoming ballistic missiles, like those fired by Iran in its last attack. ___ Associated Press writer Jon Gambrell contributed. ___ VATICAN CITY — Pope Francis reiterated his call on Sunday for an 'immediate ceasefire' in the ongoing conflicts in the Middle East and asked for the U.N. peacekeepers to be 'respected.'

Ukraine’s human rights envoy urges response to alleged killings of Ukrainian POWs in Kursk	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukraine’s human rights ombudsman urged international organizations Sunday to respond to a claim that several Ukrainian prisoners of war were executed in Russia’s Kursk region, where Kyiv had launched an incursion in August. DeepState, a Ukrainian battlefield analysis site close to Ukraine’s Defense Ministry, said that Russian troops shot and killed nine Ukrainian 'drone operators and contractors' on Oct. 10 after they had surrendered. Dmytro Lubinets said on Telegram that he sent letters to the United Nations and the International Committee of the Red Cross regarding the case, calling it 'another crime committed by the Russians.' Later on Sunday, Ukrainian Prosecutor-General Andriy Kostin said that his office had opened a criminal investigation into the matter. Earlier this month, Ukraine’s Prosecutor-General’s Office of Ukraine said that Russian troops had killed 16 captured Ukrainian soldiers in the partially occupied Donetsk region. There was no immediate response from Russian officials. Meanwhile, the Ukrainian air force said Sunday that its air defenses had shot down 31 of 68 drones launched at Ukraine by Russia overnight into Sunday in the regions of Kyiv, Poltava, Chernihiv, Sumy and Cherkasy. A further 36 drones were 'lost' over various areas, it said, likely having been electronically jammed. The air force added that ballistic missiles struck Odesa and Poltava while Chernihiv and Sumy came under attack by a guided air missile. Local authorities didn't report any casualties or damage. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Sunday that Russia had launched around 900 guided aerial bombs, more than 40 missiles and 400 drones against Ukraine over the past week. Zelenskyy appealed on X to Ukraine’s allies to 'provide the necessary quantity and quality of air defense systems' and 'make decisions for our sufficient range.' Kyiv is still awaiting word from its Western partners on its repeated requests to use the long-range weapons they provide to hit targets on Russian soil. In Russia, the Defense Ministry said that 13 Ukrainian drones were shot down over three regions of Russia: six each in the Belgorod and Kursk regions, and one in the Bryansk region, all of which border Ukraine. ___ Follow the AP’s coverage of the war at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-pows-kursk-drones-missiles-d8eabbac5bd82b34bd715c4d7473a346	2024-10-13T02:38:52-07:00	
Indian politician known for his close ties with Bollywood is killed in Mumbai	NEW DELHI (AP) — A senior politician in India’s financial capital, Mumbai, who was also known for his close ties with Bollywood has been shot dead weeks before a key state election. Baba Siddique, 66, was shot multiple times outside his son’s office in Mumbai on Saturday night, police said in a statement. He later succumbed to his wounds at the city’s Lilavati Hospital. Siddique was associated with the Indian National Congress party for decades but had recently joined a regional party that rules Maharashtra state. He was also close to several Bollywood superstars and was known for throwing lavish parties. Maharashtra’s deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, who is from the same political party as Siddique, said he was shocked by the killing. 'The incident will be thoroughly investigated and strict action will be taken against the attackers. The mastermind behind the attack will also be traced,' Pawar said in a statement. News agency Press Trust of India reported that two suspected attackers had been arrested, and police were searching for another. Broadcaster NDTV said the two suspects claimed they were part of a crime gang that has carried out multiple killings in the past. Elections in Maharashtra state are expected to be held in November.	https://apnews.com/article/india-baba-siddique-shot-bollywood-455faf6f0fca1ebb06c87b2fa02066da	2024-10-12T22:39:15-07:00	
Israeli strike on Gaza kills a family of 8	DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — An Israeli strike on the central Gaza Strip has killed a family of eight, Palestinian medical officials said Sunday, as Israeli forces battled Palestinian militants and pushed for the evacuation of hundreds of thousands of people from the territory's north. Israel is also waging an air and ground campaign against Hezbollah in Lebanon, and is expected to strike Iran in retaliation for a missile attack earlier this month, though it has not said how or when. The strike in Gaza late Saturday hit a home in the Nuseirat refugee camp, killing parents and their six children, who ranged in age from 8 to 23, according to the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in nearby Deir al-Balah, where the bodies were taken. It said another seven people were wounded, including two women and a child in critical condition. An Associated Press reporter counted the bodies and filmed funeral prayers held at the hospital. More than a year into the war with Hamas, Israel continues to strike what it says are militant targets in Gaza nearly every day. The military says it tries to avoid harming civilians and blames their deaths on Hamas and other armed groups because they operate in densely populated areas. The military rarely comments on individual strikes, which often kill women and children. In recent months, it has repeatedly struck schools being used as shelters by displaced people, accusing militants of hiding among them. Israel presses for full evacuation of northern Gaza In northern Gaza, Israeli air and ground forces have been attacking Jabaliya, where the military says militants have regrouped. Over the past year, Israeli forces have repeatedly returned to the built-up refugee camp, which dates back to the 1948 war surrounding Israel's creation, and other hard-hit areas. Israel has ordered the full evacuation of northern Gaza, including Gaza City. An estimated 400,000 people remain in the north after a mass evacuation ordered in the opening weeks of the war. The Palestinians fear Israel intends to permanently depopulate the north to establish military bases or Jewish settlements there. The military confirmed Saturday that hospitals were included in the evacuation orders but said it had not set a specific timetable. It said a medical convoy scheduled to transfer patients from the Kamal Adwan Hospital in recent days was canceled for security reasons — without elaborating — but that the convoy had delivered fuel to the hospital on Saturday. The war began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250. Around 100 hostages are still being held in Gaza, a third of whom are believed to be dead. Israel's bombardment and ground invasions of Gaza have killed over 42,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, and left much of the territory in ruins. Palestinian medical officials do not say whether those killed by Israeli forces are militants or civilians, but say women and children make up over half the fatalities. Israel says it has killed over 17,000 fighters, without providing evidence. Israel expected to strike Iran as fighting rages in Lebanon Lebanon's Hezbollah, which is allied with Hamas, began firing rockets into Israel on Oct. 8, 2023, drawing retaliatory airstrikes. The conflict dramatically escalated in September with a wave of Israeli strikes that killed Hezbollah's leader, Hassan Nasrallah, and most of his senior commanders. Israel launched a ground operation into southern Lebanon earlier this month. At least 2,255 people have been killed in Lebanon since the start of the conflict, including more than 1,400 people since September, according to Lebanon's Health Ministry, which also does not say how many were Hezbollah fighters. At least 54 people have been killed in the rocket attacks on Israel, nearly half of them soldiers. Iran, which supports Hezbollah and Hamas, launched around 180 ballistic missiles at Israel to avenge the killing of Nasrallah, an Iranian general who was with him, and Ismail Haniyeh, the political leader of Hamas, who died in an explosion in Iran's capital in July that was widely blamed on Israel. ___ Find more of AP’s war coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-lebanon-hezbollah-news-10-13-2024-a8cd5df3e2bb4ab08405a78251244bb2	2024-10-12T21:54:05-07:00	
They fled their homes to escape Boko Haram. Now Nigeria is resettling them back despite their fears	DAMASAK, Nigeria (AP) — When Boko Haram launched an insurgency in northeastern Nigeria in 2010, Abdulhameed Salisu packed his bag and fled from his hometown of Damasak in the country's battered Borno state. The 45-year-old father of seven came back with his family early last year. They are among thousands of Nigerians taken back from displacement camps to their villages, hometowns or newly built settlements known as 'host communities' under a resettlement program that analysts say is being rushed to suggest the conflict with the Islamic militants is nearly over. Across Borno, dozens of displacement camps have been shut down, with authorities claiming they are no longer needed and that most places from where the displaced fled are now safe. But many of the displaced say it’s not safe to go back. Boko Haram — Nigeria’s homegrown jihadis — took up arms in 2009 to fight against Western education and impose their radical version of Islamic law, or Sharia. The conflict, now Africa's longest struggle with militancy, has spilled into Nigeria's northern neighbors. Some 35,000 civilians have been killed and more than 2 million have been displaced in the northeastern region, according to U.N. numbers. The 2014 kidnapping of 276 schoolgirls by Boko Haram in the village of Chibok in Borno state — the epicenter of the conflict — shocked the world. Borno state alone has nearly 900,000 internally displaced people in displacement camps, with many others absorbed in local communities. So far this year, at least 1,600 civilians have been killed in militant attacks in Borno state, according to the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project, a U.S.-based nonprofit. And in a state where at least 70% of the population depends on agriculture, dozens of farmers have also been killed by the extremists or abducted from their farmland in the last year. In May, hundreds of hostages, mostly women and children who were held captive for months or years by Boko Haram were rescued from a forest enclave and handed over to authorities, the army said. In September, at least 100 villagers were killed by suspected Boko Haram militants who opened fire on a market, on worshippers and in people’s homes in the Tarmuwa council area of the neighboring Yobe state, west of Borno. Analysts say that a forced resettlement could endanger the local population as there is still inadequate security across the hard-hit region. Salisu says he wastes away his days in a resettlement camp in Damasak, a garrison town in Borno state of about 200,000 residents, close to the border with Niger. Food is getting increasingly difficult to come by and Salisu depends on handouts from the World Food Program and other aid organizations. He longs to find work. 'We are begging the government to at least find us a means of livelihood instead of staying idle and waiting for whenever food comes,' he said. On a visit last week to Damasak, Cindy McCain, the WFP chief, pledged the world would not abandon the Nigerian people as she called for more funding to support her agency's aid operations. 'We are going to stay here and do the very best we can to end hunger,' McCain told The Associated Press as she acknowledged the funding shortages. 'How do I take food from the hungry and give it to the starving,' she said. Resettlement usually involves the displaced being taken in military trucks back to their villages or 'host communities.' The Borno state government has promised to provide returnees with essentials to help them integrate into these areas, supported by aid groups. The government says the displacement camps are no longer sustainable. 'What we need now is ... durable solutions,' Borno governor Babagana Zulum told McCain during her visit. As the resettlement got underway, one in five displaced persons stayed back in Maiduguri, the Borno state capital, and nearby towns but were left without any support for local integration, the Global Protection Cluster, a network of non-government organizations and U.N. agencies, said last December. Many others have crossed the border to the north, to settle as refugees in neighboring Niger, Chad or Cameroon. The three countries have registered at least 52,000 Nigerian refugees since January 2023, according to the U.N. refugee agency — nearly twice the number registered in the 22 months before that. A rushed closure of displacement camps and forced resettlement puts the displaced people at risk again from militants still active in their home areas — or forces them to 'cut deals' with jihadis to be able to farm or fish, the International Crisis Group warned in a report earlier this year. That could make the extremists consolidate their presence in those areas, the group warned. Boko Haram, which in 2016 split into two main factions, continues to ambush security convoys and raid villages. Abubakar Kawu Monguno, head of the Center for Disaster Risk Management at the University of Maiduguri, said the best option is for government forces to intensify their campaign to eliminate the militants or 'push them to surrender.' After not being able to access their farms because of rampant attacks by militants, some farmers in Damasak and other parts of Mobbar district returned to work their land last year, armed with seedlings provided by the government. Salisu was one of them. Then a major flood struck in September, collapsing a key dam and submerging about 40% of Maiduguri's territory. Thirty people were killed and more than a million others were affected, authorities said. Farms that feed the state were ruined, including Salisu's. His hopes for a good rice harvest were washed away. Now he lines up to get food at a Damasak food hub. 'Since Boko Haram started, everything else stopped here,' he said. 'There is nothing on the ground and there are no jobs.' Maryam Abdullahi also lined up at a WFP hub in Damasak with other women, waiting for bags of rice and other food items she desperately needs for her family of eight. Her youngest is 6 years old. The donations barely last halfway through the month, she said, but she still waited in the scorching heat. What little money she has she uses to buy yams to fry and sell to sustain her family but it’s nowhere enough. Her only wish is to be able to get a 'proper job' so she and her children would feel safe, she said. 'We either eat in the morning for strength for the rest of the day or ... we eat only at night,' Abdullahi said. ___ Associated Press reporter Haruna Umar in Maiduguri, Nigeria, contributed to this report. contributed. ___ The Associated Press receives financial support for global health and development coverage in Africa from the Gates Foundation.

Lithuanians vote in parliamentary election with many looking for change despite a strong economy	VILNIUS, Lithuania (AP) — Lithuanians voted Sunday in the first round of parliamentary elections that could lead to the center-right governing coalition being replaced by the opposition Social Democrats and smaller center-left parties. Despite economic successes, strict COVID-19 measures and an influx of migrants have cast shadows over conservative Prime Minister Ingrida Šimonytė’s government, which took office in 2020. Although European Union member Lithuania has seen annual double-digit personal income growth and has one of the lowest inflation rates in the 27-nation bloc, many voters don’t seem to be impressed. 'There’s a lot of disappointment and discontent among voters,' said Rima Urbonaitė, a political analyst at Vilnius’ Mykolas Romeris University. 'It is related to numerous crises and shocks and cannot be compensated by economic factors like positive change in purchasing power.' Šimonytė has faced criticism for strict measures during the pandemic, with many complaining that her government didn’t do enough to help companies during lockdown. Others say thousands of people didn’t have proper access to health care services. Šimonytė also has been lambasted for her handling of migrants arriving via Belarus. Lithuania has its eastern neighbor, as well as Russia, of orchestrating the influx of people, mostly from Africa and the Middle East. A recent survey by pollster Vilmorus says that the Social Democratic Party, led by Vilija Blinkevičiūtė, would top the poll, with twice as many votes as Šimonytė’s Homeland Union. Nemuno Aušra, a newly registered party of right-wing politician Remigijus Žemaitaitis, who was impeached earlier this year for making antisemitic statements, would come in between them. However no party would obtain more than 20% of the vote, forcing anyone hoping to govern to to look for alliances. The Social Democrats have ruled out an alliance with Žemaitaitis’ party, meaning that three or four parties, likely small groups representing the political center, will be necessary to form a governing coalition. 'I have voted for the conservatives my entire life, but this year I’m thinking of giving my ballot to another good party, not to them,' said Darius Mikalauskas, a 51-year-old teacher in Vilnius. 'Šimonytė and the entire Homeland Union looks battered, worn out and they would better spend some time on the spare bench.' Analysts say a shift to the left wouldn’t bring significant changes to the foreign policy of Lithuania, which also borders Russia’s Kaliningrad exclave to the west. But the vote comes at a time when Russia’s war in Ukraine is fueling greater fears about Moscow’s intentions, particularly in the strategically important Baltic region. 'In this country, the foreign policy course is determined mainly by the president,' Urbonaitė said. Earlier this year, President Gitanas Nauseda beat Šimonytė in the presidential election to take a second five-year term. In 2020, Šimonytė led her Homeland Union to victory in the parliamentary election. She later formed a coalition with two liberal parties, the Freedom Party and the Liberal Movement. About 2.4 million people are eligible to elect 141 members of the parliament, or Seimas, for a four-year term in two rounds. On Sunday, 70 lawmakers will be elected by party lists, joined by those in single-mandate constituencies who manage to win more than 50% of votes. The runoff is Oct. 27, when the majority of single-member constituencies will vote to choose between the two leading candidates.	https://apnews.com/article/lithuania-elections-parliament-3ec44ad544ae11cf05b1b112175ef93b	2024-10-12T19:02:21-07:00	
Cubans searching for a better future leave their pets behind	HAVANA (AP) — Balto, Pepa and Mami were among the lucky ones. After being abandoned by their owners who left Cuba — or simply couldn’t care for them anymore — the dogs were rescued by animal rights activists on the island, who fed them, sterilized them and found them a new home. Many others didn't have such luck, and were left wandering the streets. While there are no official figures or estimates of how many pets have been left behind by their owners who leave the island, the number of abandoned cats and dogs has spiked in the last two years as Cubans migrate in record numbers, animal activists say. 'We’d receive a phone call from someone asking us to care for their pets, because they’re suddenly migrating and don’t know what to do with them,' said Elizabeth Meade, founder of Adoptions for Love, an animal shelter in Havana. Although the shelter found a home for some 300 rescued pets in the past year, many of those were returned — or simply went missing — after their new owners also decided to migrate. For these animals, said Meade, 'it’s not always a happy ending.' Between October 2021 and September 2024, U.S. authorities reported more than 600,000 encounters with Cubans — a significant number for an island of roughly 10 million people. That is in addition to the thousands who choose to migrate to Spain or other Latin American countries. For many Cubans, taking their pets with them is not an option. Transporting an animal from Havana to Miami through a specialized agency can cost up to $1,200 — including medical examinations and the flight — and, since September, pet owners have to pay an additional $1,300 to comply with a legal obligation of a quarantine. For those who remain in Cuba, daily life is not easy: the country’s gross domestic product fell by 2% in 2023, resulting in rampant inflation and food and fuel shortages. Caring for a pet on the island can be prohibitive for most Cubans. While the average monthly salary in the state sector — the largest employer — is about $21, a 20-kilo bag of imported dog food can cost up to $70 and a visit to the vet costs the equivalent of $10. The increase in the number of abandoned pets in Cuba has been largely countered by animal activism, a phenomenon that began to take shape in 2018 after the Internet was massively adopted and social media helped coordinate actions. In 2021, animal rights activists scored a win when the government passed a long-awaited animal welfare law, which seeks to prevent cruelty and raise awareness about the need to protect animals. The law also penalizes animal cruelty, including dogfights, and the sacrifice of animals for religious purposes but activists say it is not enough. 'Abandonment is the worst form of animal abuse,' said Leandro Valdés, a dog trainer and proud owner of Koffee, a rescued dog that has gone viral as he rides around Havana in the back of Valdés’ motorcycle, wearing goggles and a seatbelt.

Beijing loyalists will vote to endorse Macao's former top judge as next leader of the casino hub	MACAO (AP) — About 400 Beijing loyalists were set to vote Sunday to endorse the sole candidate for the top job in the Chinese city of Macao in a largely ceremonial election that would make him the first leader of the casino hub to be born in mainland China. Former top judge Sam Hou Fai ’s expected victory within hours would be a departure from the long-standing custom of having chief executives who were born in the former Portuguese colony, typically from influential business families. The shift in the city’s leadership to someone from the legal profession will create expectations of a declining influence from business circles, which critics have often accused of colluding with officials, analysts say. They anticipate Beijing’s policy agenda for the city will take priority. Sam, 62, is widely seen to have Beijing’s blessings. He has already secured endorsements from 386 of the 400 election committee members who are to vote on Sunday. Most of the territory’s 687,000 residents lack voting rights, leading to mixed sentiments about the election. Some hope Sam will heed public opinion and avoid prioritizing business interests, while others feel disconnected from an election process they can’t participate in. Still, political observers said many residents are comfortable with Sam’s non-local origin in a city that has been home to migrants for decades. With Sam’s victory guaranteed, the real challenges await in the governance hurdles that lie ahead. Macao is the only place in China where casino gambling is legal. Beijing has called for the city to diversify its gambling-reliant economy. Sam has promised to accelerate the current government’s plan to boost tourism and other sectors such as traditional Chinese medicine, finance, exhibitions and commerce. However, the city will still need to rely on the gambling industry for government revenues to support the city's welfare and accomplish other goals laid out by Beijing, analysts say. China wants Macao to develop into a world-class tourism and leisure center and play a bigger role as a bridge for trade between China and Portuguese-speaking countries. Small local businesses have been hurt by residents who spend money in the neighboring mainland city of Zhuhai, which offers a wider selection of items with good value for money. Chinese tourists are also now spending less than before. It remains to be seen whether Sam, with a lack of government leadership experience, can form a capable cabinet to tackle these pressing issues. Sam was born in neighboring Guangdong province in 1962. He graduated from the prestigious law school of Peking University in Beijing. He also studied the Portuguese language, culture and law at the University of Coimbra in Portugal, and once practiced law in mainland China. When Macao returned to Chinese rule in 1999, Sam was appointed the city’s top judge, a role in which he served for nearly 25 years before resigning in August to participate in the election. He handled some politically sensitive cases, including rejecting an appeal of a police ban on a vigil commemorating China’s bloody 1989 military crackdown on the Tiananmen Square pro-democracy protests. His court also upheld a decision to bar pro-democracy figures from running in the 2021 legislative elections.	https://apnews.com/article/macao-elects-leader-sam-hou-fai-china-11578a4d193ab2a440b9b915b7909666	2024-10-12T15:04:40-07:00	
Pregnant Philippine women arrested in Cambodia for surrogacy could be prosecuted after giving birth	PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) — Thirteen pregnant Philippine women accused of illegally acting as surrogate mothers in Cambodia after being recruited online may face prison terms after they give birth, a senior Interior Ministry official said Saturday. Interior Ministry Secretary of State Chou Bun Eng, who leads the country’s fight against human trafficking and sexual exploitation, said police found 24 foreign women, 20 Philippine and four Vietnamese, when they raided a villa in Kandal province, near the capital of Phnom Penh, on Sept. 23. Thirteen of the Philippine women were found to be pregnant and were charged in court on Oct. 1 under a provision in the law on Suppression of Human Trafficking and Sexual Exploitation, she said. The law was updated in 2016 to ban commercial surrogacy after Cambodia became a popular destination for foreigners seeking women to give birth to their children. Developing countries have been popular for surrogacy because costs are much lower than in countries such as the United States and Australia, where surrogate services could cost around $150,000. The surrogacy business boomed in Cambodia after it was put under tight restrictions in neighboring Thailand, as well as in India and Nepal. In July 2017, a Cambodian court sentenced an Australian woman and two Cambodian associates to 1 1/2 years in prison for providing commercial surrogacy services. The new case is unusual because surrogates normally are employed in their own countries, not transported elsewhere. Cambodia already has a bad reputation for human trafficking, especially in connection with online scams in which foreigners recruited for work under false pretenses are kept in conditions of virtual slavery and help perpetrate criminal fraud online against targets in many countries. Details of the new surrogacy case remain murky, and officials have not made clear whether the women were arrested or whether anyone involved in organizing the scheme has been identified. Chou Bun Eng told The Associated Press that the business that recruited the surrogates was based in Thailand, and their food and accommodation in Cambodia were arranged from there. She said the authorities had not yet identified the business. She said the seven Philippine women and four Vietnamese women who were caught in the raid but who were not pregnant would be deported soon. The 13 pregnant women have been placed under care at a hospital in Phnom Penh, said Chou Bun Eng. She added that after they give birth, they could be prosecuted on charges that could land them in prison for two to five years. She said that Cambodia considered the women not to have been victimized but rather offenders who conspired with the organizers to act as surrogates and then sell the babies for money. Her assertion could not be verified, as the women could not be contacted and it is not known if they have lawyers. The Philippine Embassy in Cambodia, in response to a local press account of the affair, issued a statement on Wednesday confirming most of the details related to what it called the 'rescue of 20 Filipino women.' 'The Philippine Embassy ensured that all 20 Filipinos were interviewed in the presence of an Embassy representative and an interpreter in every step of the investigation process,' it said.	https://apnews.com/article/surrogacy-human-trafficking-law-0ac21e8d40a0015dba0d62fb3b347601	2024-10-12T08:49:16-07:00	
Former Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond, who sought Scotland's independence from UK, dies at 69	LONDON (AP) — Alex Salmond, the former first minister of Scotland who for decades championed Scotland’s independence from the U.K., has died. He was 69. Salmond, who was a divisive figure in British politics and who as the then leader of the Scottish National Party took Scotland to the brink of independence in a 2014 referendum, died in the North Macedonia lake-resort town of Ohrid, local media reported. 'Unfortunately, Alex Salmond, the former first minister of Scotland who was one of the panellists at yesterday’s cultural diplomacy forum that was held in Ohrid, died suddenly today,' according to a statement from the office of former North Macedonia President Gjorgje Ivanov. Tributes poured in from across the political spectrum, with U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer of the Labour Party calling him a 'monumental figure' of both Scottish and British politics. 'He leaves behind a lasting legacy,' Starmer said. 'As first minister of Scotland, he cared deeply about Scotland’s heritage, history and culture, as well as the communities he represented.' Salmond served as first minister of Scotland from 2007 to 2014, and was leader of the Scottish National Party on two occasions, from 1990 to 2000, and from 2004 to 2014. Salmond, as then leader of the Scottish National Party, led the independence campaign in the referendum in 2014, but lost, gaining 45% of the vote. Salmond resigned from the SNP in 2018 in the wake of sexual harassment allegations. He subsequently formed a new party called Alba — the Scottish Gaelic word for Scotland — and was acquitted of the charges. The current SNP first minister, John Swinney, said that he was 'deeply shocked and saddened at the untimely death' of Salmond. 'Over many years, Alex made an enormous contribution to political life, not just within Scotland, but across the U.K. and beyond,' he said. 'He took the Scottish National Party from the fringes of Scottish politics into government and led Scotland so close to becoming an independent country.' Former U.K. Conservative Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said that Salmond was a 'huge figure in our politics.' Salmond said that he learned to dream of a better Scotland at his grandfather’s knee, and chose to join the SNP at university in 1973 when his English girlfriend poked too much fun at his separatist sentiments. Salmond’s academic and professional background prepared him to become Scotland’s most economically optimistic and visionary politician. At St. Andrew’s University. he double-majored in medieval history, reflecting his love of a Caledonia lost, and economics. In his 20s, he worked as an economist first for Britain’s regional government in Scotland and then at the Royal Bank of Scotland, where he analyzed the country’s most dynamic industry, North Sea oil. He won a seat in the U.K. Parliament in 1987, and within three years was party leader. He supported Tony Blair's Labour government in the late 1990s to create a devolved Scottish parliament in Edinburgh, a reform that stopped short of independence, but gave his homeland a taste of self-government for the first time since its 1707 union with England. Salmond then had a very public forum to push his dream of full independence forward — his government had an array of powers especially on social issues — and managed to convince the government of Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron to call a referendum. Up until the results were known, it had been considered a close call. Though the independence campaign lost, Salmond's SNP managed to capitalize its support and has dominated Scottish politics since. The SNP has been the Edinburgh-based government since, though it suffered a huge setback in this year's U.K.-wide general election, when it lost a vast majority of the seats it held in the House of Commons to Labour. The next Scottish election is due to take place in 2026. ___ Demetris Nellas contributed to this report from Athens, Greece.	https://apnews.com/article/uk-scotland-alex-salmond-dead-bb41c9c8dad38dc16a2760fd15eb8ad4	2024-10-12T07:50:41-07:00	
Powerful storm knocks out power to 1.6 million in Brazil's largest city	SAO PAULO (AP) — More than 1.6 million people in Sao Paulo were without power on Saturday more than 16 hours after a brief but powerful storm swept through South America's largest city. Officials in Sao Paulo state said that record wind gusts Friday night of up to 67 mph (108 kph) knocked down transmission lines and uprooted trees. causing severe damage in some parts. The storm also shut down several airports and interrupted water service in several areas, according to the Sao Paulo state government. Authorities originally expected to restore power within a few hours. But several neighborhoods in the metropolitan area, which is home to 21 million people, were still in the dark on Saturday and authorities were urging residents to limit their consumption of water. One person died when a tree fell on an outdoor stall, authorities said. At least four other people in surrounding Sao Paulo state also died.	https://apnews.com/article/brazil-storm-sao-paulo-44dd41d56497ed41175b09db543b5da2	2024-10-12T06:45:19-07:00	
Heavy Israeli bombardment in northern Gaza as UN peacekeepers in Lebanon are hit again	BEIRUT (AP) — Palestinians in northern Gaza described heavy Israeli bombardment Saturday in the hours after airstrikes killed at least 22 people, as Israel warned people there and in southern Lebanon to get out of the way of offensives against the Hamas and Hezbollah militant groups. In Lebanon, the U.N. peacekeeping force said that its headquarters in Naqoura was hit again, with a peacekeeper struck by gunfire late Friday and in stable condition. It wasn’t clear who fired. The shooting occurred a day after Israel’s military fired on the headquarters for a second straight day. Israel, which has warned peacekeepers to leave their positions, didn’t immediately respond to questions. Hunger warnings emerged again in northern Gaza as residents said they hadn't received aid since the beginning of the month. The U.N. World Food Program said that no food aid had entered the north since Oct. 1. An estimated 400,000 people remain there. Israel’s military renewed its offensive in northern Gaza almost a week ago while escalating its air and ground campaign against the Iran-backed Hezbollah in Lebanon. Amid Israel's war with Hezbollah, a top U.N. official, Carl Skau, told The Associated Press that he's concerned that Lebanon’s ports and airport might be taken out of service. More than 1 million people have been displaced. Lebanon’s state-run National News Agency said that an Israeli airstrike hit an apartment building on the edge of Barja south of Beirut, and the Health Ministry said that four were killed. The ministry said an airstrike on Maisra village northeast of Beirut killed five people. The total toll in Lebanon over the past year of conflict between Israel and Hezbollah is now 2,255 killed, according to the Lebanese Health Ministry. More than 1,400 people have been killed since mid-September. It wasn't clear how many were fighters. Israel’s military said that Hezbollah fired more than 300 projectiles over the Yom Kippur holiday. The military said that it killed 50 militants in Lebanon. Claims on either side couldn't be verified. 'We will keep standing with the Lebanese people during these difficult circumstances and also with the Palestinian people,' the speaker of Iran’s parliament, Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf, said Saturday while touring the scene of an Israeli airstrike in Beirut. Some Gaza residents are trapped In northern Gaza, residents told the AP many were trapped in their homes and shelters with dwindling supplies while seeing bodies uncollected in the streets as the bombing hampered emergency responders. Those who rushed to the scene of the latest deadly airstrikes in the urban refugee camp of Jabaliya found a hole 20 meters (65 feet) deep where a home once stood. At least 20 bodies were recovered as of Saturday morning, while others likely were trapped under rubble, emergency service officials said. Elsewhere in Jabaliya, a strike on a home killed two brothers and wounded a woman and newborn baby, the officials said. Another strike in the afternoon hit a Jabaliya home and killed at least four people, including a woman, said Fares Abu Hamza, an official with the emergency service. Israel’s military said that it killed more than 20 militants in the Jabaliya area over the past day. Military spokesperson Avichay Adraee told people in parts of Jabaliya and Gaza City to evacuate south to an Israeli-designated humanitarian zone as Israel plans to use great force 'and will continue to do so for a long time.' Israel has repeatedly returned to parts of Gaza as Hamas and other militants regroup. The war has destroyed large areas of Gaza and displaced around 90% of its population of 2.3 million people, often multiple times. Once again, some families moved south on foot, in donkey carts or crowded in vehicles that navigated piles of rubble. Others refused to go. 'It’s like the first days of the war,' said a Jabaliya resident, Ahmed Abu Goneim. 'The occupation is doing everything to uproot us. But we will not leave.' The 24-year-old said Israeli warplanes and drones struck many neighboring houses in the past week. He counted 15 relatives and neighbors, including four women and five children as young as 3, killed in neighboring homes. He said that there were dead in the streets and 'no one is able to recover them because of the bombing.' Hamza Sharif, who stays with his family in a school-turned-shelter in Jabaliya, described 'constant bombings day and night.' He said that the shelter hasn't received aid since the beginning of the month. 'Families depend on what they have stored, but they will run out of supplies very soon,' he said. Food is running out The World Food Program said that it was unclear how long the limited food supplies it distributed in northern Gaza earlier will last. The U.N.’s independent investigator on the right to food last month accused Israel of carrying out a 'starvation campaign' against Palestinians, which Israel has denied. Israel's offensive in Gaza started after Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack, when militants stormed into Israel, killing about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250 others. Israel’s offensive has killed more than 42,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities, who don't specify between combatants and civilians. Gaza’s Health Ministry said that hospitals had received the bodies of 49 people killed over the past 24 hours. ___ Samy Magdy reported from Cairo.

Poland's leader plans to suspend the right to asylum as country faces pressure on Belarus border	WARSAW, Poland (AP) — Poland's leader said Saturday that he plans to temporarily suspend the right to asylum as part of a new migration policy, pointing to its alleged abuse by eastern neighbor Belarus and Russia. Prime Minister Donald Tusk said that 'the state must regain 100% of the control over who enters and leaves Poland,' and that a territorial suspension of the right to asylum will be part of a strategy that will be presented to a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday, Polish news agency PAP reported. He didn't give details, but said at a convention of his Civic Coalition that 'we will reduce illegal migration in Poland to a minimum.' Poland has struggled with migration pressures on its border with Belarus since 2021. Successive Polish governments have accused Belarus and Russia of luring migrants from the Middle East and Africa there to destabilize the West. Tusk pointed to alleged misuse of the right to asylum 'by (Belarusian President Alexander) Lukashenko, by (Russian President Vladimir) Putin, by smugglers, human smugglers, human traffickers. How this right to asylum is used is in exact contradiction to the idea of the right to asylum.' He said that he would demand recognition of the decision on the right to asylum from the European Union, PAP reported. Tusk's comments came after Foreign Minister Radek Sikorski said on Thursday that Poland will tighten its visa regulations, stepping up the vetting of applicants. That decision follows an investigation into a cash-for-visas scandal under the country's previous government. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of migration issues at https://apnews.com/hub/migration	https://apnews.com/article/poland-migration-asylum-right-suspension-belarus-1716d8872d38caa25b01ac02a5348a69	2024-10-12T05:08:51-07:00	
An explosion and fire at a service station in Russia's Chechnya kills 4	MOSCOW (AP) — An explosion at a gas station in Russia’s southern region of Chechnya killed at least four people, officials said Saturday. The explosion of a gas tank triggered a fire at the service station in the regional capital, Grozny, said Russia’s Emergencies Ministry, adding that two children were among the dead. The fire was extinguished. Grozny is about 1,500 kilometers (930 miles) south of Moscow. Regional authorities said a criminal investigation was opened. Last month an explosion at a gas station in the neighboring region of Dagestan killed at least 13 people and injured 23 others.	https://apnews.com/article/chechnya-explosion-fire-gas-station-8c6d6841ba9897613724f286534176d0	2024-10-12T05:07:43-07:00	
Ukrainian recruiters descend on Kyiv's nightlife in search of men not registered for conscription	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukrainian military recruitment officers raided restaurants, bars and a concert hall in Kyiv, checking military registration documents and detaining men who were not in compliance, media and witnesses reported Saturday. Officers descended on Kyiv’s Palace of Sports venue after a concert Friday night by Ukrainian rock band Okean Elzy. Video footage aired by local media outlets appears to show officers stationed outside the doors of the concert hall intercepting men as they exit. In the footage, officers appear to be forcibly detaining some men. Checks were also conducted at Goodwine, an upscale shopping center, and Avalon, a popular restaurant. It is unusual for such raids to take place in the capital, and reflects Ukraine’s dire need for fresh recruits. All Ukrainian men aged 25-60 are eligible for conscription, and men aged 18-60 are not allowed to leave the country. Men live in fear of being called up A 27-year-old man said he left the concert as the last song was playing after he was told about the recruitment officers. He said he saw soldiers and police talking to people but 'didn't see anything super aggressive.' He said men felt in danger of being drafted whenever they ventured outside. 'That inner state of always being in danger, it’s back again,' he told The Associated Press, only giving his first name for fear of retribution. He said his university draft waiver was taken away after Ukraine passed laws in April that both lowered draft-eligible age for men from 27 to 25 and did away with some draft exemptions. Local reports said raids were also conducted in clubs and restaurants across other Ukrainian cities, including Kharkiv and Dnipro in eastern and central Ukraine. Ukraine has intensified its mobilization drive this year. A new law came into effect this spring stipulating that those eligible for military service must input their information into an online system or face penalties. Ukraine reports strikes on a Russian-run oil terminal Meanwhile, Ukraine’s military said on Saturday that it struck a Russian-controlled oil terminal in the partially occupied Luhansk region that provides fuel for Russia’s war effort. 'Oil and oil products were stored at this base, which were supplied, in particular, for the needs of the Russian army,' Ukraine’s General Staff wrote on Telegram. Russian state media reported that the terminal close to the city of Rovenky had come under attack from a Ukrainian drone and said there were no casualties and that the fire had been extinguished, but did not comment on the extent of any damage. On Monday, Ukrainian forces said they struck a major oil terminal on the south coast of the Russia-occupied Crimea Peninsula. Both sides are facing the issue of how to sustain their costly war of attrition — a conflict that started with Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and that shows no signs of a resolution. Ukraine’s aim is to impair Russia’s ability to support its front-line units, especially in the eastern Donetsk region where the main Russian battlefield effort is stretching weary Ukrainian forces. Kyiv is still awaiting word from its Western partners on its repeated requests to use the long-range weapons they provide to hit targets on Russian soil. Meanwhile, Russia’s Defense Ministry said 47 Ukrainian drones had been intercepted and destroyed by its air defense systems overnight into Saturday: 17 over the Krasnodar region, 16 over the Sea of ​​Azov, 12 over the Kursk region and two over the Belgorod region, all of which border Ukraine. Belgorod Gov. Vyacheslav Gladkov said Saturday that one person had been killed and 14 wounded in Ukrainian shelling and drone attacks over the previous 24 hours. In Ukraine, the country’s Air Force said air defenses had shot down 24 of 28 drones launched overnight against Ukraine. Zaporizhzhia regional Gov. Ivan Fedorov said two women were wounded Saturday in Russian attacks on the capital of the southern Ukrainian region, also called Zaporizhzhia. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine ___ Morton reported from London.

Authorities said that an investigation that was opened on Sept. 27 subsequently revealed a suspected 'plan for violent action targeting people in a football stadium or a shopping center' allegedly linked to the Afghan suspect.

Middle East latest: Israeli military renews orders for Palestinians to leave northern Gaza	The Israeli military on Saturday renewed its orders for Palestinian in the northern Gaza Strip to leave their homes and shelters as troops press on a weeklong offensive against militants. Most of the fighting in the past week was centered in and around Jabaliya that was pounded by Israeli war jets and artillery. Residents said they have been trapped inside their homes and shelters. In Lebanon, authorities said Friday that 60 people were killed and 168 wounded in the past 24 hours, raising the total toll over the past year of conflict between Israel and the militant group Hezbollah to 2,229 dead and 10,380 wounded. Israel has been escalating its campaign against Hezbollah with waves of heavy airstrikes across Lebanon and a ground invasion at the border, after a year of exchanges of fire. Israel is now at war with Hamas in Gaza and Hamas' ally Hezbollah in Lebanon. Israel’s offensive in Gaza has killed over 42,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities, who do not say how many were fighters but say women and children make up more than half of the fatalities. The war has destroyed large areas of Gaza and displaced about 90% of its population of 2.3 million people, often multiple times. It's been a full year since Hamas-led militants blew holes in Israel’s security fence and stormed into army bases and farming communities, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting another 250. They are still holding about 100 captives inside Gaza, a third of whom are believed to be dead. ___ Here is the latest: US military hits Islamic State camps in Syria with airstrikes The U.S. military said it conducted a series of airstrikes against multiple camps in Syria belonging to the Islamic State group. The U.S. Central Command said the strikes on Friday will 'disrupt the ability of ISIS to plan, organize and conduct attacks against the United States, its allies and partners, and civilians throughout the region and beyond.' It said battle damage assessments were underway and did not include civilian casualties. There are some 900 U.S. forces in Syria, along with an undisclosed number of contractors, mostly trying to prevent any comeback by the extremist IS group, which swept through Iraq and Syria in 2014, taking control of large swaths of territory. Speaker of Iran's parliament visits Beirut BEIRUT — The speaker of Iran’s parliament on Saturday toured the scene of an Israeli airstrike in Beirut that killed and wounded dozens, vowing that Tehran would keep supporting Lebanese and Palestinians in fighting against Israel. Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf visited the bombed area after holding talks with caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati, who said that Lebanon’s priority now was working toward a cease-fire. His office said that Lebanon’s government still abides by a 2006 U.N. Security Council Resolution approved at the end of a 34-day war between Israel and Hezbollah and was prepared to boost Lebanese army presence along the country’s border with Israel. 'We will keep standing with the Lebanese people during these difficult circumstances and also with the Palestinian people,' Qalibaf said during the tour, during which he was escorted by several Hezbollah officials. Qalibaf added that Iran will aid the Lebanese people and 'we hope that they will be victorious.' It was the second recent visit by an Iranian official to Beirut after the foreign minister visited rarlier this month. Iran is a main backer of Hezbollah that has suffered major setbacks in recent weeks, including the killing of it leader Hassan Nasrallah. Hezbollah started attacking Israeli army posts in October last year in solidarity with the militant Hamas group in Gaza. Since Sept. 23, Israel has intensified its airstrikes and forced the displacement of hundreds of thousands of Lebanese. Last week, Israel began a ground invasion of Lebanon, leading to clashes along the border with Hezbollah fighters. No food has entered northern Gaza since Oct. 1, UN says CAIRO — The United Nations food agency said on Saturday that no food aid had entered northern Gaza since Oct. 1. The World Food Program said that the primary border crossing into the war-ravaged area had been closed for about two weeks, warning that Israel’s ongoing ground operation has a disastrous impact on food security for thousands of Palestinians families there. 'The north is basically cut off and we’re not able to operate there,' said Antoine Renard, the WFP country director of Palestinian territories. Concerns of a hunger crisis have risen in Gaza roughly a month after the U.N.’s independent investigator on the right to food accused Israel of carrying out a 'starvation campaign' against Palestinians. Israel has denied such allegations and insisted that it has allowed food and other aid into Gaza in significant quantities. 'Israel has not halted the entry or coordination of humanitarian aid entering from its territory into the northern Gaza Strip. As evidence, humanitarian aid coordinated by COGAT and international organizations will continue to enter the northern Gaza Strip in the coming day as well,' COGAT, the Israeli military body overseeing aid distribution, said in a statement on Wednesday. The WFP said its food distribution points, as well as kitchens and bakeries in northern Gaza, have been forced to shut down due to airstrikes, military ground operations and evacuation orders. It said that the only functioning bakery in North Gaza, supported by WFP, caught fire after being hit by an explosive munition. The WFP said its last remaining food supplies in the north -- including canned food, wheat flour, high-energy biscuits, and nutrition supplements -- have been distributed to shelters, health facilities and kitchens in Gaza City and three shelters in the northern areas. It is unclear how long these limited food supplies will last, warning that the consequences for fleeing families will be dire if the escalation continues. EU concerns over Israeli legislation that would ban UNRWA JERUSALEM — The European Union said Saturday it was deeply concerned about draft Israeli legislation that would ban the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees from operating in Israel and likely scale back aid distribution across war-ravaged Gaza. Earlier this week, an Israeli parliamentary committee approved a pair of bills this week that would ban UNRWA from operating in Israeli territory and end all contact between the government and the U.N. agency. The bill needs final approval from the Knesset, Israel’s parliament. 'If adopted, (the bill) would have disastrous consequences, preventing the U.N. agency from continuing to provide its services and protection to Palestinian refugees in the occupied West Bank, including east Jerusalem, and Gaza,' the EU said in an online statement. Israel has alleged that some of UNRWA’s thousands of staff members participated in the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack that sparked the Israel-Hamas war. The U.N. has since fired more than a dozen staffers after internal investigations found they may have taken part in the attack that killed 1,200 people in southern Israel. The U.N. agency has been the main supplier of food, water and shelter to Palestinian civilians during the 12 month conflict in Gaza. Concern about the Israeli bill was echoed by UNRWA’s chief, Philippe Lazzarini, on Wednesday, who said all humanitarian operations in Gaza and the West Bank could 'disintegrate' if the bill was implemented. When UNRWA was created by the U.N. General Assembly in 1949, it was meant to provide health care, education and welfare services to about 700,000 Palestinian refugees from the 1948 conflict with Israel. Israeli military renews evacuation orders for northern Gaza CAIRO — The Israeli military on Saturday renewed orders for Palestinian in the northern Gaza Strip to leave their homes and shelters amid a week of intense fighting with militants there. Avichay Adraee, a spokesman for the Israeli military, told people that the area includes parts of Gaza City’s Sheikh Radwan neighborhood and other parts in and around Jabaliya, the urban refugee camp. In a post on X, Adraee asked people living there to head south to Muwasi, a packed area in southern Gaza designed by the military as a humanitarian zone. Most of past week fighting centered in and around Jabaliya with Israeli war jets and artillery pounding the area. People there said they have been trapped inside their homes and shelters. The military also ordered the three main hospitals in northern Gaza to evacuate patients and medical staff.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hezbollah-hamas-latest-mideast-12-october-2024-a6cb533eb39d69bd2bea60c46b7dcb0b	2024-10-12T00:30:22-07:00	
Planned nuclear plant in a Kenyan top tourist hub and home to endangered species sparks protest	KILIFI, Kenya (AP) — Dozens rallied against a proposal to build Kenya's first nuclear power plant in one of the country's top coastal tourist hubs which also houses a forest on the tentative list of the UNESCO World Heritage site. Kilifi County is renowned for its pristine sandy beaches where hotels and beach bars line the 165-mile-long coast and visitors boat and snorkel around coral reefs or bird watch in Arabuko Sokoke forest, a significant natural habitat for the conservation of rare and endangered species, according to the U.N. organization. The project, proposed last year, is set to be built in the town of Kilifi — about 522 kilometers (324 miles) southeast of the capital, Nairobi. Many residents have openly opposed the proposal, worried about what they say are the negative effects of the project on people and the environment, leading to a string of protesters which at times turned violent. Muslim for Human Rights (MUHURI) led the march Friday in Kilifi to the county governor’s office where they handed him a petition opposing the construction of the plant. Some chanted anti-nuclear slogans while others carried placards with 'Sitaki nuclear', Swahili for 'I don’t want nuclear.' The construction of the 1,000MW nuclear plant is set to begin in 2027 and be operational by 2034, with a cost of 500 billion Kenyan shillings ($3.8 billion). Francis Auma, a MUHURI activist, told the Associated Press that the negative effects of the nuclear plant outweigh its benefits. 'We say that this project has a lot of negative effects; there will be malformed children born out of this place, fish will die, and our forest Arabuko Sokoke, known to harbor the birds from abroad, will be lost,' Auma said during Friday’s protests. Juma Sulubu, a resident who was beaten by the police during a previous demonstration, attended Friday's march and said: 'Even if you kill us, just kill us, but we do not want a nuclear power plant in our Uyombo community.' Timothy Nyawa, a fisherman, participated in the rally out of fear that a nuclear power plant would kill fish and in turn his source of income. 'If they set up a nuclear plant here, the fish breeding sites will all be destroyed.' Phyllis Omido, the executive director at the Centre for Justice Governance and Environmental Action, who also attended the march, said Kenya’s eastern coastal towns depended on eco-tourism as the main source of income and a nuclear plant would threaten their livelihoods. 'We host the only East African coastal forest, we host the Watamu marine park, we host the largest mangrove plantation in Kenya. We do not want nuclear (energy) to mess up our ecosystem,' she said. Her center filed a petition in Nov. 2023 in parliament calling for an inquiry and claiming that locals had limited information on the proposed plant and the criteria for selecting preferred sites. It also raised concerns over the risks to health, the environment and tourism in the event of a nuclear spill, saying the country was undertaking a 'high-risk venture' without proper legal and disaster response measures in place. The petition also expressed unease over security and the handling of radioactive waste in a country prone to floods and drought. The Senate suspended the inquiry until a lawsuit two layers filed in July seeking to stop the plant’s construction, claiming public participation meetings were rushed and urging the Nuclear Power and Energy Agency (Nupea) not to start the project, was heard. Nupea said construction would not begin for years and environmental laws were under consideration, adding that adequate public participation was carried out. The nuclear agency also published an impact assessment report last year that recommended policies be put in place to ensure environmental protections, including detailed plans for the handling of radioactive waste, measures to mitigate environmental harm, such as setting up a nuclear unit in the national environment management authority, and emergency response teams. ___ The Associated Press receives financial support for global health and development coverage in Africa from the Gates Foundation.

A fire on board an oil tanker off Germany's Baltic Sea coast has been extinguished	BERLIN (AP) — A fire that broke out on board an oil tanker off Germany's Baltic Sea coast has been extinguished, authorities said Saturday. The blaze didn't spread to the ship's load. The maritime rescue service was alerted to the fire on board the German-flagged Annika on Friday morning, and shortly afterward took all seven crew members off the vessel. Black smoke from the tanker, which was carrying about 640 metric tons of oil, could be seen from the coast. The fire appears to have broken out in the engine room or in a storage room for paint and spread across the stern of the ship. On Friday afternoon, experts determined that the ship's condition was stable and authorities decided to have it towed to the port city of Rostock to continue fighting the blaze. Firefighters inspected the 73-meter (240-foot) -long ship after it arrived in the harbor around 1 a.m. and found that the fire was out, Germany's Central Command for Maritime Emergencies said.	https://apnews.com/article/germany-baltic-sea-oil-tanker-fire-extinguished-1ac4f6f0d711a134ed5193fdcfcf0a91	2024-10-11T23:21:18-07:00	
Bomb survivors use Nobel Peace Prize win to share their anti-nuke message with younger generations	TOKYO (AP) — The recipient of this year's Nobel Peace Prize is a fast-dwindling group of atomic bomb survivors who are facing down the shrinking time they have left to convey the firsthand horror they witnessed 79 years ago. Nihon Hidankyo, the Japanese organization of survivors of the U.S. atomic bombings on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, was awarded for its decadeslong activism against nuclear weapons. The survivors, known as hibakusha, see the prize and the international attention as their last chance to get their message out to younger generations. 'We must seriously think about the succession of our messages. We must thoroughly hand over from our generation to the future generations,' Toshiyuki Mimaki, senior member of the Hiroshima branch of Hidankyo, told reporters Friday night. 'With the honor of the Nobel Peace Prize, we now have a responsibility to get our messages handed down not only in Japan but also across the world.' The honor rewards members' grassroots efforts to keep telling their stories — even though that involved recollecting horrendous ordeals during and after the bombings, and facing discrimination and worries about their health from the lasting radiation impact — for the sole purpose of never again let that happen. Now, with their average age at 85.6, the hibakusha are increasingly frustrated that their fear of a growing nuclear threat and push to eliminate nuclear weapons are not fully understood by younger generations. The number of prefectural hibakusha groups decreased from 47 to 36. And the Japanese government, under the U.S. nuclear umbrella for protection, has refused to sign the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapon. But there is hope, and a youth movement seems to be starting, the Nobel committee noted. Three high school students accompanied Mimaki at the city hall, stood by him as the prize winner was announced, and promised to keep their activism alive. 'I had goose bumps when I heard the announcement,' said a beaming Wakana Tsukuda. 'I have felt discouraged by negative views about nuclear disarmament, but the Nobel Peace Prize made me renew my commitment to work toward abolishing nuclear weapons.' Another high school student, Natsuki Kai, said, 'I will keep up my effort so we can believe that nuclear disarmament is not a dream but a reality.' In Nagasaki, another group of students celebrated Hidankyo's win. Yuka Ohara, 17, thanked the survivors' yearslong effort despite the difficulty. Ohara said she heard her grandparents, who survived the Nagasaki bombing, repeatedly tell her the importance of peace in daily life. 'I want to learn more as I continue my activism.' In April, a group of people set up a network, Japan Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons, connecting younger generations around the country to work with survivors and pursue their effort. Efforts to document the survivors' stories and voices have grown in recent years around Japan, including in Hiroshima, Nagasaki and Tokyo. In some places, young volunteers are working with hibakusha to succeed their personal story telling when they are gone. The first U.S. atomic bombing killed 140,000 people in the city of Hiroshima. A second atomic attack on Nagasaki on Aug. 9, 1945, killed another 70,000. Japan surrendered on Aug. 15, bringing an end to its nearly half-century aggression in Asia. Hidankyo was formed 11 years later in 1956. There was a growing anti-nuclear movement in Japan in response to U.S. hydrogen bomb tests in the Pacific that led to a series of radiation exposures by Japanese boats, adding to demands for government support for health problems. As of March, 106,823 survivors — 6,824 fewer than a year ago, and nearly one-quarter of the total in the 1980s — were certified as eligible for government medical support, according to the Health and Welfare Ministry. Many others, including those who say they were victims of the radioactive 'black rain' that fell outside the initially designated areas of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, are still without support.	https://apnews.com/article/nobel-peace-prize-hibakusha-nihon-hidankyo-survivors-9830508bbfccdd0c9c81dc61bfbe35c0	2024-10-11T21:08:43-07:00	
China's finance minister says there is room for more economic stimulus but offers no plan	BEIJING (AP) — The Chinese government is looking at additional ways to boost the economy, Finance Minister Lan Fo'an said Saturday, but he stopped short of unveiling a major new stimulus plan that analysts and stock investors were hoping for. Lan's remarks left the door open for such a plan in the future but he did not divulge what is under consideration. 'There are other policy tools that are being discussed that are still in the pipeline,' he said at a news conference, adding that there is 'ample room' in the government budget to raise debt and increase the deficit. China's economy has remained sluggish despite the lifting of COVID-19 restrictions at the end of 2022. Companies have cut back on hiring and wages and a prolonged downturn in the property market has deflated consumer confidence, curbing spending. The government has raised pensions and offered subsidies to people who trade in old cars or appliances for new ones, but such steps have failed to jolt economic growth. Chinese stock markets rallied after the central bank and other government agencies announced steps at the end of September to revive the property sector and prop up financial markets. But the rally has since cooled amid concern about whether the moves were enough to generate a sustainable economic recovery. Investors were hoping Lan would announce a stimulus package of up to 2 trillion yuan ($280 million). The finance minister instead said the government would roll out a package of incremental measures to speed up implementation of its existing policies. They include increasing scholarships for students, issuing bonds to help major banks replenish their capital, and providing more support to highly indebted local governments, some of which have had to curtail public services.	https://apnews.com/article/china-finance-minister-economy-stimulus-96aaf75fe6d75c8550f866783f70b10a	2024-10-11T20:15:20-07:00	
As Hezbollah and Israel battle on the border, Lebanon's army watches from the sidelines	BEIRUT (AP) — Since Israel launched its ground invasion of Lebanon, Israeli forces and Hezbollah militants have clashed along the border while the Lebanese army has largely stood on the sidelines. It's not the first time the national army has found itself watching war at home from the discomfiting position of bystander. Lebanon's widely beloved army is one of the few institutions that bridge the country's sectarian and political divides. Several army commanders have become president, and the current commander, Gen. Joseph Aoun, is widely regarded as one of the front-runners to step in when the deadlocked parliament fills a two-year vacuum and names a president. But with an aging arsenal and no air defenses, and battered by five years of economic crisis, the national army is ill-prepared to defend Lebanon against either aerial bombardment or a ground offensive by a well-equipped modern army like Israel’s. The army is militarily overshadowed by Hezbollah. The Lebanese army has about 80,000 troops, with around 5,000 of them deployed in the south. Hezbollah has more than 100,000 fighters, according to the militant group’s late leader, Hassan Nasrallah. Its arsenal — built with support from Iran — is also more advanced. A cautious initial response Israeli forces and Hezbollah fighters have been clashing since Oct. 8, 2023, when the Lebanese militant group began firing rockets over the border in support of its ally Hamas in Gaza. In recent weeks, Israel has conducted a major aerial bombardment of Lebanon and a ground invasion that it says aims to push Hezbollah back from the border and allow displaced residents of northern Israel to return. As Israeli troops made their first forays across the border and Hezbollah responded with rocket fire, Lebanese soldiers withdrew from observation posts along the frontier and repositioned about 5 kilometers (3 miles) back. So far, Israeli forces have not advanced that far. The only direct clashes between the two national armies were on Oct. 3, when Israeli tank fire hit a Lebanese army position in the area of Bint Jbeil, killing a soldier, and on Friday, when two soldiers were killed in an airstrike in the same area. The Lebanese army said it returned fire both times. Lebanon's army declined to comment on how it will react if Israeli ground forces advance farther. Analysts familiar with the army’s workings said that, should the Israeli incursion reach the current army positions, Lebanese troops would put up a fight — but a limited one. The army's 'natural and automatic mission is to defend Lebanon against any army that may enter Lebanese territory,' said former Lebanese Army Gen. Hassan Jouni. 'Of course, if the Israeli enemy enters, it will defend, but within the available capabilities … without going to the point of recklessness or suicide.' Israeli and Lebanese armies are ‘a total overmatch’ The current Israeli invasion of Lebanon is its fourth into the neighboring country in the past 50 years. In most of the previous invasions, the Lebanese army played a similarly peripheral role. The one exception, said Aram Nerguizian, a senior associate with the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies, was in 1972, when Israel attempted to create a 20-kilometer (12-mile) buffer zone to push back Palestinian Liberation Organization fighters. At that time, Nerguizian said, the Lebanese army successfully slowed the pace of the Israeli advance and 'bought time for political leadership in Beirut to seek the intervention of the international community to pressure Israel for a cease-fire.' But the internal situation in Lebanon — and the army's capabilities — deteriorated with the outbreak of a 15-year civil war in 1975, during which both Israeli and Syrian forces occupied parts of the country. Hezbollah was the only faction that was allowed to keep its weapons after the civil war, for the stated goal of resisting Israeli occupation of southern Lebanon — which ended in 2000. By 2006, when Hezbollah and Israel fought a bruising monthlong war, the Lebanese army 'had not been able to invest in any real-world post-war modernization, had no ability to deter Israeli air power' and 'was left completely exposed,' Nerguizian said. 'The few times that the (Lebanese army) and Israeli forces did engage militarily, there was total overmatch.' International aid has been a mixed blessing After the 2011 outbreak of civil war in neighboring Syria and the rise of the Islamic State militant group there, the Lebanese army saw a new influx of military aid. It successfully battled against IS on Lebanon’s border in 2017, although not alone — Hezbollah was simultaneously attacking the group on the other side of the border. When Lebanon’s financial system and currency collapsed in 2019, the army took a hit. It had no budget to buy weapons and maintain its existing supplies, vehicles and aircraft. An average soldier’s salary is now worth around $220 per month, and many resorted to working second jobs. At one point, the United States and Qatar both gave a monthly subsidy for soldiers’ salaries. The U.S. had been a primary funder of the Lebanese army before the crisis. It has given some $3 billion in military aid since 2006, according to the State Department, which said in a statement that it aims 'to enable the Lebanese military to be a stabilizing force against regional threats' and 'strengthen Lebanon’s sovereignty, secure its borders, counter internal threats, and disrupt terrorist facilitation.' President Joe Biden's administration has also touted the Lebanese army as a key part of any diplomatic solution to the current war, with hopes that an increased deployment of its forces would supplant Hezbollah in the border area. But that support has limits. Aid to the Lebanese army has sometimes been politically controversial within the U.S., with some legislators arguing that it could fall into the hands of Hezbollah, although there is no evidence that has happened. In Lebanon, many believe that the U.S. has blocked the army from obtaining more advanced weaponry that might allow it to defend against Israel — America’s strongest ally in the region and the recipient of at least $17.9 billion in U.S. military aid in the year since the war in Gaza began. 'It is my personal opinion that the United States does not allow the (Lebanese) military to have advanced air defense equipment, and this matter is related to Israel,' said Walid Aoun, a retired Lebanese army general and military analyst. Nerguizian said the perception is 'not some conspiracy or half-truth,' noting that the U.S. has enacted a legal requirement to support Israel's qualitative military edge relative to all other militaries in the region. ___ Associated Press writer Matt Lee in Washington contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/lebanese-army-laf-israel-hezbollah-78f6ad2da82d64d1ae266aa5394e6d4e	2024-10-11T19:47:46-07:00	
UK leader Keir Starmer is marking 100 days in office. It has been a rocky ride	LONDON (AP) — British Prime Minister Keir Starmer marks 100 days in office Saturday with little cause for celebration. Starmer’s center-left Labour Party was elected by a landslide on July 4, sweeping back to power after 14 years. But after weeks of stories about feuding, freebies and fiscal gloom, polls suggest Starmer’s personal approval rating has plummeted, and Labour is only slightly more popular than a Conservative Party that was rejected by voters after years of infighting and scandal. 'You couldn’t really have imagined a worse start,' said Tim Bale, professor of politics at Queen Mary University of London. 'First impressions count, and it’s going to be difficult to turn those around.' Starmer won the election on promises to banish years of turmoil and scandal under Conservative governments, get Britain’s sluggish economy growing and restore frayed public services such as the state-funded National Health Service. His government argues it has made a strong start: It has ended long-running strikes by doctors and railway workers, set up a publicly owned green energy firm, scrapped the Conservatives' contentious plan to deport asylum-seekers to Rwanda and introduced bills to strengthen rights for workers and renters. Starmer has traveled to Washington, the United Nations and European capitals as he seeks to show that ' Britain is back ' after years of inward-looking wrangling over Brexit. But the United Kingdom, like its allies, has struggled to have much impact on spiraling conflicts in the Middle East and the grinding war in Ukraine. The new government also has faced crises at home, including days of far-right fueled anti-immigrant violence that erupted in towns and cities across England and Northern Ireland in the summer. Starmer condemned the rioters as 'mindless thugs' and vowed to jail those responsible. So far, more than 800 people have appeared in court and almost 400 have gone to prison. Starmer’s most intractable problem is Britain’s sluggish economy, hobbled by rising public debt and low growth of just 0.2% in August, according to official figures. Starmer has warned that things will be 'tough in the short term' before they get better. He says public spending will be constrained by a 22-billion-pound ($29 billion) 'black hole' in the public finances left by the Conservatives. One of the government’s first acts was to strip millions of retirees of a payment intended to help heat their homes in winter. It was intended to signal determination to take tough economic decisions, but it spawned a sharp backlash from Labour members and sections of the public. It also sat awkwardly with news that Starmer had accepted thousands of pounds' worth of clothes and designer eyeglasses from a wealthy Labour donor. Starmer insisted the gifts were within the rules, but after days of negative headlines agreed to pay back 6,000 pounds' (almost $8,000) worth of gifts and hospitality, including tickets to see Taylor Swift. Government officials and advisers have traded blame for the faltering start, with the focus on Downing Street Chief of Staff Sue Gray, and her reported tensions with Labour campaign strategist Morgan McSweeney. Amid intense media scrutiny — which produced the revelation that Gray earned more than the prime minister — she resigned Sunday, saying stories about her 'risked becoming a distraction.' McSweeney is replacing her as Starmer’s chief of staff. Anand Menon, director of the political think tank U.K. in a Changing Europe, wrote on its website that the government made 'avoidable mistakes' that allowed a 'perception of incompetence and dysfunction' to take hold. The government’s focus is now on Oct. 30, when Treasury chief Rachel Reeves will set out her first budget. She has ruled out increasing income tax, sales tax or corporation tax, but also says there will be no 'return to austerity' — a hard circle to square. She is thought to be considering hiking levies on wealth such as capital gains or inheritance tax. The government is hoping it can take painful decisions early and then turn things around by showing a growing economy and improving living standards. And it has time — there does not have to be another election until 2029. Starmer will be working from 10 Downing St. on his 100th day in office, and aides insist he is not musing on whether his first weeks have been a success. 'It’s for the public to judge that,' spokesperson Camilla Marshall said. 'The government is focused on delivery.' Bale said the government can rebuild trust with voters, if it shows 'not only that it’s had a pretty dire inheritance, but that it has a plan to improve the country.' 'What’s been lacking in some ways is the vision thing,' he said. 'I don’t think people have that much of a sense of what Keir Starmer or indeed Labour is about. And that’s something they need to put right very quickly.'	https://apnews.com/article/uk-labour-starmer-100-days-c0b8a3439fc67d4392ba43d09e9f1fc2	2024-10-11T19:03:08-07:00	
Drought is parching the world's largest man-made lake, stripping Zambia of its electricity	LAKE KARIBA, Zambia (AP) — Tindor Sikunyongana is trying to run a welding business which these days means buying a diesel generator with costly fuel he can't always afford. Like everyone in Zambia, Sikunyongana is facing a daily struggle to find and afford electricity during a climate-induced energy crisis that’s robbed the southern African country of almost all its power. 'Only God knows when this crisis will end,' said Sikunyongana. His generator ran out of diesel and spluttered to a halt as he spoke. 'You see what I mean?' he said. Zambia's worst electricity blackouts in memory have been caused by a severe drought in the region that has left the critical Kariba dam, the source of Sikunyongana's woes, with insufficient water to run its hydroelectric turbines. Kariba is the largest man-made lake in the world by volume and lies 200 kilometers (125 miles) south of Lusaka on the border between Zambia and Zimbabwe. The massive dam wall was built in the 1950s and more than 80 workers died during construction. It was meant to revolutionize the countries' energy supplies by trapping the water of the Zambezi River, turning a valley into a huge lake and providing an endless supply of renewable hydroelectric power. That's not the case anymore as months of drought brought by the naturally occurring El Nino weather pattern and exacerbated by warming temperatures have put Zambia's hydroelectric station on the brink of completely shutting down for the first time. The water level is so low that only one of the six turbines on Zambia's side of the dam is able to operate, cutting generation to less than 10% of normal output. Zambia relies on Kariba for more than 80% of its national electricity supply, and the result is Zambians have barely a few hours of power a day at the best of times. Often, areas are going without electricity for days. Edla Musonda is so exasperated that she’s taken to lugging her entire desktop computer — hard drive, monitor, everything — to a local cafe so she can work. Musonda and others cram into the Mercato Cafe in the Zambian capital of Lusaka, not for the sandwiches or the ambiance but because it has a diesel generator. Tables are cluttered with power strips and cables as people plug in cell phones, laptops and in Musonda’s case, a home office. This is the only way her small travel business is going to survive. Less than half of Zambia's 20 million people had access to electricity before Kariba's problems. Millions more have now been forced to adjust as mothers find different ways to cook for their families and children do their homework by candlelight. The most damaging impact is during the daylight hours when small businesses, the backbone of the country, struggle to operate. 'This is also going to increase poverty levels in the country,' said economist Trevor Hambayi, who fears Zambia's economy will shrink dramatically if the power crisis is prolonged. It's a warning call to the Zambian government and the continent in general about the danger to development of relying heavily on one source of energy that is so climate dependent. The power crisis is a bigger blow to the economy and the battle against poverty than the lockdowns during the COVID-19 pandemic, said Zambia Association of Manufacturers president Ashu Sagar. Africa contributes the least to global warming but is the most vulnerable continent to extreme weather events and climate change as poor countries can't meet the high financials costs of adapting. This year's drought in southern Africa is the worst in decades and has parched crops and left millions hungry, causing Zambia and others to already declare national disasters and ask for aid. Hydroelectric power accounts for 17% of Africa’s energy generation, but that figure is expected to rise to 23% by 2040, according to the International Energy Agency. Zambia is not alone in that hydroelectric power makes up over 80% of the energy mix in Mozambique, Malawi, Uganda, Ethiopia and Congo, even as experts warn it will become more unreliable. 'Extreme weather patterns, including prolonged droughts, make it clear that overreliance on hydro is no longer sustainable,' said Carlos Lopes, a professor at the Mandela School of Public Governance at the University of Cape Town in South Africa. The Zambian government has urged people and businesses to embrace solar power. But many Zambians can't afford the technology, while the government itself has turned to more familiar but polluting diesel generators to temporarily power hospitals and other buildings. It has also said it will increase its electricity from coal-fired stations out of necessity. While neighboring Zimbabwe has also lost much of its electricity generation from Kariba and blackouts there are also frequent, it gets a greater share of its power from coal plants. At Kariba, the 128-meter-high (420-feet) dam wall is almost completely exposed. A dry, reddish-brown stain near the top marks where the water once reached in better times more than a decade ago. Leonard Siamubotu, who has taken tourists on boat cruises on the picturesque lake for more than 20 years, has seen the change. As the water level dropped, it exposed old, dead trees that were completely submerged for years after the wall was built. 'I’m seeing this tree for the first time,' he said of one that's appeared in the middle of the lake. The lake's water level naturally rises and recedes according to the season, but generally it should go up by around six meters after the rains. It moved by less than 30 centimeters after the last rainy season barely materialized, authorities said. They hope this year's rains, which should start in November, will be good. But they estimate that it'll still take three good years for Kariba to fully recover its hydroelectric capability. Experts say there's also no guarantee those rains will come and it's dangerous to rely on a changing climate given Zambia has had drought-induced power problems before, and the trend is they are getting worse. 'That's not a solution ... just to sit and wait for nature,' said Hambayi. ___ Associated Press journalist Taiwo Adebayo in Abuja, Nigeria contributed to this report. ___ For more news on Africa and development: https://apnews.com/hub/africa-pulse ___ The Associated Press receives financial support for global health and development coverage in Africa from the Gates Foundation.

Morocco's King lauds new allies in Western Sahara dispute after European court ruling	RABAT, Morocco (AP) — King Mohammed VI on Friday reaffirmed that settling sovereignty disputes over the Western Sahara remains the driving force behind Morocco's foreign policy, lauding diplomatic triumphs and framing them as progress toward resolving the decades-long conflict in Morocco's favor. In an annual speech to members of parliament, the king noted that the United States, Spain and most recently France had backed Morocco's autonomy plan for the disputed territory. He thanked President Emmanuel Macron for his 'frank support for the ‘Moroccanness’ of the Sahara.' 'So it is that the French Republic supports Morocco’s sovereignty over the entire Sahara territory,' he said. Mohammed VI invited Macron to visit Morocco after France shifted its position in July, a gesture reflecting how relations between Paris and Rabat have warmed. The disputed territory, which Morocco considers to be its 'southern provinces,' is among the most sensitive topics in the North African Kingdom and a common theme in royal speeches. Morocco has pushed countries that partner with it economically and on security and managing migration to back its 2007 autonomy plan, which would grant it sovereignty over the region in question. Doing so, however, risks angering Algeria — a key player in the conflict as well as a security partner and gas supplier to many of the same countries. The Western Sahara is a former colony that has been a lightning rod in regional politics since the 1970s. The United Nations categorizes it as among Africa's last 'non-self-governing territories' and has since 1979 considered a pro-independence movement called the Polisario Front to be a legitimate representative of the Sahrawi people. Most of the territory is controlled by Morocco, while the Polisario operates out of refugee camps in Algeria, which supports it both financially and politically. Efforts to resolve the conflict span back to 1991, when the U.N. brokered a cease-fire and negotiations began over the territory's future. With discussions long stalled, Morocco has sought recognition among its political and economic allies while the Polisario has pursued legal routes, challenging Morocco's claims in international courts. The United States backed Morocco's plan as part of an agreement that saw Morocco normalizing its ties with Israel in 2020. Countries including Saudi Arabia and 18 European Union members have since followed suit, according to Morocco's tally. In July, France amended its longstanding position to begin backing Morocco's plan. Algeria subsequently withdrew its ambassador from France and its president indefinitely postponed a planned visit to Paris. Weeks ago, Europe's Court of Justice issued a ruling in favor of the Polisario, invalidating expired fishing and agricultural agreements between Morocco and the European Union pertaining to exports from the territory because they didn't take the people of the Western Sahara into account. Morocco has also recruited allies in the Middle East and Africa and struck ground on infrastructure projects including a territory-spanning highway and an Atlantic port that it plans to use to grow its influence as an Atlantic and African power. Mohammed VI on Friday said Morocco's African allies consider the territory 'the heart of strategic continental initiatives,' including a planned pipeline extending from Nigeria and an initiative announced last year to give countries in the Sahel additional access to Atlantic trade routes. 'The fundamentals of Morocco’s position need to be explained to the small number of countries that continue to turn the logic of law on its head and deny the facts of history,' he told members of parliament. The opening of parliament is one of the rare instances in which Mohammed VI gives public speeches. During his address, the king was flanked by his brother, Prince Moulay Rachid, and son, Prince Moulay Hassan, who is expected to succeed him. The king spent much of the summer at a palace in the northern city of Tetouan, where he received Morocco’s central bank governor, Olympic Gold-winning runner Soufiane El Bakkali and celebrated the 25th anniversary of his ascension to the throne, according to Morocco's state news agency.	https://apnews.com/article/morocco-king-mohammed-parliament-speech-western-sahara-b05bc2d69cc22a96bc25e5b1e8ede201	2024-10-11T14:41:31-07:00	
Trump's campaign requests military aircraft and armored vehicles in response to threats from Iran	NEW YORK (AP) — Donald Trump 's aides have requested a slew of stepped-up security measures, including military aircraft capable of shooting down surface-to-air missiles to transport the former president in the race’s final stretch, amid growing concerns over threats from Iran in a campaign already shaken by violence. The campaign's highly unusual request comes as the Republican candidate faces death threats from Iran, which has also targeted other former Trump administration officials and has also been blamed for a widespread hack of top campaign officials. Trump narrowly survived one assassination attempt and U.S. Secret Service agents foiled a second, though neither case has been publicly linked to Iranian actors. Beyond a military plane, the campaign has asked for special armored vehicles typically reserved for sitting presidents, expanded temporary flight restrictions over his rallies and his residences, reimbursements for decoy aircraft, and more money for the U.S. Secret Service and local law enforcement agencies that assist in Trump’s protection. Both Trump and his staff have complained that he is being restricted from campaigning the way he wants to because the agency lacks the resources to keep him safe. The Secret Service insisted Friday that Trump is already 'receiving the highest levels of protection.' And President Joe Biden told reporters that he would be happy to approve Trump’s request to use military aircraft in the final stages of the campaign, as long as 'he doesn't ask for F-15s.' 'Look, what I’ve told the department is to give him every single thing he needs for his — as if he were a sitting president,' he said. 'Give him all that he needs. If it fits within that category, that’s fine. But it doesn’t, he shouldn’t.' The new security requests were first reported by the New York Times. The campaign and Secret Service have gone back and forth The Trump campaign’s requests were outlined in a letter to acting Secret Service director Ronald Rowe Jr. from senior Trump campaign adviser Susie Wiles and obtained by The Associated Press. She asked the Secret Service to pre-position the ballistic glass that Trump now uses for protection at his outdoor rallies in the seven battleground states where he is expected to spend the majority of time in the race’s final stretch. Currently, it takes more than a week's notice to position the barriers in the right place, according to a person familiar with the requests who, like others, spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss security matters. Trump aides see that advance notice as unrealistic given the frenetic nature of the final days of a campaign, when schedules are adjusted based on incoming polls and campaign strategy, the person said. In a statement, Secret Service spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi said that since the attempted assassination on July 13 at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, the agency 'has made comprehensive enhancements to its communications capabilities, resourcing and protective operations' and that Trump 'is receiving the highest levels of protection.' He said the Department of Defense regularly provides assistance for Trump's protection, including canine units, and that the Secret Service has been restricting air traffic over the former president’s residence and when he travels. 'Additionally, the former President is receiving the highest level of technical security assets, which include unmanned aerial vehicles, counter unmanned aerial surveillance systems, ballistics and other advanced technology systems,' he said. Former American presidents are able to use military airlift only if requested by the current president. In April, for instance, former President Bill Clinton used one as he led a U.S. delegation to Rwanda. On Sept. 11, 2021, Biden, Clinton, and former President Barack Obama flew to a remembrance in New York. Trump has accused Biden of denying him resources The Trump campaign for weeks now has accused the U.S. Secret Service of forcing it to cancel or scale back events due to a lack of resources. That includes a speech in Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin, held the same week as the U.N. General Assembly in New York, that was scaled back because the Secret Service couldn't secure a larger rally. Trump has accused Biden of intentionally denying security resources to help Vice President Kamala Harris, his Democratic opponent, by preventing him from addressing large crowds. 'They couldn’t give me any help. And I’m so angry about it because what they’re doing is interfering in the election,' he said in a recent Fox News interview. Trump, however, has repeatedly praised his own security detail, commending them for their bravery. While the Secret Service says Trump already has presidential-level protection, there are differences. Both Biden and Harris, for instance, have military assets, including planes. Beyond her Sept. 30 letter, Wiles has also spoken with White House Chief of Staff Jeff Zients and others about her concerns about Trump's security and how his ability to campaign has been curtailed by threats. Zients, according to a person who spoke on condition of anonymity to disclose details of their conversation, connected Wiles to Homeland Security Department and Secret Service leadership after she reached out and made clear that Biden had directed the Secret Service to provide the highest level of protection for Trump. In a separate letter, Rep. Mike Waltz of Florida, who is close to Trump, urged the Secret Service, Department of Homeland Security, White House and Department of Defense to deploy additional military assets to protect Trump in the face of Iranian threats. He requested that Trump be provided with a military passenger aircraft like those used by cabinet secretaries. Trump aides call for action against Iran Trump has been targeted by Iran, which is believed to want retaliation for his administration’s killing of Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani. In August, a Pakistani man alleged to have links to Iran was charged in a plot to carry out political assassinations on U.S. soil. Law enforcement did not name the targets of the alleged plot, but legal filings suggest Trump was a potential target. Iranian hackers have also been charged with stealing information from Trump’s campaign and trying to pass it along to news organizations. In May, prosecutors say, the men charged began trying to penetrate the Trump campaign, successfully breaking into the email accounts of campaign officials and other Trump allies. They then sought to 'weaponize' the stolen campaign material by sending unsolicited emails to people associated with Biden’s campaign. None of the recipients who worked for Biden responded. Trump's campaign has complained that the Biden White House has downplayed the death threats. 'This administration spends more time focused on a hack of emails than they do the Iranians who are trying to kill Donald Trump,' Trump campaign senior adviser Chris LaCivita told reporters in Pennsylvania last weekend. He noted that former President Clinton deployed cruise missiles in retaliation for an Iraqi plot to assassinate former President George H.W. Bush. 'You know he did? He sent a bunch of cruise missiles to send a message,' LaCivita complained. 'All they do is put out a press release.' In a statement, National Security Council spokesman Sean Savett said the Biden administration has been 'closely tracking Iranian threats against former President Trump and former Trump administration officials for years, dating back to the last administration.' 'We consider this a national and homeland security matter of the highest priority, and we strongly condemn Iran for these brazen threats,' Savett added, warning that: 'Should Iran attack any of our citizens, including those who continue to serve the United States or those who formerly served, Iran will face severe consequences.' ___ Associated Press writers Aamer Madhani, Zeke Miller, Rebecca Santana, Lolita C.

Oregon's most populous county adds gas utility to $51B climate suit against fossil fuel companies	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) — Oregon's Multnomah County, home to Portland, has added the state's largest natural gas utility to its $51.5 billion climate lawsuit against fossil fuel companies over their role in the region's deadly 2021 heat- dome event. The lawsuit, filed last year, accuses the companies’ carbon emissions of being a cause of the heat-dome event, which shattered temperature records across the Pacific Northwest. About 800 people died in Oregon, Washington state and British Columbia in the heat wave, which hit in late June and early July 2021. An amended complaint was filed this week, adding NW Natural to a lawsuit that already named oil giants such as ExxonMobil, Chevron and Shell as defendants. It accuses NW Natural, which provides gas to about 2 million people across the Pacific Northwest, of being responsible for 'a substantial portion' of greenhouse gas emissions in Oregon and deceiving the public about the harm of such emissions. NW Natural said it can't comment in detail until it has completed reviewing the claims. 'However, NW Natural believes that these new claims are an attempt to divert attention from legal and factual laws in the case. NW Natural will vigorously contest the County’s claims should they come to court,' it said in an emailed statement. According to the Center for Climate Integrity, it is the first time a gas utility has been named in a lawsuit accusing fossil fuel companies of climate deception. There are currently over two dozen such lawsuits that have been filed by state, local and tribal governments across the U.S., according to the group. The amended complaint also added the Oregon Institute of Science and Medicine, which describes itself as a research group on its website, to the lawsuit. The group has opposed the concept of human-caused global warming. A request for comment sent Friday to the email address on its website was returned to sender. Multnomah County is seeking $51.5 billion in damages, largely for what it estimates to be the cost of responding to the effects of extreme heat, wildfire and drought. 'We’re already paying dearly in Multnomah County for our climate crisis — with our tax dollars, with our health and with our lives,' county chair Jessica Vega Pederson said in a statement. 'Going forward we have to strengthen our safety net just to keep people safe.' After the initial complaint was filed last year, ExxonMobil said the lawsuit didn't address climate change, while a Chevron lawyer said the claims were baseless. When contacted for comment Friday, Shell said it was working to reduce its emissions. 'Addressing climate change requires a collaborative, society-wide approach,' it said in an emailed statement. 'We do not believe the courtroom is the right venue to address climate change, but that smart policy from government and action from all sectors is the appropriate way to reach solutions and drive progress.' The case is pending in Multnomah County Circuit Court.	https://apnews.com/article/oregon-climate-change-lawsuit-gas-utility-fossil-fuels-a4fe9191d693969408471c9c03f0d721	2024-10-11T12:08:47-07:00	
U.S. expands sanctions on Iran in response to its ballistic attack on Israel	WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. on Friday announced new sanctions on Iran's energy sector in response to its Oct. 1 attack on Israel when it fired roughly 180 missiles into the country. Iran said the barrage was retaliation for a series of devastating blows Israel has landed in recent weeks against the Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah in Lebanon, which has been firing rockets into Israel since the war in Gaza began. Included in Friday's sanctions are blocks on Iran's so-called 'ghost fleet' of ships and associated firms that span the United Arab Emirates, Liberia, Hong Kong and other jurisdictions that allegedly obfuscate and transport Iranian oil for sale to buyers in Asia. Additionally, the U.S. State Department designated a network of companies based in Suriname, India, Malaysia and Hong Kong for allegedly arranging for the sale and transport of petroleum and petroleum products from Iran. Current U.S. law authorizes sanctions targeting Iran’s energy sector as well as foreign firms that buy sell and transport Iranian oil. But energy sanctions are often a delicate issue as restricting supplies could push up prices for global commodities that the U.S. and its allies need. Jake Sullivan, the U.S. national security advise, said the new sanctions 'will help further deny Iran financial resources used to support its missile programs and provide support for terrorist groups that threaten the United States, its allies, and partners.' The penalties aim to block them from using the U.S. financial system and bar American citizens from dealing with them. Israel and Iran have fought a shadow war for years, but rarely have they come into direct conflict. Increasingly, however, escalating attacks between Israel and Iran and its Arab allies threaten to push the Middle East closer to a regional war. Iran launched another direct attack on Israel in April, but few of its projectiles reached their targets. Many were shot down by a U.S.-led coalition while others apparently failed at launch or crashed in flight. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said Friday that the United States 'will not hesitate to take further action to hold Iran accountable.'	https://apnews.com/article/treasury-sanctions-iran-gaza-israel-hezbollah-lebanon-5c3d798a1916e4ee197b13d000a776c1	2024-10-11T12:02:24-07:00

Lawsuit in US targets former Salvadoran colonel in 1982 killings of Dutch journalists	CENTREVILLE, Va. (AP) — The brother of a Dutch journalist slain in 1982 covering El Salvador's civil war has filed a lawsuit against a former Salvadoran military officer who has lived for decades in the northern Virginia suburbs and is accused of orchestrating the killing. The lawsuit, filed Thursday in U.S. District Court in Alexandria, seeks unspecified monetary damages against Mario Adalberto Reyes Mena and a declaration that he is responsible for the killings of Jan Kuiper and three other Dutch journalists. Reyes Mena, now 85, was a colonel who commanded El Salvador’s Fourth Infantry Brigade. That unit, and Reyes Mena in particular, were declared responsible for the journalists' deaths by a United Nations Truth Commission that was established in 1992 as part of the peace agreement that ended El Salvador's civil war. An estimated 75,000 civilians were killed during El Salvador’s civil war, mostly by U.S.-backed government security forces. 'The killing of the Dutch Journalists, which the U.N. Truth Commission highlighted as among the most emblematic crimes committed during the civil war, demonstrated the brutality with which the Salvadoran Security Forces sought to stifle national and international independent media in El Salvador,' the lawyers wrote in their complaint. Kuiper and three other Dutch television journalists — Koos Koster, Hans ter Laag and Joop Willemsen — were ambushed as they tried to travel to territory controlled by the leftist guerilla group that was fighting the Salvadoran Security Forces. According to the truth commission, the killings occurred near the El Paraíso military base that was under the command of Reyes Mena, who ordered the ambush. Kuiper's family and others who have sought to bring the journalists' killers to justice have been thwarted for decades. Shortly after the truth commission released its report, the Salvadoran government passed an amnesty law that shielded Reyes Mena and other military officers from prosecution. But El Salvador's Supreme Court struck down the amnesty law as unconstitutional in 2016. In 2022, a judge ordered the arrest of Reyes Mena and others, including former defense minister Gen. José Guillermo García and Col. Francisco Antonio Morán, former director of the now-defunct treasury police, in connection with the journalists' killing. According to the lawsuit, Reyes Mena ended his travel to El Salvador when the arrest warrants were issued. The lawsuit said there's no indication that Reyes Mena will be extradited, even though a notice seeking his arrest has been posted with Interpol. The Salvadoran Embassy referred questions about efforts to extradite Reyes Mena to the country's court system, which said a formal public information request must be submitted. The U.S. State Department referred questions Friday to the Justice Department, which did not respond. At Reyes Mena’s Centreville townhouse, a woman who identified herself as his wife declined to comment Thursday and said she would relay a reporter’s request for comment to their lawyer, whom she did not identify. The Center for Justice and Accountability, a nonprofit legal group that filed the lawsuit on behalf of Kuiper's brother, Gert Kuiper, has brought multiple cases over the years against individuals accused of overseas war crimes under U.S. laws like the Torture Victim Protection Act. In 2019, a jury at the Alexandria courthouse found a northern Virginia man who once served as a colonel in the Somali Army during the regime of dictator Siad Barre responsible for torturing a Somali man in the 1980s. The jury awarded $500,000 in damages. It also won a $21 million default judgement against a former Somali defense minister and prime minister, Mohamed Ali Samantar. Other efforts to hold foreign officials accountable have failed. Earlier this year, a judge in Alexandria tossed out a series of civil lawsuits against a Libyan military commander, Khalifa Hifter, who used to live in Virginia and was accused of killing innocent civilians in that country’s civil war. The Hifter lawsuits were not brought by the Center for Justice and Accountability.	https://apnews.com/article/salvador-dutch-journalist-lawsuit-kuiper-reyes-717fac8d4abb9a6955fa773f9742a9c8	2024-10-11T08:56:00-07:00	
UN peacekeepers in southern Lebanon in crosshairs of Israel’s war on Hezbollah	BEIRUT (AP) — Israeli airstrikes hit the headquarters of the U.N. peacekeeping force and other positions in southern Lebanon in recent days, drawing widespread condemnation from around the world. The force, known as UNIFIL, said new explosions hit its headquarters on Friday morning, injuring two peacekeepers, a day after Israeli forces struck the same position, injuring two others. As Israel escalates its campaign against Hezbollah in the south, the 10,000-strong peacekeeping force is increasingly in the crosshairs, highlighting the fragility of its personnel amid an expanding ground invasion by Israel. The attacks are taking place in the backdrop of worsening relations between Israel and the United Nations over the way Israel has conducted its war in Gaza. In an unprecedented move, Israel earlier this month said the U.N. chief was persona non grata in Israel, signaling a new low in relations. Here’s a look at the U.N. peacekeeping force in Lebanon and the latest developments: What is UNIFIL? The United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon was created in 1978 to oversee the withdrawal of Israeli troops after Israel invaded and occupied south Lebanon. Israel invaded again in 1982, and it was not until 2000 that it withdrew from the country. In the absence of an agreed-upon border, the U.N. drew up a boundary between Lebanon and Israel known as the Blue Line, which UNIFIL monitors and patrols. The United Nations expanded UNIFIL’s original mission following the monthlong 2006 war between Israel and Hezbollah, allowing peacekeepers to deploy along the Israeli border to monitor the cessation of hostilities between the two sides and patrol a buffer zone set up along the border. The force currently has some 10,000 peacekeepers stationed in southern Lebanon drawn from around 50 countries. The troops patrol, monitor and report violations of U.N. Security Council Resolution 1701 which ended the 2006 fighting. The force also provides support to local communities. What happened in the last two days? On Thursday, UNIFIL said an Israeli tank 'directly' fired on its headquarters in the town of Naqoura, knocking down an observation tower and injuring two Indonesian peacekeepers, who were hospitalized. It said its headquarters and nearby positions 'have been repeatedly hit' and that Israel 'deliberately' fired on and disabled the headquarters’ monitoring cameras. It also said the Israeli army fired on a nearby bunker where peacekeepers were sheltering. On Friday, UNIFIL said new explosions hit its headquarters, injuring two more peacekeepers, although it did not directly blame Israel. It also said an Israeli army bulldozer hit the perimeter of another of its positions in southern Lebanon while Israeli tanks moved nearby. The attacks drew global condemnation. Italy, which has about 1,000 soldiers deployed in southern Lebanon, and France summoned the Israeli ambassadors in protest. Italy's defense minister said the attacks were possible 'war crimes.' Human Rights Watch, in a statement, used similar language. Tensions between the two sides had been mounting for days. Earlier this month, Israel asked UNIFIL to move its personnel further north, which the peacekeeping force refused to do. 'We won’t accept the justification that Israeli military forces had previously alerted UNIFIL that some of its bases had to be abandoned,' Defense Minister Guido Crosetto said Thursday at a press conference in Rome, calling the attacks 'not an accident nor a mistake.' What has Israel said? The Israeli army has expressed deep concern over Thursday's incident and says it is conducting a thorough review at the highest levels of command to determine the details. On Friday, it said its soldiers were responding with fire to an immediate threat against them, adding that the army had instructed UNIFIL personnel to enter into protected spaces and remain there, hours before the incident. It also accused Hezbollah of deliberately operating near U.N. posts, thereby endangering their personnel. There have been several incidents during the current war where UNIFIL said that Israel had shot at patrol vehicles or shelled their positions. The United Nations peacekeeping force has had a troubled history with Israel. In 1996, during a 17-day Israeli offensive against Hezbollah, Israel shelled a United Nations compound near the village of Qana where hundreds of displaced civilians were sheltering. The attack killed 106 civilians, including at least 37 children. Four Fijian soldiers assigned to UNIFIL were seriously injured. How does this affect the mission? The Israeli military is asking that the peacekeeping force move 5 kilometers (3 miles) north to avoid being caught in the fighting between its troops and Hezbollah militants. That effectively would impede the peacekeeping force from doing its mission. The U.N. peacekeeping chief, Jean-Pierre Lacroix, told an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council Thursday that UNIFIL would not evacuate its personnel, but because of air and ground attacks they cannot conduct patrols. He said UNIFIL operations have virtually come to a halt since late September, when Israel expanded its campaign against Hezbollah in the south. 'Peacekeepers have been confined to their bases with significant periods of time in shelter,' he said, adding that the security environment has also presented challenges for the resupply of fuel, food and water for U.N. positions. Later Thursday, Lacroix said 300 peacekeepers in frontline positions had been temporarily moved to larger bases, and that plans to move another 200 will depend on security conditions as the conflict escalates. He said UNIFIL had decided to reduce its footprint 'at the most affected U.N. positions by 25%.' On Oct. 3, he told reporters that in some places in southern Lebanon, the number of peacekeepers had been reduced by about 20%. Nick Birnback, U.N. peacekeeping’s chief of strategic communications, said: 'UNIFIL has remained in its positions along the Blue Line without interruption since its establishment.' The Italian minister also reiterated that a final decision on whether to stop the UNIFIL mission in southern Lebanon for security reasons is up to the U.N.	https://apnews.com/article/unifil-peacekeeping-lebanon-israel-peacekeeping-b03091462dbb2e025a6fcad1acdba08f	2024-10-11T08:48:55-07:00	
Activists risk their lives to rescue animals in areas of Lebanon hit by Israeli airstrikes	BEIRUT (AP) — Hours after an Israeli strike destroyed a three-story building in Beirut, killing at least 10 people, Maggie Sharawi received a telephone call from a person living nearby saying that the attack had killed a cat that had several kittens. While civil defense members were combing through the rubble for human victims or survivors, Sharawi and other members of Animals Lebanon, an animal protection organization, also rushed to the scene in Beirut’s central Burj Abi Haidar neighborhood Friday. They began climbing through rubble, twisted metal and collapsed walls to reach the kittens. The animals, just a few days old, were pulled out, put in a plastic carrier and taken away as the rescuers continued searching for other cats whose cries could be heard emerging from under the debris. Sharawi said that over the past three weeks they have managed to rescue 190 animals from strike sites in Beirut and its southern suburbs. In some cases, she added, they give the animals back to their owners while others remain at the group’s shelter in the Lebanese capital. 'We believe that caring for animals is caring for humans. In the end it is the people who are calling us for help,' Sharawi said. Since Lebanon’s Hezbollah started attacking Israeli military posts along the border in October last year and Israel responded with airstrikes and shelling in much of southern Lebanon, animal rights activists have been going to the south to help rescue pets. After Israel intensified its attacks on parts of Lebanon on Sept. 23, leading to the displacement of hundreds of thousands, many people left their pets behind in south Lebanon or in Beirut’s southern suburbs. Since then, animal rights activists have increased their missions, putting their own lives in danger in order to rescue the animals, mainly cats and dogs, or to bring them to where their owners have fled. 'Our teams are working 24 hours a day,' said Sharawi, adding that they go into homes in the southern suburbs to bring animals to safety. After the kittens were rescued, two adult cats remained but they were too scared for the activists to approach them. Animals Lebanon members later brought metal traps and baited them with food, hoping that the cats would walk in and be captured. Sharawi said if cats or dogs are injured, they usually rush them straight to a clinic for treatment and those who are in good condition are either sent back to their owners or left at their shelters. Many of the animals they rescue have suffered injuries, including broken bones as a result of walls falling on them. 'We are dealing with cases that we have never seen before,' Sharawi said.	https://apnews.com/article/lebanon-animals-war-israel-hezbollah-airstrikes-rescue-1549ca8f08e7d97b7a5cb27f43b12398	2024-10-11T08:47:31-07:00	
Stellantis CEO under fire from Italian lawmakers as the group grapples with financial troubles	ROME (AP) — Italian lawmakers on Friday questioned the head of Stellantis, the world's fourth largest automaker, over the group’s strategy, one day after it announced a management shakeup in an effort to revive sales. Stellantis, which makes Jeep and Chrysler vehicles, is struggling globally, with the Italian government demanding clarity about its production plans for the country. It also faces a national metal workers strike called by Italy’s main unions for Oct. 18, with a massive demonstration expected in Rome. The group has been under fire following a concerning profit warning in which the company said it expected to finish the year with a negative cash flow of up to 10 billion euros ($11.2 billion). Speaking in front of a parliamentary committee on Friday, Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares stressed that European Union carbon emission rules impose 40% higher costs on the struggling car-making industry. He added that European customers are reluctant to buy expensive electric vehicles, while Chinese competitors can leverage on additional cost advantages. Tavares, whose leadership has recently come under scrutiny, said the sector is under pressure due to a constant change in technologies. 'This can generate anxiety, especially when fast and profound … But we at Stellantis have a very clear roadmap for carrying forward this change,' he said. Tavares has also been under fire from U.S. dealers and the United Auto Workers union after a dismal financial performance this year, caught off guard by too many high-priced vehicles on dealer lots. He has been trying to cut costs by delaying factory openings, laying off union workers and offering buyouts to salaried employees. Italian lawmakers pointed to a significant cutback in car manufacturing in Italy, which threatens the country’s once prosperous automotive industry. Stellantis, which was created in 2021 from the merger of Fiat-Chrysler with PSA Peugeot, registered a sharp drop in output at most of its Italian plants in the first half of 2024. Over the past 17 years, the carmaker has slashed its Italian production by nearly 70%. Tavares was invited by lawmakers to explain how he intends to reverse the decline of Italy's car industry. 'The cost of energy here is very high,' he said. 'It is double that of Spain, and this is a significant disadvantage,' he noted, calling for political leaders to provide responses on how to manage the cost increase. Calling for additional state incentives for the struggling electric cars sector, Tavares said: 'We are not asking for money for ourselves, we are asking you to help your citizens, so that they can buy vehicles they can afford.' However, several parliamentarians — mainly from the center-left opposition — blasted Tavares’ hearing as 'disappointing.' Giuseppe Conte, leader of the 5-Star party, noted that Stellantis’ CEO 'didn’t say anything about the future of our factories, nothing specific regarding investments in research, technology and development.' Meanwhile, Democratic Party leader Elly Schlein said that her party will support the autoworkers’ strike. 'We ask that Stellantis discuss with the trade unions and the workers. It cannot be them who bear the costs of what is happening,' she said. In the latest management shakeup announced Thursday, Stellantis' chief financial officer Natalie Knight will be replaced by Doug Ostermann, the company’s chief operating officer in China. Stellantis also appointed new chief operating officers in North America and in Europe. The group in September announced that it was looking for a successor for Tavares, 66, as part of a planned leadership change. Tavares’ five-year contract was a little over a year from its expiration date in 2026, but the company hinted at the time it was possible he might remain in the job beyond that.	https://apnews.com/article/italy-stellantis-ceo-parliament-hearing-lawmakers-financial-troubles-75a2f2979bb349a9d7bd94a0686d5c3f	2024-10-11T08:06:19-07:00	
Treasury official says withdrawing the US from the IMF and World Bank would be a 'step backward'	WASHINGTON (AP) — Withdrawing the United States from the IMF and World Bank would be 'a step backward,' a top U.S. Treasury official said Friday, defending the organizations before a presidential election that could cast uncertainty about America's future in them. In advance of the institutions' annual meetings this month, Jay Shambaugh, the undersecretary for international affairs, alluded to a Project 2025 proposal for the U.S. to pull out of the IMF and World Bank if Donald Trump wins. The proposal is part of a plan created by the Heritage Foundation as a possible handbook for the next Republican administration, though Trump has said it is not related to his campaign and he is not bound to its ideas. 'There are those who have suggested the U.S. withdraw from these institutions; this would be a step backward for our economic security,' Shambaugh said in a speech at the Atlantic Council. Without U.S. leadership, 'we would have less influence and we would weaken these institutions. We cannot afford that.' Often lenders of last resort, the International Monetary Fund and World Bank use billions in loans and assistance to buoy struggling economies and encourage countries operating in deficit to implement reforms they say promote stability and growth. Asked more directly about the Project 2025 plan in a question and answer session, Shambaugh was measured in his response, noting that the Hatch Act restricts partisan political activity by federal employees. But he said that over many decades there have been proposals to withdraw from the institutions by people who say the U.S. would be better off without them. 'I would just say I think the evidence suggests that’s entirely inaccurate,' he said. Within the more than 1,000-page Project 2025, the authors propose that the Treasury Department 'withdraw from both the World Bank and the IMF and terminate its financial contribution to both institutions,' because they 'simply create expensive middle-men, while U.S. funds are intercepted before being distributed to those in need.' Vice President Kamala Harris and Democratic allies have turned Project 2025 into one of their most consistent tools against Trump. He has denied knowing about Heritage's conservative roadmap, even though dozens of his allies and former aides helped to draft the presidential transition plan. Danielle Alvarez, a Trump campaign senior adviser, said 'only President Trump and the campaign, and NOT any other organization or former staff, represent policies for the second term.' She said the 20 promises listed on his campaign website 'are the only policies endorsed by President Trump for a second term,.'

New arrests revive concern that nonviolent political protesters in Myanmar may be tortured	BANGKOK (AP) — Concern was rising on Friday that two nonviolent activists opposed to military rule in Myanmar are at high risk of torture after being arrested in raids this week in Yangon, the country’s biggest city. Paing Phyo Min, 27, a leading member of AJAY — the Anti-Junta Alliance Yangon — and Shein Wai Aung, a participant in peaceful protests, were arrested separately on Wednesday night, one of AJAY’s leaders, Nan Lin, told The Associated Press. He said that four other young activists were arrested just hours after participating in a brief Sept. 19 protest in Yangon against high commodity prices and military conscription. The arrests are a reminder that even as the military engages in armed combat against pro-democracy guerrillas and ethnic rebels in the countryside and remote areas, they also seek to bottle up political opposition in major urban areas. AJAY’s Nan Lin said he was worried that the arrested protesters are at high risk of torture by interrogators. He said Paing Phyo Min and Shein Wai Aung were sent to an interrogation center, and there has been no contact with any of the detainees. Rights groups and media, including The Associated Press, have reported extensively on the use of torture on detainees. On its Facebook page, AJAY on Thursday called on the international community and Myanmar's strike committees to exert pressure on the military government to safeguard the detained protesters, expressing particular concern for Paing Phyo Min. Paing Phyo Min is known for his involvement with a group of young people performing Thangyat, a traditional Burmese art form in which the participants present satirical poetry and songs. He was arrested in 2019 along with three others after taking part in Thangyat performances dressed as soldiers. He was sentenced to six years in prison for sedition, but released in April 2021 under a mass amnesty. Nonviolent demonstrations were the main form of protest immediately after the army seized power from the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi in February 2021. After the security forces suppressed them with lethal force, many opponents of the military launched armed resistance, and much of the country is now embroiled in fighting. 'Protesting in Myanmar today is not the same as it was before the coup. Anyone involved in any kind of dissent against the military faces long jail terms, torture and other ill-treatment, and even death in custody,' said Joe Freeman, the Myanmar researcher for the human rights group Amnesty International. 'In Myanmar’s prison system, there is little hope of fair treatment, no transparency, and extremely substandard conditions. Interrogation centers, where these two activists have likely been sent, are also notorious locations of abuse where torture has been used to extract information before charges are formally brought.' According to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, which tabulates arrests and deaths, at least 5,800 people have been killed and 27,529 people have been arrested by the security forces since the army takeover. After the crackdowns on street demonstrations in 2021, protests have become fewer in number and usually take the form of flash mobs. Protesters quickly gather, carrying flags, banners or torches, and chant for the overthrow of the military government and the release of civilian leaders currently in detention. They disperse after a few minutes, minimizing the possibility of confrontation with police or soldiers. According to Nan Lin and statements from activist groups in Yangon, the four activists arrested on Sept. 19 were Zaw Lin Htut, also known as Poe Thar, a University Students’ Union Alumni Force co-founder and freelance photojournalist; Aung Min Khaing and Mya Myintzu, members of the Youth Strike Committee; and Hnin Ei Khaing, a former political prisoner. Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, the head of Myanmar’s military-government, at a Tuesday meeting on security and development , told army officers and administrative officials that they must collaborate in maintaining security and peace in greater Yangon, and constantly watch to prevent armed-opponents from infiltrating into the wards and villages, state media reported.	https://apnews.com/article/myanmar-protests-yangon-politics-arrest-torture-09c96b7e94c001c5a86384136838e3ec	2024-10-11T06:45:56-07:00	
Nobel prize for A-bomb survivors' group boosts hope for Japanese seeking a nuke-free world	TOKYO (AP) — For many Japanese survivors of the U.S. atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and their relatives, Friday’s awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize to a Japanese organization against nuclear weapons gives them hope for a new momentum to push for a nuclear-free world — starting from getting their own government to sign the nuclear weapons ban treaty. Nihon Hidankyo, an organization of survivors of the two U.S. atomic bombings, became the first Japanese recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize in 50 years since the late Prime Minister Eisaku Sato was honored in 1974 for his contribution to regional stability and Japan's signing of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Toshiyuki Mimaki, the organization’s Hiroshima branch executive, was standing by at the city hall for the announcement. He cheered and teared up when he received the news. 'Is it really true? Unbelievable!' Mimaki screamed, pinching his cheek with his fingers to make sure he was not dreaming. 'I believe the Nobel Peace Prize will give us more power to promote our cause toward achieving a world without nuclear weapons,' said Mimaki, who was exposed to atomic bombing at age 3 in Hiroshima, his father’s hometown, where he evacuated after surviving the U.S. air raid in Tokyo on March 10, 1945. The group’s honor comes seven years after the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons won the peace prize in 2017 for their contribution to the adoption of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons. Hidankyo members have helped collect more than 3 million signatures in favor of the treaty, and demanded the reluctant Japanese government sign it and do more to lead the nuclear disarmament as the world’s only country to have suffered atomic attacks. Former Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has been criticized by survivors for refusing to sign the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapon. He has argued that the pact is unworkable because no nuclear-armed state has signed. Japanese leaders have repeatedly promised to serve as a middle ground between nuclear and non-nuclear states and stressed the need for dialogue toward nuclear disarmament, but refused to join the treaty even as an observer. Atomic bombing survivors, or hibakusha, say Japanese leaders are only making hollow promises because Japan relies on the U.S. nuclear umbrella for protection and has been rapidly expanding its military. 'As hibakusha, it is extremely sad to see the Japanese government has not signed or ratified the nuclear weapons ban treaty,' said Terumi Tanaka, 91, a Hidankyo executive who survived the Nagasaki bombing at age 13. 'I hope the Nobel Peace Prize opens up a chance to get the Japanese government to take the step.' Tanaka said the prize is timely in a world increasingly facing the threat of nuclear weapons. 'Sadly, I think many people around the world still don’t understand how inhumane nuclear weapons are,' he said, adding that it is 'a good chance for them to think about what we’ve kept saying all along.' Japan, the United States and other regional partners have been stepping up security cooperation in response to a more assertive China and the growing nuclear and missile threats from North Korea and Russia. Japan has sought stronger U.S. protection by its nuclear capability. Japan’s new Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, a security expert who took office this month, is an advocate of a NATO-style collective defense framework in Asia. 'It is extremely meaningful,' Ishiba said of the Hidankyo’s honor at a news conference from Vientiane where he attended the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. In Tokyo, many expressed surprise and joy as workers distributed a special newspaper edition on Hidankyo’s winning of the peace prize. 'I would be happy if this award can be an opportunity to make the people around the world think,' said Sayaka Nakanishi, a high school teacher. Hiroshima Gov. Hidehiko Yuzaki, an advocate of nuclear disarmament, said Hidankyo’s win meant 'the Nobel Foundation was warning against an international trend toward stronger nuclear armament.' 'We should really take the meaning of the award seriously and think about what they mean when hibakusha say they don’t want anyone else to suffer the same ordeal,' he said. Many survivors of the bombings have suffered lasting injuries and illnesses resulting from the explosions and radiation exposure and have faced discrimination in Japan. Aging survivors are also worried about how to keep their stories alive for younger generations. Nagasaki Mayor Shiro Suzuki, whose parents were hibakusha, expressed hope that the international recognition for Hidankyo will help inspire younger generations around the world. The atomic bomb dropped by the United States on Hiroshima on Aug. 6, 1945, killed 140,000 people, and a second bomb dropped on Nagasaki three days later killed another 70,000. Japan surrendered on Aug. 15, 1945, ending World War II and its nearly half-century of aggression across Asia. Hidankyo was formed 11 years later in 1956, amid a growing anti-nuclear movement in Japan in response to U.S. hydrogen bomb tests in the Pacific that led to a series of radiation exposures by Japanese boats and added to demands for government support for health problems. As of March, 106,823 survivors — 6,824 fewer than a year ago, and now with an average age of 85.6 — are certified as eligible for government medical support, according to the Health and Welfare Ministry. Many others, including those who say they were victims of the radioactive 'black rain' that fell outside the initially designated areas of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, are still without support. —- This version corrects the name of the Hiroshima branch executive to Toshiyuki Mimaki, not Tomoyuki Mimaki. ___ Associated Press video journalist Ayaka McGill contributed.	https://apnews.com/article/japan-nobel-peace-hibakusha-atomic-bomb-808038ef664be2f200306d5e60b76711	2024-10-11T06:15:16-07:00	
Trump heads to Colorado to drive his anti-immigration message	AURORA, Colo. (AP) — Donald Trump is detouring from the battleground states Friday to visit a Colorado suburb that's been in the news over illegal immigration as he drives a message that migrants are causing chaos in smaller American cities and towns, often using false or misleading claims to do so. Trump’s rally in Aurora will mark the first time ahead of the November election that either presidential campaign has visited Colorado, which reliably votes Democratic statewide. The Republican nominee has long promised to stage the largest deportation operation in U.S. history and has made immigration core to his political persona since the day he launched his first campaign in 2015. Over the last few months, Trump has pinpointed specific smaller communities that have seen large arrivals of migrants, with tensions flaring locally over resources and some longtime residents expressing distrust about sudden demographic changes. Aurora entered the spotlight in August when a video circulated showing armed men walking through an apartment building housing Venezuelan migrants. Trump has claimed extensively that Venezuelan gangs are taking over buildings, even though authorities say that was a single block of the suburb near Denver, and the area is again safe. At the venue where he was appearing on Friday, chants of 'Trump!' and guttural cries of excitement began before the sun rose and continued throughout the morning. Attendees trickled into the vast conference hall, curated specially for Trump’s visit to Aurora: On stage, posters displayed mug shots of people in prison-orange with descriptions including 'Illegal immigrant gang members from Venezuela.' Trump and his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, also have spread falsehoods about a community in Springfield, Ohio, where Haitian immigrants were accused of stealing and eating pets. 'It’s like an invasion from within, and we’re going to have the largest deportation in the history of our country, and we’re going to start with Springfield and Aurora,' Trump said last month in a news conference in California. While Ohio and Colorado are not competitive in the presidential race, the Republican message on immigration is intended for states that are. Vance campaigned recently in Eau Claire, Wisconsin, a city of 70,000 that has resettled refugees from Africa and Asia, and touted Trump's plan to ramp up deportations. He argues smaller communities have been 'overrun' by immigrants taxing local resources. Some of Colorado's Democratic leaders accused Trump and other Republicans of overstating problems in Aurora. 'What is occurring is minimal and isolated. And to be clear, it’s never acceptable, right? We never say any level is acceptable,' said Rep. Jason Crow, D-Colo. 'But it’s not a surge. It’s not a change. There is no takeover of any part of this city, of any apartment complex. It has not happened. It is a lie.' Trump has vowed to deport not only 'criminals,' a promise he shares with Vice President Kamala Harris, his Democratic rival, but also Haitians living legally in Springfield and even people he has denigrated as 'pro-Hamas radicals' protesting on college campuses. Trump has said he would revoke the temporary protected status that allows Haitians to stay in the U.S. because of widespread poverty and violence in their home nation. Trump repeatedly faults Harris and President Joe Biden for allowing record high numbers of arrivals, saying that is fueling violent crime, though numbers show a continued downward trend after a coronavirus pandemic-era crime spike. On the campaign trail, Trump uses specific cases of murders or attacks where suspects are immigrants who arrived in the country illegally. He has referred to them as 'animals,' and earlier this week suggested that those suspected in homicide cases 'have bad genes.' Chris Haynes, an associate professor of political science at University of New Haven, who wrote a book about public opinion on immigration policies and has studied the former president’s messaging on immigration, says that is part of what he calls 'episodic branding.' It may prompt some moderate voters to reassess who they want to support, he said. 'What’s worked for him from the very beginning is to vilify immigrants, but also to try to make people feel like they’re a threat,' said Haynes, saying some of the rhetoric also appeals to low propensity voters that are part of his base. Harris, for her part, was wrapping up a three-day western swing with a campaign event Friday in Scottsdale, Arizona. She also was participating virtually in a White House briefing with President Biden on the recovery effort from hurricanes Milton and Helene. Just as Biden did before he abandoned his reelection bid, Democrat Harris has tacked to the right on immigration, presenting herself as a candidate who can be tough on policing the border, which is perceived as one of her biggest vulnerabilities. 'What Kamala has done with illegal migrants is the biggest crime story of our time because hundreds of thousands of people are going to be victims very shortly,' Trump said in a recent speech in Erie, Pennsylvania, before saying he would send federal law enforcement 'to liberate every Pennsylvania town and every town in the United States of America that has been taken over by migrant gangs.' Jeffrey Balogh, a resident of Erie, said at that event that he feels strongly about Trump’s proposals on immigration. He shared that he felt uncomfortable recently when he went to rent chairs from a business and five men who spoke a foreign language were standing outside waiting for a bus. 'Not one spoke a lick of English,' he said. 'You see a whole different environment.' ___ Gomez reported from Fort Lauderdale, Florida.	https://apnews.com/article/trump-migrants-deportation-colorado-fe8805ec9024cb683a6386bce9f64c70	2024-10-11T05:48:51-07:00	
The Latest: Hurricanes have jumbled campaign schedules for Harris and Trump	Back-to-back hurricanes have jumbled the presidential campaign schedules of Democrat Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump. Trump and Harris have separately gone to Georgia to assess hurricane damage and pledge support. Harris also has visited North Carolina, requiring the candidates to cancel campaign events elsewhere and use up time which is a precious resource in the final weeks before any election. Both Georgia and North Carolina are political battlegrounds. Meanwhile, a recent poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found that a solid majority of Hispanic women have a positive opinion of Harris and a negative view of Trump. Hispanic men are more divided on both candidates. Follow the AP’s Election 2024 coverage at: https://apnews.com/hub/election-2024. Here’s the latest: Harris-Walz campaign makes pitch to gun owners Kamala Harris and Tim Walz are taking another shot at making their case to gun owners. Their campaign announced Friday they are launching their newest coalition: Hunters and Anglers for Harris-Walz. Harris has advocated for stricter gun safety laws, while also underscoring that she and Walz are gun owners. She told Oprah Winfrey at a campaign event last month that she had a gun and that 'if somebody breaks into my house, they’re getting shot.' The vice president revealed earlier this week in a CBS '60 Minutes' interview that her weapon is a Glock pistol and confirmed that she has fired it at a shooting range. The hunters and anglers group is set to hold a call next week aimed at mobilizing like-minded peers to get behind Harris and Walz. The campaign announced the new group as Walz on Saturday will join fellow hunters in Minnesota to mark the start of pheasant season Trump brings anti-immigration message to Colorado Donald Trump is in a Colorado suburb, aiming to tie the arrivals of migrants to a perception of chaos in smaller communities. He is doubling down on his pledge to carry out the largest deportation operation in U.S. history. Trump’s rally on Friday in Aurora, Colorado, marks the first time either presidential campaign has visited this state that votes reliably Democratic in statewide races. Trump has been consistently loud in his statements on immigration. Over the last few months, he has pinpointed specific smaller communities that have seen large arrivals of migrants, where tensions are flaring over resources. Harris says she would create a bipartisan council of advisers Vice President Kamala Harris said she will create a bipartisan council of advisers to provide her feedback on her policy initiatives if she makes it to the White House. Harris announced the initiative while attending an event in Phoenix with Republicans supporting her campaign. She said it’s critical that there is structure in her administration so she could hear from a spectrum of voices. 'I love good ideas wherever they come from,' said Harris, who is making a push to get Republicans with doubts about Trump to support her. Harris says she would be a greater champion for Israel's security than Trump Vice President Kamala Harris laced into former President Donald Trump on Friday for letting Iran 'off the hook' while he was in office and argued that she would be a greater champion for Israel’s security than the Republican nominee. 'Make no mistake, as president, I will never hesitate to take whatever action is necessary to defend American forces and interests from Iran and Iran-backed terrorists,' Harris said in a call with Jewish supporters ahead of Yom Kippur. 'And I will never allow Iran to acquire a nuclear weapon. Diplomacy is my preferred path to that end. But all options are on the table.' Harris charged that Trump 'did nothing' after Iranian-backed militias attacked U.S. bases and American troops. But during his time in office, Trump had ordered strikes against Iranian-backed militias as well as a January 2020 operation that killed Qassem Soleimani, the head of Iran’s elite Quds Force, and Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, the deputy commander of the Iran-backed group in Iraq known as the Popular Mobilization Forces, or PMF. Trump said he ordered the killing of Soleimani because Soleimani was developing plans to attack American diplomats and service members. Biden derides Trump for disinformation about hurricane response President Joe Biden said ahead of a Friday briefing about hurricane damage that estimates are the Hurricane Milton alone caused $50 billion of damage, while adding that his predecessor, Donald Trump, is 'just the biggest mouth' for disinformation about the government’s response. The president added that the disinformation is a 'permanent state of being for some extreme people,' but that he believes the country as a whole wants facts and bipartisan cooperation to address natural disasters. 'I think those who have been spreading these lies to try to undermine the opposition are going, gonna pay a price for it,' Biden added. Trump will try to expand his appeal with women in Fox News town hall Donald Trump has been running a decidedly 'bro-y' campaign. But he will try to expand his appeal with women as he participates in a Fox News town hall focusing on issues impacting women Fox News Channel announced that host Harris Faulkner will moderate the discussion in front of an audience of women. 'Women constitute the largest group of registered and active voters in the United States, so it is paramount that female voters understand where the presidential candidates stand on the issues that matter to them most,' Faulkner said said in a statement. Trump’s campaign has aggressively courted men — especially younger men of color — with appearances on podcasts and sporting events popular with the demographic. Polls have repeatedly shown he is seen more favorably by men than by women. The Trump sit-down will be taped Tuesday and air the next day, Oct. 16th. Fox says it has extended a standing invitation to Vice President Kamala Harris to participate in a town hall as well. 3 Wisconsin conservatives declare support for Harris A trio of Wisconsin conservatives declared Friday that they support Democrat Kamala Harris rather than Donald Trump in the Nov. 5 election. Charlie Sykes, a former conservative radio talk show host from Milwaukee; former Republican state Senate Majority Leader Dale Schultz; and former Republican state representative and appellate judge David Deininger told reporters that Trump lacks the character and moral fiber to serve as president. Sykes said the election is a referendum on constitutional values that the country had always taken for granted before Trump’s political ascendance. 'Republicans have decided winning or staying in power is more important than standing up for these values, which used to be fundamental,' Sykes said. 'I’m going to be voting for Kamala Harris for president and it’s not a difficult choice for me. It’s absolutely essential to keep Donald Trump out of the White House.' Schultz said the country needs real leadership. 'I continue to consider myself a good Republican but it’s time to put the good of the country ahead of the party,' Schultz said. Deininger said Trump has lied to Americans 'about just about everything.' 'A second Trump term would be far worse and far more dangerous,' Deininger said. 'If he regains power, he won’t have guardrails to restrain him.' Emhoff says Trump is afraid to debate Harris again Doug Emhoff, Kamala Harris’ husband, says Donald Trump won’t debate his wife again because he was badly beaten in their first encounter. 'He’s afraid that that’s going to happen again,' Emhoff says in an interview for the MSNBC show 'Morning Joe.' The husband of the Democratic nominee says Trump would rather spread 'this fog of misinformation and disinformation and gaslighting' than face Harris directly. Emhoff says he doesn’t have the time to be angry at Trump’s criticisms of him and his wife, because that would be a 'distraction' and the focus of the Democratic ticket is on campaigning to win the Nov. 5 election. Walz says Trump is wrong about Detroit Democratic vice presidential nominee Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz is firing back at Donald Trump in Michigan for insulting Detroit while campaigning in the city. Trump said Thursday that if Vice President Kamala Harris wins the White House, 'The whole country will be like — you want to know the truth? It’ll be like Detroit.' Walz was to use a campaign event in nearby Warren, Michigan, to attack Trump’s record in the battleground state, according to prepared remarks shared by the campaign. 'Maybe if he ever spent any time in the Midwest, he’d know Detroit is experiencing a great American comeback. Crime is down. The city is growing. Factories are opening again,' he was to say. 'But all these guys know about manufacturing is how to manufacture bulls—-.' Walz plans to quote Trump campaigning in the state in 2016 promising that they 'won’t lose one' automotive plant if he’s elected. 'I guess, technically, that wasn’t a lie — because he lost 6 of them across the country,' Walz was to say. Walz also plans to reassure the auto-heavy state that Harris was not trying to ban gas-powered vehicles. Harris to participate in a town hall hosted by Charlamagne tha God Vice President Kamala Harris will participate in a town hall hosted by Charlamagne tha God on Tuesday, the influential radio host announced on his show Friday. The appearance comes as Harris’ campaign is looking to shore up support among Black men for her candidacy. The announcement comes a day after former President Barack Obama delivered a forceful call for Black men to support Harris during a campaign swing in Pennsylvania. Walz discusses Biden's term on 'Good Morning America' Democratic vice presidential nominee Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz says, 'I don’t know if any of us do everything right,' as he tried to draw some distance between the Democratic ticket and President Joe Biden. Speaking to ABC’s 'Good Morning America,' Walz was asked whether he and Vice President Kamala Harris would have done anything different over the last four years. 'Look, I don’t know if any of us do everything right,' he replied. 'But I can tell you he’s done everything in the best interests of the American public.' Harris drew fire from former President Donald Trump when she told 'The View' earlier this week that she couldn’t think of a difference with Biden — before saying she would put a Republican in her Cabinet if elected. Walz also used the interview to try to walk back his call at a fundraiser this week to eliminate the electoral college. Harris’ campaign quickly stated it doesn't support such a move and Walz told ABC, 'My position is the campaign’s position.'	https://apnews.com/article/harris-trump-election-2024-walz-vance-59658719a804c0dafd1afb08c324370a	2024-10-11T05:34:23-07:00	
North Korea accuses South Korea of flying drones to its capital and threatens to attack next time	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korea has accused rival South Korea of flying drones to its capital to drop anti-North Korean propaganda leaflets and threatened to respond with force if such flights occur again. South Korea issued a vague denial of the allegation. North Korea’s Foreign Ministry said in a statement Friday that South Korean drones were detected in the night skies of Pyongyang on Oct. 3 and Wednesday and Thursday this week. The ministry accused the South of violating North Korea’s 'sacred' sovereignty and threatening its security, and described the alleged flights as a 'dangerous provocation' that could escalate to an armed conflict and even war. It said North Korean forces will prepare 'all means of attack' capable of destroying the southern side of the border and the South Korean military, and respond without warning if South Korean drones are detected in its territory again. 'The safety lock on our trigger has now been released,' the ministry said. 'We will be prepared for everything and will be watching. The criminals should no longer gamble with the lives of their citizens.' Asked about the North Korean claims during a parliamentary hearing, South Korean Defense Minister Kim Yong-hyun told lawmakers, 'We have not done that.' He said he was still trying to assess the situation and didn’t elaborate further. It wasn’t immediately clear whether Kim was referring to South Korean military drones, or also drones possibly operated by South Korean civilians. The South’s Joint Chiefs of Staff later said in a statement that it couldn’t confirm whether the North’s claims were true, without elaborating why. The joint chiefs warned the North to 'exercise restraint and not act recklessly.' 'If the safety of our citizens is threatened in any way, our military will respond with stern and thorough retaliation,' it said. North Korea is extremely sensitive to any outside criticism of the authoritarian government of leader Kim Jong Un and his family’s dynastic rule over the country. Since May, North Korea has sent thousands of balloons carrying paper waste, plastic and other trash to drop on the South, in what it described as retaliation against South Korean civilian activists who flew balloons with anti-North Korean propaganda leaflets across the border. South Korea’s joint chiefs said in a separate statement that the North was again flying balloons toward the South Friday evening and warned civilians to beware of objects falling from the sky. South Korea’s military responded to the North’s balloon campaign by using border loudspeakers to broadcast propaganda and K-pop to North Korea. The psychological warfare campaigns have further escalated tensions created by Kim’s weapons tests and verbal threats of nuclear conflict against Washington and Seoul. The allies have responded by strengthening their combined military exercises and expanding three-way cooperation with Japan, while also upgrading nuclear deterrence plans built around U.S. strategic assets. On Wednesday, North Korea said it will permanently block its border with South Korea and build front-line defense structures to cope with 'confrontational hysteria' by South Korean and U.S. forces. North Korea’s military said in a statement on state media that it will 'completely cut off roads and railways' linked to South Korea and 'fortify the relevant areas of our side with strong defense structures.' North Korea called its steps a 'self-defensive measure for inhibiting war and defending the security' of the country and accused its rivals of 'getting ever more reckless in their confrontational hysteria.' North Korea cited what it called various military exercises in South Korea, the deployment of U.S. strategic assets and its rivals’ harsh rhetoric. Experts say Kim’s nuclear push is aimed at eventually forcing the United States to accept North Korea as a nuclear power and allowing the North to negotiate security and economic concessions from a position of strength. In written answers to questions by The Associated Press this month, South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol said North Korea will likely stage major provocations such as a nuclear test explosion or an intercontinental ballistic missile test around the U.S. presidential election in November to grab Washington’s attention. Yoon also condemned North Korea over its balloon campaign and warned that it 'will face consequences that it will find difficult to withstand' if its balloon activities jeopardize the safety of South Korean people. He didn’t elaborate on what steps his government was considering. ___ Associated Press writer Hyung-jin Kim contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/north-korea-south-drones-attack-threat-border-d1b2e42665fba63dbf4cf2f36a96f5f5	2024-10-11T02:54:32-07:00	
Zelenskyy appeals to allies to keep up aid as Germany pledges new weapons package	BERLIN (AP) — President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Friday it's important that allies' aid to Ukraine doesn't decrease next year as he received a pledge of a new weapons package from German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on a European tour meant to win backing for his 'victory plan' aimed at ending the war with Russia. Zelenskyy arrived in Berlin after stops Thursday in London, Paris and Rome on a tour arranged after a planned summit Saturday with U.S. President Joe Biden and other allied leaders was derailed by Hurricane Milton. Scholz noted that Germany is Ukraine’s biggest military supporter in Europe and the second-biggest behind the United States, and said 'it will stay that way.' Scholz emphasized Berlin’s continued focus on helping Kyiv with air defense. And he said that, by the end of the year, it will deliver another package of military support worth about 1.4 billion euros ($1.5 billion), with support from Belgium, Denmark and Norway — including further air defense systems, self-propelled Gepard anti-aircraft guns, tanks, armored vehicles, combat drones, artillery ammunition and radars. 'For us, it is very important that aid does not decrease next year,' Zelenskyy said, thanking Scholz for the planned aid. 'It must be sufficient to protect people and lives.' This year’s German budget foresees nearly 7.5 billion euros in military aid for Ukraine, while next year’s plan is for 4 billion euros. Berlin hopes a $50 billlion international loan packag e funded by interest on profits from frozen Russian assets will play a growing role in financing aid starting next year, with Kyiv procuring weapons directly. The aim is for that system to be set up by the end of the year. Scholz told Zelenskyy that 'you can rely' on that package. He said Russian President Vladimir Putin should realize that 'playing for time won't work; we won't let up in our support for Ukraine.' The Ukrainian leader has yet to publicly detail his proposals for 'victory.' But the timing of his efforts to lock in European support appear to have the looming U.S. election in mind. Former President Donald Trump has long been critical of U.S. aid to Kyiv. Ukraine’s stretched and short-handed army is currently under heavy pressure in the country’s eastern Donetsk region. Russian forces recently pushed it out of the Donetsk town of Vuhledar and are now in control of about half of nearby Toretsk. To stop the losses, Zelenskyy needs to secure more help. In Berlin, he said that Ukraine 'would want to end the war no later than in 2025.' 'This plan is a bridge to hold a productive peace summit that will truly put an end to the war,' he said, adding that Ukraine can only strengthen its position against Russia through cooperation with Western partners. Earlier Friday, Zelenskyy had a 35-minute meeting with Pope Francis at the Vatican. He also met the Vatican's secretary of state, Pietro Parolin. 'The discussions were dedicated to the state of the war and the humanitarian situation in Ukraine, as well as the ways in which it could be brought to an end, leading to just and stable peace in the country,' the Vatican said, adding that 'some matters relating to the religious life of the country were also examined.' Since the first Russian attack on Kyiv, there have been multiple contacts between Francis and Zelenskyy, through visits, letters and phone calls. The pope sparked some criticism from Ukrainian leaders in March when he suggested they should have the courage of the 'white flag' negotiating an end to the war with Russia, in what was interpreted by many as a call to surrender. Francis has called repeatedly for an end to the war, focusing on prisoner exchanges and on reaching a diplomatic solution to the Ukrainian conflict. ___ Arhirova reported from Kyiv, Ukraine.

Israel's deadliest strike in central Beirut leaves Lebanese stunned as they dig through the rubble	BEIRUT (AP) — Rescue workers searched through the rubble of a collapsed building in central Beirut on Friday morning, hours after two Israeli strikes hit the Lebanese capital, killing at least 22 people and wounding dozens. The air raid was the deadliest attack on central Beirut in over a year of war, hitting two residential buildings in neighborhoods that have swelled with displaced people fleeing Israeli bombardment elsewhere in the country. Hezbollah’s Al-Manar television and Israeli media said the strikes aimed to kill Wafiq Safa, a top security official with the group. Al-Manar said Safa was not in either building at the time. The Israeli military had no comment on the reports. Thursday night's strikes came as Israel escalates its campaign against Hezbollah with waves of heavy airstrikes across Lebanon and a ground invasion at the border, after a year of exchanges of fire between the two rivals. The same day as the Beirut explosions, Israeli forces fired on United Nations peacekeepers in southern Lebanon and wounded two peacekeepers from Indonesia, drawing widespread condemnation. Hezbollah has expanded its rocket fire to more populated areas deeper inside Israel. While disrupting life for Israelis, most of Hezbollah’s barrages have not caused casualties. But early Friday, an anti-tank missile fired from Lebanon killed a man from Thailand working on a farm in northern Israel. In Beirut’s Burj Abi Haidar neighborhood, civil defense members and municipal workers dug through the pile of concrete and twisted metal from a three-story building knocked down by Thursday night’s strike. In an adjacent building that was badly damaged, Ahmad al-Khatib stood in the apartment of his in-laws where he, his wife, Marwa Hamdan, and their 2 ½-year-old daughter, Ayla, suffered injuries. He had just picked up his wife from work and she was performing the evening Muslim prayers at home when the blast hit. 'The world suddenly turned upside down and darkness prevailed,' said the 42-year-old, tears running down his cheeks. He pulled his daughter out from under the debris of a wall that collapsed in a bedroom. Al-Khatib, who works for the postal service. said he found the force of the explosion had thrown his wife against a wall and a piece of metal had hit her in the head. 'I looked in her face and shouted, ‘Say something!’' he said, but she only responded with sounds of pain. His wife remains in the ICU at a Beirut hospital. His daughter suffered only minor injuries. Mohammed Tarhani said he had moved in with his brother nearby in the neighborhood after fleeing around southern Lebanon to escape airstrikes the past weeks. His children were out on the veranda, and he was in the living room when the strike hit. 'We rushed out to look for the children,' he said. 'Where is one supposed to go now?' Civil defense official Walid Hashash said they don’t expect more bodies under the rubble as no people are missing. He added that once operations are over they will issue a final death toll. Hezbollah began firing rockets into Israel on Oct. 8, 2023, in support of Hamas and the Palestinians, drawing Israeli airstrikes in retaliation. Israel says its stepped-up campaign since late September aims to push Hezbollah away from the border to allow tens of thousands of its citizens evacuated from the area to return home. More than 2,100 Lebanese –- including Hezbollah fighters, civilians and medical personnel — have been killed the past year by Israeli strikes, more than two thirds of them in the past few weeks. Hezbollah attacks have killed 29 civilians as well as 39 Israeli soldiers in northern Israel since October 2023 and in southern Lebanon since Israel launched its ground invasion on Sept. 30. So far, Israeli troops have been operating in a narrow strip of a few kilometers (miles) along the border. The war threatens to spiral even further, with Israel aiming to strike a crippling blow to its longtime adversary Hezbollah. Netanyahu this week warned Lebanese they would suffer the same destruction that Israel’s campaign against Hamas has inflicted in Gaza unless they take action against Hezbollah. Israel has also vowed to strike back against the Lebanese group’s supporter, Iran, after it launched some 180 ballistic missiles at Israel last week. Iran’s barrage was in retaliation for previous Israeli strikes that killed Hamas’ leader in Tehran and senior Iranian Revolutionary Guard figures in Lebanon. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Friday reiterated U.S. support for Israel’s escalated campaign against Hezbollah. He said Israel had a 'clear and very legitimate' interest to try to ensure the return of tens of thousands of its citizens who were evacuated from their homes near the border because of Hezbollah fire since last October. He told a news conference after attending an annual meeting of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations in Laos that the U.S. is 'extremely focused' on reaching a diplomatic solution to the war. Meanwhile the U.N. peacekeeping mission in Lebanon, known as UNIFIL, was rearranging some of its personnel after its positions were repeated hit by Israeli forces Thursday. UNIFIL said an Israeli tank directly fired on an observation tower at the force’s headquarters in the town of Naqoura, Lebanon, and that soldiers attacked a bunker near where peacekeepers were sheltering, damaging vehicles and a communication system. It said an Israeli drone was seen flying to the bunker’s entrance. The Israeli military acknowledged opening fire at a U.N. base in southern Lebanon on Thursday and said it had ordered the peacekeepers to 'remain in protected spaces.' Afterward, the U.N. peacekeeping chief said 300 peacekeepers in frontline positions on southern Lebanon’s border have been temporarily moved to larger bases. Plans to move another 200 will depend on security conditions as the conflict escalates. Jean-Pierre Lacroix told an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council that peacekeepers with UNIFIL are staying in their positions, but because of air and ground attacks they cannot conduct patrols. UNIFIL, which has more than 10,000 peacekeepers from dozens of countries, was created to oversee the withdrawal of Israeli troops from southern Lebanon after Israel’s 1978 invasion. The United Nations expanded its mission following the 2006 war between Israel and Hezbollah, allowing peacekeepers to patrol a buffer zone set up along the border. Israel accuses Hezbollah of establishing militant infrastructure along the border in violation of the U.N. Security Council resolution that ended the 2006 war. ___ Find more of AP’s coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war.	https://apnews.com/article/srael-palestinians-hamas-war-lebanon-hezbollah-11-10-2024-9dd58a9fea9c2de963edbc31ba90bb1a	2024-10-11T01:39:43-07:00	
AI is having its Nobel moment. Do scientists need the tech industry to sustain it?	Hours after the artificial intelligence pioneer Geoffrey Hinton won a Nobel Prize in physics, he drove a rented car to Google's California headquarters to celebrate. Hinton doesn't work at Google anymore. Nor did the longtime professor at the University of Toronto do his pioneering research at the tech giant. But his impromptu party reflected AI's moment as a commercial blockbuster that has also reached the pinnacles of scientific recognition. That was Tuesday. Then, early Wednesday, two employees of Google's AI division won a Nobel Prize in chemistry for using AI to predict and design novel proteins. 'This is really a testament to the power of computer science and artificial intelligence,' said Jeanette Wing, a professor of computer science at Columbia University. Asked about the historic back-to-back science awards for AI work in an email Wednesday, Hinton said only: 'Neural networks are the future.' It didn't always seem that way for researchers who decades ago experimented with interconnected computer nodes inspired by neurons in the human brain. Hinton shares this year's physics Nobel with another scientist, John Hopfield, for helping develop those building blocks of machine learning. Neural network advances came from 'basic, curiosity-driven research,' Hinton said at a press conference after his win. 'Not out of throwing money at applied problems, but actually letting scientists follow their curiosity to try and understand things.' Such work started well before Google existed. But a bountiful tech industry has now made it easier for AI scientists to pursue their ideas even as it has challenged them with new ethical questions about the societal impacts of their work. One reason why the current wave of AI research is so closely tied to the tech industry is that only a handful of corporations have the resources to build the most powerful AI systems. 'These discoveries and this capability could not happen without humongous computational power and humongous amounts of digital data,' Wing said. 'There are very few companies — tech companies — that have that kind of computational power. Google is one. Microsoft is another.' The chemistry Nobel Prize awarded Wednesday went to Demis Hassabis and John Jumper of Google’s London-based DeepMind laboratory along with researcher David Baker at the University of Washington for work that could help discover new medicines. Hassabis, the CEO and co-founder of DeepMind, which Google acquired in 2014, told the AP in an interview Wednesday his dream was to model his research laboratory on the 'incredible storied history' of Bell Labs. Started in 1925, the New Jersey-based industrial lab was the workplace of multiple Nobel-winning scientists over several decades who helped develop modern computing and telecommunications. 'I wanted to recreate a modern day industrial research lab that really did cutting-edge research,' Hassabis said. 'But of course, that needs a lot of patience and a lot of support. We’ve had that from Google and it’s been amazing.' Hinton joined Google late in his career and quit last year so he could talk more freely about his concerns about AI’s dangers, particularly what happens if humans lose control of machines that become smarter than us. But he stops short of criticizing his former employer. Hinton, 76, said he was staying in a cheap hotel in Palo Alto, California when the Nobel committee woke him up with a phone call early Tuesday morning, leading him to cancel a medical appointment scheduled for later that day. By the time the sleep-deprived scientist reached the Google campus in nearby Mountain View, he 'seemed pretty lively and not very tired at all' as colleagues popped bottles of champagne, said computer scientist Richard Zemel, a former doctoral student of Hinton’s who joined him at the Google party Tuesday. 'Obviously there are these big companies now that are trying to cash in on all the commercial success and that is exciting,' said Zemel, now a Columbia professor. But Zemel said what’s more important to Hinton and his closest colleagues has been what the Nobel recognition means to the fundamental research they spent decades trying to advance. Guests included Google executives and another former Hinton student, Ilya Sutskever, a co-founder and former chief scientist and board member at ChatGPT maker OpenAI. Sutskever helped lead a group of board members who briefly ousted OpenAI CEO Sam Altman last year in turmoil that has symbolized the industry's conflicts. An hour before the party, Hinton used his Nobel bully pulpit to throw shade at OpenAI during opening remarks at a virtual press conference organized by the University of Toronto in which he thanked former mentors and students. 'I’m particularly proud of the fact that one of my students fired Sam Altman,' Hinton said. Asked to elaborate, Hinton said OpenAI started with a primary objective to develop better-than-human artificial general intelligence 'and ensure that it was safe.' 'And over time, it turned out that Sam Altman was much less concerned with safety than with profits. And I think that’s unfortunate,' Hinton said. In response, OpenAI said in a statement that it is 'proud of delivering the most capable and safest AI systems' and that they 'safely serve hundreds of millions of people each week.' Conflicts are likely to persist in a field where building even a relatively modest AI system requires resources 'well beyond those of your typical research university,' said Michael Kearns, a professor of computer science at the University of Pennsylvania. But Kearns, who sits on the committee that picks the winners of computer science's top prize — the Turing Award — said this week marks a 'great victory for interdisciplinary research' that was decades in the making. Hinton is only the second person to win both a Nobel and Turing. The first, Turing-winning political scientist Herbert Simon, started working on what he called 'computer simulation of human cognition' in the 1950s and won the Nobel economics prize in 1978 for his study of organizational decision-making. Wing, who met Simon in her early career, said scientists are still just at the tip of finding ways to apply computing's most powerful capabilities to other fields. 'We’re just at the beginning in terms of scientific discovery using AI,' she said. —— AP Business Writer Kelvin Chan contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/ai-nobel-prizes-physics-chemistry-google-deepmind-hinton-cb963de3b4235f28f8c95ca9080830f6	2024-10-11T01:00:21-07:00	
George Baldock's family confirm soccer player drowned while swimming	George Baldock, the Greece international soccer player who was found dead at his home in Athens on Wednesday, drowned while swimming in his pool, his family said. Greek police said this week there was no initial indication the death of the 31-year-old former Premier League player was suspicious. 'We are heartbroken with the sudden passing of our beloved George. We can confirm that a post-mortem examination has found that George tragically drowned whilst swimming in the pool at his home in Glyfada, Athens,' Baldock's family said in a statement issued to The Associated Press. The family said the Panathinaikos defender, who was born in Britain, had been due to return to the U.K. on Thursday to celebrate his baby son's first birthday. 'George, you were the most special father, fiance, son, brother, uncle, friend, teammate and person. Your enthusiasm and infectious personality brought so much love to those that were fortunate enough to know you and those that adored you from the stands,' the family said. 'We will forever cherish the special memories we have of you and you will continue to live on in your beautiful son.' Baldock was of Greek heritage and played 12 matches for the national team. He joined Sheffield United in 2017 and helped the club earn promotion to the Premier League twice, in 2019 and 2023. He joined Panathinaikos in May, on a three-year contract, after Sheffield United was relegated to England’s second division. 'As a family it has been incredibly touching, but equally so very difficult to read the huge number of tributes written by those that knew George and from those whose life he touched. It was impossible not to love him,' his family said. 'We ask that you please continue to respect our privacy at this devastating time as we begin to process our grief.' There was a period of silence in tribute to the right back ahead of Thursday's game in the Nations League between England and Greece at Wembley Stadium. Greece won 2-1. ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer	https://apnews.com/article/greece-george-baldock-dead-swimming-family-cebabaeddb20e81f8a953ae150d90ad8	2024-10-11T00:51:54-07:00	
Russia launches 4th aerial attack in a week against Ukraine's grain-exporting Odesa region	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — A nighttime Russian missile strike on Odesa killed at least four people including a 16-year-old girl, regional authorities said Friday, in the latest in a series of attacks this week on the southern Ukrainian region that are likely intended to disrupt the country’s grain exports. Four Russian missile and drone attacks on the Odesa region this week have killed 14 people and wounded around 20, according to local officials. The strikes have hit merchant ships and damaged port infrastructure in the region, which is a vital hub for Ukraine’s agricultural exports through the Black Sea. An attack on Odesa late Wednesday killed nine people and hit a container ship sailing under the Panamanian flag — the third attack on a merchant vessel in four days, according to regional Gov. Oleh Kiper. The apparent Russian effort to frustrate Ukraine’s exports, which bring vital revenue for a national economy battered by more than two years of war, coincided with a renewed push by Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to ensure continuing military and financial support from his country’s Western partners. Ukraine’s stretched and short-handed army is currently under heavy pressure in the country’s eastern Donetsk region. Russian forces recently pushed it out of the Donetsk town of Vuhledar and are now in control of about half of nearby Toretsk, local administration chief Vasyl Chynchyk said Friday. To stop the losses, Zelenskyy needs to secure more help. Russia last year tore up an agreement that allowed Ukraine — one of the world’s biggest suppliers of grain and other food staples, especially to developing nations — to export produce safely through the Black Sea. Months later, and amid successful Ukrainian attacks on Russia’s Black Sea fleet which forced its navy to back away from the coast, Ukraine established a shipping corridor that hugs the coast down to Turkey and opens a way to the Mediterranean Sea. A special insurance program has provided affordable coverage to shippers who have carried millions of tons of cargo out of Ukraine, but the latest attacks could jeopardize that arrangement. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-odesa-attacks-grain-e9e8ce95daf89a07c9d1c1ee68a7416e	2024-10-11T00:27:48-07:00	
Nobuyo Oyama, voice actor for beloved Japanese cartoon robotic cat Doraemon, dies at age 90	TOKYO (AP) — Nobuyo Oyama, best known as the raspy voice of Doraemon, the beloved cartoon robotic cat from the future, has died. She was 90. Oyama, who voiced Doraemon for more than a quarter century, died of natural causes on Sept. 29, her agency, Actors Seven, said Friday. Oyama performed the voice of the blue-and-white robotic cat from 1979 to 2005. Created by the cartoonist Fujiko F. Fujio in 1970, Doraemon and the story of his friendship with Nobita, a good-hearted but somewhat lazy boy, became hugely popular. The manga and anime series have been read and watched by millions of fans in Japan and across the world and have been translated into dozens of languages. In the series, Doraemon arrives from the 22nd century and helps Nobita in difficult situations, often with gadgets from the future such as an 'anywhere door' and 'take-copter.' Born in Tokyo in 1933, Oyama was an aspiring actor and debuted in a 1956 drama on Japan’s NHK public television. She had her first voice acting role in 1957 in the dubbed version of the TV drama series 'Lassie.' Oyama’s raspy voice quickly gained her popularity in anime and children’s programs. She was the voice of one of three piglets in a popular children’s puppet show in the early 1960s and of teenage boy Katsuo in the family anime series 'Sazaesan' prior to 'Doraemon.' Oyama retired as Doraemon in March 2005 as part of a renewal of the voice actors for the main characters. 'I hope Doraemon will still be a beloved character in the distant future,' Oyama said. In 2015, Oyama’s husband disclosed that she had developed dementia. Even so, as head of a sound arts school, Oyama was known to always succeed on the first try when she was asked to perform in her Doraemon voice. Oyama’s agency said her funeral was held privately by her relatives. Noriko Ohara, the voice of Nobita, died in July.	https://apnews.com/article/japan-doraemon-voice-actor-manga-obit-bc30a07500453c78a854339ba1d49667	2024-10-11T00:07:01-07:00	
Nobel Peace Prize awarded to Japanese organization of atomic bombing survivors Nihon Hidankyo	The Nobel Peace Prize was awarded Friday to Nihon Hidankyo, a Japanese organization of survivors of the U.S. atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, for its activism against nuclear weapons. Jørgen Watne Frydnes, chair of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, said the award was made as the 'taboo against the use of nuclear weapons is under pressure.' In September, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a shift in his country’s nuclear doctrine, in a move aimed at discouraging the West from allowing Ukraine to strike Russia with longer-range weapons. It appeared to significantly lower the threshold for the possible use of Russia’s nuclear arsenal. Watne Frydnes said the Nobel committee 'wishes to honor all survivors who, despite physical suffering and painful memories, have chosen to use their costly experience to cultivate hope and engagement for peace.' Hidankyo's Hiroshima branch chairperson, Tomoyuki Mimaki, who was standing by at the city hall for the announcement, cheered and teared up when he received the news. 'Is it really true? Unbelievable!' Mimaki screamed. Efforts to eradicate nuclear weapons have been honored in the past by the Nobel committee. The International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons won the peace prize in 2017, and in 1995 Joseph Rotblat and the Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs won for 'their efforts to diminish the part played by nuclear arms in international politics and, in the longer run, to eliminate such arms.' This year's prize was awarded against a backdrop of devastating conflicts raging in the world, notably in the Middle East, Ukraine and Sudan. 'It is very clear that threats of using nuclear weapons are putting pressure on the important international norm, the taboo of using nuclear weapons,' Watne Frydnes said in response to a question on whether the rhetoric from Russia surrounding nuclear weapons in its invasion of Ukraine had influenced this year's decision. 'And therefore it is alarming to see how threats of use is also damaging this norm. To uphold an international strong taboo against the use is crucial for all of humanity,' he added. EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said on X that 'the spectre of Hiroshima and Nagasaki still looms over humanity. This makes the advocacy of Nihon Hidankyo invaluable. This Nobel Peace Prize sends a powerful message. We have the duty to remember. And an even greater duty to protect the next generations from the horrors of nuclear war.' Alfred Nobel stated in his will that the peace prize should be awarded for 'the most or the best work for fraternity between nations, for the abolition or reduction of standing armies and for the holding and promotion of peace congresses.' Last year’s prize went to jailed Iranian activist Narges Mohammadi for her advocacy of women’s rights and democracy, and against the death penalty. The Nobel committee said it also was a recognition of 'the hundreds of thousands of people' who demonstrated against 'Iran’s theocratic regime’s policies of discrimination and oppression targeting women.' In a year of conflict, there had been some speculation before the announcement that the Norwegian Nobel Committee that decides on the winner would opt not to award a prize at all this year. The prize has been withheld a total of 19 times since 1901, including during both world wars. The last time it was not awarded was in 1972. In the Middle East, persistently spiraling levels of violence over the past year have killed tens of thousands of people, including thousands of children and women. The war, sparked by a bloody raid into Israel by Hamas-led militants on Oct. 7, 2023 that left about 1,200 people dead, mostly civilians, has spilled out into the wider region. In the past week, Israel sent ground troops into Lebanon to pursue Hezbollah militants firing rockets into Israel, while Iran – which backs both Hamas and Hezbollah – fired a barrage of ballistic missiles into Israel. Israel has yet to respond, but its defense minister vowed this week that its retaliation would be both devastating and surprising. The war in Gaza has killed more than 42,000 people, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which doesn’t differentiate between civilians and combatants in its count but says more than half are women and children. In Lebanon, more than 1,400 people have been killed, with thousands more injured and around 1 million displaced since mid-September, when the Israeli military dramatically expanded its offensive against Hezbollah. The war in Ukraine, sparked by Russia’s invasion, is heading toward its third winter with a massive loss of human life on both sides. The U.N. has confirmed more than 11,000 Ukrainian civilian dead, but that doesn’t take into account as many as 25,000 Ukrainians believed to have died during the Russian capture of the city of Mariupol or unreported deaths in the occupied territories. The Nobel prizes carry a cash award of 11 million Swedish kronor ($1 million). Unlike the other Nobel prizes that are selected and announced in Stockholm, founder Alfred Nobel decreed the peace prize be decided and awarded in Oslo by the five-member Norwegian Nobel Committee. The Nobel season ends Monday with the announcement of the winner of the economics prize, formally known as the Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel. ___ Corder reported from The Hague, Netherlands, and Becatoros from Athens, Greece.

Middle East latest: UN mission in Lebanon is hit again by explosions	The United Nations peacekeeping force in southern Lebanon said new explosions hit its headquarters Friday, injuring two peacekeepers a day after Israeli forces targeted the same position and struck central Beirut. Earlier Friday, cross-border fire from Lebanon killed a man from Thailand who was working on a farm in north Israel. Lebanon’s crisis response unit announced Friday that 60 people were killed and 168 wounded in the past 24 hours, raising the total toll over the past year of conflict between Israel and Hezbollah to 2,229 killed and 10,380 wounded, according to the Lebanese Health Ministry. Israel has been escalating its campaign against Hezbollah with waves of heavy airstrikes across Lebanon and a ground invasion at the border, after a year of exchanges of fire between the two rivals. Israel is now at war with Hamas in Gaza and Hamas' ally Hezbollah in Lebanon. Israel’s offensive in Gaza has killed over 42,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities, who do not say how many were fighters but say women and children make up more than half of the fatalities. The war has destroyed large areas of Gaza and displaced about 90% of its population of 2.3 million people, often multiple times. It's been a full year since Hamas-led militants blew holes in Israel’s security fence and stormed into army bases and farming communities, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting another 250. They are still holding about 100 captives inside Gaza, a third of whom are believed to be dead. ___ Here is the latest: At least 8 killed in airstrikes on southern Lebanon, health ministry says BEIRUT — At least eight people were killed in intensified airstrikes across villages in southern and eastern Lebanon on Friday evening, according to the Lebanese Health Ministry. An Israeli airstrike on Baysarieh, a village in Sidon province, killed three people, including a 2-year-old and a 16-year-old, and injured three others, the health ministry said. In Baalbeck-Hermel province, located in the Bekaa Valley, five more people were killed and five others wounded in additional airstrikes. On Thursday, 22 people were killed and 117 wounded in two Israeli strikes on two locations in central Beirut. The strike caused the collapse of two residential buildings housing families and displaced individuals. Critical aid routes into northern Gaza have been cut off, United Nations officials say UNITED NATIONS — U.N. humanitarian officials say aid entering Gaza is at its lowest level in months and warn that critical aid lifelines into northern Gaza, where Israel has renewed its offensive, have been cut off. U.N. deputy spokesperson Farhan Haq delivered the grim news Friday, saying the main crossings into the north have been closed and no food or other essential supplies have entered since Oct. 1. More than 400,000 people who remain in the north are under increasing pressure to move south, Haq said. On Wednesday, the Israeli military body that oversees aid distribution in Gaza, COGAT, said in a statement that 'Israel has not halted the entry or coordination of humanitarian aid' in the north. Meanwhile, the humanitarian organization MedGlobal, which has worked in Gaza since 2018, said Friday that the Israeli army’s renewed military action has driven the remaining health care facilities in the north 'to the brink of collapse.' Three hospitals with hundreds of patients including children in intensive care — Kamal Adwan, Al-Awda and the Indonesian Hospital — have been ordered to evacuate by Israeli authorities and are on the verge of running out of fuel. Dr. Hussam Abu Safiya, director of Kamal Adwan and MedGlobal’s lead physician in Gaza, said Friday that the hospital just received 'numerous injuries and fatalities due to the targeting of Al Naji area.' The hospital’s intensive care unit is overcrowded and the 'catastrophic situation … will worsen in the coming hours if there is no fuel for emergency services,' he said in a statement. On the overall dire situation throughout Gaza, Haq said the U.N. World Food Program reports that it has been unable to deliver food parcels to the more than 1 million Palestinians who receive them so far this month 'due to constrained access of aid supplies.' In the north, WFP said kitchens, distribution points and bakeries have either been forced to shut down or are at risk of shutting down if the conflict continues, Haq said, adding that the bakeries are also running out of wheat flour. Despite the challenges, Haq said, the U.N. agency helping Palestinian refugees known as UNRWA and its partners are distributing bread, meals and flour to designated shelters and beyond. Government watching situation of Italian peacekeeping contingent, premier says Italy’s Premier Giorgia Meloni said Friday that the Italian government is following the situation of the Italian peacekeeping contingent in southern Lebanon 'with great attention,' reiterating her strong condemnation of the Israeli attacks on the U.N. bases in the area. The Italian soldiers engaged in the UNIFIL mission 'are doing a fundamental, valuable work for the stabilisation of the area, ' Meloni said, speaking at the final press conference of the Med9 Summit in Cyprus. She recalled that the UNIFIL mission’s headquarters and two Italian bases have been hit by gunfire attacks launched by Israeli forces. 'I can’t avoid to go back and condemn what happened. It is not acceptable,' Meloni said, confirming that the Italian government has 'strongly protested' to the Israeli authorities over the attacks. Meloni added that she was also working with her international colleagues on a common initiative to be discussed during the G7 Defense summit, which will take place in the coming days, 'to implement our joint efforts to strengthen the Lebanese armed forces.' US and Israel defense leaders spoke to discuss operations in Lebanon, Pentagon says WAHINGTON — U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin spoke with Israeli Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant on Thursday to discuss Israel’s operations in Lebanon. Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder, the Pentagon press secretary, said Austin reaffirmed ironclad support for Israel’s right to defend itself and reiterated the U.S. commitment to a diplomatic arrangement that safely returns both Lebanese and Israeli civilians to their homes on both sides of the border. He said Austin emphasized the importance of ensuring the safety of UNIFIL forces in the area and urged Israel to 'pivot from military operations to a diplomatic pathway as soon as feasible.' 60 killed, 168 wounded over past 24 hours in Lebanon, health ministry says BEIRUT — Lebanon’s crisis response unit announced Friday that 60 people were killed and 168 wounded in the past 24 hours, raising the total toll over the past year of conflict between Israel and Hezbollah to 2,229 killed and 10,380 wounded, according to the Lebanese Health Ministry. The casualty toll was notably higher than previous days, with 22 people killed and 117 wounded in two Israeli strikes on two locations in central Beirut. The strike caused the collapse of two residential buildings housing families and displaced individuals. The crisis response unit report also recorded 57 airstrikes and incidents of shelling in the past day, mostly concentrated in southern Lebanon, the southern suburbs of Beirut and the Bekaa Valley. Some 1,032 centers — including educational complexes, vocational institutes, universities and other institutions — are sheltering 187,000 people, including 39,000 families, displaced by the Israeli offensive in Lebanon, the report said. Among these shelters, 837 have now reached full capacity. Despite a major border crossing between Lebanon and Syria being out of commission after an Israeli strike hit the road last week, crowds have continued to flow across the border seeking relative safety in Syria. Between Sept. 23 and Oct. 9, Lebanese General Security recorded 317,457 Syrian citizens and 115,044 Lebanese citizens crossing into Syria, the report said. Fourth Brazilian repatriation flight leaves Beirut SAO PAULO — Brazil’s fourth repatriation plane left Beirut for Brazil on Friday, carrying 211 passengers including 12 infants, according to a statement from Brazil’s foreign ministry. The flight is set to land in Sao Paulo on Saturday morning local time after a stop to refuel in Lisbon. The Brazilian government has evacuated 885 people and 11 pets from Lebanon in one week, the foreign ministry said. About 21,000 Brazilians live in Lebanon, which is home to the largest community of Brazilians in the Middle East. Two Brazilian adolescents have been killed by Israeli bombardments in Lebanon. The Brazilian Embassy in Beirut remains in contact with Brazilians and their close family members to organize a new repatriation flight depending on the security conditions, according to the foreign ministry. 2 Sri Lankans serving in UN peacekeeping mission in Lebanon wounded COLOMBO, Sri Lanka — The Sri Lankan foreign ministry said two Sri Lankan soldiers who were serving in the United Nations peacekeeping mission in south Lebanon were wounded following the attacks on the U.N. base. 'Sri Lanka strongly condemns the attack at UNIFIL’s headquarters in Naqoura, South Lebanon injuring two Sri Lankan UN peacekeepers. Sri Lanka upholds the obligations to ensure the safety and security of UN personnel and inviolability of UN premises at all times,' the foreign ministry said Friday. The U.N. force, known as UNIFIL, said new explosions hit its headquarters on Friday morning and injured two peacekeepers a day after Israeli forces struck the same position. The force has more than 10,000 peacekeepers from dozens of countries. 2 Lebanese soldiers killed as airstrike hits near Lebanese Army checkpoint Two Lebanese soldiers were killed and three others wounded in an Israeli airstrike that hit a building near a Lebanese Army checkpoint in Kafra, Bint Jbeil province, the Lebanese Army said Friday. Since Israel launched its ground invasion of Lebanon, Israeli forces and Hezbollah militants have clashed along the border while the Lebanese army has largely stood on the sidelines. As Israeli troops made their first forays across the border and Hezbollah responded with rocket fire, Lebanese soldiers withdrew from observation posts along the frontier and repositioned about 5 km back. On Oct. 3, a Lebanese soldier was killed and another injured in an Israeli strike in Taybeh during rescue operations. On Sept. 30, another Lebanese soldier was killed by an Israeli drone targeting a Lebanese Army checkpoint in Wazzani. 2 injured after new explosions hit its base in southern Lebanon, UN says The United Nations peacekeeping force in southern Lebanon says new explosions hit its headquarters on Friday morning, injuring two peacekeepers, a day after Israeli forces struck the same position. The force, known as UNIFIL, said the explosions went off close to an observation tower at its headquarters in the southern Lebanese town of Naqoura. One of the injured peacekeepers was taken to a hospital in the nearby city of Tyre, while the other was treated at the site. It did not specify the cause of the blasts. It also said an Israeli army bulldozer hit the perimeter of another of its positions in southern Lebanon while Israeli tanks moved nearby. Additional peacekeepers were sent to reinforce the position, it said. Human Rights Watch says Israeli attacks on United Nations peacekeepers amount to war crimes Human Rights Watch says the Israeli military's deliberate and repeated attacks on the United Nations peacekeeping mission in south Lebanon are unlawful and amount to war crimes. The New York-based rights group issued a statement amid widespread condemnation of the attack by Israeli forces on the headquarters of the U.N. peacekeeping force known as UNIFIL, which wounded two peacekeepers a day earlier. 'Any targeting of UN peacekeepers by Israeli forces violates the laws of war and dangerously interferes with UNIFIL’s civilian protection and aid work,' said Lama Fakih, Middle East and North Africa director at Human Rights Watch. 'With over 2,000 people killed and over a million people displaced in Lebanon since mid-September, it is crucial for UNIFIL to be allowed to fulfil its civilian protection and humanitarian functions,' Fakih said. United Nations appeals for pause in fighting to enable polio vaccinations in Gaza GENEVA — The U.N. is getting ready for the start a second round of polio vaccinations for children in Gaza next week, and appealed for the implementation of a 'humanitarian pause' to enable the campaign. A first round of vaccinations was concluded last month after the detection of Gaza’s first polio case in 25 years. The new round is due to start on Monday and aims to give a second dose to some 591,700 children. Dr. Rik Peeperkorn, the World Health Organization’s representative in the Palestinian territories, said Friday that a pause in fighting will once again be a 'prerequisite' for a successful second round. He said that 'we renew our request for all parties of the conflict to implement this necessary humanitarian pause' in Gaza. He added that this is 'particularly critical as new evacuation orders in the north of Gaza are threatening access to hospitals and protection of health facilities and health and community workers.' Blinken says Israel has ‘clear and legitimate’ interests in fighting Hezbollah VIENTIANE, Laos — Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Friday gave support to Israel’s escalated campaign against Hezbollah, saying it had 'clear and legitimate' reasons, but said the United States is trying to find a diplomatic solution to the war. 'When the horror of Oct. 7 happened, the next day Hezbollah joined in, trying to create another front in the process,' he told a news conference after attending an annual meeting of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations in Laos. He said Israel has a 'clear and very legitimate interest' in trying to allow the return of its citizens who were evacuated from their homes in northern Israel because of Hezbollah fire. 'The people of Lebanon want the same thing,' he said, referring to Lebanese who fled homes near the border to escape Israeli bombardment. 'We believe that the best way to get there is through a diplomatic understanding, one that we’ve been working on for some time and one that we’re extremely focused on right now,' he said. Blinken said it was also important that civilians are protected amid fighting in Lebanon and Gaza, adding that not enough humanitarian aid is reaching north Gaza and other areas. Thai worker in Israel killed by munition from Lebanon JERUSALEM — Cross-border fire from Lebanon killed a young worker from Thailand in the north of Israel early Friday, Israel’s military said. Israel's military said that the 27-year-old was killed by a rocket that hit farmland. The Thai Embassy in Israel and Israel's paramedic service said he was killed by an anti-tank missile fired from Lebanon. The two accounts could not immediately be reconciled. The man was a farmworker on Kibbutz Yir'on, a communal farm in the north, the embassy said in a Facebook post Friday. The attack also 'severely traumatized' another worker. The embassy was working on getting in touch with the man’s family, a spokesperson for Thailand’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said at a news conference in Bangkok. The Israeli military said two other civilians were injured in the same incident Friday. Hezbollah claimed one missile attack on a military position in the north Friday morning. Hezbollah and other militants in Lebanon have been exchanging fire with Israel for the past year. Israel recently escalated bombardment in Lebanon and invaded a strip inside the Lebanese border, vowing to push out Hezbollah fighters. Friday’s strike was one of the first civilian deaths in Israel since the escalation began in late September. Two Israelis were killed by rocket debris Wednesday. On the Lebanese side, Israeli strikes have killed more than 1,400 people in the past three weeks, including fighters, civilians and medical personnel. Turkey condemns Israeli attack that wounded United Nations peacekeepers ANKARA, Turkey — Turkey condemned Israel’s attack on United Nations peacekeepers in southern Lebanon, characterizing it as 'a manifestation of its perception that its crimes go unpunished.' The U.N. peacekeeping mission in Lebanon, known as UNIFIL, said in a statement Thursday that its headquarters and positions 'have been repeatedly hit' by Israeli forces. Two UNIFIL troops were wounded in the attacks. The Israeli military acknowledged opening fire at a U.N. base in southern Lebanon on Thursday and said it had ordered the peacekeepers to 'remain in protected spaces.' 'The international community is obliged to ensure that Israel abides by international law,' Turkey’s Foreign Ministry said in a statement released late Thursday. 'We will continue to support all initiatives within the framework of international law to promote peace in the region. Turkey contributes to UNIFIL Maritime Task Force with a corvette and five personnel, the ministry said.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hezbollah-hamas-latest-mideast-11-october-2024-114541998d0f165b05884e19fa161d34	2024-10-10T23:13:43-07:00	
AP PHOTOS: Performers bring Hindu gods to life in the Ramleela	NEW DELHI (AP) — 23-year old Ashutosh Agnihotri has been playing god this week. Ahead of the Dussehra festival, which celebrates the defeat of mythological demon Ravana, at the hands of Lord Rama, artists dressed in ornate crowns and costumes perform the Ramleela, a dramatic re-enactment of Lord Rama’s life as told in the religious epic Ramayana. Performing as one of Hindu-majority India’s most beloved gods means living up to the values enshrined in his inspiring life story, says Agnihotri, the actor playing Lord Rama. The former technology professional-turned-actor is trying to keep his anger in check during the 10-day run of the Ramleela in a New Delhi park. 'Well, I get angry. God does not get angry easily,' he says. 'When you have played the character of god, you realize how you should live your life as a human being. God has shown you everything.' Usually performed on a brightly lit open stage, the Ramleela brings alive one of the most enduring tales in Hindu religion, symbolizing the victory of good over evil and blending collective devotion with popular culture. It tells the story of Lord Rama’s exile with his wife Sita and his brother Lakshmana, Sita’s abduction by the demon king of Lanka, Ravana, and the grand battle for her ultimate rescue. The scenes include song and dance, narration and melodramatic dialogue, with a live orchestra using local instruments like drums and the harmonium to keep the audience engaged. What the production lacks in technological sophistication, it makes up with sheer ingenuity. The man in charge of special effects holds a flame behind the actor playing the ten-headed Ravana, whose raucous laughter fills the air as smoke machines throw up plumes of color. Rakesh Ratnakar, 65, a retired drama teacher who has been directing Ramleela performances in New Delhi for years, brought together a motley crew of actors, technicians and make-up artists, many travelling from other cities. Days of rehearsals, hours of makeup, and pounds of heavy costume go into the production. Funds for the show are collected from donors. While the tale may be traditional, digital technology and social media have helped in reaching contemporary audiences. The demon king Ravana is the most sought after for selfies with fans. For Ratnakar, putting the show together is a labour of love, and devotion. The show ends every night with ritual prayers. Lord Rama represents 'the essence' of India, he says, and his life story will help safeguard both the Hindu religion and India’s culture. 21-year old Hitanshi Jha, who plays the role of Sita, believes that a divine hand guides her performance. 'Meaning everything happens automatically. I don’t say anything on stage, God himself makes it happen,' she says. The day of the Dussehra festival also marks the end of the five-day Durga Puja festival, the biggest holiday for India’s Bengali community. Thousands gather at temporary shrines to the Hindu goddess Durga, who is seen as the mother of the universe and worshipped for her fearsome power. As the actors in Delhi finish their show, they seek the director’s blessings, bowing down in front of their guru. Then the makeup comes off and costumes are packed away, and the crew gathers for a meal, relaxing in their dressing room in a tent provided by a charitable group. Time to catch up on real lives and sleep, before another day of playing gods.	https://apnews.com/article/india-festival-ramleela-dussehra-hindu-gods-1571d00214a0bb7c6027f674ec646c92	2024-10-10T20:36:14-07:00	
Israel's airstrike warnings terrify and confuse Lebanese civilians	BEIRUT (AP) — As the war between Israel and Hezbollah intensifies, Lebanese civilians are increasingly paying the price – and this dangerous reality often becomes clear in the middle of the night: That’s when the Israeli military typically warns people to evacuate buildings or neighborhoods to avoid airstrikes. Moein Shreif was recently awakened at 3 a.m. by a neighbor calling to alert him that Israel planned to strike a nearby building in his middle-class suburb south of Beirut where Hezbollah has a strong presence. Shreif, his wife and their three children quickly fled their multi-story apartment building and drove away. Within minutes, explosions rang out, he said later that day upon returning to see the smoldering ruins of his building and the one next door. 'I didn’t even have time to dress properly, as you can see,' said Shreif, a well-known Lebanese folk and pop singer who was still wearing his pajamas from the night before. 'I didn’t take anything out of the house.' Israel and Hezbollah have been exchanging strikes nearly every day since the start of the war in Gaza. Hezbollah says it will fire rockets into Israel until there's a cease-fire in Gaza; Israel says its fighting to stop those attacks, which have forced tens of thousands of Israelis from their homes. But it wasn’t until late last month, when Israel dramatically expanded its aerial campaign against Hezbollah, that Lebanese people began receiving regular warnings about upcoming airstrikes. Human rights groups say Israel's warnings — which aren't issued before many airstrikes — are inadequate and sometimes misleading. On Sept. 23, Israel made 80,000 calls into Lebanon, according to Imad Kreidieh, head of the country’s telecommunications company – presumably recorded warnings about upcoming airstrikes. The calls caused panic. Schools shut down. People rushed home early from work. It ended up being the deadliest day of airstrikes in Lebanon in decades, with over 500 people killed — roughly one quarter of all those killed in Lebanon the past year, according to the country’s Health Ministry. Women and children make up one quarter of all the deaths, the ministry says. Israel has issued warnings on social media nearly every day since then. On Oct. 1, 27 villages in southern Lebanon were told to evacuate to the north of the Awali River, dozens of kilometers (miles) away. 'Save your lives,' the instructions said. That is when Salam, a 42-year-old mother of two, fled the village of Ain Ebel. She and her family are now staying with relatives in Beirut. Salam refused to give her full name for fear of reprisals. So far, Ain Ebel – a mostly Christian village – hasn’t been bombarded, although surrounding villages whose residents are predominantly Shiite Muslims have been. Salam's teenage children are terrified of going home, especially since Israel launched a ground invasion. Salam is still baffled and angry that her village was evacuated. So far, evacuation notices in Lebanon have been far more limited than in Gaza, but the messages in both places have a common theme. In Gaza, Israel says it is targeting Hamas militants embedded among Gaza's civilians. In Lebanon, it warns of similar behavior by Hezbollah, a Hamas ally. Most of the Israeli military's warnings first appear on the social media accounts of its Arabic spokesperson. They are then amplified by the Lebanese media. The warnings instruct people to vacate homes 'immediately,' and they are usually followed by a series of overnight strikes that often cause damage in areas beyond those that were warned. Israel says it is targeting Hezbollah fighters, weapons or other assets belonging to the group. Warnings are rarely issued before daytime strikes. The Lebanese government says at least 1.2 million people have been displaced by the war, the vast majority since Israel ramped up airstrikes across the country last month. Over 800 of some 1,000 shelters are over capacity. One quarter of Lebanese territory is now under Israeli military displacement orders, according to the U.N.'s human rights division. 'Calling on residents of nearly 30 villages to leave ‘immediately’ is not effective and unlawfully suggests that civilians who do not leave an area will be deemed to be combatants,' said Ramzi Kaiss, a researcher for Human Rights Watch in Beirut. Kaiss said Israel — which usually issues warnings 30 to 90 minutes ahead of airstrikes — is obligated to protect civilians who refuse to evacuate, or who are physically unable to. Amnesty International is also critical of Israel's practice of warning entire towns and villages to evacuate. It 'raises questions around whether this is intended to create the conditions for mass displacement,' Agnes Callamard, the group's secretary general said in a statement on Thursday. The Israeli military didn’t respond to a request for comment. It has previously said it makes a significant effort to save civilian lives with its warnings. For almost a year, Israel’s strikes were mostly concentrated in communities along the border, far from the capital and its populous suburbs. But now people who once felt relatively safe in the outskirts of Beirut are increasingly at risk, and their neighborhoods are receiving a small but growing share of airstrike warnings. In Shreif’s case, he said his neighbor called about five minutes after the Israeli military issued a warning on the social media platform X. Shreif considers himself lucky: If it wasn’t for that wake-up call, his family might not be alive. The AP could not determine whether any people were killed or injured in the strike that destroyed Shreif's building or the one next door. To the northeast of Beirut, in the Bekaa Valley, Israel recently issued a warning to people to stay at least 1,000 meters (yards) away from their town or village if they are in or a near a home that has weapons belonging to Hezbollah. Some of the warnings have come in the form of animated videos. One shows an elderly woman in a kitchen, suggesting she is unaware of hidden rooms and compartments in her own house that contain weapons for Hezbollah. 'Didn’t you know?' the narrator says in Arabic, as the elderly woman discovers rockets under the couch, behind the shower curtains and elsewhere. The video warns viewers to leave their homes immediately if they – or their neighbors – discover weapons. But in many cases there are no warnings at all. Last month, in Ain el-Delb near the southern city of Sidon, an Israeli airstrike hit a residential building, burying about 70 people under the rubble. Achraf Ramadan, 34, and his father were among the lucky one who rescue workers were able to pull out alive. His mother was taken to the hospital alive, but she later died from her wounds. His younger sister Julia, a public relations professional in her late 20s, was found dead. Achraf and Julia together had been leading initiatives to support displaced Lebanese families in and around Sidon. 'This is a nice and peaceful neighborhood,' Ramadan said, sounding dejected. 'The international community is asleep and not taking initiative. On the contrary, I think it's giving Israel an excuse for its barbarity on the pretext of self-defense.' ___ Associated Press writers Fadi Tawil in Beirut, Julia Frankel in Jerusalem, and Zeina Karam in London, contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-lebanon-hezbollah-evacuation-warnings-war-d131e6f7043623bc109eab768decc2a1	2024-10-10T20:04:38-07:00	
AP PHOTOS: A look at life inside Paraguay's overcrowded prisons	ASUNCION, Paraguay (AP) — Paraguay a few months ago launched an operation to address some of the many problems plaguing its prison system, including internal gang control, but one problem in particular has proven difficult to deal with: overcrowding. The South American nation has 18 prisons with a capacity for almost 10,000 inmates, but the current population exceeds 17,600, according to the latest figures provided by authorities which go until the end of 2023. A country of more than 6 million inhabitants, Paraguay is considered a regional drug trafficking hub. An Associated Press photographer recently had access to five different prisons — four male facilities and one for women — to see how their inmates live. With the exception of the female detention center, overcrowding was common. One of the penitentiaries the AP visited was Tacumbú, the largest prison in Paraguay, which authorities raided nine months ago in an effort to regain control from the Rotela clan — a gang that has extended its presence onto Paraguay's streets and into some of its prisons. The police operation ended with a dozen people dead, several injured and the relocation of 700 inmates to other lockups. Inside the prison, cells designed to hold five inmates hold more than 15. Prisoners often sleep on thin mattresses on the floor and hang towels in an attempt at privacy. They look for ways to spend their time. The facilities the AP visited were minimum-security prisons, so inmates interact more freely. But for those who break the rules, there are cells in an isolated area where they are held without visitors. Inside 'El Buen Pastor,' or Good Shepherd, female prison, things look cleaner and less crowded than in the men's facilities. Any given day, in prisons like Tacumbú, there are stretching sessions in open areas or religious ceremonies. Some inmates play soccer while others prefer bingo. Some try to earn money and shine the guards shoes for 30 cents. There are no dining areas, so inmates eat in their cells or in hallways. On cold days, prisoners are allowed to make a fire in the patios to keep warm. Atiliano Cuyer, 64, was detained for domestic violence and says he's been waiting for 10 months for a trial inside the Coronel Oviedo regional penitentiary. 'Justice in Paraguay doesn't work if you don't have money,' he adds.	https://apnews.com/article/paraguay-prisons-photo-gallery-2c58be3819606a99950302574773a06f	2024-10-10T19:26:52-07:00	
Stock market today: Wall Street rises toward records as banks rally and Tesla tumbles	NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks are rising toward records Friday as big banks rally on a rush of reassuring profit reports. The S&amp;P 500 was 0.4% higher in afternoon trading and on track to top its all-time high set earlier this week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 268 points, or 0.6%, and also heading toward a record, as of 12:56 p.m. Eastern time. The Nasdaq composite was lagging the market with a gain of 0.2% after a slide for Tesla kept it in check. Wells Fargo jumped 6% after reporting stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. It benefited from better results from its venture-capital investments and higher fees for investment-banking services, among other things. Banks and other financial giants traditionally kick off each earnings reporting season, and BlackRock and Bank of New York Mellon also climbed after delivering results that topped analysts’ forecasts. BlackRock, the investment giant, said it ended the summer managing a record $11.5 trillion in total assets for its customers. JPMorgan Chase, the nation's biggest bank, rose 4.9% and was the strongest single force pushing upward on the S&amp;P 500 after it reported a milder drop in profit than analysts feared. CEO Jamie Dimon said the bank is still buying back shares of its stock to send cash to investors, but the pace is modest 'given that market levels are at least slightly inflated.' The gains for banks helped make up for the drag of Tesla, which tumbled 7.7% and was the heaviest weight on the market. The electric-vehicle maker unveiled its long-awaited robotaxi on Thursday night, but critics highlighted a lack of details about its planned rollout. Following the unveiling of the 'Cybercab,' potential rival Uber Technologies jumped 9.6% and was one of the strongest forces lifting the S&amp;P 500. Lyft rose even more, 10.1%. Another automaker, Stellantis, saw its European-traded shares sink 2.8% after it announced some significant leadership changes, including the timing of CEO Carlos Tavares’ retirement. Its chief financial officer is also departing as the company formed by the merger of PSA Peugeot and Fiat Chrysler struggles to revive sales in North America. In the bond market, Treasury yields were holding relatively steady after the latest updates on inflation at the wholesale level and on sentiment among U.S. consumers. Prices paid by producers were 1.8% higher in September than a year earlier. That was an improvement from August’s year-over-year inflation level, but not as much as economists expected. Analysts said it likely helped calm worries stirred a day earlier, when a separate report showed inflation at the consumer level wasn’t cooling as quickly as economists expected. A separate report suggested sentiment among U.S. consumers is weakening by more than economists feared. But the preliminary reading's decline was still within the margin of error, according to Joanne Hsu, director of the University of Michigan's Surveys of Consumers. After Friday’s reports, traders were holding onto their bets that the Federal Reserve would cut its main interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point at its next meeting, according to data from CME Group. They've pared back their expectations from earlier this month, when some were betting on the possibility for another larger-than-usual cut of half a percentage point in November. A run of stronger-than-expected data on the economy wiped out such calls. Regardless of how much the Fed cuts rates by at its next meeting, the longer-term trend for interest rates is still downward, according to Solita Marcelli, chief investment officer Americas, at UBS Global Wealth Management. That should benefit stock prices generally. The Fed last month cut its main interest rate from a two-decade high as it widens its focus to include keeping the economy humming instead of just fighting high inflation. The yield on the 10-year Treasury was holding at 4.07%, where it was late Thursday. The two-year yield, which more closely tracks expectations for the Fed’s upcoming moves, edged down to 3.93% from 3.96%. In markets abroad, stocks fell 2.5% in Shanghai for their latest sharp swing ahead of a briefing scheduled for Saturday by China’s Finance Ministry. Investors hope it will unveil a big stimulus plan for the world's second-largest economy. South Korea's Kospi slipped 0.1% after its central bank cut interest rates for the first time in more than four years in hopes of boosting its economy. ___ AP Business Writers Matt Ott and Zimo Zhong contributed.	https://apnews.com/article/stock-market-china-stimulus-fed-korea-rates-7dfc363b1ff32e71a335571cdf8325fb	2024-10-10T19:16:31-07:00	
Migration through Darien Gap increased in September, led by Venezuelans after the election	PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) — The number of migrants crossing the Darien Gap — a rugged jungle passage between Colombia and Panama — increased sharply in September, according to Panamanian government data, and a human rights organization says there’s less capacity to assist migrants. Venezuelans have led mass migration through the Darien since 2022, and make up much of the increase since that country's recent controversial presidential election. 'The crackdown in the wake of the July 28, 2024 elections in Venezuela has led to an increase in immigration,' Refugees International said in a report published Friday. The report was based on dozens of interviews with migrants at reception stations in Panama and Costa Rica. More than half a million migrants, a record number, crossed the Darien in 2023. More than 65% of them were Venezuelan. Panamanian President José Raúl Mulino, who took office on July 1, promised to curb migration by closing several access points. He also said he would implement a repatriation program with the help of the United States, which has so far added flights to Colombia, Ecuador, and India. The U.S. government agreed to pay for deportation flights for those migrants deemed inadmissible. The plan has not been applied to Venezuelan migrants because Panama, like neighboring Costa Rica, suspended its relations with Caracas after refusing to recognize the electoral victory claimed by Nicolás Maduro. Flights between the two nations are paralyzed. As of Oct. 7, the number of migrants who had crossed through the Darien this year was 277,939 or 36% less than the same period in 2023, according to the Panamanian Ministry of Security. However, the same data showed a sharp increase in September compared to August. Records show that 25,111 migrants crossed last month, 51% more than in August with more than 80% of them Venezuelans. The numbers also included Colombians, Ecuadorians, Chinese and dozens of other nationalities. 'The (migratory) measures and the rhetoric from the Panamanian government could have temporarily discouraged migration, but not in the long-term,' said the organization. 'When they exit Darien, migrants encounter less humanitarian aid in Panama,' the report said. 'For those who aren’t Venezuelan they encounter the threat of deportation.' Refugees International said this is due in part to the suspension of Doctors Without Borders (MSF) in early March by the previous Panamanian administration. The organization provided humanitarian aid to migrants, but was suspended because of an expired agreement with the country's Ministry of Health. MSF had suggested that the suspension was in retaliation for multiple accusations made against Panamanian authorities for not addressing unprecedented rates of sexual violence in the Darien during the first months of 2024, according to the report. MSF informed the AP on Thursday that it has resumed its activities since last week at the Lajas Blancas reception station after Panamanian authorities approved a three-month medical intervention. MSF said that from January 2023 to February 2024 it provided more than 72,700 migrants with medical care. ___ Follow AP's Latin America coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america	https://apnews.com/article/darien-gap-panama-venezuelan-migrants-4a385db728c922525d9addbc2577bc42	2024-10-10T19:14:38-07:00

Blinken tells ASEAN the US is worried about China's 'dangerous' actions in disputed sea	VIENTIANE, Laos (AP) — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken told Southeast Asian leaders Friday that the U.S. is concerned about China's 'increasingly dangerous and unlawful' activities in the disputed South China Sea during an annual summit meeting, and pledged the U.S. will continue to uphold freedom of navigation in the vital sea trade route. The 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations’ meeting with Blinken followed a series of violent confrontations at sea between China and ASEAN members Philippines and Vietnam, which have fueled concerns that China’s increasingly assertive actions in the waterways could spiral into a full-scale conflict. China, which claims almost the entire sea, has overlapping claims with ASEAN members Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia and Brunei, as well as Taiwan. About a third of global trade transits through the sea, which is also rich in fishing stocks, gas and oil. Beijing has refused to recognize a 2016 international arbitration ruling by a U.N.-affiliated court in the Hague that invalidated its expansive claims, and has built up and militarized islands it controls. 'We are very concerned about China’s increasingly dangerous and unlawful activities in the South China Sea which have injured people, harm vessels from ASEAN nations and contradict commitments to peaceful resolutions of disputes,' said Blinken, who is filling in for President Joe Biden, in his opening speech at the U.S.-ASEAN summit. 'The United States will continue to support freedom of navigation, and freedom of overflight in the Indo Pacific.' The U.S. has no claims in the South China Sea, but has deployed navy ships and fighter jets to patrol the waters in a challenge to China’s claims. Chinese and Philippine vessels have clashed repeatedly this year, and Vietnam said last week that Chinese forces assaulted its fishermen in the disputed sea. China has also sent patrol vessels to areas that Indonesia and Malaysia claim as exclusive economic zones. The U.S. has warned repeatedly that it’s obligated to defend the Philippines — its oldest treaty ally in Asia — if Filipino forces, ships or aircraft come under armed attack, including in the South China Sea. Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. complained to summit leaders on Thursday that his country 'continues to be subject to harassment and intimidation' by China. He said it was 'regrettable that the overall situation in the South China Sea remains tense and unchanged' due to China’s actions, which he said violated international law. He has called for more urgency in ASEAN-China negotiations on a code of conduct to govern the South China Sea. Singaporean leader Lawrence Wong earlier this week warned of 'real risks of an accident spiraling into conflict' if the sea dispute isn't addressed. Malaysia, who takes over the rotating ASEAN chair next year, is expected to push to accelerate talks on the code of conduct. Officials have agreed to try and complete the code by 2026, but talks have been hampered by sticky issues including disagreements over whether the pact should be binding. Chinese Premier Li Qiang was defiant during talks on Thursday. He called South China Sea a 'shared home' but repeated China’s assertion that it was merely protecting its sovereign rights, officials said. Li also blamed meddling by 'external forces' who sought to 'introduce bloc confrontation and geopolitical conflicts into Asia.' Li didn’t name the foreign forces, but China has previously warned the U.S. not to meddle in the region’s territorial disputes. In another firm message to China, Blinken said the U.S. believed 'it is also important to maintain our shared commitment to protect stability across the Taiwan Strait.' China claims the self-ruled island of Taiwan as its own territory and bristles at other countries’ patrolling the body of water separating it from the island. Blinken also attended an 18-nation East Asia Summit, along with the Chinese premier, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, and leaders from Japan, South Korea, India, Australia and New Zealand. ASEAN has treaded carefully on the sea dispute with China, which is the bloc's largest trading partner and its third largest investor. It hasn't marred trade relations, with the two sides focusing on expanding a free trade area covering a market of 2 billion people. Blinken said the annual ASEAN summit talks were a platform to address other shared challenges including the civil war in Myanmar, North Korea’s 'destabilizing behavior' and Russia’s war aggression in Ukraine. He said the U.S. remained the top foreign investor in the region, and aims to strengthen its partnership with ASEAN.	https://apnews.com/article/asean-us-china-south-china-sea-blinken-12e98754ad3ece4932254b8a869c02ec	2024-10-10T18:29:17-07:00	
Gunmen kill 20 miners in an attack in southwest Pakistan ahead of an Asian security summit	QUETTA, Pakistan (AP) — Gunmen killed 20 miners and wounded another seven in Pakistan’s southwest, a police official said Friday, drawing condemnation from authorities who have ordered police to trace and arrest those who are behind the killings. It’s the latest attack in restive Balochistan province and comes days ahead of a major security summit being hosted in the capital. Police official Hamayun Khan Nasir said the gunmen stormed the accommodations at the coal mine in Duki district late Thursday night, rounded up the men and opened fire. Most of the men were from Pashtun-speaking areas of Balochistan. Three of the dead and four of the wounded were Afghan. No group claimed immediate responsibility for the attack, but the suspicion is likely to fall on the outlawed Baloch Liberation Army, which often targets civilians and security forces. The group committed multiple attacks in August that killed more than 50 people, while authorities responded by killing 21 insurgents in the province. Those killed included 23 passengers, mostly from eastern Punjab province, who were fatally shot after being taken from buses, vehicles and trucks in Musakhail district in Baluchistan. The latest attack drew a strong condemnation from the country's Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi and Sarfraz Bugti, the chief minister in Balochistan, who said the 'terrorists have once again targeted poor laborers.' He said the attackers were cruel and had an agenda to destabilize Pakistan. 'The killing of these innocent laborers would be avenged,' he said in a statement. Naqvi also said those who killed the laborers would not be able to escape from the grip of the law. The province is home to several separatist groups who want independence. They accuse the federal government in Islamabad of unfairly exploiting oil- and mineral-rich Balochistan at the expense of locals. On Monday, a group called the Baloch Liberation Army said it carried out an attack on Chinese nationals outside Pakistan's biggest airport. There are thousands of Chinese working in the country, most of them involved in Beijing’s multibillion-dollar Belt and Road Initiative. The explosion, which the BLA said was the work of a suicide bomber, also raised questions about the ability of Pakistani forces to protect high-profile events or foreigners in the country. Islamabad is hosting a summit next week of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, a grouping founded by China and Russia to counter Western alliances. Authorities have beefed up security in the capital by deploying troops to prevent any acts of terrorism. The Ministry of Interior this week had alerted the country's four provinces to take additional measures to enhance security as the separatist groups and Pakistani Taliban could launch attacks at public places and government installation. The killings of miners came hours Saudi and Pakistani businessmen signed 27 memorandums of understanding valued at $2 billion for investment across various sectors, including mining in oil and gas rich Balochistan. Pakistan’s Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif attended the signing of the memorandums in the capital, Islamabad. Saudi Arabia also wants to invest in Reko Diq, district in Balochistan which famed for its mineral wealth, including gold and copper. Baluchistan’s Gwardar port is an anchor in the China Pakistan Economic Corridor, part of Beijing’s vast Belt and Road infrastructure initiative, and BLA has asked the Chinese to leave the province to avoid attacks. ____ Associated Press writer Munir Ahmed contributed to this story from Islamabad.	https://apnews.com/article/pakistan-miners-killed-b4302a6af4888c009212bea622f76679	2024-10-10T17:48:09-07:00	
South Korea's central bank cuts rates in a bid to boost the economy	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea’s central bank on Friday cut its policy rate for the first time in more than four years as pressure to revive a sluggish economy outweighed concerns about the country’s level of household debt. The Bank of Korea lowered its key interest rate by a quarter percentage point to 3.25% following a meeting of its monetary policy committee, in its first move to lower borrowing costs since May 2020, when the economy was weathering the COVID-19 pandemic. The bank raised the rate by a quarter percentage point in August 2021 over concerns about inflation and soaring household debt, driven in part by skyrocketing house prices, and then froze rates for over three years. The bank said in a statement that domestic demand is making a slow recovery, bogging down the pace of economic growth. It said there was room for a rate cut because inflation is showing signs of stabilizing and household debt is also increasing more slowly as the housing market in the greater Seoul area cools down. At a news conference, central bank Governor Rhee Chang-yong said there’s still capacity in the economy for additional cuts, pointing out that house prices in the capital area grew by two thirds less in September than in August. The country’s consumer price inflation also eased to 1.6% in September, below the policy target of 2%. However, Rhee said it’s still too soon to conclude that the country’s financial situation is stabilizing and indicated that the bank would be conservative about further rate cuts. 'We will decide after monitoring the stability in financial markets,' said Lee. He said the bank’s latest step could be interpreted as a 'hawkish cut,' meaning that it still favors tighter monetary conditions. Alarmed by slowing growth, government officials have called for the bank to lower borrowing costs. During a parliamentary hearing, South Korean finance minister Choi Sang-mok told lawmakers that he 'respects and welcomes' the rate cut. South Korea’s trade-dependent economy is facing increasing uncertainties, including the growing crisis in the Middle East that could potentially influence fuel prices, exchange rates and public utility prices, the bank said. 'The future path of economic growth is likely to be influenced by the pace of recovery in domestic demand, economic conditions in major countries and trends in information-technology exports,' the bank said. 'The growth in house prices in the metropolitan area and household debt is expected to gradually slow down due to the strengthening of macroprudential policies,' aimed at maintaining the stability of the financial system, the bank said. 'However, there’s still a need to monitor related risks, such as the impact the lowered base interest rate may have on household debt.' The bank projects South Korea’s economy to grow at 2.4% this year, down from 2.6% in 2023. Household loans issued by banks were measured at around 1,135.7 trillion won ($841 billion) at the end of September after growing by about 5.7% during the month, compared to a 9.2% increase in August. While the country’s exports have been gradually improving, job growth remains sluggish, due to weakness in construction industries and other sectors, the bank said. ___ The headline of this story has been edited to reflect that the central bank cut, not raised, its policy interest rate.	https://apnews.com/article/south-korea-rate-cut-central-bank-economy-66f3bdd72aae9910f072b08f901b711f	2024-10-10T17:28:17-07:00	
New Zealand ship didn’t sink because its captain was a woman, the ‘appalled’ defense minister says	WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — New Zealand's defense minister issued stinging rebukes of what she said were 'vile' and 'misogynistic' online remarks by 'armchair admirals' about the woman captain of a navy ship that ran aground, caught fire and sank off the coast of Samoa. 'Seriously, it’s 2024,' Judith Collins told reporters Thursday. 'What the hell’s going on here?' After days of comments on social media directed at the gender of Commander Yvonne Gray, Collins urged the public to 'be better.' Women members of the military had also faced verbal abuse in the street in New Zealand since the ship — one of nine in the country's navy — was lost on Sunday, Collins said. All 75 people on board evacuated to safety with only minor injuries after the vessel ran aground on the reef it was surveying about a mile off the coast of Upolu, Samoa's most populous island. The cause of the disaster is not known. 'The one thing that we already know did not cause it is the gender of the ship's captain, a woman with 30 years' naval experience who on the night made the call to get her people to safety,' Collins said. One of the posters was a truck driver from Melbourne, Australia, she added. 'I think that he should keep his comments to people who drive trucks rather than people who drive ships,' Collins said. 'These are the sorts of people I'm calling out and I'm happy to keep calling them out for as long as it takes to stop this behavior.' About 20% of New Zealand’s uniformed military members are women. Collins is New Zealand's first woman defence minister and said she stood alongside Gray and Maj. Gen. Rose King, the country's first woman army chief, who assumed her role in June. 'We are all appointed on merit, not gender,' said Collins. The sinking prompted fears of a major fuel spill. On Thursday, officials in Samoa said while the vessel was leaking oil from three places, the amount was reducing each day and was dissipating quickly due to strong winds in the area. Most of the ship's fuel appeared to have burned out in the fire, according to a statement by the Marine Pollution Advisory Committee. Officials were due to meet with locals Thursday to discuss how to remove the vessel's anchor and three shipping containers from the reef without further damaging the fragile marine ecosystem. New Zealand’s government has ordered a military court of inquiry into the episode, which will be led by senior military officers. It will assemble for the first time on Friday. Passengers, including civilian scientists and foreign military personnel, left the vessel on life boats in 'challenging conditions' and darkness, New Zealand’s Chief of Navy Rear Admiral Garin Golding told reporters after the sinking. Those on board have since returned to New Zealand by plane. The specialist dive and hydrographic vessel had been in service for New Zealand since 2019, but was 20 years old and had previously belonged to Norway. The military said the ship, purchased for $100 million NZ dollars ($61 million), was not covered by replacement insurance. The state of New Zealand’s aging military hardware has prompted warnings from the defense agency, which in a March report described the navy as 'extremely fragile,' with ships idle due to problems retaining the staff needed to service and maintain them. Of the navy’s eight remaining ships, five are currently operational. Golding said the HMNZS Manawanui underwent a maintenance period before the deployment.	https://apnews.com/article/zealand-navy-ship-sexism-woman-commander-samoa-778b42dcefe5adc252673fd16cf41372	2024-10-10T14:01:08-07:00	
A new mayor takes office in southern Mexico after his predecessor was beheaded	CHILPANCINGO, Mexico (AP) — A new mayor was sworn in Thursday in a city in southern Mexico where his predecessor was killed and beheaded less than a week after taking office. The new mayor, Gustavo Alarcón, a doctor, had been elected as an alternate on the same ticket as deceased Mayor Alejandro Arcos in the June election. Arcos took office on Oct. 1 in the violence-wracked city of Chilpancingo, the capital of the southern state of Guerrero. But his beheaded body was found in a pickup truck Sunday; his head had been placed on the vehicle's roof. Two rival drug gangs are fighting to control the city. Alarcón took the oath of office with a minimal security detail of a handful of police officers Thursday. He pledged to 'work for the good of all' and fight the violence that has gripped Chilpancingo for years. Before he was killed, Arcos had told local media he needed more protection, but officials said no formal request had been received. State and federal governments can offer mayors bulletproof vehicles, additional bodyguards and emergency alert systems. It was not clear if Alarcón had been granted that kind of protection. Chilpancingo, a city of about 300,000, is dominated by two warring drug gangs, the Ardillos and the Tlacos. One staged a demonstration of hundreds of people, hijacked a government armored car, blocked a major highway and took police hostage in 2023 to win the release of arrested suspects. Earlier this week, federal Public Safety Secretary Omar García Harfuch said four mayors from other towns in Mexico had requested protection on Monday, a day after Arcos’ remains were found. The requests came from Guerrero and another violence-plagued state, Guanajuato. The situation in Guanajuato is so bad that ahead of the country’s June elections, at least four mayoral candidates were killed. But violence in Guerrero reached such unprecedented levels that earlier this year, Roman Catholic bishops announced they had helped arrange a truce in another part of the state between two warring drug cartels. At the time, former president Andrés Manuel López Obrador— who refused to confront the gangs — said he approved of such talks. 'Priests and pastors and members of all the churches have participated, helped in pacifying the country. I think it is very good,' said López Obrador, who left office Sept. 30. ____ Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america	https://apnews.com/article/mexico-mayor-beheading-cartel-violence-guerrero-3c6de2e059d6c1a706508a2ac814d7c7	2024-10-10T13:33:11-07:00

AP PHOTOS: Powerful Hurricane Milton destroys homes, shreds stadium roofs apart	Many Florida residents were returning to their homes Thursday after Hurricane Milton pummelled the state, the second major hurricane in two weeks. Millions of people in several counties had been ordered to evacuate earlier this week as Milton approached. In Palmetto, southwest of Tampa, resident Natasha Ducre and her family of seven returned from a government shelter to find their home demolished and unlivable — furniture and other belongings destroyed by heavy rainwater. The roof in her kitchen had collapsed, with debris now carpeting the floor. Their home destroyed, siblings Saboria, 4, and Messiah Tyler, 3, had nowhere to sleep but the backseat of a car. Farther north in St. Petersburg, powerful winds and rain shredded the roof of the Tropicana Field Stadium, home to the Tampa Bay Rays of Major League Baseball, where several stadium workers were taking shelter. The team said it may take weeks to fully assess how much damage was done. Milton slammed into Florida as a Category 3 storm on Wednesday, killing at least 5 people, spawning tornadoes and leaving more than 3 million homes and businesses without power. The state’s central Gulf Coast was hardest hit by the outages, including Hardee, Sarasota, Hillsborough and Manatee counties. The storm came after Hurricane Helene ravaged several southeastern states as a Category 4 storm, killing more than 220 people. ___ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

TD Bank to pay $3 billion in historic money-laundering settlement with the Justice Department	WASHINGTON (AP) — TD Bank will pay approximately $3 billion in a historic settlement with U.S. authorities who said Thursday that the financial institution's lax practices allowed significant money laundering over multiple years. Canada-based TD Bank pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit money laundering, the largest bank in U.S. history to do so, Attorney General Merrick Garland said. 'TD Bank created an environment that allowed financial crime to flourish,' Garland said. 'By making its services convenient for criminals, it became one.' High-level executives were alerted to serious problems with the bank’s anti-money laundering program, but failed to correct them as employees openly joked about how easy it seemed to be for criminals to launder money there, Garland said. The bank is the 10th largest in the United States, and its CEO said the company takes full responsibility and has been cooperating with the investigation. It's been taking steps to fix its U.S. anti-money laundering program, including appointing new leadership and adding hundreds of new specialists, said TD Bank Group CEO Bharat Masrani. 'We know what the issues are, we are fixing them. As we move forward, we’re ensuring that this never happens again,' Masrani said. 'And I’m 100% confident that we get to the other side and emerge even stronger.' The Justice Department said the bank allowed at least three different money laundering networks to move a total of $670 million through TD Bank accounts over a period of several years. The institution became the bank of choice for multiple criminals and money laundering organizations, authorities said. 'From fentanyl and narcotics trafficking, to terrorist financing and human trafficking, TD Bank’s chronic failures provided fertile ground for a host of illicit activity to penetrate our financial system,' said Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Wally Adeyemo. In one case, a man moved more than $470 million in drug proceeds and other illicit funds through TD Bank branches, bribing employees with more than $57,000 in gift cards. He chose TD Bank because it had the 'most permissive policies,' more than once depositing more than $1 million in cash in a single day and then moving the funds out of the bank with checks or wire transfers, Garland said. It continued despite employees expressing concern about what he was doing. There were also piles of cash dumped on a bank’s counters and ATM withdrawals that totaled 40 times to 50 times higher than the daily limits, said Philip Sellinger, U.S. attorney in New Jersey. In a separate scheme, five employees worked with criminal organizations to open and maintain accounts that were used to launder $39 million to Colombia, including drug proceeds, Garland said. There were also multiple red flags in that case, including that the same Venezuelan passports were used to open multiple accounts, but the bank did not identify the problem until one of the employees was arrested. In a third scheme, a money laundering network had accounts for at least five shell companies that moved more than $100 million in illicit funds, but the bank did not file a required suspicious activity report until law enforcement alerted it. The bank's 'long-term, pervasive, and systemic deficiencies' in its policies over a period of nine years allowed such abuses to flourish, prosecutors said. Two dozen people have been prosecuted for involvement in money-laundering schemes, including two TD Bank employees, Garland said. The investigation is ongoing. The bank has also agreed to major restructuring of the corporate compliance program in its U.S. operations, as well as three years of monitoring and five years of probation. ____ Associated Press writer Alanna Durkin Richer contributed to this story.	https://apnews.com/article/td-bank-money-laundering-justice-department-75426a569d40174fd61fa7bc83026176	2024-10-10T08:59:01-07:00	
Donald Trump rolls out tax breaks, but no specifics, for overseas citizens and auto buyers	DETROIT (AP) — Donald Trump on Thursday rolled out more plans for tax breaks without offering details on how they would work or how they'd affect the federal budget. Trump vowed in a speech at the Detroit Economic Club to allow interest on car loans to be deducted from taxes, saying the proposal would 'stimulate massive domestic auto production' and make car ownership more affordable. In a video, also released Thursday, he proposes to grant a key tax break to U.S. citizens living overseas to end so-called double taxation. Trump has offered a series of tax breaks over the last several months to appeal to specific groups he's courting in the election: tipped and hourly workers, Social Security recipients, and now car buyers who have experienced sticker shock as well as Americans who live and vote abroad. In a tight race with Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump is betting that his targeted no-tax pledges will appeal to enough voters in key battlegrounds. But so far, the Republican nominee has been vague about how those tax breaks would work or how he would pay for them — other than promising that his plans to impose sweeping tariffs would bring in new government revenue. Economic analyses of his earlier tax cut ideas estimated they would cost between nearly $6 trillion and $10 trillion over 10 years, depending on which proposals become policy and how they’re implemented. And mainstream economists warn that Trump's tariff plans — and the expected retaliation from targeted countries — would raise prices for Americans, slash more than a percentage point off the U.S. economy by 2026 and make inflation 2 percentage points higher next year than it otherwise would have been. The proposal to make interest on car loans tax deductible is intended to help buyers struggling with the increase in car prices. Since inflation took off in early 2021, the average price of a new car has jumped nearly 18%, though that has fallen compared with a year ago. Used car prices are up 13%. At the same time, the Federal Reserve’s interest rate increases, intended to combat inflation, have pushed auto-loan rates much higher. The average rate on a five-year car loan reached 8.4% in this year’s third quarter, up from 4.5% two years ago, when the Fed’s rate hikes began. Marc Goldwein, senior vice president at the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said a rough estimate of the impact of Trump’s proposals for overseas citizens and auto buyers would be to reduce tax revenues by more than $100 billion over 10 years. If the car-loans proposal does operate like the deduction for mortgage interest, as Trump suggested, then only the one-fifth of taxpayers who itemize their deductions would be able to take advantage of it, Goldwein said. Trump's promise to help U.S. citizens living abroad concerns policies that can require Americans to pay taxes in the country where they reside and to the U.S. government. The U.S. has bilateral agreements with some nations that ease the burden in some cases. The proposal was first released by a group called Republicans Overseas. 'You have to make sure that you are registered and you are going to vote, because I'm going to take very good care of you,' Trump says in the video statement the overseas group's CEO, Solomon Yue, posted to his account on X. 'Once and for all, I'm going to end double taxation on our overseas citizens,' Trump said. 'You've been wanting this for years, and nobody has listened to you. And you deserve it. And I'm going to do it.' The overseas tax breaks could also end up favoring some wealthy citizens, because it could open more opportunities for them to live abroad in low-tax countries and avoid U.S. taxes. Yue praised Trump for his commitment. 'Republicans Overseas has been fighting for the rights of Americans abroad since its inception ten years ago,' Yue said in a statement. 'We have spoken to many politicians over the years, and while they sympathized with the burden of double taxation, very few have been willing to act.' The former president's embrace of U.S citizens living abroad comes after statements lumping those voters in with his unfounded accusations that Democrats plan to commit widespread fraud in the 2024 election. 'The Democrats are talking about how they’re working so hard to get millions of votes from Americans living overseas,' Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform Sept. 23. 'Actually, they are getting ready to CHEAT!' He argued that efforts to make it easier for overseas citizens to vote would 'dilute' the votes of military service members who Trump believes will favor him over Democratic nominee Kamala Harris. 'WATCH! Remember, IF YOU VOTE ILLEGALLY,' he threatened, 'YOU’RE GOING TO JAIL.' Paulina Salzeider, 47, who attended the speech on Thursday, works as a barber and supports Trump’s tax cuts and plan to exclude tips from federal taxes. 'In our business, I mean we depend on tips,' she said. 'In the service industry, the nicer you are, the kinder you are, the friendlier you are, you get rewarded by tips. So I feel that we deserve it.' But Curtis Lyons, a financial adviser from Detroit who is a Democrat and was also at the Thursday event, said he believes Trump’s tax cuts in his first administration did more harm than good and only benefited the wealthier. 'I’m not going to be voting for our guest,' he said. 'I’m just here to see and be entertained.' ___ Barrow reported from Atlanta and Gomez Licon reported from Fort Lauderdale, Fla.

South Koreans are joyful after Han Kang wins Nobel Prize for literature	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Koreans reacted with joy and astonishment on Thursday after learning that homegrown writer Han Kang won the Nobel Prize in literature, an unexpected moment that stoked national pride about the country’s growing cultural influence. Han, known for her experimental and often disturbing stories that explore human traumas and violence and incorporate the brutal moments of South Korea’s modern history, is the country’s first writer to win the preeminent award in world literature. Han's triumph adds to the growing global influence of South Korean culture, which in recent years included the successes of director Bong Joon-ho’s Oscar-winning 'Parasite,' the brutal Netflix survival drama 'Squid Game' and K-pop groups like BTS and BLACKPINK. 'I’m so surprised and honored,' Han, 53, said in a telephone interview posted on the X account of the Nobel Prize. As the news spread in South Korea, some online bookstores temporarily froze following a sudden jump in traffic. South Korean social media were flooded with jubilant messages expressing admiration and pride. Some internet users found it meaningful that Han was the first Asian woman to win the award and portrayed it as a statement toward the country’s traditionally male-dominated literature scene. 'It’s always the women who do the big things,' one Facebook user wrote. In South Korea’s parliament, multiple government hearings were paused as lawmakers cheered and applauded Han’s award. While visiting Laos for a meeting of Asian leaders, South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol issued a statement, congratulating Han on her award, calling it a 'great achievement in the history of Korean literature' and a 'special moment for the nation.' 'You converted the painful wounds of our modern history into great literature,' Yoon wrote. 'I send my respects to you for elevating the value of Korean literature.' Han, the daughter of renowned South Korean novelist Han Seung-won, made her publishing debut as a poet in 1993. She won the International Booker Prize in 2016 for the novel 'The Vegetarian,' a story in which a woman’s decision to stop eating meat brings devastating consequences and raises concern among family members that she’s mentally ill. The book sold more than 100,000 in the U.S. Another one of Han's well-known novels is 'Human Acts,' which is set in 1980 in her birth city of Gwangju and follows a boy searching for the body of a friend who was killed in a violent suppression of a student protest. South Korea’s former military government that year sent troops to Gwangju for a bloody crackdown on pro-democracy protesters that left around 200 people dead and hundreds of others injured. 'The decision came all too sudden. I could also describe it as a feeling of bewilderment,' Han Seung-won, Han’s father, told reporters Friday about the moment he heard the news that his daughter had won the Nobel Prize. He praised his daughter's writing, which he described as poetic and exhibiting unique 'fantastical realism,' and also commended British translator Deborah Smith, who translated 'The Vegetarian' and 'The White Book.' 'The translator has somehow managed to convey Han Kang’s sentences, bringing to life the delicate and beautiful prose and melancholic sensibility,' he said. Han Kang’s award generated excitement among South Korean writers and critics, who in comments to local media expressed hope that it would bring more global attention to South Korean literature. But it remains to be seen whether Han’s stories would become widely popular among casual readers around the world, said Brother Anthony of Taize, a British-born scholar and prolific translator of Korean literature. 'It’s not always an easy read,' he said, describing how her novels are often complicated stories about communication failures, misunderstandings, 'unhappy people and troubled relationships and pain.' If Han's works have anything in common with South Korea's other cultural products that garnered international acclaim in recent years, it is that they often reflect the dark side of the country’s society. Both Parasite and Squid Game provided biting commentaries on the country’s deepening inequality and other problems that have many young and poor people describing their lives as a hellish nightmare. South Korea has one of the largest gaps between rich and poor among developed economies and is grappling with decaying job markets, soaring household debt and a record-low birth rate as struggling couples put off having babies. The country also struggles to deal with the pains of its brutal transition from dictatorship to democracy. 'Korean society is rather dark and it’s probably the aspect that resonates,' Brother Anthony said. Jung Yoon-young, a 49-year-old resident in Seoul, said Han’s triumph was a refreshing moment for the country during depressing times. 'It’s a miraculous event and really a breath of fresh air,' she said. 'I’m grateful and proud.'	https://apnews.com/article/han-kang-nobel-literature-south-korea-vegetarian-dark-history-e404fdbb3ca2079bf45e03023c6ad3b4	2024-10-10T07:01:07-07:00

The Latest: Harris visiting Nevada and Arizona while Trump speaks in Michigan	As Florida grapples with the effects of Hurricane Milton, presidential campaigning remains in full swing in battleground states across the U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris will attend a Univision town hall in Las Vegas on Thursday afternoon before going to an evening rally in Phoenix while remaining in close contact with the White House and monitoring federal disaster response efforts. Former President Donald Trump, meanwhile, will speak at the Economic Club of Detroit after holding rallies in Pennsylvania on Wednesday. Even amid the hurricane, however, both the Harris and Trump campaigns are using their travel strategically, trying to increase support with key voting blocs who could decide an election expected to be exceedingly close. Former President Barack Obama is also hitting the campaign trail on Thursday night, making his first appearance for Harris at a rally in Pittsburgh. That begins what the Harris campaign says will be a series of campaign stops Obama will make on the vice president’s behalf. Follow the AP’s Election 2024 coverage at: https://apnews.com/hub/election-2024. Here’s the latest: UAW chief calls Trump the ‘job-killer-in-chief’ The Harris campaign openly challenged Trump’s economic record ahead of the Republican nominee’s Thursday speech in Detroit, part of a broader effort to chip away at the former president’s credibility. On a call with reporters organized by the campaign, Shawn Fain, president of the United Auto Workers, called Trump the 'job-killer-in-chief.' Despite Trump’s promises to bring back factory jobs, Fain said, 'The reality is Trump never brought back squat.' Back in 2000, Michigan had nearly 900,000 factory jobs. That number nearly halved after the 2008 financial crisis, only to then slowly recover 633,900 jobs in 2018. But factory work in Michigan began to slump in 2019 and then plunged during the pandemic, all during Trump’s term. Labor Department data show that manufacturing work in the state still hasn’t fully recovered with there being 604,800 jobs in the sector as of August.	https://apnews.com/article/harris-trump-election-2024-campaign-rallies-f63c268e981712f7f88da6149a476fc7	2024-10-10T06:31:55-07:00	
UN-backed experts say Israel is destroying Gaza's health sector and both sides have tortured people	A U.N. commission on Thursday accused Israel of destroying Gaza's health care system through 'relentless and deliberate attacks' in its yearlong war with Hamas and said that Palestinian prisoners and Israeli hostages have been tortured and sexually abused. The expert panel was commissioned in 2021 by the U.N.-backed Human Rights Council to look into rights violations and abuses in Israel and the Palestinian areas it controls. Led by Navi Pillay, a former U.N. human rights chief, the panel members are independent experts and do not speak for the world body. There was no immediate comment from Israel, which has long accused the U.N. of being biased against it and has not cooperated with the commission. Israeli forces have raided hospitals in Gaza on several occasions, accusing militants of sheltering there. Palestinian medical officials have denied such allegations and accused Israel of recklessly endangering civilians. Hospitals can lose their protection under international law if they are used for military purposes. The report accused Israel of deliberately killing, detaining and torturing Palestinian medical staff, of targeting their vehicles and of restricting permits for medical evacuations from Gaza. It said those amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity. 'Israel must immediately stop its unprecedented wanton destruction of health care facilities in Gaza,' Pillay said in a statement. 'By targeting health care facilities, Israel is targeting the right to health itself with significant long-term detrimental effects on the civilian population.' The commission said children have borne much of the cost of such actions, pointing to attacks on medical facilities offering pediatric and neonatal care. The panel also said it found that thousands of adults and children detained in Gaza had been subjected to 'widespread and systematic abuse, physical and psychological violence, and sexual and gender-based violence.' It said Israeli security forces had raped male detainees, attacked their genitals and forced them to perform humiliating or strenuous acts while stripped naked. It said children who had been detained had returned to Gaza unaccompanied and deeply traumatized. The commission further said the abuse had been institutionalized by Israel's far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir. He has boasted of making conditions in the country's prisons as harsh as possible under Israeli law in what he says is an attempt to deter militant attacks. Israel detained nine soldiers in July over what their defense lawyer said were allegations of sexual abuse of a detainee being held at a shadowy facility where detainees from Gaza have been taken since the start of the war. The lawyer denied the allegations, and their arrest sparked protests by Israeli hard-liners. The commission also said that hostages held by Palestinian militants in Gaza were subjected to physical and sexual violence, forced isolation and threats, and given limited access to water, food and hygiene facilities. It said Palestinian armed groups were also guilty of war crimes and crimes against humanity, and called on them to immediately release all the hostages. Hamas-led militants stormed into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250 others. They are still holding around 100 captives, a third of whom are believed to be dead. Israel's offensive has killed over 42,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities, who do not say how many were fighters but say women and children make up more than half of the fatalities. The war has destroyed large areas of Gaza and displaced around 90% of its population of 2.3 million people. The International Court of Justice is investigating allegations that Israel has committed genocide in Gaza, and the International Criminal Court is considering arrest warrants against Israeli and Hamas leaders. Israel has adamantly denied the accusations and says it abides by international law. ___ Find more of AP’s coverage of the war at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-human-rights-un-c75b4db37aa5ade8466e0daa446ad596	2024-10-10T05:20:50-07:00	
Trump and Harris keep campaigning after Milton hits Florida	WASHINGTON (AP) — Vice President Kamala Harris visits Nevada and Arizona while former President Donald Trump talks economic issues in Michigan, as presidential campaigning continues even with Hurricane Milton hitting Florida. Trump was speaking at the Economic Club of Detroit after holding rallies in Pennsylvania on Wednesday. Harris is attending a Univision town hall in Las Vegas and an evening rally in Phoenix while remaining in close contact with the White House and monitoring federal disaster response efforts. President Joe Biden, who said Milton 'is looking like the storm of the century,' postponed a trip to Germany and Angola to cope with its aftermath. He and Harris were huddling with top officials in the Situation Room to discuss disaster response. Even amid the hurricane, however, both the Harris and Trump campaigns are using their travel strategically, trying to increase support with key voting blocs who could decide an election expected to be exceedingly close. Trump has emphasized picking up votes in heavily Hispanic parts of Pennsylvania, including Reading, where he held a rally Wednesday. Harris is out west as her campaign looks to increase support among Hispanic voters there, especially men. Her campaign began a group this week known as 'Hombres con Harris.' Harris' running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, attended an Hombres kickoff event with Arizona Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego, and actor Jaime Camil in Phoenix on Wednesday. Similar gatherings were held elsewhere in Arizona, as well as in Nevada and Pennsylvania. The group is planning to hold upcoming events at Latino-owned small businesses, union halls, barbecues and community events until Election Day. The Harris campaign has also aimed to reach Hispanic voters who may not be closely following the election by doing things like having Julie Chavez Rodriguez, Harris' campaign manager, attend the recent boxing match between Canelo Alvarez and Edgar Berlanga in Las Vegas, and holding events at churches and elsewhere to mark Mexican Independence Day in September. Harris' campaign also announced last month that it was spending $3 million on Spanish-language radio ads and focusing on sport events like baseball games and boxing matches. Meanwhile, former President Barack Obama is also hitting the campaign trail on Thursday night, making his first appearance for Harris at a rally in Pittsburgh. That begins what the Harris campaign says will be a series of campaign stops Obama will make on the vice president's behalf. Biden spent Monday campaigning in suburban Philadelphia, but has made just one joint appearance with Harris, joining her in Pittsburgh on Labor Day, since he announced he was leaving the race and endorsing her in July. Obama was among the key Democrats who were part of a behind-the-scenes effort to encourage Biden, his former vice president, to drop out. Obama and Harris have also been friends for two decades, since he ran for Senate in Illinois. She campaigned for him when he sought the presidency in 2008.	https://apnews.com/article/trump-harris-nevada-michigan-hispanic-voters-milton-2a9db630d1318e78de91efd2df5a16f0	2024-10-10T04:49:01-07:00	
Colombia’s river guardians battle to protect the Atrato amid threats and abandonment	PAIMADO, Colombia (AP) — Sediment and pebbles are all that’s left on the earth around much of Bernardino Mosquera’s small riverside community in northwest Colombia’s Choco region. Just a year ago, healthy shrubs and trees filled this important biodiversity spot teeming with species native to the land. But then illegal miners arrived, using their heavy machinery to dredge the riverbeds for gold. 'It’s just desert here,' said Mosquera. 'Illegal mining affects the ecosystem in every way … it leads to degraded land. There are no trees. The water sources are drying up, it’s polluted by mercury.' Mosquera is a river guardian, a title bestowed upon him and 13 others. The unpaid guardians serve as the eyes and ears of the Atrato River: They liaise with government institutions on environmental and social issues in the face of aggression from armed groups and hope to reverse the devastation they see along the river. But after eight years, they are increasingly disenchanted by the lack of support from institutions and growing threats from armed groups that control the region. Colombia’s constitutional court declared in 2016 that the Atrato River running alongside this 2,500-person town was so important to life, it would have rights equivalent to a human. The region is home to thousands of species, with 25% of its plant and bird species endemic, according to the United Nations Development Programme. The river's legal status was a first for Latin America, and when the guardians were established. 'It’s an unbreakable marriage between its inhabitants and the rivers,' Mosquera, 62, said. 'That’s why we have to defend the Atrato.' Illegal gold mining has become the fastest-growing criminal economy over the past decade in South America. The boom began in Colombia and Peru and expanded to Ecuador, Venezuela and Brazil. In Choco, illegal mining is rife Paimado, like many towns in the Choco region, is an illegal mining hub firmly in the control of the largest criminal organization in the country, known as Gulf Clan. Early each morning, small wooden boats carry plastic gasoline containers to feed the mining machinery dotted along the Atrato, a river that snakes some 750 kilometers (470 miles) through northern Colombian jungles. Dozens of illegal mines pepper the river between Mosquera’s home in Paimado, which lies on Rio Quito, the Atrato River's main tributary, and the state capital Quibdo. Large wooden rafts propped on stilts reach deep into the riverbed to extract material that is sifted through the machine for gold. Deep inside the banks of the river, another type of mining takes place with heavier machinery. It is here that deforestation is glaringly evident. Drone footage taken by The Associated Press shows large patches of empty land which stretch long behind the riverbanks. 'Many people think that because it looks very green there is no deforestation,' said river guardian and agronomist Maryuri Mosquera, 42. High rates of poverty have pushed many into gold mining, work that destroys land and contaminates their river. That destruction then destroys the local economy, making communities even more dependent on mining. Colombia’s human rights ombudsman’s office said in April the government is failing to protect the river, saying 'there is no evidence of any progress' since the river gained personhood. It called on the environment ministry to comply with the 2016 ruling. In a written response, Colombia’s environment ministry said its Minister Susana Muhamad has been coordinating efforts with the Ministry of Defense 'to protect this important ecosystem.' It added that a program will soon begin to work with the communities to restore the Atrato River basin and its tributaries. A community lifeline destroyed The Atrato River has long been an important source of water, food and transport for its rural, mostly Afro-Colombian residents who built communities on the riverbanks. The tiny village of El Arenal along the Atrato is home to river guardian Juan Carlos Palacios, 33, who says that his role is a triumph for the Black communities who fought for the 2016 ruling. 'It makes me feel very sad when I see machinery pass by continually, without any controls. They arrive on our land and we can’t even say anything, because the miners come along with armed actors,' Palacios said. For most of his life, even sometimes now, Palacios has been involved in artisanal gold mining. A short canoe ride to the other side of the river from El Arenal is his mother, bent over with a hoe and a wooden gold sifting pan. This has been her life since she can remember. 'I think that if I stop doing this, I’ll die quickly, because I’m so used to it,' said Ana Palacios Cuesta with a laugh. 'The dredgers have emptied the whole river, so we hardly get anything anymore.' The tiny amounts of gold sediment she collects are sold in the nearby town of Yuto, or in Quibdo, about 40 minutes away. Mercury and arsenic offer the industrial-scale miners a low-tech solution to extract the gold. But they get pumped into the water, poisoning the river and the surrounding lands. The tactic has been killing marine life, changing the natural flow of the river, and further debilitating some of the most vulnerable communities in the country. Palacios, who has a degree in biology, said fish in the river have been 'highly contaminated' by mercury, which gets passed through fish to humans and can cause damage to vital organs. 'Of course we continue to consume them because we have no other option,' he said. Local women and their children stand in the river to wash their dishes and clothes, something only the most rural and needy communities do nowadays over fear of the water’s contamination. Guardians face violence and threats The guardians have a precarious job in an area controlled largely by rebel and criminal armed groups, like leftist guerrillas the National Liberation Army and Gulf Clan. Mining machinery along the banks are overseen by these groups and miners are forced to pay them protection money — known locally as 'vacuna' — to be allowed to operate freely without becoming targets. 'The act of raising awareness and denouncing the situations that the Atrato basin is experiencing means we face certain risks,' guardian Maryuri Mosquera said, especially her guardian colleagues in more rural areas. Guardian Bernardino Mosquera has a bulletproof vest provided by the state after he got multiple death threats over the years, the last one in March. He has been kidnapped by Gulf Clan and had bullet shells placed under his door on several occasions 'as warnings.' He almost quit. 'But I realized that if we pull out of the process, we are giving them strength ... no one is going to want to say what is happening, you’ll end up riddled with bullets,' Mosquera said as the tropical rain lashed the tin roof of his home. 'We must continue to make the process visible. It’s the only way for them (armed groups) to feel that we too are in the territory. So that stopped me and made me carry on ... And here I am.' ___ Follow Steven Grattan on X: @sjgrattan __ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Palestinian officials say an Israeli strike on a Gaza shelter has killed at least 21 people	DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — An Israeli strike on a school sheltering displaced people in Gaza killed at least 21 people on Thursday, with the toll likely to rise, Palestinian medical officials said. Israel has continued to strike at what it says are militant targets across the Palestinian enclave even as attention has shifted to its war against Hezbollah in Lebanon and rising tensions with Iran. It launched a large-scale air and ground operation against Hamas in northern Gaza earlier this week. The Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital, where the bodies were brought, confirmed the toll from the strike in the central town of Deir al-Balah. It said several other people were wounded in the strike. An Associated Press reporter saw ambulances streaming into the hospital and counted the bodies, many of which arrived in pieces. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military. Witnesses said the strike targeted a makeshift post of the Hamas-run police inside the shelter. Israel has repeatedly attacked schools-turned-shelters in Gaza, accusing militants of hiding out there. Hamas has continued to launch attacks on Israeli forces and fire occasional rockets into Israel more than a year after its Oct. 7 attack ignited the war. Hamas-led militants stormed into Israel and rampaged through army bases and farming communities in that attack, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250 others. They are still holding around 100 captives, a third of whom are believed to be dead. Israel’s offensive has killed over 42,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities, who do not say how many were fighters but say women and children make up more than half of the fatalities. The war has destroyed large areas of Gaza and displaced around 90% of its population of 2.3 million people, often multiple times. ___ Find more of AP’s coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-lebanon-hezbollah-10-10-2024-a5e53cdd4fca30be1909506b5c777922	2024-10-10T00:10:39-07:00	
Zelenskyy meeting UK and NATO leaders as he seeks support for Ukraine's peace plan	LONDON (AP) — Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy arrived at 10 Downing St. in London on Thursday for talks with the leaders of Britain and NATO on his 'victory plan' for the war against Russia. Zelenskyy is meeting Prime Minister Keir Starmer and NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte, before traveling to Paris for talks with President Emmanuel Macron. Zelenskyy says he will also meet the leaders of Germany and Italy this week to discuss the plan. He had been due to present his blueprint at a weekend meeting of Western leaders and defense ministers in Germany, but it has been postponed because U.S. President Joe Biden said he had to stay home to respond to Hurricane Milton’ s landfall in Florida. Zelenskyy said Wednesday he hoped the meeting could be rescheduled soon. The details of Zelenskyy’s plan have been kept quiet but contours have emerged, including the need for fast action on decisions Western allies have been mulling since the full-scale invasion began in 2022. Zelenskyy said Wednesday at a summit in Croatia with leaders of southeastern European states that the plan seeks to strengthen Ukraine 'both geopolitically and on the battlefield' before any kind of dialogue with Russia. 'Weakness of any of our allies will inspire (Russian President Vladimir) Putin,' he said. 'That’s why we’re asking them to strengthen us, in terms of security guarantees, in terms of weapons, in terms of our future after this war. In my view, he (Putin) only understands force.' Kyiv is still awaiting word from Western partners on its repeated requests to use the long-range weapons they provide to hit targets deep inside Russia. While some, including the U.K., are thought to be willing, Biden has held back out of concern it could escalate the conflict. Ukraine’s leader last visited London in July, soon after Starmer’s Labour Party government was elected, when he addressed a meeting of the British Cabinet. Starmer’s spokesman, Dave Pares, said Thursday’s meeting would involve 'broad strategic discussions' on U.K. and allied support for Ukraine during a 'crucial period,' rather than specific decisions.	https://apnews.com/article/ukraine-zelenskyy-europe-allies-c626fb13b60feacfbecf50280bed589b	2024-10-09T23:27:46-07:00	
With roads often blocked by rebels in Congo, boats — the only alternative — have become death traps	GOMA, Congo (AP) — The overcrowded boat that capsized in eastern Congo last week killed eight members of Serge Nzonga’s family along with 70 others. Days later, he was back on the same route that claimed their lives in yet another boat lacking safety measures. Nzonga and hundreds of other passengers, including Associated Press journalists, lined up at the seaport in Goma, eastern Congo’s largest city, getting ready to board a locally made boat bound for Bukavu city on the other side of Lake Kivu, a perilous journey they would rather undertake than travel Congo’s treacherous roads. On Wednesday, as authorities continued to investigate the accident, families of those killed last week protested at the port of Kituku, accusing officials of negligence in failing to address the insecurity in eastern Congo and of delaying rescue operations. The capsizing of overloaded boats is becoming increasingly frequent in this central African nation as more people are abandoning the few available roads for wooden vessels crumbling under the weight of passengers and their goods. The roads are often caught up in the deadly clashes between Congolese security forces and rebels that sometimes block major access routes. Hundreds have already been killed or declared missing in such accidents so far this year. 'This is the only way we can reach our brothers and sisters in the other province of South Kivu,' said Nzonga as his turn to board a locally made boat drew nearer. 'If we don’t take this journey, there is no other route,' he said. 'The road is blocked because of the war and … the roads are not paved in eastern Congo.' In the absence of good roads in this country of more than 100 million, the rivers in Congo have been the only means of transport many here have known — especially in remote areas where passengers usually come from. Among the frequent passengers on the boats and ferries are traders unable to transport their goods along the dangerous roads, some of them spending days or weeks along the rivers. However, several others also board them for various other reasons: It is faster than traveling by road, the roads are in bad shape and families like Nzonga’s can travel at more affordable rates. That leaves boats and ferries frequently overcrowded, and safety measures are hardly implemented, analysts say. The boat that capsized on Congo's Lake Kivu last week was trying to dock just meters away from the port of Kituku when it began to sink, witnesses said. The boat was visibly overcrowded, 'full of passengers (as) it started to lose its balance,' said Francine Munyi, an eyewitness. Authorities often threaten harsh punishments to curb overloading, enforce safety measures and punish corrupt officials, but measures promised to stop the accidents are rarely carried out, analysts say. 'The private sector dominates Lake Kivu … but the boats cannot leave the port without the authorization of the lake commissioner,' said Émile Murhula, an independent analyst, adding that authorities are also supposed to enforce the use of life jackets and remove boats that do not meet the required standards. As the Bukavu-bound boat – named Emmanuel 4 – navigated the waters, the passengers cast worried glances at the lake, many of them without life jackets. Canoes crisscrossed the lake in search of the bodies of victims still missing after the latest accident. At the seaport, dozens of relatives waited patiently for answers that were taking forever to come. Nzonga, the passenger who lost eight relatives, admits it is dangerous to travel without a life jacket. But even those jackets are not provided by the government. 'We’re scared, but it’s the only way we have to get to the other province,' he said. 'I still have to travel, even though we’re used to it (the accidents).' ___ Associated Press journalist Chinedu Asadu in Abuja, Nigeria, contributed to this report. ___ The Associated Press receives financial support for global health and development coverage in Africa from the Gates Foundation.

The Nobel Prize in literature is being awarded in Stockholm	STOCKHOLM (AP) — After three days of Nobel prizes honoring work in the sciences, the literature award is being announced Thursday by the Nobel Committee at the Swedish Academy. The winner will follow Norwegian writer Jon Fosse, who was honored last year for writing in Nynorsk, one of the two official written versions of the Norwegian language, that prize organizers said gives 'voice to the unsayable.' The literature prize has long faced criticism that it is too focused on European and North American writers of style-heavy, story-light prose. It has also been male-dominated, with just 17 women among its 119 laureates. The last woman to win was Annie Ernaux of France, in 2022. Six days of Nobel announcements opened Monday with Americans Victor Ambros and Gary Ruvkun winning the medicine prize. Two founding fathers of machine learning — John Hopfield and Geoffrey Hinton — won the physics prize on Tuesday. On Wednesday, three scientists who discovered powerful techniques to decode and even design novel proteins were awarded the Nobel Prize in chemistry. The Nobel Peace Prize will be announced Friday and the economics award on Oct. 14. The prize carries a cash award of 11 million Swedish kronor ($1 million) from a bequest left by the award’s creator, Swedish inventor Alfred Nobel. The laureates are invited to receive their awards at ceremonies on Dec. 10, the anniversary of Nobel’s death. ___ Corder reported from The Hague, Netherlands.	https://apnews.com/article/nobel-literature-prize-e52fdabe9379d351d744e121218bddc5	2024-10-09T22:33:10-07:00	
China will lift 4-year ban on Australian lobster imports, Australia's prime minister says	MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — China will resume importing Australian live lobsters by the end of the year, removing the final major obstacle to bilateral trade that once cost Australian exporters more than 20 billion Australian dollars ($13 billion) a year, Australia’s prime minister said Thursday. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese made the announcement after meeting Premier Li Qiang on the sidelines of a Southeast Asian summit in Vientiane, Laos. The ban on lobsters was the last of a series of official and unofficial trade barriers that Beijing has agreed to lift since Albanese’s center-left Labor Party government was elected in 2022. 'I’m pleased to announce that Premier Li and I have agreed on a timetable to resume full lobster trade by the end of this year,' Albanese told reporters. 'This of course will be in time for Chinese New Year and this will be welcomed by the people engaged in the live lobster industry,' he added. Albanese has given assurances that relations with China have been improved without compromising Australian interests. Beijing is unhappy with restrictions Australia has placed on some Chinese investments because of security concerns. 'What’s important is that friends are able to have direct discussions. It doesn’t imply agreement, it doesn’t imply compliance and I’ll always represent Australia’s national interest. That’s what I did today; it was a very constructive meeting,' Albanese said. 'I’m encouraged by the progress that we have made between Australia and China’s relationship in producing stabilization to the benefit of both of our nations and with the objective of advancing peace and security in the region,' Albanese added. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning referred questions about Australian lobsters to trade authorities. 'China stands ready to work with Australia to continue properly resolving issues of each other’s concerns through dialogue and consultation, so as to build more mature and stable bilateral relations for the benefit of the two peoples,' Mao said at a regular media briefing in Beijing. Australian lobster exports to China had been worth AU$700 million ($470 million) in 2019. Beijing ended trade with Australia in 2020 on a range of commodities including lobster, coal, wine, barley, beef and wood as diplomatic relations plumbed new depths. Conservative Prime Minister Scott Morrison had angered Beijing that year by demanding an independent investigation into the origins of and responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. Tom Ryan, a manager at lobster exporter Five Star Seafoods at Port MacDonnell in South Australia state, said he was disappointed that his trade would be the last to resume with China. 'It’s been a long time coming,' Ryan told Australian Broadcasting Corp. of Albanese's announcement. 'Between myself and other people in Port MacDonnell, it’s an absolute relief,' he added. The industry had found new markets for lobster products but at lower profit margins, Ryan said. Li said during a state visit to Australia in June that he had agreed with Albanese to 'properly manage' their nations' differences. Beijing had severed minister-to-minister contacts during the conservatives' nine years in power. ___ Follow AP's Asia-Pacific coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/asia-pacific	https://apnews.com/article/australia-china-lobsters-trade-laos-6bea24485d2e72a7de9b5aedbcf37c41	2024-10-09T22:03:13-07:00	
Suspected militants shoot police in vehicle in northwest Pakistan, killing 2 officers	PESHAWAR, Pakistan (AP) — Suspected militants riding on a motorcycle opened fire on a vehicle carrying police officers Thursday in a former stronghold of the Pakistani Taliban, killing two of them and wounding two others, police said. The attack happened in Tank, a city in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province bordering Afghanistan, local police official Sher Afzal said. No group has claimed responsibility, but suspicion is likely to fall on the Pakistani Taliban, known as the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan or TTP, who often target security forces. The TTP are outlawed in Pakistan. They are separate from but a close ally of the Afghan Taliban who control neighboring Afghanistan. The latest violence came a day after at least three people were killed in clashes in the northwestern town of Jamrud between police and supporters of a banned right group Pashtun Protection Movement or PTM, which authorities say supports TTP. The government has also barred PTM from holding rallies in the northwest, allegedly because the demonstrations are against the interests of Pakistan. PTM denies backing the Pakistani Taliban, and tension was growing Thursday after the group vowed to resist the ban on their rallies.	https://apnews.com/article/pakistan-police-killed-northwest-0add0e973471aa6ba6c227bd28f56917	2024-10-09T20:59:34-07:00	
Suspected attacks by Yemen's Houthi rebels target ship in Red Sea	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — A series of suspected attacks by Yemen's Houthi rebels targeted a ship on Thursday in the Red Sea, authorities said. The attack comes as the rebels continue to threaten ships moving through the Red Sea, a waterway that once saw $1 trillion in goods move through it a year, over the ongoing conflicts in the Mideast stemming from the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip. A ship in the Red Sea skirting the coast of the East Africa found itself struck first by a projectile that damaged the vessel, but sparked no fire and caused no injuries, the British military's United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations center said. The private security firm Ambrey identified the ship as a Liberian-flagged chemical tanker. At least two more projectiles later fell in the waters around the vessel, which was a distance away from Hodeida, the Houthi-controlled port from which many of the rebels' attacks have been launched. The rebels did not immediately claim the attack. However, it can take them hours or even days to acknowledge their assaults. The Houthis have targeted more than 80 merchant vessels with missiles and drones since the war in Gaza started in October. They seized one vessel and sank two in the campaign that has also killed four sailors. Other missiles and drones have either been intercepted by a U.S.-led coalition in the Red Sea or failed to reach their targets, which have included Western military vessels as well. The rebels maintain that they target ships linked to Israel, the U.S. or the U.K. to force an end to Israel’s campaign against Hamas in Gaza. However, many of the ships attacked have little or no connection to the conflict, including some bound for Iran. In Thursday's attack, Ambrey said it 'assessed the vessel to have a strong affiliation with the Houthi targeting profile,' without elaborating.	https://apnews.com/article/red-sea-attacks-yemen-houthi-rebels-israel-hamas-war-961fbf91e97e071011ad3bea9077511a	2024-10-09T20:28:10-07:00	
AP PHOTOS: Human towers rise skyward in Spain's Catalonia as part of cultural pride	TARRAGONA, Spain (AP) — Dozens of people squeeze together, pressing as tight as they can get. The stronger the foundation they build, the less likely their human tower will collapse. As children and others climb, they create eight, nine, even 10 dizzying stories. They tug on sashes wound around torsos, gritting their teeth to keep their backs straight and their legs from buckling. With maximum concentration, they look into each other’s eyes, seeking further support. The tradition of building human towers, or 'castells' in Catalan, dates to the 18th century and forms an essential part of Catalonia’s culture. 'Colles,' or human tower troupes, compete to build the tallest and most complicated towers at festivals often held in village squares across the region in northeastern Spain. For many Catalans, the towers symbolize the pride they feel for their land, language and history. It means they are in it together and, if united, they are capable of amazing feats. As the tower goes up, the ages come down. Graying hair, receding hairlines and the burliest bodies are seen on the ground floor. The increasingly nimble are tasked with creating the final stages. Young men and women, then teenagers, then children ascend in a spidery climb, their arms interlocked, to the very top. The smallest boy or girl, as young as 5 years old, crowns the tower, reaching some 16 meters high (52 feet). Then, as collective strength wavers, the tower often sways. It undoes itself, with each level sliding down the backs of lower ones. Or the tower crashes on the heads and shoulders below. Injuries aren't common, and children wear helmets. Every two years, the most important competition for human towers is held in Tarragona, an old Roman city on the Mediterranean coast. The 'Concurs de Castells' started in 1932. It now invites the 42 best teams to compete. Newcomers and foreigners alike now take part in this practice that's included in UNESCO's list of Intangible Cultural Heritage. Tomoko Sakamoto is from Japan. She, her husband and their two children participate in a human tower troupe. 'It’s changed my life,' she said. 'I am part of Catalan culture and I am proud.' ___ Iain Sullivan in Madrid and Joseph Wilson in Barcelona contributed.	https://apnews.com/article/human-towers-castells-spain-catalonia-0146da4fd9edc44a681acb3944a81fb3	2024-10-09T20:07:00-07:00	
China seeks deeper economic ties with ASEAN at summit talks as South China Sea disputes lurk	VIENTIANE, Laos (AP) — Chinese Premier Li Qiang called for deeper market integration with Southeast Asia on Thursday during annual summit talks, where concerns over Beijing's aggression in the disputed South China Sea was raised. The 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations' meeting with Li followed recent violent confrontations at sea between China and ASEAN members Philippines and Vietnam, that sparked groiwng unease over China's increasingly assertive actions in the disputed waters. Li didn't mention the row in his opening speech at the summit talks but said intensifying trade relations and creating an 'ultra large-scale market' are keys to economic prosperity. 'The global economy is still seeing a sluggish recovery, protectionism is rising and geopolitical turbulence has brought instability and uncertainty to our development,' Li said. 'Strengthening market coordination and synchronization is an important direction for our further cooperation.' ASEAN and China said they expect to conclude negotiations to upgrade their free trade pact next year. Officials said the expanded pact will cover supply chain connectivity, the digital economy and green economy. Since the two sides signed the pact covering a market of 2 billion people in 2010, ASEAN’s trade with China has leaped from $235.5 billion to $696.7 billion last year. China is ASEAN's No. 1 trading partner and its third-largest source of foreign investment — a key reason why the bloc has been muted in its criticisms of Chinese actions in the South China Sea. ASEAN members Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia and Brunei along with Taiwan have overlapping claims with China, which claims sovereignty over virtually all of the South China Sea. Chinese and Philippine vessels have clashed repeatedly this year, and Vietnam said last week that Chinese forces assaulted its fishermen in the disputed sea. China has also sent patrol vessels to areas that Indonesia and Malaysia claim as exclusive economic zones. Philippines President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. made clear to Li during talks Thursday that ASEAN-China cooperation cannot be separated from the sea dispute, according to an ASEAN official who declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the discussion. The official said Marcos wants to prioritize negotiations on a code of conduct to govern behavior in the sea to ensure peace. Li responded by saying the South China Sea is 'a shared home' and that China has an obligation to protect its sovereignty, the official said. The Philippines, a longtime U.S. ally, has been critical of other ASEAN countries for not doing more to get China to back away. Talks on the code of conduct have been ongoing for years, hampered by sticky issues including disagreements over whether the pact should be binding. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who arrived in Vientiane on Thursday for the meetings, is expected to raise the issue of China’s aggression in the sea, officials said. The U.S. has no claims but it has deployed navy ships and fighter jets to patrol the waterway and promote freedom of navigation and overflight. China has warned the U.S. not to meddle in the disputes. ASEAN leaders, who held a summit among themselves on Wednesday, also separately met with new Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol before convening an ASEAN Plus Three summit along with China. ASEAN elevated its ties with South Korea to a 'comprehensive strategic partnership' at the summit to boost cooperation. Yoon said the partnership will help both sides 'create a new future together.' Ishiba separately pledged to boost Japan-ASEAN relationship by providing patrol vessels and training on maritime law enforcement, strengthening economic security through financial and other support and bolstering cybersecurity. 'Japan shares principles such as freedom, democracy and the rule of law, and would like to create and protect the future together with ASEAN,' he said. The bloc will also hold individual talks with dialogue partners Australia, Canada, India, the U.S. and the United Nations that will culminate in an East Asia Summit of 18 nations including Russia and New Zealand on Friday. Former ASEAN Secretary-General Ong Keng Yong said that despite challenges in addressing disputes in the South China Sea and the Myanmar civil war, ASEAN's central role in the region is undisputable. 'ASEAN and its diplomatic maneuvers have sustained the relative peace and progress of Southeast Asia to date. ASEAN will continue to be useful in that regard. Big powers cannot do what they wish in the region,' said Ong, who is now deputy chairman of the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore. Nearly 6,000 people have been killed and over 3 million displaced in a civil war after the Myanmar army ousted an elected government in 2021. The military has backtracked on an ASEAN peace plan it agreed to in late 2021 and fighting has continued with pro-democracy guerillas and ethnic rebels. Myanmar's top generals have been shut out of ASEAN summits since the military takeover. Thailand will host an informal ASEAN ministerial-level consultation on Myanmar in mid-December as frustration grows in the bloc over the prolonged conflict.	https://apnews.com/article/asean-laos-china-south-china-sea-myanmar-ad1f39ff6d0bc353f07598b06bf214b7	2024-10-09T19:56:59-07:00	
Cambodian fishermen turn to raising eels as Tonle Sap lake runs out of fish	KAMPONG PHLUK, Cambodia (AP) — Em Phat, 53, studies his eel tanks with the intensity of a man gambling with his livelihood. For millennia, fishermen like him have relied on the bounty of the Tonle Sap in Cambodia, Southeast Asia’s largest lake and the epicenter of the world’s most productive inland fishery. But climate change, dams upstream on the Mekong River that sustains the lake, and deforestation in the region have changed everything. There aren't enough fish and living by the lake has become dangerous as storms intensify due to global warming. 'Being a fisherman is hard,' he said. Phat hopes that raising eels — a delicacy in Asian markets like China, Japan and South Korea — will provide a way forward. He raises eels in different tanks: translucent eel eggs bob gently in Small glass aquariums. Voracious glassy larvae swim in plastic tanks. Larger tubs have bicycle tires to provide places for juvenile eels to hide. Raising eels can be profitable but it's risky. Eels are notoriously difficult and expensive to raise. They need constant pure, oxygenated water and special food and are susceptible to diseases. Phat lost many eels when a power cut stopped his oxygen pumps, killing the fish. But he's optimistic about the future. Living on land, instead of on the lake, also means that his wife, Luy Nga, 52, can grow vegetables to eat and sell, so they are making enough money to get by. 'The eels have value and can also be exported to China and other countries in the future,' he said. That fishermen like Phat can no longer rely on the Tonle Sap, literally the 'Great Lake,' for their livelihood reflects how much has changed. The lake used to more than quadruple in size to an area larger than the country of Qatar during the rainy season, inundating native forests and creating the perfect breeding ground for diverse fish to thrive. The 'flood pulse,' a natural process of periodic flooding and droughts in the river system helped make the Mekong Basin the world’s largest freshwater fishery, with nearly 20% of all freshwater fish worldwide caught there, according to the think tank Stimson Center in Washington. More than 3 million people live and fish by the lake: a third of all 17 million Cambodians rely on the fisheries sector and up to 70% of Cambodia’s intake of animal protein is from fish. But dams upstream in China and Laos are cutting the Mekong's flow, weakening that flood pulse. The lakes have been depleted by overfishing and much of the forest surrounding it has been logged or burned for farmland. Cambodian authorities are reluctant to estimate the extent that fish stocks have declined. This year, the flood pulse was delayed by about two months, according to the Mekong Dam Monitor, a research project. In this shattered ecosystem, raising eels or other fish can provide fishermen like Phat with a 'buffer,' said Zeb Hogan, a fish biologist at the University of Nevada who has worked in the region for decades. 'Aquaculture, such as eel farming, is a way for people to take more control over their income source and livelihood,' he said, adding that it also allows them to raise fish that they know will fetch higher prices. Phat is one of more than thousands helped by a program run by the Britain-based nonprofit VSO to boost incomes of people living by Tonle Sap. VSO provides his baby eels and has taught him how to raise them. Eels are in high demand in Cambodia and elsewhere, said Sum Vy, 38, a coordinator at VSO, so they're profitable. When fishermen know how to farm eels and hatch the babies, others can follow. 'Not only can he or she earn the money to support their family, they can share this knowledge and skill with other people,' he said. Expanding aquaculture is helping increase Cambodian exports. Its fish production increased 24-fold in the two decades leading up to 2021 and, unlike its neighbors, most of its fish catch is inland, according to the Food and Agricultural Organization or FAO. Much of it is consumed domestically and exports have grown sluggishly. Earlier this year, the government launched a scheme to improve fish processing technologies and address food safety concerns, hoping to begin exporting more fish to Europe next year. Cambodia has signed trade agreements with China and began shipping frozen eels to Shanghai last year. 'This export will contribute to economic growth, creating jobs for our farmers and fishermen,' Heng Mengty, the export manager of the Cambodian fish exporter told China's official Xinhua news agency. The promised growth can’t come soon enough for Cambodians living in fishing communities around the lake. Some families live in homes that float year round, others on homes built on stilts up to 8-meters-high (26 feet), to keep them above floodwaters during the rainy season. Fishing is the only form of subsistence for many, but signs of decay are evident. Fishing nets catch only very small fish, or worse, nothing at all. Families speak of giant fish that are now rarely seen. The catch is a fraction of what it used to be. Even 10 years ago, Som Lay, a 29-year-old fisherman said, the lake was teeming with fish. But illegal fishing has increased and some families have already given up fishing and are trying to find land where they can grow rice. 'The entire village — my family and others — is facing these difficulties,' he said. ___ Associated Press journalist Sopheng Cheang contributed to this report. ___ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Africans recruited to work in Russia say they were duped into building drones for use in Ukraine	The social media ads promised the young African women a free plane ticket, money and a faraway adventure in Europe. Just complete a computer game and a 100-word Russian vocabulary test. But instead of a work-study program in fields like hospitality and catering, some of them learned only after arriving on the steppes of Russia’s Tatarstan region that they would be toiling in a factory to make weapons of war, assembling thousands of Iranian-designed attack drones to be launched into Ukraine. In interviews with The Associated Press, some of the women complained of long hours under constant surveillance, of broken promises about wages and areas of study, and of working with caustic chemicals that left their skin pockmarked and itching. To fill an urgent labor shortage in wartime Russia, the Kremlin has been recruiting women aged 18-22 from places like Uganda, Rwanda, Kenya, South Sudan, Sierra Leone and Nigeria, as well as the South Asian country of Sri Lanka. The drive is expanding to elsewhere in Asia as well as Latin America. That has put some of Moscow’s key weapons production in the inexperienced hands of about 200 African women who are working alongside Russian vocational students as young as 16 in the plant in Tatarstan’s Alabuga Special Economic Zone, about 1,000 kilometers (600 miles) east of Moscow, according to an AP investigation of the industrial complex. 'I don’t really know how to make drones,' said one African woman who had abandoned a job at home and took the Russian offer. The AP analyzed satellite images of the complex and its internal documents, spoke to a half-dozen African women who ended up there, and tracked down hundreds of videos in the online recruiting program dubbed 'Alabuga Start' to piece together life at the plant. A hopeful journey from Africa leads to ‘a trap’ The woman who agreed to work in Russia excitedly documented her journey, taking selfies at the airport and shooting video of her airline meal and of the in-flight map, focusing on the word 'Europe' and pointing to it with her long, manicured nails. When she arrived in Alabuga, however, she soon learned what she would be doing and realized it was 'a trap.' 'The company is all about making drones. Nothing else,' said the woman, who assembled airframes. 'I regret and I curse the day I started making all those things.' One possible clue about what was in store for the applicants was their vocabulary test that included words like 'factory' and the verbs 'to hook' and 'to unhook.' The workers were under constant surveillance in their dorms and at work, the hours were long and the pay was less than she expected — details corroborated by three other women interviewed by AP, which is not identifying them by name or nationality out of concern for their safety. Factory management apparently tries to discourage the African women from leaving, and although some reportedly have left or found work elsewhere in Russia, AP was unable to verify that independently. A drone factory grows in Tatarstan Russia and Iran signed a $1.7 billion deal in 2022, after President Vladimir Putin invaded neighboring Ukraine, and Moscow began using Iranian imports of the unmanned aerial vehicles, or UAVs, in battle later that year. The Alabuga Special Economic Zone was set up in 2006 to attract businesses and investment to Tatarstan. It expanded rapidly after the invasion and parts switched to military production, adding or renovating new buildings, according to satellite images. Although some private companies still operate there, the plant is referred to as 'Alabuga' in leaked documents that detail contracts between Russia and Iran. The Shahed-136 drones were first shipped disassembled to Russia, but production has shifted to Alabuga and possibly another factory. Alabuga now is Russia's main plant for making the one-way, exploding drones, with plans to produce 6,000 of them a year by 2025, according to the leaked documents and the Washington-based Institute for Science and International Security. That target is now ahead of schedule, with Alabuga building 4,500, said David Albright, a former U.N. weapons inspector who works at the institute. Finding workers was a problem. With unemployment at record lows and many Russians already working in military industries, fighting in Ukraine or having fled abroad, plant officials turned to using vocational students and cheap foreign labor. Alabuga is the only Russian production facility that recruits women from Africa, Asia and South America to make weapons according to experts and the AP investigation. About 90% of the foreign women recruited via the Alabuga Start program work on making drones, particularly the parts 'that don’t require much skill,' he said. Documents leaked last year and verified by Albright and another drone expert detail the workforce growing from just under 900 people in 2023 to plans for over 2,600 in 2025. They show that foreign women largely assemble the drones, use chemicals and paint them. In the first half of this year, 182 women were recruited, largely from Central and East African countries, according to a Facebook page promoting the Alabuga Start program. It also recruits in South America and Asia 'to help ladies to start their career.' Officials held recruiting events in Uganda, and tried to recruit from its orphanages, according to messages on Alabuga's Telegram channel. Russian officials have also visited more than 26 embassies in Moscow to push the program. The campaign gave no reasons why it doesn't seek older women or men, but some analysts suggest officials could believe young women are easier to control. One of the leaked documents shows the assembly lines are segregated and uses a derogatory term referring to the African workers. The factory also draws workers from Alabuga Polytechnic, a nearby vocational boarding school for Russians age 16-18 and Central Asians age 18-22 that bills its graduates as experts in drone production. According to investigative outlets Protokol and Razvorot, some are as young as 15 and have complained of poor working conditions. Surveillance, caustic chemicals — and a Ukrainian attack The foreign workers travel by bus from their living quarters to the factory, passing multiple security checkpoints after a license plate scan, while other vehicles are stopped for more stringent checks, according to the woman who assembles drones. They share dormitories and kitchens that are 'guarded around the clock,' social media posts say. Entry is controlled via facial recognition, and recruits are watched on surveillance cameras. Pets, alcohol and drugs are not allowed. The foreigners receive local SIM cards for their phones upon arrival but are forbidden from bringing them into the factory, which is considered a sensitive military site. One woman said she could only talk to an AP reporter with her manager’s permission, another said her 'messages are monitored,' a third said workers are told not to talk to outsiders about their work, and a fourth said managers encouraged them to inform on co-workers. The airframe worker told AP the recruits are taught how to assemble the drones and coat them with a caustic substance with the consistency of yogurt. Many workers lack protective gear, she said, adding that the chemicals made her face feel like it was being pricked with tiny needles, and 'small holes' appeared on her cheeks, making them itch severely. 'My God, I could scratch myself! I could never get tired of scratching myself,' she said. 'A lot of girls are suffering,' she added. A video shared with AP showed another woman wearing an Alabuga uniform with her face similarly affected. Although AP could not determine what the chemicals were, drone expert Fabian Hinz of the International Institute for Strategic Studies confirmed that caustic substances are used in their manufacture. In addition to dangers from chemicals, the complex itself was hit by a Ukrainian drone in April, injuring at least 12 people. A video it posted on social media showed a Kenyan woman calling the attackers 'barbarians' who 'wanted to intimidate us.' 'They did not succeed,' she said. Workers ‘maltreated like donkeys’ Although one woman said she loved working at Alabuga because she was well-paid and enjoyed meeting new people and experiencing a different culture, most interviewed by AP disagreed about the size of the compensation and suggested that life there did not meet their expectations. The program initially promised recruits $700 a month, but later social media posts put it at 'over $500.' The airframe assembly worker said the cost of their accommodation, airfare, medical care and Russian-language classes were deducted from her salary, and she struggled to pay for basics like bus fare with the remainder. The African women are 'maltreated like donkeys, being slaved,' she said, indicating banking sanctions on Russia made it difficult to send money home. But another factory worker said she was able to send up to $150 a month to her family. Four of the women described long shifts of up to 12 hours, with haphazard days off. Still, two of these who said they worked in the kitchen added they were willing to tolerate the pay if they could support their families. The wages apparently are affecting morale, according to plant documents, with managers urging that the foreign workers be replaced with Russian-speaking staff because 'candidates are refusing the low salary.' Russian and Central Asian students at Alabuga Polytechnic are allowed visits home, social media posts suggest. Independent Russian media reported that these vocational students who want to quit the program have been told they must repay tuition costs. AP contacted the Russian Foreign Ministry and the offices of Tatarstan Gov. Rustam Minnikhanov and Alabuga Special Economic Zone Director General Timur Shagivaleev for a response to the women's complaints but received no reply. Human rights organizations contacted by AP said they were unaware of what was happening at the factory, although it sounded consistent with other actions by Russia. Human Rights Watch said Russia is actively recruiting foreigners from Africa and India to support its war in Ukraine by promising lucrative jobs without fully explaining the nature of the work. Russia’s actions 'could potentially fulfill the criteria of trafficking if the recruitment is fraudulent and the purpose is exploitation,' said Ravina Shamdasani, a spokesperson for the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, noting that Moscow is a party to the U.N. Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime. The AP contacted governments of 22 countries whose citizens Alabuga said it had recruited for the program. Most didn’t answer or said they would look into it. Betty Amongi, Uganda’s Minister for Gender, Labour and Social Development, told AP that her ministry raised concerns with its embassy in Moscow about the Alabuga recruiting effort, particularly over the age of the women, because 'female migrant workers are the most vulnerable category.' The ministry said it wanted to ensure the women 'do not end up in exploitative employment,' and needed to know who would be responsible for the welfare of the Ugandan women while in Russia. Alabuga's Facebook page said 46 Ugandan women were at the complex, although Amongi had said there were none. How accurate are the drones? Bolstered by the foreign recruits, Russia has vastly increased the number of drones it can fire at Ukraine. Nearly 4,000 were launched at Ukraine from the start of the war in February 2022 through 2023, Albright’s organization said. In the first seven months of this year, Russia launched nearly twice that. Although the Alabuga plant's production target is ahead of schedule, there are questions about the quality of the drones and whether manufacturing problems due to the unskilled labor force are causing malfunctions. Some experts also point to Russia’s switching to other materials from the original Iranian design as a sign of problems. An AP analysis of about 2,000 Shahed attacks documented by Ukraine’s military since July 29 shows that about 95% of the drones hit no discernible target. Instead, they fall into Ukraine's rivers and fields, stray into NATO-member Latvia and come down in Russia or ally Belarus. Before July, about 14% of Shaheds hit their targets in Ukraine, according to data analyzed by Albright’s team. The large failure rate could be due to Ukraine's improved air defenses, although Albright said it also could be because of the low-skilled workforce in which 'poor craftsmanship is seeping in,' he said. Another factor could be because Russia is using a Shahed variant that doesn't carry a warhead of 50 kilograms (110 pounds) of explosives. Moscow could be launching these dummy drones to overwhelm air defenses and force Ukraine to waste ammunition, allowing other UAVs to hit targets. Tourism, paintball games and a pitch on TikTok The Alabuga Start recruiting drive relies on a robust social media campaign of slickly edited videos with upbeat music that show African women visiting Tatarstan's cultural sites or playing sports. The videos show them working — smiling while cleaning floors, wearing hard hats while directing cranes, and donning protective equipment to apply paint or chemicals. One video depicts the Polytechnic school students in team-building exercises such as paintball matches, even showing the losing side — labeled as 'fascists' — digging trenches or being shot with the recreational weapons at close range. 'We are taught patriotism. This unites us. We are ready to repel any provocation,' one student says. The videos on Alabuga's social media pages don't mention the plant's role at the heart of Russian drone production, but the Special Economic Zone is more open with Russian media. Konstantin Spiridonov, deputy director of a company that made drones for civilian use before the war, gave a video tour of an Alabuga assembly line in March to a Russian blogger. Pointing out young African women, he did not explicitly link the drones to the war but noted their production is now 'very relevant' for Russia. Alabuga Start's social media pages are filled with comments from Africans begging for work and saying they applied but have yet to receive an answer. The program was promoted by education ministries in Uganda and Ethiopia, as well as in African media that portrays it as a way to make money and learn new skills. Initially advertised as a work-study program, Alabuga Start in recent months is more direct about what it offers foreigners, insisting on newer posts that 'is NOT an educational programme,' although one of them still shows young women in plaid school uniforms. When Sierra Leone Ambassador Mohamed Yongawo visited in May and met with five participants from his country, he appeared to believe it was a study program. 'It would be great if we had 30 students from Sierra Leone studying at Alabuga,' he said afterward. Last month, the Alabuga Start social media site said it was 'excited to announce that our audience has grown significantly!' That could be due to its hiring of influencers, including Bassie, a South African with almost 800,000 TikTok and Instagram followers. She did not respond to an AP request for comment. The program, she said, was an easy way to make money, encouraging followers to share her post with job-seeking friends so they could contact Alabuga. 'Where they lack in labor,' she said, 'that’s where you come in.' ___ Associated Press writers Michael Biesecker in Washington and Jamey Keaten in Geneva contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-drones-shahed-africans-11602ab837f0ff4635926d884b422185	2024-10-09T19:04:51-07:00	
Taiwan celebrates its National Day holiday against background of Chinese threats	TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) — Taiwan celebrated its National Day holiday Thursday against the background of threats from China, which claims the self-governing island republic as its own territory. The celebration marks the establishment of the Republic of China, which overthrew the Qing Dynasty in 1911 and fled to Taiwan as Mao Zedong’s Communists swept to power on the mainland during a civil war in 1949. Taiwan was run under martial law until transitioning to full democracy in the 1980s and 1990s but maintains the original constitution brought from China and the ROC flag. President Lai Ching-te took office in May, continuing the eight-year rule of the Democratic Progressive Party that rejects China’s demand that it recognize Taiwan is a part of China. The Nationalists adhere to a unification stance that recognizes both sides of the Taiwan Strait as a single nation. Thursday's commemorations were to include speeches by Lai and others, performances in front of the Presidential Office Building in Taipei, including an honor guard, military marching band and overflight by military aircraft, but no display of heavy military equipment as seen in years past. Maintaining its military pressure on Taiwan, China's People's Liberation Army sent 15 planes across the median line in the Taiwan Strait, prompting Taiwan to scramble jets, dispatch ships and activate missile systems.	https://apnews.com/article/taiwan-national-day-c40f5a7f16e9cb1c12f936d489de283a	2024-10-09T17:38:52-07:00	
Stock market today: Asian shares rise after Wall Street rally, and China promises a briefing	TOKYO (AP) — Asian shares mostly rose Thursday, as market optimism got a perk from the record highs set on Wall Street. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 edged up 0.4% in morning trading to 39,439.50. Australia's S&amp;P/ASX 200 rose 0.6% to 8,239.10. South Korea's Kospi added 0.3% to 2,601.66. Hong Kong's Hang Seng jumped 2.4% to 21,127.55, after a previous day of wild swings. Earlier in the week, the index dropped more than 9%, recording its worst loss since the global financial crisis of 2008. The Shanghai Composite surged 2.0% to 3,324.61. After surging on hopes for stimulus to prop up the world’s second-largest economy, Chinese stocks slumped earlier this week on disappointment that more isn’t on the way. One plus was the announcement from China’s Finance Ministry it will hold a briefing Saturday that could provide details on planned government moves. 'There’s still a glimmer of hope that Beijing might swoop in with a fiscal stimulus lifeline in October to reignite growth. In short, the market is hanging in the balance, waiting for the next big move,' said Stephen Innes, managing partner at SPI Asset Management. On Wall Street, the S&amp;P 500 rose 0.7% to top the all-time high it had set last week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 431 points, or 1%, to hit its own record, while the Nasdaq composite gained 0.6%. Leading the way were cruise-ship companies, whose customers stand to benefit from the surprisingly strong U.S. job market. Norwegian Cruise Line steamed 10.9% higher after analysts at Citi upgraded its stock and said data suggests growth for the cruise industry 'has real legs' into 2025 and beyond. Carnival rose 7%, and Royal Caribbean Group gained 5.3%. KinderCare Learning rose 8.9% in its debut on the New York Stock Exchange. It has over 2,400 early childhood education centers and before- and after-school sites across the country for kids aged between six weeks and 12 years. They helped offset a 3.4% slump for Boeing. The aerospace giant withdrew a contract offer that would have given striking workers 30% raises over four years following a break down in labor talks. Alphabet also kept the market’s gains in check after the heavyweight stock sank 1.5%. The U.S. Department of Justice is considering asking a federal judge to break up its Google business after its search engine was declared an illegal monopoly. A breakup is one of many possible remedies under review. All told, the S&amp;P 500 rose 40.91 points to 5,792.04. The Dow jumped 431.63 to 42,512.00, and the Nasdaq composite gained 108.70 to 18,291.62. In the oil market, a barrel of Brent crude, the international standard, recovered to rise 34 cents to $73.58 a barrel. It briefly topped $81 early this week. Benchmark U.S. crude gained 34 cents to $76.92 per barrel. Earlier leaps for oil driven by worries about worsening tensions in the Middle East had helped drag the S&amp;P 500 on Monday to its worst loss in a month. In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.07% from 4.01% late Tuesday. Treasury yields have swung recently, first sharply downward through the spring and summer and then turning upward in the last week or so. They’ve followed traders’ expectations for what the Federal Reserve is likely to do with overnight interest rates. The central bank has just begun cutting interest rates from a two-decade high, as it widens its focus to include keeping the economy humming instead of just fighting high inflation. That caused the sharp easing of rates through the summer, but recent reports have shown the U.S. economy remains stronger than expected. In currency trading, the U.S. dollar inched down to 149.15 Japanese yen from 149.16 yen.

Turkey's navy starts to evacuate its citizens from Beirut as Israel battles Hezbollah	BEIRUT (AP) — Over 2,000 Turkish citizens and some foreign nationals started boarding a Turkish military ship late Wednesday that brought in aid and will take them out of a country being hit by Israeli airstrikes targeting Hezbollah. Zehra Cibbin, an ethnic Arab from the southeastern Turkish city of Mardin who lives in Beirut with her Lebanese husband, got off a bus packed with the other evacuees, her two children in tow and luggage in hand. 'It’s indescribable. They bombed the street below our house. From that moment on, it was over for me, I said I didn’t want to stay in Beirut anymore,' said Cibbin, 46. Cibbin said they decided to leave Beirut out of fear for their lives, putting no thought into what will happen when they arrive in Turkey. She spoke to The Associated Press before getting in line to board the TCG Bayraktar amphibious landing vessel, which along with the TCG Sancaktar will take on evacuees. They are part of a six-ship convoy including escorts that set sail from the southern Turkish port of Mersin early Wednesday, transported 300 tons of humanitarian supplies, including food, hygiene kits, kitchenware, tents, beds and blankets. Besides the Turkish citizens, people from Bulgaria, Romania and Kazakhstan were among those who applied to evacuate on the ships. Officials did not provide numbers. The Associated Press was the only non-government media invited aboard the ships to cover the evacuation operation. 'Israel’s aggression has severely impacted Lebanon and our brothers here,' said Turkish Ambassador to Lebanon Ali Baris Ulusoy, standing in front of the Bayraktar. 'We are carrying out an operation today with two aims: to provide humanitarian aid to our Lebanese brothers and to ensure the safe return of our citizens who are in a difficult situation.' Ulusoy said. Hundreds lined up before the Bayraktar as Turkish soldiers and sailors checked the evacuees’ passports and their luggage was examined by metal detectors and drug-sniffing dogs before they were allowed to board Another Turkish citizen waiting with her family was Abir Gokcimen, who said she left her extended family and husband in Beirut and hopes the war that spread to Lebanon will end soon. She hopes to come back to Lebanon as soon as the danger passes. The journey back to Mersin is expected to take about 10 hours. Turkey's government plans to organize more sea evacuations if necessary and is contemplating charter flights to repatriate citizens. Hezbollah began firing rockets into northern Israel on Oct. 8, 2023, the day after Hamas’ surprise attack into Israel ignited the war in Gaza. Hezbollah and Hamas are both allied with Iran, and Hezbollah says its attacks are aimed at aiding the Palestinians. Israel has carried out airstrikes in response and the conflict steadily escalated, erupting into a full-fledged war last month. Israel has inflicted a punishing wave of blows against Hezbollah in recent weeks and says it will keep fighting until tens of thousands of displaced Israeli citizens can return to their homes in the north. More than 1,300 people have been killed in Lebanon and over a million displaced since the fighting escalated in mid-September. Earlier on Wednesday, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan ramped up his rhetoric against Israel during his party’s first meeting of the new legislative year, declaring that Turkey 'has more than enough power to thwart expansionist ambitions' of Israel and doubling down on his claims that Israel would target Turkey after Gaza and Lebanon. ___ AP journalist Suzan Fraser contributed from Ankara. ___ Follow AP's coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/mideast-wars	https://apnews.com/article/mideast-wars-turkey-lebanon-israel-evacuations-cea598e62da5a649095d98e13f84a34a	2024-10-09T16:08:19-07:00	
Climate solution: Form Energy secures $405M to speed development of long-awaited 100-hour battery	Form Energy, a company that is beginning to produce a longer-lasting alternative to lithium batteries, hit a milestone Wednesday with an announcement of $405 million in funding. The money will allow Form to speed up manufacturing at its first factory in Weirton, West Virginia and continue research and development. Manufacturing long-duration energy storage at a commercial scale is seen as essential for lowering carbon emissions that are causing climate change, because it makes clean energy available when the sun isn’t shining or the wind isn’t blowing. 'I’m incredibly proud of how far our team has come in scaling our iron-air battery technology,' Mateo Jaramillo, CEO of Form Energy, said via email. Investment company T. Rowe Price led the funding. GE Vernova, a spin-off of General Electric’s energy businesses, and several venture capital firms were also involved. 'With this new funding ... we’re ready to accelerate multi-day battery deployments to meet the rising demand for a cleaner, and more reliable grid. I’m grateful for our team’s hard work and the trust our partners have placed in us as we push toward our mission of building energy storage for a better world.' Lithium batteries typically last four hours. Form is one of many companies pursuing entirely different chemistries. Its batteries use iron, water and air and are able to store energy for 100 hours, meaning if they work at scale, they could bridge a period of several days without sunlight or wind. Iron is also one of the most abundant elements on Earth, which the company says helps make this technology affordable and scalable. In collaboration with Great River Energy, the company broke ground on its first commercial battery installation in Cambridge, Minnesota in August. It's expected to come online in 2025 and will store extra energy that can be used during times of higher electricity demand. Other Form Energy batteries in Minnesota, Colorado and California are expected to come online next year. There are projects in New York, Georgia and Virginia set for 2026. To date, Form Energy has raised more than $1.2 billion from investors. _____ The last line of this story has been corrected to reflect that the $1.2 billion raised so far is only from investors, not from any government entities. ____ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Ratan Tata, the former chairman of Indian conglomerate Tata Sons, dies at age 86	NEW DELHI (AP) — Ratan Tata, a former chairman of Indian conglomerate Tata Sons, died at a Mumbai hospital on Wednesday night. He was 86. Tata Sons chairman N Chandrasekaran confirmed Tata’s death and described him in a statement as his 'friend, mentor, and guide.' He did not provide a cause of death. Tata was admitted this week to the Breach Candy Hospital in south Mumbai, the city where he lived. Soon after he was hospitalized, Tata issued a statement on Monday saying there was no cause for concern regarding his health and he was undergoing checkups for age-related medical conditions. Prime Minister Narendra Modi described Tata as a visionary leader, and a compassionate and an extraordinary human being. 'He provided stable leadership to one of India’s oldest and most prestigious business houses. At the same time, his contribution went far beyond boardrooms,' Modi said on X. 'Tata endeared himself to several people, thanks to his humility, kindness and an unwavering commitment to making our society better,' Modi said in his tributes, referring to his philanthropy work. Industrialist Harsh Goenka called him a 'titan.' Google CEO Sundar Pichai, said Ratan Tata left behind an extraordinary business and philanthropic legacy and he was instrumental in mentoring and developing modern business leadership in India. 'My last meeting with Ratan Tata at Google, we talked about the progress of Waymo and his vision was inspiring to hear,' Pichai said on X. 'He deeply cared about making India better,' he said. Mukesh Ambani, chairman and managing director of Reliance Industries, said, 'It is a very sad day for India and India Inc. Ratan Tata’s passing away is a big loss, not just to the Tata Group, but to every Indian.' 'With him gone, all we can do is to commit to emulating his example,' Anand Mahindra, chairman of the Mahindra Group, said on X. Tata received the Padma Bhushan, one of India’s most distinguished civilian awards, in 2000 and ``Padma Vibhushan' in 2008, Tata Group is a sprawling collection of nearly 100 companies, including the country’s largest automaker, the largest private steel company and a leading outsourcing firm. The companies employ more than 350,000 people worldwide. In June 2008, Tata bought Jaguar and Land Rover from Ford for $2.3 billion. Tata pioneered commercial aviation in India when it launched an airline in 1932 that later became Air India. The government later took it over. Tata Group bought state-owned Air India in 2021. It also started a full-service carrier, Vistara, with Singapore Airlines, but recently merged it with Air India. Tata companies include Tata Steel, Tata Motors, Tata Power and the information technology company Tata Consultancy Services. In 2009, the company surprised the automobile industry by launching Tata Nano, a tiny vehicle with a rear engine costing about 100,000 rupees (then $2,000). Publicized as a 'People’s Car,' it could seat up to five adults. Ratan Tata had said it would provide a 'safe, affordable, all-weather form of transport' to millions of middle- and lower-income Indian consumers. However, due to the low sales of the tiny car, the company stopped its production in 2018. Ratan Tata graduated from Cornell University with a bachelor’s degree in architecture. He joined the Tata group in 1961 and succeeded J.R.D. Tata as chairman of Tata Sons upon the latter’s retirement in 1991. In December 2012, Tata retired as chairman of the Tata Sons. He briefly served as interim chairman beginning Oct. 2016, following the ouster of his successor, Cyrus Mistry. He returned to retirement in 2017 when Natarajan Chandrasekaran was appointed chairman of the Tata Group.	https://apnews.com/article/india-ratan-tata-death-06f48744f603ae3797e4f5df395fdd6d	2024-10-09T10:06:11-07:00

Saudi Arabia loses bid for a seat on UN's premier human rights body	UNITED NATIONS (AP) — Saudi Arabia was defeated for a seat in the U.N.’s premier human rights body Wednesday after a campaign by rights groups urging the world body's members to reject its bid. The 193-member General Assembly elected 18 new members to serve on the 47-nation Human Rights Council, which allocates seats to regional groups to ensure geographical representation. The Geneva-based council reviews the human rights records of all countries periodically, appoints independent investigators to examine and report on issues like torture and situations in countries like North Korea, Iran and Myanmar, and sends fact-finding missions to investigate rights violations, including in Ukraine. It was created in 2006 to replace a human rights commission discredited because of some members’ poor rights records. But the new council soon came to face similar criticism, including that countries sought seats to protect themselves and their allies. This year, the Asia-Pacific group had the only contested slate in the election, with six candidates for five seats. Thailand received 177 votes, Cyprus and Qatar 167 votes, South Korea 161 votes, Marshall Islands 124 votes and Saudi Arabia 117 votes. Before the vote, Louis Charbonneau, U.N. director at Human Rights Watch, called Saudi Arabia 'unfit to serve on the Human Rights Council.' He pointed to the rights group’s documentation of Saudi border guards opening fire and likely killing hundreds of Ethiopian migrants and asylum seekers trying to cross the Yemen-Saudi border in 2022 and 2023, and the lack of accountability for the 2018 killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. 'Governments that commit crimes against humanity or similar atrocities and ensure impunity for those responsible shouldn’t be rewarded with seats on the U.N.’s top human rights body,' Charbonneau said. Saudi Arabia’s U.N. Mission didn't immediately respond to calls and an email seeking comment. A letter sent last year by Saudi Arabia’s mission to the U.N. in Geneva said that it 'categorically refutes' allegations that the kingdom carries out any 'systematic' killings on the border. Human Rights Watch and other groups also criticized other candidates. United Nations Watch in Switzerland, Human Rights Foundation in the United States and the Raoul Wallenberg Center for Human Rights in Canada called for the General Assembly to oppose Qatar, Bolivia, Congo and Ethiopia, declaring them 'unqualified' because of poor rights records. But all the candidates from other regions where there were no contested slates were elected. The 18 countries will serve three-year terms starting on Jan. 1, 2025. The Africa group’s Benin, Congo, Ethiopia, Gambia and Kenya won seats. So did the Latin America and Caribbean group’s candidates Bolivia, Colombia and Mexico and the Central and Eastern Europe group’s candidates, the Czech Republic and North Macedonia. The three candidates for the so-called Western and others group known as WEOG also won easy election — Iceland, Spain and Switzerland — after the United States announced in late September that it wouldn’t seek a second consecutive term. U.S. State Department spokesman Matthew Miller told reporters then that the Biden administration was engaged with its allies 'about the best way to move forward' and said Iceland, Spain and Switzerland would be able to represent American interests and values.	https://apnews.com/article/united-nations-saudi-arabia-human-rights-council-2276e8bce8a1c5de838d250aa968bd64	2024-10-09T08:09:37-07:00	
UN tribunal orders ex-official to repay $58.8 million lost in bad deals while getting perks	UNITED NATIONS (AP) — A U.N. tribunal has ordered a former high-ranking official to repay the United Nations $58.8 million lost in deals he made with a British businessman who showered him with interest-free loans, a Mercedes for his wife and perks for his sons. The three-judge United Nations Dispute Tribunal ruled that evidence 'clearly and convincingly' shows that Vitaly Vanshelboim’s misconduct 'caused massive financial losses' by the U.N. Office for Project Services, which says it provides infrastructure, procurement and project management services and is known as UNOPS. The Geneva-based tribunal said last week that Vanshelboim facilitated multiple financial deals between the U.N. office and British businessman David Kendrick focusing on renewable energy, sustainable housing and the oceans. At the same time, the tribunal said Vanshelboim entered into a series of private arrangements with Kendrick and his businesses stretching back to 2017 — which he never disclosed to the U.N. as required — and 'obtained direct financial and material benefits for himself and his family in the amount of at least $3,133,186.10.' Secretary-General Antonio Guterres 'is pleased by this judgment,' U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said Tuesday. 'The U.N. continues to pursue recovery of the funds through other avenues,' he said. 'We are fully committed to ensuring criminal accountability for crimes that may involve U.N. personnel,' he said, adding it would cooperate with national authorities on any investigations. Dujarric did not elaborate. Vanshelboim's lawyer, George Irving, said in an email Wednesday that his client is appealing the decision, and declined to comment. Emails sent to three companies that the tribunal says are connected to Kendrick were not immediately returned, and his previous lawyers in London said he was no longer a client. Other contact information for Kendrick could not be found. The New York Times first reported the ruling. Vanshelboim, a Ukrainian, had been an assistant secretary-general, serving either as UNOPS deputy executive director or director of its sustainable infrastructure impact investments program. He was fired in January 2023 following an internal investigation. The investments by UNOPS, which lost millions of dollars, became public in 2022 with media reports followed by the resignation of Grete Faremo, a former Norwegian minister of justice and public security, as the head of Copenhagen-based UNOPS. The Dispute Tribunal was ruling on Vanshelboim’s appeal of the fine on his dismissal of 12 months' salary and an order for him to pay the U.N. over $63.6 million in losses incurred from the deals, with his U.N. pension withheld until the sum was paid. The judges ruled that Vanshelboim’s failure to disclose any of his financial dealings with Kendrick constituted 'blatant misconduct' and said he 'committed fraud against the organization by leading it into multiple business partnerships with the Kendrick entities, with which he engaged in undisclosed and unauthorized outside activities.' The judgment said Vanshelboim was tasked with identifying potential partners and that UNOPS allocated money 'with the specific intention to develop projects that would attract private investors.' The judges said Vanshelboim did not disclose that his wife was being paid by Kendrick for services, including helping the businessman locate, purchase and renovate an apartment in Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv. Vanshelboim did not disclose that in July 2017 he entered into a tennis sponsorship agreement with Kendrick for his youngest son. The U.N. said the amount was $1.2 million, which Vanshelboim called 'grossly exaggerated.' Nonetheless, the judges said when Vanshelboim's son was told what Kendrick was going to pay him, he wrote: 'this is insane, how is this possible. I’m not even a good tennis player yet.' In reply, his father wrote part 'of my job is to make insane things happen.' The judgment also revealed that Kendrick granted Vanshelboim 'an interest-free revolving loan facility' for five years, with a limit of $500,000 per year and a total cap of $2 million. It said Vanshelboim used Kendrick’s credit cards for his personal expenses between October 2018 and December 2020. In addition, Kendrick paid for repairs to Vanshelboim's property in Mamaroneck, New York, and for custom furniture and home accessories — half for his apartment in Kyiv and half for his son’s apartment, the judgment said. Vanshelboim also purchased a Mercedes Benz luxury vehicle for his wife with funds from Kendrick and his entities, it said. The tribunal said Vanshelboim 'misled the organization by both omitting his blatant conflict of interest with Mr. Kendrick and 'pushing’ UNOPS to enter into highly risky deals with the Kendrick entities, while minimizing concerns and concealing relevant information.' It said he can be held responsible for $58.8 million, the amount that UNOPS lost, minus nearly $4.83 million in interest and fees that it said were less clear. 'However, he may seek contribution elsewhere from any others deemed responsible as well,' the tribunal said.	https://apnews.com/article/un-official-misconduct-tribunal-ruling-1607271b8999dee627c96d62f095d8e4	2024-10-09T07:13:05-07:00	
The Latest: Hurricane Milton threatens to overshadow presidential campaigning	Hurricane Milton is threatening to overshadow presidential campaigning as it menaces Florida. The storm has already scrambled Donald Trump's schedule. He put off a virtual event Tuesday night focused on health care and postpone a Univision town hall in Miami. He was in Pennsylvania on Wednesday. President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris denounced the misinformation and disinformation surrounding the federal response to Hurricane Helene, which hit last week and killed more than 220 people. Both singled out Trump as driving much of the falsehoods. Harris plans to head to Nevada and Arizona on Thursday. She spent Tuesday in New York taping interviews on ABC’s 'The View,' with radio personality Howard Stern and on 'The Late Show with Stephen Colbert. Follow the AP’s Election 2024 coverage at: https://apnews.com/hub/election-2024. Here’s the latest: Trump talks about Hurricane Milton Trump says he is praying for the people of Florida as Hurricane Milton begins lashing the state. Speaking at a rally in Scranton, Pennsylvania, Trump says he wants to 'send our love to everyone in Florida. They’re going through a big one tonight.' Trump went on to say that he was 'praying for' those in the storm’s path and 'asking God to keep them all safe.' 'I’ve never seen a hurricane like that. So often you know, they talk about it and they talk talk talk because they want you to watch. This is the real deal. This is a bad one,' he said. He added that many of the states expected to be impacted have Republican governors whom he predicted would 'do a phenomenal job.' Walz talks about Hurricane Milton Campaigning in Arizona, where early voting kicked off on Wednesday, Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Walz, talked about Hurricane Milton moving toward Florida and said, 'Those are Americans. Those are our neighbors. Those are our family members. Those are our friends.' Walz, the Minnesota governor, called unifying across party lines in the face of natural disasters 'critical.' 'It’s not about politics. It’s about basic human decency,' Walz said. 'It’s about leadership and character.' Trump insults Harris at Pennsylvania rally Trump is continuing to insult Harris at a rally in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and says he has no interest in stopping, even if turns some voters off. 'I don’t want to be nice,' Trump said at his first of two rallies of the day in the pivotal battleground state. 'You know, somebody said, ‘You should be nicer. Women won’t like it.’ I said, ’I don’t care.' 'The women want safety and the women want to have a country they can be proud of, I think,' he says. Trump, as usual, is casting Harris as 'an incompetent person,' calling her 'grossly incompetent' and 'totally ill-quipped to do the job of being President of the United States' He also criticized the hosts of 'The View,' where Harris appeared on Tuesday. He called one of the women hosts 'dumber than Kamala. She’s a dummy,' he said. 'That is one dumb woman. Sorry. I’m sorry, women, she’s a dummy.' In-person voting has started in Arizona Early in-person voting has started in Arizona, making it the first of this year’s presidential battleground states where all residents can cast a ballot at a traditional polling place ahead of Election Day. The start of in-person voting on Wednesday in the closely contested state also is drawing the presidential tickets. Both campaigns scheduled visits here this week. Each of Arizona’s 15 counties is required to open at least one site for in-person voting, which runs until the Friday before the Nov. 5 general election. In-person voting begins next week in four more presidential swing states — Georgia, Michigan, North Carolina and Nevada. Marjorie Taylor Greene's suggestions that Democrats control the weather is ‘beyond ridiculous,’ Biden says President Joe Biden is calling 'beyond ridiculous' suggestions by a Republican congresswoman that Democrats are controlling the weather, and might even be directing especially strong storms toward conservative parts of the country. During a briefing at the White House on federal preparations for Hurricane Milton, Biden denounced widespread misinformation about the federal assistance that’s available to victims. He called out Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene by name, saying she was suggesting 'the federal government is literally controlling the weather. We’re controlling the weather. It’s beyond ridiculous. It’s gotta stop.' The president referenced Greene’s comments again later in the briefing, calling them 'off the wall.' 'It’s like out of a comic book,' Biden said Biden discusses FEMA's efforts President Joe Biden has told the head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, 'You’re doing a hell of a job.' Biden made the comment to FEMA chief Deanne Criswell during a virtual briefing at the White House with federal authorities bracing for Hurricane Milton’s making landfall in Florida. It was meant as a compliment, but it immediately recalled then-President George W. Bush telling his FEMA director, Michael Brown, 'Brownie, you’re doing a heck of a job.' Bush said that before the extent of the mismanaged federal response to 2005’s Hurricane Katrina had become clear and it later long haunted him. South Dakota kicks 273 people off its voter rolls with voting underway South Dakota’s top elections official has removed hundreds of people from the state’s voter rolls even with voting already underway. Republican Secretary of State Monae Johnson says the move was necessary to defend the integrity of the election. But critics say it violates a federal law and could disenfranchise valid voters who are naturalized U.S. citizens. The American Civil Liberties Union of South Dakota has called for the 273 voters to be reinstated. South Dakota was one of the first states to begin early voting for the November general election. Absentee voting began Sept. 20. Harris warns against price gouging Vice President Kamala Harris warned against jacking up prices on Americans dealing with back-to-back hurricanes. 'Those evacuating before Hurricane Milton or recovering from Hurricane Helene should not be subject to illegal price gouging or fraud — at the pump, airport, or hotel counter,' she said in a statement on Wednesday. Harris said the federal government is tracking allegations and 'will hold those taking advantage of the situation accountable.' President Joe Biden made a similar demand Tuesday. 'I’m calling on the airlines and other companies to provide as much service as possible to accommodate evacuations and not to engage in price gouging, to just do it on the level,' he said at the White House. Biden says Congress needs to step up after Hurricane Helene President Joe Biden says that the destruction from Hurricane Helene is going to cost billions of dollars that victims will need quickly and that 'Congress better be ready to step up to help.' Biden made the comments in excerpts of his interview recorded Tuesday with theGiro. The excerpts were released as Hurricane Milton threatens to unleash new devastation in Florida. Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, who replaced him at the top of the Democratic Election Day ticket, have previously criticized former President Donald Trump, now the Republican nominee, for spreading false information about the federal response to Helene. In the interview excerpts, Biden says that, 'A lot of folks are out there spreading lies about what we are not doing, that things are not going well. That we are not responding.' He responded, 'We’ve been completely responsive, and we’ve been ahead of the game.' Trump schedules rally in New York for end of October Donald Trump is returning to New York in the race’s final stretch, scheduling a rally at the city’s iconic Madison Square Garden stadium. Trump is planning his event for Oct. 27, kicking off the final week of campaigning, according to a campaign official familiar with the plans who spoke on condition of anonymity before a formal announcement. It will be Trump’s second rally in the city he grew up in following a stop in the South Bronx in May. Trump has claimed he believes he can win New York, even though it is an overwhelmingly Democratic state and the city even more so. But such an event is likely to draw outsized media attention. The former president is also campaigning this week in other Democratic states, including California and Colorado. — By Jill Colvin	https://apnews.com/article/harris-trump-election-2024-b635227719e4f237fe74b72ccfef1c26	2024-10-09T05:48:34-07:00	
The death toll in a gang attack on a small Haitian town rises to 115, a local official says	PONT-SONDÉ, Haiti (AP) — The death toll in a brutal gang attack last week on a small town in central Haiti has risen to 115, a local official told The Associated Press on Wednesday. The attack on residents of Pont-Sondé on Oct. 3 was one of the biggest massacres that Haiti has seen in recent history. Myriam Fièvre, mayor of the nearby city of Saint-Marc, said Wednesday that the toll had risen to 115 and would likely keep rising because authorities are still looking for bodies and haven’t been able to access certain areas of the town. 'We are working to make sure that the population is protected,' she said in a phone interview. The U.N. had previously said that at least 70 people were killed last week when the Gran Grif gang invaded the town in the central Artibonite region. The victims included babies, young mothers and the elderly, with the gang approaching Pont-Sondé via canoes to catch residents by surprise, according to a local human rights group. Survivors have questioned why authorities did not do anything to stop the attack since the gang had warned in a video posted on social media that it planned to target Pont-Sondé. A day after the attack, officials replaced the police commissioner who oversees the Artibonite region, which has seen a surge of gang violence in recent years, with at least 20 criminal groups operating in the area, according to the U.N. More than 6,200 survivors have fled Pont-Sondé and temporarily settled in the coastal city of Saint-Marc and surrounding areas. A majority of them are staying with relatives, but more than 750 others have nowhere to go and are sleeping on the floors of a church, a school and a public plaza in Saint-Marc, according to the U.N.’s International Organization for Migration. As Saint-Marc struggles with the sudden influx of people, Fièvre warned that the Gran Grif gang is infiltrating nearby communities after attacking Pont-Sondé. Haiti’s National Human Rights Defense Network has said the gang was angry that a local self-defense group was trying to limit gang activity in Pont-Sondé and prevent it from profiting off a makeshift road toll it had recently established nearby. Gran Grif has about 100 members and has been accused of crimes including murder, rape, robberies and kidnappings. It was formed after former legislator Prophane Victor began arming young men nearly a decade ago to secure his election and control of the area, according to the U.N Victor and the Gran Grif leader, Luckson Elan, were sanctioned by the U.S. last month. Elan also was sanctioned by the U.N. Security Council, which noted that Gran Grif 'is the largest and most powerful' gang in Artibonite, committing nine mass kidnappings from October 2023 to January 2024, including that of 157 people. ___ Sanon reported from Port-au-Prince, Haiti	https://apnews.com/article/haiti-gang-attack-pontsonde-gran-grif-1a45faafb929a605f30af4efd8454aeb	2024-10-09T05:11:29-07:00	
Alfonso Cuarón and Cate Blanchett made a television series. 'Disclaimer' is already a triumph	VENICE, Italy (AP) — 'Disclaimer' pulls the rug out from the audience before they’ve had the chance to get settled. There’s no building of empathy for its central character, Cate Blanchett’s Catherine Ravenscroft. There’s no luxuriating in her banal every day, at work or in her plush London home with her snobbish husband (Sacha Baron Cohen) and directionless, resentful adult son (Kodi Smit-McPhee). All we know at the beginning of the seven-part series, which begins rolling out on Apple TV+ Friday, is that she’s an acclaimed documentary filmmaker who is being feted by Christiane Amanpour. But almost immediately her life starts to spiral when she receives an anonymous, self-published book about a young mother on vacation in Italy with her toddler son that’s shockingly familiar. The woman in the book meets a young man who later drowns while trying to save her son. When the police question her, she denies knowing him and returns to London. It’s a memory that Catherine has long kept buried and secret but has now emerged in spectacularly embarrassing, reputation-destroying fashion along with a batch of intimate, provocative photos that the young man, Jonathan (Louis Partridge) took the night before. 'Disclaimer' throws you into the fire; And like everyone else in the show, from strangers reading the book to Catherine’s husband, you start making assumptions about and judging her. Not even Blanchett was immune reading the script. She wondered: Is this woman awful? 'I was shocked at the layers of judgment that I transposed on the character,' Blanchett said. 'The challenge and agony of playing a character like this is that the crisis happens as soon as you meet her. We know nothing about her, only what people are saying about her.' Told in seven chapters, the psychological thriller comes from Oscar-winning director Alfonso Cuarón who read Renée Knight’s book before he’d even made 'Roma.' The filmmaker had never dabbled in longform before, but soon realized while writing the script that it was the only way to tell it in a satisfying way. Instead of getting hung up on the ins-and-outs of making a television show, he decided he would just do it his way: Like a film, or, rather, seven films. After all, Rainer Werner Fassbinder, David Lynch and Krzysztof Kieślowski had done it too. Cuarón had written Catherine with only Blanchett in mind, an actor he knew had the incredible range and sophistication required by the role. He teased that he was also jealous of his friends Alejandro Iñárritu and Guillermo del Toro, who had already had the privilege of directing (and raving about) her. What he didn’t expect, and was pleasantly surprised about, was her complete and total commitment as a producer, even as the shoot stretched on to nearly a year. 'I enjoy collaboration,' Blanchett said. 'I’m interested in the whole thing. And I think you have to know when you are going to be useful and when you need to just sit back and be quiet.' Sometimes, Cuarón said, he’d be on board with her suggestions. Other times he chose a different path and usually regretted it. But they consulted on everything from the smallest details (like prop placement) to the biggest, including the script and casting Kevin Kline as Stephen Brigstocke, the father of the young man Catherine met so many years ago. He’s recently lost his wife too, has retired from his job and has nothing but time to stew about how his happy life became so tragic. Revenge is on his mind. The series plays with form and storytelling, with flashbacks, different perspectives, timelines and narrators dolling out information. Amanpour at the outset, in what is meant to be complimentary to Catherine, frames the whole thing aptly: 'Beware of narrative and form. Their power can bring us closer to the truth, but they can also be a weapon with a great power to manipulate.' In that spirit, Cuarón’s longtime cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki even suggested bringing in another director of photography, Bruno Delbonnel, to add a different visual element as well. Don’t worry if that sounds like you need a film degree to recognize or appreciate the distinction between a Lubezki or a Delbonnel shot. 'It’s not about noticing,' Cuarón said. 'It’s about the experience and following different narratives. We try to approach each one of these narratives with a different language.' 'Disclaimer' debuted like a film too, at the Venice Film Festival last month. Though the festival often hosts auteur-driven series alongside the feature films, they’re not often discussed in the same breath as the competition slate of Oscar hopefuls. 'Disclaimer' hit differently, though. In a lineup that had all forms of ambitious cinematic fare from modern masters, some were even calling the show 'the best film of the festival.' Audiences were shown episodes one through four one day, and the final three on the next. While Cuarón welcomes viewers to manage their own viewing schedule, whether it’s as they drop on Apple TV+ (two episodes on Oct. 11, two on Oct. 18, and one every Friday following) waiting to watch in two batches, divided up as they were in Venice, isn’t a bad idea either. The main thing, Blanchett and Cuarón agree, is that attention is key. Also, it’s something you might find yourself wanting to watch again after the finale airs on Nov. 8. 'Something we talked about was the hope that people went back and watched it again and have an entirely different perspective on things that we take for granted,' Blanchett said. Cuarón went a step further: 'A second view should give you a completely different reading than the first view.'	https://apnews.com/article/cate-blanchett-alfonso-cuaron-series-disclaimer-dad35604feabca8075575d4137b746a0	2024-10-09T03:50:59-07:00	
Germany's economy is on track to shrink for a second straight year	BERLIN (AP) — Germany's government said Wednesday that the country's economy, Europe's biggest, is on track to shrink for a second consecutive year — underlining the unpopular administration's troubles as it heads into a difficult election year. The new forecast that gross domestic product will shrink by 0.2% this year compares with the government's prediction in April of 0.3% growth and brings it into line with economists, who also have forecast a slight contraction. The German economy shrank by 0.3% in 2023. The government forecast growth of 1.1% next year and 1.6% in 2025. Vice Chancellor Robert Habeck, who is also the economy minister, said that the German economy hasn't seen powerful growth since 2018 as the country's own structural problems have been joined by wider global challenges. 'In the middle of the crises, Germany and Europe are squeezed between China and the U.S., and must learn to assert themselves,' he said in a statement. Habeck argued that the government has tackled many of Germany's homemade problems — securing its energy supply, speeding up planning procedures, trimming bureaucracy and trying to address a shortage of skilled workers. The German Chamber of Commerce and Industry said that such measures need to be implemented quickly and more reforms are required to encourage investment. Its chief executive, Martin Wansleben, said that Germany has only once before had two successive years of recession — in 2002 and 2003, when the government at the time launched a series of welfare state reforms — and that GDP is only half a percentage point above its level before the COVID-19 pandemic. 'There has never yet been such a prolonged phase of weakness in the German economy,' he said. Chancellor Olaf Scholz's three-party coalition government has seen its popularity plunge over nearly three years in office. It has become notorious for constant infighting, for instance over next year's budget. The center-right opposition leads polls before a national election scheduled for September, and the far-right Alternative for Germany also has performed strongly in recent state and European Parliament elections.	https://apnews.com/article/germany-economy-gdp-recession-government-a4d30f2e398d12afbd793d69c5ac76de	2024-10-09T03:35:04-07:00	
Zelenskyy will present his Ukraine 'victory plan' to Western leaders but Biden meeting is postponed	DUBROVNIK, Croatia (AP) — Ukraine's president on Wednesday said he intends to present his 'victory plan' to Western leaders this week, but a weekend meeting to discuss it has been postponed as U.S. President Joe Biden said he had to stay home to respond to Hurricane Milton’ s landfall in Florida. Speaking at a summit in Croatia with leaders of southeastern European states, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he hopes his meeting with Biden at the U.S. Ramstein Air Base in Germany, originally scheduled for Saturday, will be rescheduled soon. That meeting was meant to include about 20 Western leaders and defense ministers. 'We will present our victory plan in detail there, the same as we presented it in the White House,' Zelenskyy said. He added that he now planned to meet with the leaders of Britain, France, Italy and Germany this week to present the plan. Zelenskyy said the plan is about strengthening Ukraine 'both geopolitically and on the battlefield' before any kind of dialogue with Russia. 'Weakness of any of our allies will inspire (Russian President Vladimir) Putin,' he said. 'That’s why we’re asking them to strengthen us, in terms of security guarantees, in terms of weapons, in terms of our future after this war. In my view, he (Putin) only understands force.' The specifics of Zelenskyy’s blueprint have been kept quiet but contours of the plan have emerged, including the need for fast action on decisions Western allies have been mulling since the full-scale invasion began in 2022. Kyiv is still awaiting word from Western partners on its repeated requests to use the long-range weapons they provide to hit targets on Russian soil. Some Balkan states have been providing Ukraine with short-range weapons. At a previous summit with southeast European countries in February, Zelenskyy pleaded for more to repel Russian advances. On Wednesday, Zelenskyy signed an agreement with Croatia on further cooperation, particularly regarding humanitarian aid, demining and war crimes prosecution experience that Croatia has from its own 1991-95 war. Besides Croatia, the summit was being attended by premiers, presidents or foreign ministers from Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Greece, Kosovo, Moldova, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Romania, Serbia, Slovenia and Turkey. Serbia’s President Aleksandar Vucic's government is the only one in Europe that has not imposed sanctions on Russia over its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, although Vucic has repeatedly said that Serbia respects Ukraine’s 'territorial integrity.' Summit participants passed a declaration condemning Russia's aggression against Ukraine and supporting Zelenskyy's peace efforts, Ukraine's membership in NATO and its reconstruction after the war. 'There can be no free, peaceful and prosperous Europe without a free, peaceful and prosperous Ukraine,' the joint declaration said.	https://apnews.com/article/croatia-ukraine-summit-southeast-europe-14888717f7e62179dd5ac9e6dd9274c5	2024-10-09T02:51:10-07:00	
Ukrainian drone strikes another arms depot inside Russia, officials say	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — A Ukrainian drone struck an important arms depot inside Russia, the Ukraine military said Wednesday, three weeks after another drone blasted a major Russian armory and three days after a drone smashed into a key oil terminal in Russia-occupied Crimea. The Tuesday night strike targeted an arsenal in Russia’s Bryansk border region where missiles and artillery munitions were stored, including some that had been delivered by North Korea, a Ukrainian General Staff statement said. Hugely powerful glide bombs that have terrorized civilian areas of Ukraine and bludgeoned Ukrainian army defenses were also kept at the arsenal, located 115 kilometers (70 miles) from the Ukrainian border, and some of the ammunition was stored in the open, it said. 'Striking such arsenals creates serious logistical problems for the Russian army, thus significantly reducing (its) offensive capabilities,' the statement said. Russia is expending enormous amounts of ammunition as it makes its advantage in artillery shells felt on the battlefield in a war of attrition that is approaching its 1,000-day milestone next month. Its slow but relentless drive deeper into Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region is stretching Ukraine’s resources just as some of Kyiv’s key Western partners are being distracted by domestic concerns and Middle East wars. Ukraine is building up its own arms industry, and authorities have identified drones as an important aspect of that. 'Among the key areas identified are drones for our army, and this should be a supply that not only constantly increases in volume, but also evolves and develops in line with the demands of war,' Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a video address late Tuesday about weapons production. The Russian military has also improved its drones’ capabilities and expanded their use. Russian drones targeted Ukraine’s southern Odesa region for the third night in a row on Tuesday, injuring five people, regional Gov. Oleh Kiper said. However, Ukraine’s air defenses have proved resilient against drones. The Ukrainian air force said Wednesday it shot down 21 out of 22 drones that Russia launched over three Ukrainian regions. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-drone-arms-depot-bryansk-096d0ddf453a9000623a91b29c735e3c	2024-10-09T01:31:46-07:00	
An American once imprisoned in Russia is sentenced in absentia as Ukraine mercenary	MOSCOW (AP) — An American who spent three years behind bars in Russia before being released in a prisoner exchange has been convicted in absentia for fighting as a mercenary in Ukraine, Russia's Investigative Committee said Wednesday. The committee, Russia's primary criminal investigation authority, said in a statement that Trevor Reed was sentenced by a Russian court to 14 1/2 years in prison. Reed was injured in the fighting in eastern Ukraine in 2023 and treated in Germany. His whereabouts at the time of the sentencing were not immediately known. Reed, a former US Marine, was arrested in Moscow in 2019 for allegedly assaulting a police officer while heavily intoxicated. Russian authorities claimed he had grabbed the steering wheel of the police vehicle taking him to a so-called 'drunk tank.' However, police did not produce video evidence from the vehicle's camera and Reed's girlfriend, who was following in a separate car, said she did not see the vehicle swerve. The then-US ambassador, John Sullivan, said the evidence against Reed in the trial was so preposterous that 'even the judge laughed.' Reed was sentenced to nine years in prison. He was released in April 2022 in exchange for Russian drug smuggler Konstantin Yaroshenko. He reportedly joined the Ukraine military as a foreign fighter in November 2022. The announcement of Reed's conviction came two days after a Moscow court convicted 72-year-old American Stephen Hubbard of fighting in Ukraine as a mercenary and sentenced him to nearly seven years. Hubbard was captured by Russia about two months after the Febrruary 2022 start of full-scale fighting in Ukraine.	https://apnews.com/article/ukraine-trevor-reed-russia-389dccc3c8f557bc9c598e29d1429773	2024-10-09T01:05:32-07:00	
Israeli offensive in hard-hit northern Gaza kills dozens and threatens hospitals	DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — A large-scale Israeli operation in northern Gaza has killed dozens of people and threatens to shut down three hospitals over a year into the war with Hamas, Palestinian officials and residents said Wednesday. Heavy fighting was underway in Jabaliya, where Israeli forces have carried out several major operations over the course of the war and then returned as militants regroup. The entire north, including Gaza City, has suffered heavy destruction and has been largely isolated by Israeli forces since late last year. The continuing cycle of destruction and death in Gaza, unleashed by Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack on southern Israel, comes as Israel expands a weeklong ground offensive against Hezbollah in Lebanon and considers a major retaliatory strike on Iran. A rocket fired from Lebanon killed two people in the northern Israeli town of Kiryat Shmona, and another six people were wounded in a series of stabbings in the city of Hadera on Wednesday, which Israeli police described as a militant attack. Police said the attacker was 'neutralized,' indicating he was killed. Hezbollah claimed the strike on Kiryat Shmona, saying it targeted 'a gathering of enemy forces' with a rocket salvo. Ofir Yehezkeli, the town's acting mayor, said the two people killed were a couple who were walking their dogs when a rocket fell near them. Residents of Jabaliya, an urban refugee camp dating back to the 1948 war surrounding Israel's creation, said thousands of people have been trapped in their homes since the operation began Sunday, as Israeli jets and drones buzz overhead and troops battle militants in the streets. 'It’s like hell. We can’t get out,' said Mohamed Awda, who lives with his parents and six siblings. He said there were three bodies in the street outside his home that could not be retrieved because of the fighting. 'The quadcopters are everywhere, and they fire at anyone. You can’t even open the window,' he told The Associated Press by phone, speaking over the sound of explosions. Dozens have been killed and survivors fear displacement Gaza's Health Ministry said it recovered 40 bodies from Jabaliya from Sunday until Tuesday, and another 14 from communities farther north. There are likely more bodies under rubble and in areas that can't be accessed, it said. An airstrike in Jabaliya early Wednesday killed at least nine people, including two women and two children, according to Al-Ahly Hospital, which received the bodies. Strikes in central Gaza killed another nine people, including three children, according to Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir al-Balah. Residents of Jabaliya fear Israel’s aim is to depopulate the north and turn it into a closed military zone or a Jewish settlement. Israel has blocked all roads except for the main highway leading south from Jabaliya, according to residents. The U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees said it was evacuating seven schools that were being used as shelters and that only two of eight water wells in the camp are still functioning. 'We are concerned about the displacement to the south,' Ahmed Qamar, who lives in Jabaliya with his wife, children and parents, said in a text message. 'People here say clearly that they will die here in northern Gaza and and won’t go to southern Gaza.' Hospitals are under threat Fadel Naeem, the director of Al-Ahly Hospital in Gaza City, said it had received dozens of wounded people and bodies from the north. 'We declared a state of emergency, suspended scheduled surgeries, and discharged patients whose conditions are stable,' told AP in a text message. Israel’s offensive has gutted Gaza’s health sector, forcing most of its hospitals to shut down and leaving the rest only partially functioning. Naeem said three hospitals farther north — Kamal Adwan, Awda and the Indonesian Hospital - have become almost inaccessible because of the fighting. The Gaza Health Ministry says the Israeli army has ordered all three to evacuate staff and patients. Meanwhile, no humanitarian aid has entered the north since Oct. 1, according to U.N. data. The Israeli military did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the hospitals or the apparent suspension of aid delivery in the north. Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, the military spokesperson, said late Tuesday that Israeli forces were operating in Jabaliya to 'prevent Hamas' regrouping efforts' and had killed around 100 militants, without providing evidence. Israel says it only targets militants and blames civilian deaths on Hamas because it fights in residential areas. Israel ordered the wholesale evacuation of northern Gaza, including Gaza City, in the opening weeks of the war, but hundreds of thousands of people are believed to have remained there. Israel reiterated those instructions over the weekend, telling people to flee south to an expanded humanitarian zone where hundreds of thousands are already crammed into squalid tent camps. The war began just over a year ago, when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250. They still hold around 100 hostages, a third of whom are believed to be dead. Israel's offensive has killed over 42,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not say how many were fighters. It has said women and children make up over half of the dead. The offensive has also caused staggering destruction across the territory and displaced around 90% of the population of 2.3 million people, often multiple times. Israel warns Lebanon it could end up like Gaza Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to keep fighting until 'total victory' over Hamas and the return of all the captives. On Tuesday, he warned that Lebanon would meet the same fate as Gaza if its people did not rise up against Hezbollah, which began firing rockets into Israel after the initial Hamas attack. That set in motion a cycle of escalation that ignited a full-scale war last month. 'You have an opportunity to save Lebanon before it falls into the abyss of a long war that will lead to destruction and suffering like we see in Gaza,' Netanyahu said, addressing the Lebanese people. An Israeli strike killed four people and wounded another 10 at a hotel sheltering displaced people in the southern Lebanese town of Wardaniyeh on Wednesday, according to Lebanon's Health Ministry. An Associated Press reporter in a nearby town heard two sonic booms from Israeli jets before the strike. Plumes of smoke rose from the building after the explosion. In recent weeks Israel has waged a heavy air campaign across large parts of Lebanon, targeting what it says are Hezbollah rocket launchers and other militant sites. A series of strikes killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and most of his top commanders. So far, ground operations appear to be focused on a narrow strip along the border, but Israel has warned people to evacuate dozens of cities and towns, many of them north of a buffer zone declared by the United Nations after the 2006 war between Israel and Hezbollah. Hezbollah's acting leader, Sheikh Naim Kassem, said in a televised statement Tuesday that the group has replaced its slain commanders and was preventing Israeli ground forces from advancing. The militants have extended their rocket fire deeper into Israel, disrupting life but causing few casualties. The Israeli military said Wednesday that Hezbollah has fired more than 12,000 rockets, missiles and drones at Israel since the start of the hostilities last year. Israel is meanwhile considering options for a strike on Iran that could potentially escalate the war on yet another front. Iran, which supports Hezbollah and Hamas, launched a wave of some 180 ballistic missiles at Israel last week in retaliation for the killing of top militants from both groups. ___ Magdy reported from Cairo.

Nobel Prize in chemistry awarded to 3 scientists for work on proteins, building blocks of life	STOCKHOLM (AP) — Three scientists who discovered powerful techniques to predict and even design novel proteins — the building blocks of life — were awarded the Nobel Prize in chemistry on Wednesday. Their work used advanced technologies, including machine learning, and holds the potential to transform how new drugs are made. The prize was awarded to David Baker, who works at the University of Washington in Seattle, and to Demis Hassabis and John Jumper, who both work at Google DeepMind, a British-American artificial intelligence research laboratory based in London. Heiner Linke, chair of the Nobel Committee for Chemistry, said the award honored research that unraveled long-standing scientific mysteries. 'That was actually called a grand challenge in chemistry, and in particular in biochemistry, for decades. So, it’s that breakthrough that gets awarded today,' he said. What is the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for? Proteins are complex molecules with thousands of atoms that twist, turn, loop and spiral in a countless array of shapes. The shape of a protein determines its biological function. For decades, scientists have dreamed of being able to efficiently design and build new proteins. Baker, whose work has received funding from the National Institutes of Health since the 1990s, created a computer program called Rosetta that helped analyze information about existing proteins in comprehensive databases in order to build new proteins that don't exist in nature. 'It seems that you can almost construct any type of protein now with this technology,' said Johan Åqvist of the Nobel committee. Hassabis and Jumper created an artificial intelligence model that has been able to predict the structure of virtually all the 200 million proteins that researchers have identified, the committee added. The duo 'managed to crack the code. With skillful use of artificial intelligence, they made it possible to predict the complex structure of essentially any known protein in nature,' Linke said. Why this work matters? The ability to custom design new proteins — and better understand existing proteins — could enable researchers to create new kinds of medicines and vaccines. It could also allow scientists to design new enzymes to break down plastics or other waste materials, and to design fine-tuned sensors for hazardous materials. 'I think there’s fantastic prospects for making better medicines — medicines that are smarter, that only work in the right time and place in the body,' Baker told The Associated Press. One example is a potential nasal spray that could slow or stop the rapid spread of specific viruses, such as COVID-19, he said. Another is a medicine to disrupt the cascade of symptoms known as cytokine storm. 'That was always the holy grail. If you could figure out how protein sequences folded into their particular structures, then it might be possible to design protein sequences to fold into previously never seen structures that might be useful for us,' said Jon Lorsh of the NIH. Baker said Hassabis and Jumper's artificial intelligence work gave his team a huge boost. 'The breakthroughs made by Demis and John on protein structure prediction really highlighted to us the power that AI could have. And that led us to apply these AI methods to protein design and that has greatly increased the power and accuracy,' he said. How the winners reacted Baker told the AP he found out he won the Nobel during the early hours of the morning alongside his wife, who immediately started screaming. 'So it was a little deafening, too,' he said. Hassabis said in a statement that 'receiving the Nobel Prize is the honor of a lifetime.' One of Britain’s leading tech figures, he co-founded the AI research lab DeepMind in 2010, which was later acquired by Google. DeepMind’s breakthroughs include developing an AI system that mastered the Chinese game of Go and was able to defeat the game’s human world champion much faster than expected. Jumper said in the same statement that it was an honor to be 'recognized for delivering on the long promise of computational biology to help us understand the protein world and to inform the incredible work of experimental biologists.' 'It is a key demonstration that AI will make science faster and ultimately help to understand disease and develop therapeutics,' Jumper said. More about the Nobels Baker gets half of the prize money of 11 million Swedish Kronor ($1 million) while Hassabis and Jumper share the other half. It’s the second Nobel prize that has gone to someone with links to Google. Physics prize winner Geoffrey Hinton also previously worked at the tech company, but later quit so he could speak more freely about the potential dangers of artificial intelligence. Last year, the chemistry award went to three scientists for their work on quantum dots — tiny particles just a few nanometers in diameter that can release very bright colored light and whose applications in everyday life include electronics and medical imaging. Six days of Nobel announcements opened Monday with Americans Victor Ambros and Gary Ruvkun winning the medicine prize. Two founding fathers of machine learning — Hinton and John Hopfield — won the physics prize. The awards continue with the literature prize on Thursday. The Nobel Peace Prize will be announced Friday and the economics award on Oct. 14. The prize money comes from a bequest left by the award’s creator, Swedish inventor Alfred Nobel. The laureates are invited to receive their awards at ceremonies on Dec. 10, the anniversary of Nobel’s death. ___ Corder reported from The Hague, Netherlands, and Larson reported from Washington, D.C.

Middle East latest: Dozens killed as Israeli troops pound central and northern Gaza	Israel’s bombardment of central and northern Gaza has killed dozens of people and trapped thousands in their homes, Palestinian officials said Wednesday, as the death toll in the yearlong war passed 42,000. Gaza’s Health Ministry said it recovered 40 bodies from Jabaliya from Sunday until Tuesday, and another 14 from communities farther north. The toll is likely higher as there are bodies buried under the rubble and in areas that can’t be accessed, it said. Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, the military spokesperson, said that Israeli forces were operating in Jabaliya to prevent Hamas from regrouping and had killed about 100 militants, without providing evidence. Israel says it only targets militants and blames civilian deaths on Hamas because it fights in residential areas. A year ago, Hamas-led militants blew holes in Israel’s security fence and stormed into army bases and farming communities, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting another 250. They are still holding about 100 captives inside Gaza, a third of whom are believed to be dead. Israel is now at war with Hamas in Gaza and its ally Hezbollah in Lebanon, which began firing rockets at Israel on Oct. 8, 2023. ___ Here is the latest: Airstrike kills 5 Lebanese Civil Defense paramedics, officials say BEIRUT — An Israeli airstrike hit a Lebanese Civil Defense center in the town of Dardghaya in southern Lebanon, killing five members stationed there Wednesday, civil defense spokesperson Elie Khairallah told The Associated Press. The Lebanese Health Ministry also confirmed the news in a statement, saying Israel has 'renewed its targeting of rescue and ambulance crews tonight, disregarding international laws, norms and humanitarian conventions.' There was no immediate statement from the Israeli military. Among the victims was Abdullah Al-Moussawi, head of the Tyre regional civil defense center, Khairallah said. The health ministry said teams continued to search for survivors in the rubble. Before Wednesday’s strike, six civil defense members had been killed since last October, Khairallah said. As of last Thursday, the health ministry reported that more than 100 paramedics had been killed by Israeli airstrikes since last October and 225 wounded, with significant damage to emergency infrastructure, including 128 ambulances and fire trucks destroyed, as well as damage to nine hospitals and 45 medical centers. Just last week, Al-Moussawi, spoke with the Associated Press, saying the Israeli airstrikes had made his team increasingly nervous, but that they were hopeful that the international protection guaranteed to medics would extend to them as well. 'We put international protection (tag) on our vehicles along with the (national) Civil Defense flag and we wear the yellow vests,' he said. Video shows what appears to be Israeli soldiers raising flag in Lebanon TEL AVIV, Israel — Video verified by The Associated Press shows what appears to be a group of Israeli soldiers raising an Israeli flag in a village in southern Lebanon. In the video, which appears to have been filmed in Maroun A-Ras, three soldiers are seen hoisting a flag atop a pile of debris. A soldier off camera speaks in Hebrew and refers to the nearby Israeli village of Avivim. It was not clear when the video was recorded. Israeli troops have been operating in Maroun a-Ras, where they have taken up positions inside a public garden on the edge of the village. The video follows other similar acts that took place throughout Israel’s ground offensive in Gaza. The Israeli military had no immediate comment. Israeli strike on Iran would be ‘lethal,’ defense minister says JERUSALEM — Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said Wednesday that an Israeli strike on Iran in response to its recent missile attack would be 'lethal' and 'surprising.' 'Our attack will be lethal, precise and above all surprising. They will not understand what happened and how it happened,' Gallant said during a speech to Israeli troops. Iran fired dozens of missiles at Israel last week in an escalation of the conflict between the two countries. Israel has vowed to respond to the missile attack but has not outlined what this retaliation would entail. The ballistic missile attack came weeks after Israel’s military intensified its airstrikes across Lebanon wiping out the majority of Hezbollah’s high ranking commanders including its leader, Hassan Nasrallah. In July, a strike in Tehran assassinated Hamas’ political leader, Ismael Haniyeh, and Iran blamed Israel. Israel has not confirmed or denied it was behind his killing. Iran is the main sponsor of the Lebanese militant group and Hamas in Gaza. Third Brazilian repatriation flight leaves Beirut RIO DE JANEIRO — Brazil’s third repatriation plane left Beirut for Brazil on Wednesday, carrying 218 passengers including 11 infants, as well as five pets, according to a statement from Brazil’s foreign ministry. The flight is set to land in Sao Paulo on Thursday morning local time after a stop to refuel in Lisbon. The Brazilian government has evacuated 674 people and 11 pets from Lebanon in five days, the foreign ministry said. The aircraft also delivered Brazil’s second donation of health supplies to Lebanon. About 21,000 Brazilians live in Lebanon, which is home to the largest community of Brazilians in the Middle East. Two Brazilian adolescents have been killed by Israeli bombardments in Lebanon. Biden and Netanyahu have first phone conversation in weeks WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday held their first call in seven weeks, a conversation that comes as Israel expands its ground incursion into Lebanon and considers how to respond to Iran’s recent ballistic missile attack. Vice President Kamala Harris joined the call, according to the White House. Meanwhile, Netanyahu’s office confirmed that the prime minister had recently spoken with former President Donald Trump. The Republican, who is the midst of a close White House race against Harris, called Netanyahu last week and 'congratulated him on the intense and determined operations that Israel carried out against Hezbollah,' according to Netanyahu’s office. 22 killed and 80 wounded in past 24 hours, Lebanon's health ministry says BEIRUT — Lebanon’s crisis response unit announced Wednesday that 22 people were killed and 80 wounded in the past 24 hours, raising the total toll over the past year of conflict between Israel and Hezbollah to 2,141 killed and 10,099 wounded, according to Lebanese Health Ministry. The report also recorded 70 airstrikes and incidents of shelling in the past day, mostly concentrated in southern Lebanon, the southern suburbs of Beirut and the Bekaa Valley. Some 1,000 centers — including educational complexes, vocational institutes, universities and other institutions — are sheltering 185,400 people displaced by the Israeli offensive in Lebanon, the report said. Half of those displaced are housed in facilities concentrated in Beirut and Mount Lebanon. Among these shelters, 807 have reached full capacity. Overall, the total number of displaced individuals in Lebanon stands at 1.2 million. Additionally, 15,000 displaced individuals have received medical treatment and medication. Despite a major border crossing between Lebanon and Syria being out of commission after an Israeli strike hit the road last week, crowds have continued to flow across the border seeking relative safety in Syria. Between Sept. 23 and Wednesday, Lebanese General Security recorded 311,034 Syrian citizens and 108,672 Lebanese citizens crossing into Syria, the report said. Palestinian militants killed by Israeli forces in West Bank, officials say JERUSALEM — The Palestinian Health Ministry said four Palestinians were killed by Israeli forces in the northern West Bank city of Nablus on Wednesday. A militant group later said the slain men were its fighters. Commenting on the incident, the Israeli police said its forces killed five militants, including a local commander in Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade, an armed offshoot of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas’ Fatah party. The Associated Press was not immediately able to reconcile the conflicting death tolls. The military said the slain men were planning attacks against Israeli troops and civilians. Violence has surged in the West Bank since the Israel-Hamas war erupted 12 months ago. Over that time, more than 740 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli fire in the West Bank according to the Palestinian Health Ministry. Nablus and other northern cities have seen some of the territory’s worst violence. Palestinian journalist killed and another wounded in a Gaza airstrike JERUSALEM — A Palestinian journalist was killed and at least one other injured in an Israeli airstrike in northern Gaza on Wednesday, Palestinian health authorities said. Mohammed Tanani, a cameraman working with the Hamas-affiliated Al-Aqsa TV station, was killed in a blast at Abu Shrekh roundabout in the Jabaliya area, the Palestinian Red Crescent and Hamas-affiliated outlet said. Another Palestinian reporter from the TV station was wounded, the network said. The Committee to Protect Journalists, a media freedom organization, say 128 journalists have been killed since the Israel-Hamas war erupted last October. They include 123 Palestinian, two Israeli and three Lebanese media workers. 2 killed in a rocket attack on northern Israel TEL AVIV, Israel — Israeli first responders say a man and a woman were killed by a rocket fired from Lebanon. The Magen David Adom rescue service said the two were killed Wednesday when a rocket struck the northern town of Kiryat Shmona. Lebanon’s Hezbollah militant group has fired hundreds of rockets into Israel in recent days as Israel has ramped up its airstrikes in Lebanon and pushed ahead with a ground incursion. Most of the rockets have been intercepted or landed in open areas, but the barrages have grown more intense and have reached deeper into Israel, disrupting daily life. Hezbollah began firing rockets, missiles and drones into Israel after Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023 attack from Gaza into Israel ignited the war. Hezbollah and Hamas are both allied with Iran, and Hezbollah said the attacks were in support of the Palestinians. Israel retaliated with airstrikes, and the conflict escalated into a full-blown war last month. At least 4 killed in an Israeli strike in southern Lebanon BEIRUT — The Lebanese Health Ministry said at least four people were killed in an Israeli strike on a hotel-turned-shelter for displaced people in southern Lebanon. Ten others were wounded in the strike that hit the building in Wardaniyeh in Lebanon’s Chouf province. An Associated Press reporter in a nearby town heard two sonic booms and an explosion from Israeli jets before the strike, followed by plumes of black and white smoke rising from the building. At least 6 people stabbed and wounded in an attack in northern Israel TEL AVIV, Israel — At least six people were stabbed and wounded in northern Israel in what police say was a militant attack. Police said the assailant stabbed people in multiple locations in the northern city of Hadera on Wednesday before fleeing on a motorbike. Police said they shot and 'neutralized' the attacker, later clarifying that he was arrested. They did not provide the name or nationality of the assailant. Five of the people who were attacked were in critical or severe condition, while the sixth was moderately wounded, according to the nearby Hillel Yaffe Medical Center. Palestinians have carried out scores of stabbing, shooting and car-ramming attacks against Israelis in recent years, and tensions have spiked over the war in Gaza. Philippine president orders preparations for evacuation from Lebanon MANILA, Philippines — Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. ordered government agencies Wednesday to prepare to evacuate Filipinos 'by whatever means' from Lebanon. Marcos held a virtual meeting with key Cabinet members while attending a summit of Southeast Asia leaders in Laos, underscoring the urgency as Israel intensified attacks against the militant group Hezbollah. 'We are now going to evacuate our people by whatever means — by air, or by sea,' Marcos said, adding that any ship to be used has to be positioned near Beirut so Filipinos could immediately leave. About 11,000 Filipinos live and work in Lebanon, including many house helpers, but Philippine Foreign Affairs officials say many are hesitant to leave their jobs. Only about 171 Filipinos in Lebanon were ready for immediate repatriation, they said. Turkish navy ships bring humanitarian aid to Beirut and evacuate citizens BEIRUT — Turkish navy ships docked at a port in Beirut on Wednesday as a part of a mission to bring humanitarian aid to Lebanon and evacuate Turkish citizens. Two of the ships, which can accommodate up to 2,000 passengers, were carrying up to 300 tons of humanitarian aid consisting of food, tents and blankets, according to a statement from the Turkish Defense Ministry. Rear Adm. Nihat Baran, commander of the evacuation mission, said the trip was ordered by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan 'to ensure that our citizens living in Lebanon are transferred to Turkey safely.' Citizens of Bulgaria, Romania and Kazakhstan also applied for the evacuation, the ministry said. The two ships are part of a larger six-vessel convoy that departed the southern port of Mersin early Wednesday. The Turkish Foreign Ministry said additional evacuations would be organized if necessary. Gaza death toll passes 42,000 Gaza’s Health Ministry says the Palestinian death toll from the war in Gaza has passed 42,000. The ministry does not differentiate between fighters and civilians in its count, but has said women and children make up more than half of those killed. It said Wednesday that 42,010 Palestinians have been killed and 97,720 wounded since the start of the war, which was ignited by Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023 attack into Israel. German police close pro-Palestinian protest camp Greta Thunberg planned to visit BERLIN — German police say they dissolved a pro-Palestinian protest camp in the western city of Dortmund after organizers told them that Swedish activist Greta Thunberg was planning to visit the camp. Dortmund police said late Tuesday the decision was made, among other reasons, because Thunberg’s appearance would probably have drawn more people to the protest camp than originally permitted. The dismantling of the camp, which had been in existence for months, was accepted without resistance, police said. Seven protesters were present at the camp on Tuesday, but Thunberg did not appear, German news agency dpa reported. On Monday, Thunberg participated in a pro-Palestinian protest in Berlin. 18 dead after Israeli strikes in Gaza DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — Palestinian officials say Israeli strikes in central and northern Gaza killed at least 18 people, including five children and two women. Two strikes hit tents for displaced people in the urban Nuseirat and Bureij refugee camps in central Gaza early Wednesday. The bodies of nine people, including three children, were brought to the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in the nearby town of Deir al-Balah. An Associated Press journalist saw the bodies at the morgue. In northern Gaza, an Israeli strike hit a family home in the Jabaliya refugee camp, killing at least nine people, according to the Civil Defense, a rescue agency operating under the Hamas-run government. The dead were taken to the Al-Ahly Hospital, which said two women and two children were among those killed. Footage shared by the Civil Defense showed first responders recovering dead bodies and body parts from under the rubble. Israel launched an air and ground operation earlier this week in Jabaliya, a densely populated urban refugee camp dating back to the 1948 war surrounding Israel’s creation. Israel has carried out several previous operations in Jabaliya, and its forces have repeatedly returned to other areas of Gaza after militants have regrouped.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hezbollah-hamas-latest-mideast-9-october-2024-753c6e5ca57cd79c248fede09283ba33	2024-10-08T22:19:10-07:00	
Ishiba dissolves Japan's lower house to set up an Oct. 27 parliamentary election	TOKYO (AP) — Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba dissolved Japan's lower house of parliament Wednesday to set up an Oct. 27 snap election and seek a mandate from voters for his 9-day-old government. Ishiba took office last week as Fumio Kishida resigned after leading the governing Liberal Democratic Party for three years as it was dogged by corruption scandals. With the early election, Ishiba is seeking to secure a majority in the lower house for his governing party while he is still fresh and before the congratulatory mood fades. The move has been criticized as prioritizing an election rather than policies and for allowing little debate. But Japan's opposition has remained too fractured to push the governing party out of power. Ishiba announced his plans for an election even before he won the party leadership vote and became prime minister. His Cabinet planned later Wednesday to formally announce the election date and the start of campaigning next Tuesday. Ishiba and his Cabinet will stay in office until they win the election and are reappointed. The speaker of the house, Fukushiro Nukaga, announced the dissolution of the lower, more powerful of the two parliamentary chambers at a plenary session. All 465 lawmakers stood up, cheered 'banzai' and rushed out of the assembly room. 'We will act fairly and squarely in order to win the people’s endorsement for the current administration,' Ishiba told reporters. 'Even while the lower house is dissolved the Japanese government must fully function' in tackling national security, disaster response and deflation, he said. 'We will devote all our body and soul for the people.' Ishiba planned to explain the election plans at a news conference late Wednesday, just before heading to Laos to make his diplomatic debut at the Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit. Opposition leaders have criticized him for rushing to hold an election allowing only three days of parliamentary debate on his policies and before achieving any results. Even though opposition parties are too fractured to topple the governing party's almost uninterrupted postwar rule, the first public support ratings for Ishiba as prime minister were only about 50% or even lower, the lowest levels for a new leader, according to Japanese media. Ishiba is increasingly seen as backpedaling on a number of proposals he previously advocated so as not to create controversy ahead of the election. In his first policy speech at parliament Friday, he did not touch on his goal of establishing a stronger regional military framework and a more equal Japan-U.S. security alliance, a dual surname option for married couples, and other issues seen as controversial or opposed by conservatives within the governing party. Ishiba is unaffiliated with factions led and controlled by party heavyweights, which some experts say could make his tenure as party leader unstable. None of his Cabinet ministers is from the late Shinzo Abe’s faction that has been linked to damaging misconduct. He also plans to not endorse some members of the Abe faction in the upcoming election to show his determination for cleaner politics. Opponents have said that’s still too lax, but Ishiba is getting backlash within the party for being too strict. ___ Follow AP’s Asia-Pacific coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/asia-pacific	https://apnews.com/article/japan-politics-ishiba-pariament-dissolution-election-6e7ffd74ff17e263b8aea1283f0afbe8	2024-10-08T22:07:19-07:00	
A kitchen staffed by trans women is a refuge for Mexico City’s LGBTQ+ community	MEXICO CITY (AP) — Karolina Long Tain González Rodríguez plops another corn cake into the piping hot oil of a large pan. As she grabs a set of tongs to flip them one by one, she yells across the kitchen realizing she’s pressed for time. 'We open in 15 minutes!' she shouts over the cumbia music playing in the background. At Casa Lleca, an LGBTQ+ shelter in Mexico City’s Peralvillo neighborhood, a community kitchen was founded two months ago to provide employment opportunities to transgender women — and serve surrounding residents in the area. As González, 36, reaches over for more of the corn cakes to fry, Thalia Trejo busies herself stuffing shredded pork into small masses of dough. While they've only worked together for a short time, González says she runs a kitchen based on mutual respect and communication. 'We know how to talk to each other… and we know how to find a solution. We’re a really united trans community, we’re really understanding,' she said. The community kitchen was born after Casa Lleca received approval from city authorities to open through a social welfare program, as many trans women in the shelter were having trouble finding work. Casa Lleca's founder and human rights activist Victoria Sámano, 30, had brought up the idea to González, who came from a culinary background. 'She (Victoria) saw the opportunity to employ our friends who arrived unhoused and gave them dignified work,' González said. Much of the funding for the kitchen came from the women themselves, who purchased appliances, chairs and tables to create an authentic dining experience. González, a native of Puerto Escondido, Oaxaca, arrived at Casa Lleca seven months ago seeking refuge and a fresh start as a trans woman. She had studied cooking in middle and high school, but then dropped out, and after working in a kitchen in Oaxaca, she left for Mexico City to begin her transition. Once in the capital, she was recommended to a plastic surgeon who gave her faulty breast implants and, after one of them ruptured, he refused to give her a warranty — or operate her again. That's when she said her life began to spiral. 'I acquired lots of bad vices, lots of bad habits, and that took me to a lot of dark places,' she recalled. 'But God always has a plan for us.' When she arrived at Casa Lleca, things began to turn around. Sámano approached her after noticing her active involvement in the shelter and strong work ethic. She thought González could be a good fit to lead the kitchen. Along with her other helpers, González runs a tight crew. All kitchen employees are up by 7 a.m. to bathe and drink coffee. They start cooking at 8:30 a.m. and prepare for customers’ arrival at 1 p.m. For González, the kitchen has become a safe space where she can also use all of her culinary knowledge. 'Now that I found this kitchen, this project and this rhythm of life, I’ve found a way to fulfill my dreams as a young person,' she said. Though the kitchen initially began as an idea to serve and employ their community, as soon as it opened, residents in the surrounding neighborhood started to flock in. Out in front of Casa Lleca, Sámano guides customers into the small dining room set up for the community kitchen. Etched onto a whiteboard hung on a steel door, the menu reads in big black letters, 'chicharrón gorditas, soup, beans and dessert.' A full meal for only 11 pesos (about 50 cents). They cook lunch for up to 150 people a day, including workers like 31-year-old Alan Olivares, who has become a regular. Olivares, a cleaner who works in the nearby Cuauhtemoc neighborhood, has been eating at the kitchen for the past couple of weeks. 'In addition to saving some money, the food is delicious,' he said, adding that he was happy to see the shelter thriving in its new business. 'Mexico needs to have a more open mind, we’re all human and it’s part of our diversity,' he said. Sámano founded Casa Lleca in 2020, right in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic, in an effort to help LGBTQ+ folks and sex workers who were unhoused or at risk of losing their homes. As hotels remained shut down, many had been left without a home or workplace. She said many of the shelters that were opened by the government at that time didn’t know how to address the needs of the LGBTQ+ community. 'When they arrive in these spaces, they are often violated or discriminated against,' said Sámano. 'In part by other residents, but (also) by the staff who don’t know where to place them because of their gender identity.' 'One day, when we leave this place, we’re going to say ‘thank you, Casa Lleca’ for showing me how to live,' said González. 'Thank you for showing me new progress in my life.' Still, many trans individuals like González are not given the space and support to embrace who they are, and are often vulnerable to dangerous situations. Mexico’s trans community continues to face challenges, and transgender individuals continue to be killed, sparking protests and anger. So far this year, 36 trans people have been killed in Mexico, according to an August report from the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights. Some progress has been made. At least 20 Mexican states have passed legislation to protect trans people. Mexico City in July passed the Paola Buenrostro law, named after a trans woman and sex worker killed in 2016, making transfemicides a crime punished by a prison sentence of up to 70 years. Sámano believes adopting laws to support trans individuals is crucial. She points at laws passed recently in Spain and Colombia that cover everything, from access to medical services to labor protections for trans people. '(These laws) address many areas of life for a trans person, and put emphasis on the tools for them to overcome and — in some cases — to survive,' said Sámano. For residents of Casa Lleca, the community kitchen has also helped to raise awareness about who they are and what role they play in the neighborhood. 'Now that they’ve tried the food, and they saw we opened the kitchen with a really nice atmosphere, people started to approach us,' said González. 'How should I refer to you all? They ask… ‘We’re trans women,’ I would tell them. People have been really accepting.' ____ Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america	https://apnews.com/article/mexico-city-trans-women-community-lgbtq-3f5aecc86dd8e5843374d2abe8f73dbf	2024-10-08T19:04:44-07:00	
Climate change boosted Helene's deadly rain and wind and scientists say same is likely for Milton	Human-caused climate change boosted a devastating Hurricane Helene 's rainfall by about 10% and intensified its winds by about 11%, scientists said in a new flash study released just as a strengthening Hurricane Milton threatens the Florida coast less than two weeks later. The warming climate boosted Helene's wind speeds by about 13 miles per hour (20.92 kilometers per hour), and made the high sea temperatures that fueled the storm 200 to 500 times more likely, World Weather Attribution calculated Wednesday from Europe. Ocean temperatures in the Gulf of Mexico were about 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit (2 degrees Celsius) above average, WWA said. 'Hurricane Helene and the storms that were happening in the region anyway have all been amplified by the fact that the air is warmer and can hold more moisture, which meant that the rainfall totals — which, even without climate change, would have been incredibly high given the circumstances — were even higher,' Ben Clarke, a study co-author and a climate researcher at Imperial College London, said in an interview. Milton will likely be similarly juiced, the authors said. The scientists warned that continued burning of fossil fuels will lead to more hurricanes like Helene, with 'unimaginable' floods well inland, not just on coasts. Many of those who died in Helene fell victim to massive inland flooding, rather than high winds. Helene made landfall in Florida with record storm surge 15 feet (4.57 meters) high and catastrophic sustained winds reaching 140 miles per hour (225.31 kilometers per hour), pummeling Georgia, the Carolinas, Tennessee and Virginia. It decimated remote towns throughout the Appalachians, left millions without power, cellular service and supplies and killed over 230 people. Search crews in the days following continued to look for bodies. Helene was the deadliest hurricane to hit the mainland U.S. since Katrina in 2005. Helene dumped more than 40 trillion gallons of rain — an unprecedented amount of water — onto the region, meteorologists estimated. That rainfall would have been much less intense if humans hadn’t warmed the climate, according to WWA, an international scientist collaborative that runs rapid climate attribution studies. 'When you start talking about the volumes involved, when you add even just a few percent on top of that, it makes it even much more destructive,' Clarke said. Hurricanes as intense as Helene were once expected every 130 years on average, but today are about 2.5 times more likely in the region, the scientists calculated. The WWA launched in 2015 to assess the extent which extreme weather events could be attributed to climate change. The organization’s rapid studies aren’t peer-reviewed but use peer-reviewed methods. The team of scientists tested the influence of climate change on Helene by analyzing weather data and climate models including the Imperial College Storm Model, the Climate Shift Index for oceans and the standard WWA approach, which compares an actual event with what might have been expected in a world that hasn't warmed about 1.3 degrees Celsius since pre-industrial times. A separate analysis of Helene last week by Department of Energy Lawrence Berkeley National Lab scientists determined that climate change caused 50% more rainfall in some parts of Georgia and the Carolinas, and that observed rainfall was 'made up to 20 times more likely in these areas because of global warming.' That study was also not peer-reviewed but used a method published in a study about Hurricane Harvey. Kim Cobb, director of the Institute at Brown for Environment and Society, wasn't involved in either study. She said there are uncertainties in exactly how much climate change is supercharging storms like Helene, but 'we know that it’s increasing the power and devastation of these storms.' She said Helene and Milton should serve 'as a wake up call' for emergency preparedness, resilience planning and the increased use of fossil fuels. 'Going forward, additional warming that we know will occur over the next 10 or 20 years will even worsen the statistics of hurricanes,' she said, 'and we will break new records.' Analysis is already indicating climate change made possible the warmed sea temperatures that also rapidly intensified Milton. Clarke said the two massive storms in quick succession illustrates the potential future of climate change if humans don't stop it. 'As we go into the future and our results show this as well, we still have control over what trajectory this goes in as to what risks we face in the future, what costs we pay in the future,' he said. 'That just hinges on how we change our energy systems and how many more fossil fuels we burn.' ___ Read more of AP’s climate coverage at http://www.apnews.com/climate-and-environment ___ Alexa St. John is an Associated Press climate solutions reporter.

Trump has long blasted China's trade practices. His 'God Bless the USA' Bibles were printed there	WASHINGTON (AP) — Thousands of copies of Donald Trump’s 'God Bless the USA' Bible were printed in a country that the former president has repeatedly accused of stealing American jobs and engaging in unfair trade practices — China. Global trade records reviewed by The Associated Press show a printing company in China’s eastern city of Hangzhou shipped close to 120,000 of the Bibles to the United States between early February and late March. The estimated value of the three separate shipments was $342,000, or less than $3 per Bible, according to databases that use customs data to track exports and imports. The minimum price for the Trump-backed Bible is $59.99, putting the potential sales revenue at about $7 million. The Trump Bible’s connection to China, which has not been previously reported, reveals a deep divide between the former president’s harsh anti-China rhetoric and his rush to cash in while campaigning. The Trump campaign did not respond to emails and calls seeking comment. Trump says his Bibles would help America The largest and most recent load of 70,000 copies of Trump’s Bible arrived by container vessel at the Port of Los Angeles on March 28, two days after Trump announced in a video posted on his Truth Social platform that he’d partnered with country singer Lee Greenwood to hawk the Bibles. In the video, Trump blended religion with his campaign message as he urged viewers to buy the Bible, inspired by Greenwood’s ballad, 'God Bless the USA.' The Bible includes copies of the U.S. Constitution, Declaration of Independence, Bill of Rights and Pledge of Allegiance. 'This Bible is a reminder that the biggest thing we have to bring back in America, and to make America great again, is our religion, Trump said. Judeo-Christian values, he added, are 'under attack, perhaps as never before.' Trump didn’t say where the 'God Bless the USA' Bibles are printed, or what they cost; a copy hand-signed by the former president sells for $1,000. Trump also didn't disclose how much he earns per sale. A version of the $59.99 Bible memorializes the July 13 assassination attempt on the former president in Pennsylvania. Trump’s name is on the cover above the phrase, 'The Day God Intervened.' The wording appears to have been stamped on after the Bible was produced. Trump said Saturday his would-be assassin did not succeed 'by the hand of providence and the grace of God.' The Bibles are sold exclusively through a website that states it is not affiliated with any political campaign nor is it owned or controlled by Trump. A photo posted on the website shows Trump sitting at his desk in the Oval Office with Greenwood standing beside him. In another photo, the former president smiles broadly while holding a copy of the Bible. Trump's name and image are licensed The website states that Trump’s name and image are used under a paid license from CIC Ventures, a company Trump reported owning in his most recent financial disclosure. CIC Ventures earned $300,000 in Bible sales royalties, according to the disclosure. It’s unclear what period that covers or how much Trump received in additional payments since the disclosure was released in August. AP received no response to questions sent to an email on the Bible website and to a publicist for Greenwood. For years, Trump has castigated Beijing as an obstacle to America’s economic success, slapping hefty tariffs on Chinese imports while president and threatening even more stringent measures if he’s elected again. He blamed China for the COVID-19 outbreak and recently suggested, without evidence, that thousands of Chinese immigrants are flooding the U.S. to build an 'army' and attack America. But Trump also has an eye on his personal finances. Pitching Bibles is one of a dizzying number of for-profit ventures he’s launched or promoted, including diamond-encrusted watches, sneakers, photo books, cryptocurrency and digital trading cards. The web of enterprises has stoked conflict of interest concerns. Selling products at prices that exceed their value may be considered a campaign contribution, said Claire Finkelstein, founder of the nonpartisan Center for Ethics and the Rule of Law and a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania. 'You have to assume that everything that the individual does is being done as a candidate and so that any money that flows through to him benefits him as a candidate,' Finkelstein said. 'Suppose Vladimir Putin were to buy a Trump watch. Is that a campaign finance violation? I would think so.' Selling Bibles, she added, 'strikes me as a profoundly problematic mixing of religion and state.' Potential conflicts of interest As president, Trump would be in a position to influence policies and markets to benefit businesses in which he and his family have financial stakes. While president, his administration exempted Bibles and other religious texts from tariffs imposed on billions of dollars of Chinese goods. There’s a potentially lucrative opportunity for Trump to sell 55,000 of the 'God Bless the USA' Bibles to Oklahoma after the state’s top education official ordered public schools to incorporate Scripture into lessons for grades 5 through 12. Oklahoma plans to spend $3 million on Bibles that initially matched Trump’s edition: a King James Version that contains the U.S. founding documents. The request was revised Monday to allow the U.S. historical documents to be bound with the Bible or provided separately. Oklahoma’s Department of Education did not answer AP’s questions about whether the Bibles must be printed in the United States or if any department officials have discussed the proposal with Trump or his representatives. 'There are hundreds of Bible publishers and we expect a robust competition for this proposal,' said department spokesman Dan Isett. Chinese printing company confirms shipments China is one of the world’s leading producers of Bibles, so it’s not unusual for the Trump-endorsed version to be printed there. The first delivery of Trump Bibles was labeled 'God Bless USA,' according to the information from the Panjiva and Import Genius databases. The other two were described as 'Bibles.' All the books were shipped by New Ade Cultural Media, a printing company in Hangzhou that describes itself as a 'custom Bible book manufacturer.' They were sent to Freedom Park Design, a company in Alabama that databases identified as the importer of the Bibles. Tammy Tang, a sales representative for New Ade, told AP all three shipments were 'God Bless the USA' Bibles. She said New Ade received the orders via the WhatsApp messaging service and confirmed they were from Freedom Park Design. The books were printed on presses near the company’s Hangzhou office, she said. Tang did not disclose the sales price or other details, citing customer confidentiality. 'They didn’t come to meet us,' Tang said by telephone. 'We just do the production.' She declined further comment and referred interview requests to Freedom Park Design. Freedom Park Design was incorporated in Florida on March 1, according to business registration records. An aspiring country singer named Jared Ashley is the company’s president. He also co-founded 16 Creative, a digital marketing firm that uses the same Gulf Shores address and processes online orders for branded merchandise sold by entertainers and authors. Ashley hung up on a reporter who called to ask about the Bibles. Greenwood is a client of 16 Creative, according to the firm’s website. He launched the American-flag emblazoned Bible in 2021. His song, 'God Bless the USA,' was released 40 years ago and is a staple at Trump rallies. Greenwood has also appeared at the former president’s campaign events. Critics call Trump Bible a ‘toxic mix’ The King James Version used in the Trump Bible is in the public domain. Greenwood had initially planned to use the best-selling New International Version licensed in North America by HarperCollins Christian Publishing. But the publisher abandoned the arrangement amid pressure from religious scholars and authors who denounced the merger of Scripture and government documents as a 'toxic mix' that would fuel Christian nationalism sentiments in evangelical churches. Christian nationalism is a movement that fuses American and Christian values, symbols and identity and seeks to privilege Christianity in public life. Christian nationalists are likely to believe the U.S. Constitution was inspired by God and that the federal government should declare the U.S. a Christian nation. Other critics called the Trump Bible blasphemous. 'Taking what has long been understood as a global message religiously and stamping it with the flag of one nation is the type of thing that for centuries theologians would call heresy,' said Brian Kaylor, a Baptist minister and president of the Christian media company Word&amp;Way. ‘Love of money’ Tim Wildsmith, a Baptist minister who reviews Bibles on his YouTube channel, said he quickly noticed the signs of a cheaply made book when his 'God Bless the USA' Bible arrived wrapped in plastic inside a padded mailer. It had a faux leather cover, and words were jammed together on the pages, making it hard to read. He also found sticky pages that ripped when pulled apart, and there was no copyright page or information about who printed the Bible, or where. 'I was shocked by how poor the quality of it was,' Wildsmith said. 'It says to me that it’s more about the love of money than it is the love of our country.' ___ Kang reported from Beijing.

Mozambique votes for president and the ruling party could extend its 49 years in power	MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) — Mozambique is voting for a new president on Wednesday in an election that is expected to extend the ruling party's 49 years in power since the southern African nation gained independence from Portugal in 1975. Daniel Chapo, 47, is the candidate for the ruling Front for the Liberation of Mozambique, or Frelimo, seeking to succeed President Filipe Nyusi, who has served a maximum two terms. Analysts say the strongest challenge to Chapo and Frelimo's dominance will likely come from 50-year-old independent Venancio Mondlane. People also will vote for the makeup of Parliament and for provincial governors in a country of some 33 million people that went through a bloody, 15-year civil war that ended in 1992, and more recently has been shaken by an ongoing violent jihadist insurgency in the north. Ending that insurgency and bringing stability to Cabo Delgado province — where 1.3 million fled their homes and more than half remain displaced — is a pledge by both leading candidates, while poverty, youth unemployment and government corruption are top issues for voters. 'I am still selling biscuits at a vegetable market here in Maputo to take care of my two children,' said 35-year-old Felicidade Simao. 'My husband is unemployed and we are struggling. I want the best for my children and the winner of this election must make the dream of a better life in the future.' Polls opened at 7 a.m. local time and vote-counting is due to start right after polls close in the one-day election. Preliminary results from some areas are expected from Thursday, and the full results must be delivered to the Constitutional Council within 15 days of polls closing to be validated and formally declared. Around 17 million people are registered to vote. The credibility of the election will be under scrutiny, with the leftist Frelimo party accused of ballot-stuffing and falsifying results in previous votes, including last year's local elections, where it was declared the winner in 64 out of 65 municipalities. Frelimo has consistently denied the accusations of election tampering. Teams of regional and international election observers are in Mozambique, including from the European Union. Frelimo effectively established a one-party state following independence and fought a civil war against the Mozambique National Resistance, or Renamo, for a decade and a half. The country, where Portuguese remains the official language, held its first elections in 1994, two years after a peace agreement. Renamo is also contesting this election, with party leader Ossufo Momade, a military commander in the civil war, its candidate for president. The former rebel group has seen its popularity wane, while the peace between Frelimo and Renamo has been fragile, with an outbreak of more fighting in 2013. Momade and outgoing leader Nyusi signed another peace deal in 2019. But tensions remain, especially between the two political parties that were once at war with each other. The independent Mondlane, who broke away from Renamo, has focused his campaign on young Mozambicans frustrated with poverty and unemployment. The country boasts a long coastline of picturesque beaches on the Indian Ocean, but that vulnerable area has been battered by cyclones in recent years. A drought this year in the southern African region has left more than a million Mozambicans impacted by hunger. Meanwhile, it emerged in 2016 that government officials and others had embezzled more than $2 billion in foreign loans that were kept secret, sending the economy into a crisis from which it is still recovering. 'All Mozambicans have high hopes from the new president,' said 69-year-old Baptista Antonio, who was one of the first to vote at an elementary school in the capital, Maputo, a port city on the east coast of Africa. 'I was born during the colonial era and saw many transformations of the country from wars to development and all I can say is it’s a work in progress. There are many challenges ahead.' Mondlane was aligned with a coalition of opposition parties, but they were barred from contesting the election, which raised accusations against Frelimo of attempting to control the election. Mondlane is now supported by a new party called Podemos, which means 'we can' in Portuguese. While Mondlane, a former banker, represents a fresh challenge to Frelimo, most analysts expect the ruling party to remain in power. It was declared the winner with more than 70% of the vote in national elections five years ago. The Pangea risk company, which provides security and investment advice on developing countries, said Chapo's election has been 'carefully stage managed' by Frelimo. Chapo worked as a radio announcer and television presenter before becoming a law professor. He was the governor of southern Inhambane province — Mozambique's flagship tourism region — but was a surprise winner of an internal party vote in May to become Frelimo's presidential candidate. Chapo would be Mozambique's first leader born after independence if he wins. ___ AP Africa news: https://apnews.com/hub/africa	https://apnews.com/article/mozambique-election-president-frelimo-chapo-bdcef382aa0462bfdbe8d89ca284b241	2024-10-08T15:31:55-07:00	
Military board substantiates misconduct but declines to fire Marine who adopted Afghan orphan	CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) — A U.S. Marine whose adoption of an Afghan war orphan has spurred a yearslong legal battle and raised alarms at the highest levels of government will remain on active duty. A three-member panel of Marines said Tuesday that while Maj. Joshua Mast acted in a way unbecoming of an officer in his zealous quest to bring home the baby girl, it did not warrant his separation from the military. Lawyers for the Marine Corps argued Mast abused his position, disregarded orders of his superiors and mishandled classified information in his fight over the child who was found orphaned on the battlefield in rural Afghanistan in 2019. The board found that the government provided enough evidence to substantiate some of the bases for misconduct, including misuse of a government computer. Mast was cleared of allegations he made false official statements and failed to obey an order or regulation. Mast and his wife, Stephanie, then lived in rural Fluvanna County, Virginia. They persuaded a judge there to grant them an adoption of the child, even though she remained in Afghanistan as the government there tracked down her extended family and reunited her with them. Mast helped the family flee Afghanistan after the Taliban took over in 2021. Once in the U.S., Mast used the adoption papers to get the federal government to take the child from her Afghan relatives and give her to him. She has remained with his family ever since. A five-day board of inquiry hearing held partially behind closed doors at the Marine Forces Special Operations Command at Camp Lejeune was administrative, not criminal, and intended to determine whether Mast was fit to remain in the military. The worst outcome Mast might have faced was an other-than-honorable discharge. Mast, 41, who now lives in Hampstead, North Carolina, denied the allegations against him, insisting he never disobeyed orders but was encouraged by his supervisors, and was simply upholding the code of the Marine Corps by working tirelessly to ensure the girl was safe. At the front of the room, he set up poster-sized photos of the child as a baby at Afghanistan’s Bagram Airfield and as a smiling toddler in North Carolina. But because the board substantiated misconduct, a report will be entered into Mast's file, which could affect promotions and assignments, the Marines said Tuesday. The board’s report will be sent up the ladder to the Secretary of the Navy, who will close the case against Mast. The child’s fate, however, remains in limbo. The Afghan couple who raised the child for 18 months in Afghanistan is seeking to have Mast’s adoption of her undone. The Department of Justice has intervened and contended that Mast lied to the Virginia court and federal officials to justify taking the girl, and his actions threaten America’s standing around the world. The State Department said in a statement Tuesday that its decision to work with the Afghan government and International Committee of the Red Cross to reunite the child with her Afghan relatives 'was consistent with international law and U.S. policy to take appropriate steps to facilitate the reunion of families separated during armed conflict.' The department said it has insisted that Virginia courts return the child to the Afghan family. The Virginia Court of Appeals ruled earlier this year that the adoption should have never been granted. The case is stalled at the state Supreme Court. Lawyers for the Afghan couple did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Much of the government’s case in the hearing was held in secret because lawyers were presenting classified information. Everyone present in the nondescript conference room was dressed identically in camouflage. And Mast chose to make an unsworn statement in a closed session, which meant he was not subject to cross-examination. But his wife, Stephanie, testified publicly, offering rare insight into the couple’s motivation for working so vigorously to bring the child into their home. The Masts have long declined to talk to The Associated Press about their actions and the Virginia court file remains sealed. The Masts, as well as the Afghan couple, are now barred from speaking to the media about the state court case. Stephanie Mast wept as she described her husband’s decision to work to bring the girl back to the United States as exemplary of his commitment to Marine Corps values. 'It was very much an American response,' she said. 'We value human life. As Marines, you serve and protect.' The deciding panel of two lieutenant colonels and a colonel was allowed to ask questions, and one asked Stephanie Mast why she and her husband continued to try to adopt the girl even after she had been reunited with relatives in Afghanistan. They noted that multiple high-ranking officials, including then-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and a federal judge, told them to stop. When she responded that getting the child to the United States was their highest priority, the board asked whether the assumption that a child would be better off in the U.S. rather than Afghanistan was a product of Western bias. 'They have a survival mentality,' she said of Afghans. 'We believe in life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. And we wanted her to have that.' ___ Galofaro reported from Louisville, Kentucky, and Mendoza from San Francisco.

This camp provides a safe space for kids to learn and play after Hurricane Helene	BREVARD, N.C. (AP) — The Weissmans still have much to do to recover from Hurricane Helene flooding their home last month. They need to chase down private insurance claims and fill out applications for the Small Business Administration and the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Because the storm killed power to western North Carolina, they worry about mold. The storm also wrecked Max Weissman's office, leaving the 45-year-old therapist with nowhere to meet patients. And it leveled the building that housed the tea company where his wife, Aviva Weissman, worked. But the Weissmans haven’t had time to deal with any of that because like all parents their utmost priority is their children. Schools have been closed since the storm and their son Avi, 11, helped Max bleach the basement last week. Aviva briefly took their 7-year-old daughter Reyna to stay with family in South Carolina before returning home. Like all children, both now need a routine, and to play. On Monday morning, Weissman took Avi and Reyna to a free, pop-up day camp where dozens of kids were making bracelets, drawing, and playing oversized games of Jenga and Connect Four in a large playroom. Outside, girls bounced through a hopscotch court as a fierce basketball game heated up behind them. The camp is hosted by the the L.A.-based nonprofit Project:Camp. As storms become more frequent and severe, the organization is increasingly traveling to disaster-affected communities to set up spaces where kids can process the disruption and devastation of a disaster while their parents start the long recovery process. 'I feel pretty guilty telling them all the time, ‘I’ve never dealt with this,’' said Weissman. '‘This is the first time we’re dealing with a pandemic. This is the first time we’re dealing with a flood.’ And I feel like it just keeps on.' He lingered outside the playroom, anxiously peering through the window to check on the kids as he responded to messages from his patients. The Brevard camp opened Monday and will run until Friday. Schools here are expected to open next week. Project:Camp is talking with nearby communities about where to set up next. Schools can’t reopen until water is restored. For some counties, it’s still unclear when that can happen. As of Tuesday, 15 school districts and the majority of the 21 charter schools in the region were closed, according to the state’s Department of Public Instruction. Three districts are set to resume classes Wednesday, with more to follow next week. With Hurricane Milton approaching Florida, Project:Camp was also preparing for the possibility it would be needed there, too. 'It’s always been the case that there’s a lack of this,' said Dr. Irwin Redlener, founding director of the National Center for Disaster Preparedness at Columbia University and an adjunct professor of pediatrics at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. 'As quickly as possible, we have to begin reestablishing some level of post-disaster normalcy for children ... The necessity for play should not be understated,' he said. Project:Camp volunteers are trained in trauma recovery. Kids participate in gratitude circles, refocusing them on positive thoughts, and do mental and emotional checks, or 'Me' checks, where they rate how they feel and learn to assess their own wellbeing. They also just have fun. 'Camp is an inherently therapeutic space for kids,' said Henry Meier, director of external affairs at the organization and leader of the Brevard pop-up. 'They process through play, they process with their peers. So just having a space that they recognize, that they feel safe and comfortable in, is the best environment for them right now.' On Tuesday morning, the Weissmans returned to Project:Camp. Max looked more relaxed. He’d gotten some things done, and the power was supposed to return that day. When he'd picked up the kids the evening before, Reyna told him it was the 'best camp ever.' Avi said it was ok, but that was enough for Max. 'In 11-year-old language,' he said. 'That means it was fantastic.' ___ This story has been updated to correct that a majority of the charter schools in the western North Carolina region were closed as of Tuesday, not all. ___ Associated Press writer Gary D.

Musk's X to be reinstated in Brazil after complying with Supreme Court demands	SAO PAULO (AP) — The Brazilian Supreme Court's Justice Alexandre de Moraes on Tuesday authorized the restoration of social media platform X´s service in Brazil, over a month after its nationwide shutdown, according to a court document that was made public. Elon Musk’s X was blocked on Aug. 30 in the highly online country of 213 million people — and one of X’s biggest markets, with estimates of its user base ranging from 20 to 40 million. De Moraes ordered the shutdown after a monthslong dispute with Musk over free speech, far-right accounts and misinformation. Musk had disparaged de Moraes, calling him an authoritarian and a censor, even though his rulings, including X’s suspension, were repeatedly upheld by his peers. Despite Musk's public bravado, X ultimately complied with all of de Moraes' demands. They included blocking certain accounts from the platform, paying outstanding fines and naming a legal representative in the country. Failure to do the latter had triggered the suspension. 'The resumption of (X)’s activities on national territory was conditioned, solely, on full compliance with Brazilian laws and absolute observance of the Judiciary's decisions, out of respect for national sovereignty,' de Moraes said in the court document. 'X is proud to return to Brazil,' the company said in a statement posted on its Global Government Affairs account. 'Giving tens of millions of Brazilians access to our indispensable platform was paramount throughout this entire process. We will continue to defend freedom of speech, within the boundaries of the law, everywhere we operate.' Just two days before the ban, on Aug. 28, X said it was removing all its remaining staff in Brazil 'effective immediately,' saying de Moraes had threatened with arrest its legal representative in the country, Rachel de Oliveira Villa Nova Conceição, if X did not comply with orders to block accounts. Brazilian law requires foreign companies to have a local legal representative to receive notifications of court decisions and swiftly take any requisite action — particularly, in X’s case, the takedown of accounts. Conceição was first named X’s legal representative in April and resigned four months later. The company named her to the same job on Sept. 20, according to the public filing with the Sao Paulo commercial registry. In an apparent effort to shield Conceição from potential violations by X — and risking arrest — a clause has been written into Conceição’s new representation agreement that she must follow Brazilian law and court decisions, and that any legal responsibility she assumes on X’s behalf requires prior instruction from the company in writing, according to the company’s filing. Conceição works for BR4Business, a business services firm. Its two-page website provides no insight into its operations or staff. 'Something great is on its way,' the top of the site’s main page reads in English. Its other page is an extensive privacy policy. At three of its listed Sao Paulo offices, receptionists told the AP that the company’s offices are empty and employees work remotely. Neither Conceição nor BR4Business returned multiple phone calls and emails from the AP. There is nothing illegal or suspect about using a company like BR4Business for legal representation, but it shows that X is doing the bare minimum to operate in the country, said Fabio de Sa e Silva, a lawyer and associate professor of International and Brazilian Studies at the University of Oklahoma. 'It doesn’t demonstrate an intention to truly engage with the country. Take Meta, for example, and Google. They have an office, a government relations department, precisely to interact with public authorities and discuss Brazil’s regulatory policies concerning their businesses,' Silva added. Indeed, it is rare for an established, influential company such as X to have only a legal representative, said Carlos Affonso Souza, a lawyer and director of the Institute for Technology and Society, a Rio-based think tank. And that could be problematic going forward. 'The concern now is what comes next and how X, once back in operation, will manage to meet the demands of the market and local authorities without creating new tensions,' he said. Some of Brazilian X’s users have migrated to other platforms, such as Meta’s Threads and, primarily, Bluesky. It’s unclear how many of them will return to X. In a statement to the AP, Bluesky reported that it now has 10.6 million users and continues to see strong growth in Brazil. Bluesky has appointed a legal representative in the South American country. Brazil was not the first country to ban X — far from it — but such a drastic step has generally been limited to authoritarian regimes. The platform and its former incarnation, Twitter, have been banned in Russia, China, Iran, Myanmar, North Korea, Venezuela and Turkmenistan. Other countries, such as Pakistan, Turkey and Egypt, have also temporarily suspended X before, usually to quell dissent and unrest. X’s dustup with Brazil has some parallels to the company’s dealings with the Indian government three years ago, back when it was still called Twitter and before Musk purchased it for $44 billion. In 2021, India threatened to arrest employees of Twitter (as well as Meta’s Facebook and WhatsApp), for not complying with the government’s requests to take down posts related to farmers’ protests that rocked the country. Musk’s decision to reverse course in Brazil after publicly criticizing de Moraes isn’t surprising, said Matteo Ceurvels, research firm Emarketer’s analyst for Latin America and Spain. 'The move was pragmatic, likely driven by the economic consequences of losing access to millions of users in its third-largest market worldwide, along with the millions of dollars in associated advertising revenue,' Ceurvels said. 'Although X may not be a top priority for most advertisers in Brazil, the platform needs them more than they need it.' ___ Ortutay reported from San Francisco	https://apnews.com/article/brazil-x-elon-musk-supreme-court-de-moraes-e32c4b4171e78cbe8994f53713a922f7	2024-10-08T11:33:12-07:00	
As Israel plots to strike Iran, its choices range from symbolic to severe	JERUSALEM (AP) — Israel has promised to retaliate for Iran’s massive missile attack last week. How it does so involves great risk, and could have major repercussions for the archenemies, the Middle East and the world. Israel's options range from symbolic strikes on military targets to crippling attacks on Iran's vital oil industry or its secretive and heavily fortified nuclear program. The intensity and timing of any retaliatory strike was expected to top the agenda of a planned meeting this week at the Pentagon between Israel’s defense minister and his U.S. counterpart. But late Tuesday, the Pentagon said the meeting was abruptly postponed. In a sign of possible disagreement over the right approach, President Joe Biden has already urged Israel not to hit Iran's nuclear program and discouraged it from hitting the oil industry. The Associated Press spoke to two former Israeli prime ministers and other experts to explore Israel’s options. There is broad consensus that Israel must strike back, but deep disagreement over the best way to do so. 'The question is not whether Israel will retaliate or respond,' former Prime Minister Ehud Olmert told AP. 'The question is which way.' Why is Israel threatening Iran? Israel and Iran have been involved in a bitter shadow war for years — primarily through Israel’s battles against Iranian-backed militant groups across the region. Israel also has been suspected of killing Iranian nuclear scientists and carrying out attacks on Iranian nuclear facilities, but it rarely acknowledges involvement. Direct clashes have been rare. But things changed after Hamas attacked Israel from the Gaza Strip on Oct. 7, 2023, and Hezbollah began firing rockets at Israel the following day. Both groups receive support from Iran. In April, Iran fired over 300 drones and missiles toward Israel after accusing it of killing two Iranian generals in a diplomatic compound in Syria. Nearly all of the missiles malfunctioned or were intercepted, and Israel responded with a limited strike that signaled it did not want any further escalation. After last week’s Iranian attack, Israel signaled its next response would be different. Iran said the barrage of at least 180 ballistic missiles was to avenge a series of Israeli strikes against its close allies, Hamas and Hezbollah, including the assassination of the group’s longtime leader. Although the missiles caused little damage or casualties, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Iran had made a 'big mistake and it will pay for it.' Members of his hard-line coalition have called for a harsh response. What options does Israel have? Israel has a broad range of choices of targets – from Iranian government buildings and military bases to sensitive oil installations to heavily fortified nuclear facilities hidden deep below ground. Israel accuses Iran of developing nuclear weapons — a charge Iran denies. Striking anywhere in Iran is a logistical challenge for Israel. Warplanes would need to fly over 1,500 kilometers (about 1,000 miles) to their target, requiring a complicated midair refueling operation, potentially over hostile skies. Any strike would also mean confronting Iran’s Russian-made air-defense systems. 'Remember that Iran is 1,500, 1,600 kilometers (about 1,000 miles) away from Israel, and you have countries in between — Jordan, Iraq, Saudi Arabia. Some are friends. Some are foes,' said Yoel Guzansky, a senior researcher at the Institute for National Security Studies in Tel Aviv and a former adviser on Iranian affairs on Israel's National Security Council. 'You don’t want to embarrass your friends. You don’t want to get hostile fire from other countries,' he said. Olmert, who served as prime minister from 2006 to 2009, said Israel is more than capable of coping with these challenges. 'We have the capabilities,' he said. 'I’m not certain it would be wise and responsible to expose them.' Even if Israel has the means, there are diplomatic considerations. A strike on the oil sector, Iran’s economic backbone, or on the nuclear program would almost certainly guarantee an Iranian response and raise the risk of further escalation. Such strikes could rattle global oil markets and shake the U.S. economy on the eve of a presidential election. They also could risk Iranian retaliation not only against Israel, but against American troops stationed in the region or Gulf Arab countries aligned with the West. 'Unlike Lebanon and Gaza, every Israeli attack on Iran has international and global repercussions,' said Menahem Merhavy, an Iran expert at Hebrew University in Jerusalem. So how will Israel respond? Former leaders are divided on what path Israel should choose. Olmert said a strike on multiple military targets, spread across Iran’s vast territory, would be more than enough to send a message. The goal, he said, is to show that Israel can strike anywhere and anytime. 'That’s precisely what deterrence is all about,' he said. Olmert said hitting Iran’s oil sector would be an unnecessary escalation that invites a response, and that striking the nuclear program is not worth the risk. Not only would it trigger Iranian retaliation, but the odds of success are uncertain, he said. 'Trying to attack the nuclear program will be a mistake,' he said. Another former prime minister, Yair Lapid, believes Israel should strike Iran’s oil industry infrastructure. 'That is the most painful target for the Iranian regime,' Lapid, who served as premier in 2022, said in a written response to a question from The Associated Press. 'Iran’s ballistic missile attack against Israel must be met with a forceful response,' he said, adding that Iran must understand 'there is a high cost to its regional aggression.' In an interview with the Israeli news site Ynet, Lapid said a strike on Iran’s nuclear facilities should only be done as part of an international coalition in coordination with the United States. Lapid’s predecessor as prime minister and former governing partner, Naftali Bennett, takes an even tougher line, saying now is the time for Israel to bomb the Iranian nuclear project. Bennett said in a video posted on social media Tuesday that Iran and its allies have been weakened, and that Israel has a rare chance to deliver a decisive blow to Iran’s leadership, economy and nuclear program. 'We must not settle for Iranian military bases or noisy-yet-meaningless actions that are meant only to deliver a message,' Bennett said. 'The time for messages is over.' Olmert, however, said he hopes cooler heads will prevail. 'What do we want to achieve and how far do we want to go and how arrogant do we want to be?' he said. His advice: 'Try to be smart.' ___ Associated Press reporters Julia Frankel, Melanie Lidman and Jon Gambrell in Jerusalem, contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-iran-nuclear-hezbollah-hamas-missile-retaliation-0184e79d4ee5ec012960e0b24ddae102	2024-10-08T10:49:09-07:00	
Dominican Republic starts mass deportations of Haitians and expels nearly 11,000 in a week	SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) — The Dominican Republic said Tuesday it has deported or repatriated nearly 11,000 Haitians in the past week, fulfilling a pledge to do so weekly as neighboring Haiti scrambles to handle the influx while besieged by gang violence and poverty. The Dominican government announced last week that it would deport up to 10,000 Haitians a week, citing an 'excess' of immigrants as relations between the countries that share the island of Hispaniola continue to sour. These are the largest such deportations in recent history there. The announcement prompted Haitian officials to request an emergency meeting at the Organization of American States, where Haitian permanent representative Gandy Thomas called the deportations 'a strategy of ethnic cleansing' and 'a discriminatory campaign against Haitians due to their nationality and color of their skin.' Thomas called for dialogue and a 'respectful solution,' saying the deportations will 'worsen the fragility of our infrastructure while the deportees will arrive with no support, no resources and no ties to their community.' At least half a million Haitians live in the Dominican Republic, according to human rights groups. Activists say the deportations put the lives of thousands at risk. A U.N.-backed mission led by Kenyan police that began earlier this year to try to quell gang violence is facing a lack of funds and personnel. 'There are a great number of armed groups that are just like birds of prey waiting to swoop down and take advantage of these people,' said Sam Guillaume with Haiti’s Support Group for Returnees and Refugees. Guillaume accused Dominican authorities of 'hunting down' Haitians, asserting that some are extorted, raped or held in jail with no water or food and subjected to beatings or tear gas 'if they dare say boo.' Radhafil Rodríguez, adviser to the OAS' Dominican Republic mission, said the government rejected accusations of mistreatment and would take any complaint 'very seriously' and investigate it. He said Haiti's crisis is disproportionately affecting the Dominican Republic, asserting that migrants are overwhelming schools, clinics and hospitals. Rodríguez said his country stands in solidarity with the people of Haiti during their crisis but added that no one can expect it to halt deportations. Both Rodríguez and Thomas called for dialogue as officials in Haiti urgently met to talk about the deportations and established a working group to handle the influx of migrants and their needs. 'The forced and mass deportation of our Haitian compatriots from the Dominican Republic is a violation of the fundamental principles of human dignity,' Haitian Prime Minister Garry Conille wrote on social media platform X on Tuesday. The mass deportations have led to an increase in abandoned children across the Dominican Republic, warned activist William Charpentier, coordinator for the Dominican-based National Coalition for Migrations and Refugees. 'They take their parents, or one of the parents, and leave the children behind, even while they’re in school,' he said. Charpentier called the deportations 'a type of persecution against Black people, against everything they presume to be Haitian.' He said even people with legal documents are being detained and deported, a practice that activists say has occurred in previous years. Allegations of extortion have surged. Ocicle Batista, a 45-year-old Haitian migrant who sells avocados in the capital, Santo Domingo, accused soldiers of demanding $230 to $330 to avoid deportations 'even when they have their papers in hand,' she said of migrants. 'We come here to work,' she said. Luis Rafael Lee Ballester, the Dominican Republic’s migration director, said human rights are being respected and that a proportional use of force is used when migrants are arrested. He said those with documents were detained because they did not have 'reliable identification' to justify their presence in the country. From Oct. 1-7, 7,591 people were deported and 3,323 repatriated, according to the government, which said all were Haitian. ___ Coto reported from San Juan, Puerto Rico.	https://apnews.com/article/dominican-republic-deportations-haiti-0e46f10ca79a34d05f9ff0cf5e00a971	2024-10-08T10:24:45-07:00	
Kenya’s parliament overwhelmingly votes to impeach the country's deputy president	NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) — Kenya's lawmakers approved a motion Tuesday to impeach the country's deputy president, following daylong discussions and after Rigathi Gachagua appeared in parliament to defend himself against several charges, including allegations that he supported anti-government protests in June. The motion was approved by a 281-44 vote in favor of impeachment, well above the 117 votes constitutionally required. The motion now goes to the parliament’s upper house, which will debate the matter and also hold a vote. For impeachment to be final, it will need the additional backing of two thirds of senators in the upper house. It's not clear when that vote will take place. Under Kenya's constitution, the removal from office is automatic if approved by both chambers, though Gachagua can challenge the action in court — something he has said he would do. The deputy president is also accused of being involved in corruption and other irregularities. He denies all the charges against him. The debate surrounding his fate has extended beyond parliament — supporters and opponents of the motion clashed last week in public forums after the ruling alliance brought the motion before parliament. In his speech, Gachagua declared that he was 'undergoing a political process' and asked legislators to make their decision 'without intimidation and coercion.' On Monday, the deputy president had said he believed the motion had the president’s blessings. President William Ruto has yet to publicly comment about the impeachment but is on record in the earlier days of his presidency saying he would not publicly humiliate his deputy, alluding to the troubled relationship he had with his predecessor, Uhuru Kenyatta, during their second term in office. On Sunday during a prayer meeting at his residence, Gachagua implored Ruto, legislators and Kenyans to forgive him for any wrongdoing during his tenure. He clarified that statement on Monday, saying it was not an admission of guilt and dismissed rumors that he would resign. Gachagua told lawmakers Tuesday that some of the properties listed in the impeachment motion as his belonged to his late brother. He also defended renovation expenditures for his official residence, saying it was in a state of disrepair and needed to be 'dignified.'	https://apnews.com/article/kenya-deputy-president-impeached-02d46fc2c8470549520620ce14a1e9b9	2024-10-08T10:24:40-07:00	
Survivors of massacre in small Haitian town where 70 died point finger at government	PONT-SONDÉ, Haiti (AP) — Angry whispers have broken the heavy silence that fell over Pont-Sondé just days after a vicious gang attack left more than 70 dead, marking one of Haiti’s biggest massacres in recent history. The whispering came from a handful of people that remained in the small town in central Haiti after Thursday's assault. They huddled by the roadside, stood under leafy trees or milled around the lone cemetery. All of them blamed the government for the assault by the Gran Grif gang, created after a former legislator armed young men nearly a decade ago to secure his election and control of the area. 'I have to thank the government, because the gangs are killing people and kids cannot go to school,' said Lunoir Jean Chavanne, the town’s morgue driver. He lost three relatives, including a 14-year-old boy and a beloved uncle who was a priest of the Vodou religion. Like others, Chavanne questioned why authorities didn’t do anything to stop the attack by Gran Grif, considered one of Haiti’s cruelest gangs. 'They’ve been announcing that they were coming a number of times on social media,' he said. A tragic message Pont-Sondé was once a bustling community with a thriving marketplace located near the mighty Artibonite River, Haiti’s longest. It’s the same river that gang members used to their advantage the night of the attack, plying its rich brown waters with canoes so as not to alert anyone about their presence. They killed babies, older people and entire families. Among the victims was the nephew of 58-year-old Elvens François, who was preparing to bury him on Tuesday. He recalled how he was carrying a plastic bag with his belongings as he prepared to flee his house when three men gripping automatic weapons surrounded him. One held François from the back while the other two gang members faced him. 'They attacked me, cornered me and took everything from me,' he said, tears in his eyes. He doesn’t know why he was spared. François’ nephew will be buried near a mass grave at Pont-Sondé’s lone cemetery, where an 83-year-old caretaker serves as the lone witness to most burials since the attack, with the relatives of victims either dead or having joined the more than 6,200 people who fled to the nearby coastal city of Saint-Marc for safety. On Tuesday, the caretaker pointed to the recent graves he dug, noting none of their relatives were able to attend the burials. They are the most recent victims of a surge of gang violence to hit the Artibonite region in recent years, although the magnitude of Thursday’s attack shocked many. 'This is the most terrifying massacre in decades in Haiti,' said Romain Le Cour, senior expert on Haiti for the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime. 'It’s definitely a show of force.' Such massacres were limited to the capital of Port-au-Prince, of which 80% is controlled by gangs and is now being patrolled by Kenyan police leading a U.N.-backed mission struggling with a lack of funds and personnel. The attack poses additional challenges to authorities already struggling with gang violence in the capital, Le Cour said. 'It’s a very, very tragic message and challenge sent to the authorities and the international community,' he said. ‘I’m left with nothing' Gone is the chatter of street vendors and the rumbling of small, colorful buses known as tap-taps crowded with passengers. The only noises now are the angry whispering, the shovel hitting the dirt at the cemetery and the occasional motorcycle carrying a coffin. The handful of people who stayed behind now carry machetes, walking past walls pocked with bullet holes and floors smeared with blood. 'Young men in the area were fighting back,' Chavanne said, referring to a local self-defense group known as 'The Coalition' that was trying to keep the Gran Grif gang at bay. 'This is how we were able to resist.' But it was those very efforts that sparked the attack, according to Haiti’s National Human Rights Defense Network. The human rights group said in a report that Gran Grif was angry that the self-defense group was trying to limit gang activity and prevent it from profiting off a makeshift road toll it had recently established nearby. 'The night that they invaded, there was nothing that they were able to do,' Chavanne said of the self-defense group. The leader of Gran Grif, Luckson Elan, was recently sanctioned by the U.N. Security Council and the U.S. government. Also sanctioned was Prophane Victor, the former legislator that the U.N. accused of arming young men in the Artibonite region. Chavanne and others questioned what police plan to do now. 'Four days later, the gang is still threatening people on social media, saying that they’re coming back to finish them,' he said. 'And now, I’m left with nothing in my hands, just dead family members.' ___ Dánica Coto reported from San Juan, Puerto Rico.

Restorers complete work on the canopy covering St. Peter's main altar ahead of the 2025 Jubilee	VATICAN CITY (AP) — Restorers put the finishing touches Tuesday on the ornate canopy covering the main altar in St. Peter’s Basilica, which has been covered in scaffolding for months during the first renovation of Baroque architect and sculptor Gian Lorenzo Bernini’s masterpiece in more than 250 years. Journalists were allowed a bird’s eye view of the 29-meter canopy, or baldachin, on Tuesday, climbing the scaffolding to observe where workers have buffed the intricate surface of the bronze and wood canopy. During the renovation, workers for the Fabbrica di San Pietro, which maintains the basilica, discovered bits of the baldachin’s history, including a forgotten bit of sandwich and nuts that could be over 200 years old, a 17th Century shopping list including tomatoes and bread, and most telling: the sole of a child’s shoe. The sole explains the tradition of using children 'suspended on a rope and go and clean the most difficult areas,' said engineer Alberto Capitanucci. The making of the scaffolding was key to the success of the work, as it needed to allow workers access 'to every point of the canopy with reasonable ease,' he said. 'The wood has proven to be in excellent condition, which is the element that we expected to be the most delicate,’’ he said. When the scaffolding is removed on Oct. 27, Capitanucci said visitors can expect to be dazzled by the sheen of restored gold plate, and the leather effect that was achieved through the restoration of the bronze. The work was completed with an eye on the upcoming Jubilee year, which Pope Francis will inaugurate in December. The structure, which is positioned over the basilica’s main altar to provide a ceremonial covering for the tomb of St. Peter underneath, was completed from the 1620s to 1630s on Pope Urban VIII commission of Baroque architect and sculptor Gian Lorenzo Bernini. It is considered one of the most complicated multi-material artworks of all time, with marble, bronze, wood, gold, and iron. Numerous craftsmen and artists, including master architect Francesco Borromini, contributed to its completion. ___ Silvia Stellaci contributed to this report. ___ Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

Authorities in Belarus open new criminal probes against scores of opposition activists	TALLINN, Estonia (AP) — Belarusian authorities said Tuesday that they have launched new criminal investigations against dozens of opposition activists, part of a sweeping crackdown on dissent ahead of next year's presidential vote, in which the country's authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko intends to seek a seventh term. He has already been in power for more than 30 years. After Lukashenko's previous re-election in 2020, which was seen at home and abroad as rigged, he responded to a wave of mass protests with brutal repressions that saw more than 65,000 people detained. About 1,300 are currently held behind bars as political prisoners, according to the Viasna human rights group, including the group’s founder and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Ales Bialiatski. The Investigative Committee, Belarus’ top state criminal investigation agency, announced Tuesday that it has opened new criminal inquiries against 22 opposition activists on charges of their alleged involvement in a 'conspiracy to seize power' and against 23 others who are accused of creating an 'extremist group' for their activities. The activists, most of whom have fled Belarus, have been slapped with confiscation of their apartments and other assets and will face up to 12 years in prison if convicted. The new criminal investigations follow the activists’ move to launch a new effort to coordinate the opposition activities ahead of next year’s presidential vote and set the stage for future democratic reforms. In August, Belarusian opposition activists also staged rallies in several countries. Hundreds of thousands have fled the country amid the brutal crackdown on protests after the 2020 election. Viasna said that at least 66 opposition activists, who have returned to Belarus, have been convicted and sentenced on politically motivated charges. Some others have been sent to psychiatric hospitals for mandatory treatment.	https://apnews.com/article/belarus-opposition-lukashenko-crackdown-6d6a4ba59fff5dd32782141e5c897089	2024-10-08T08:25:11-07:00	
Mexico's president lays out a plan to combat cartel violence. But it looks like more of the same	MEXICO CITY (AP) — Mexico’s new president laid out a plan Tuesday to combat drug cartel violence, but analysts say it appears to be largely a continuation of previous policy. President Claudia Sheinbaum said that she plans to increase intelligence and investigative work, but her main focus will apparently remain the 'hugs, not bullets' approach used by her predecessor. Sheinbaum took over last week from her mentor, former President Andres Manuel López Obrador, who largely failed in his own plan to bring down Mexico’s homicide rate. López Obrador refused to confront the cartels, instead relying on the armed forces and appeals to gangs to keep the peace. 'There is a continuity in the militarization of public safety,' Mexican security analyst David Saucedo said. 'There will also be a continuation of social programs to try to prevent youths from being recruited by organized crime.' Sheinbaum's top security official, Omar García Harfuch, said that 'we will continue with the strategy begun in the administration of President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, to give priority attention to the poorest families.' Mike Vigil, a former head of the DEA’s foreign operations, said that the new plan appears to be 'more of the same.' In 2023, Mexico had a homicide rate of about 24 per 100,000 inhabitants, more than four times higher than the U.S. rate. But officials said that they were also worried about extortion, a crime that the cartels have increasingly turned to along with migrant smuggling, to supplement their income. Sheinbaum blamed the killings in Guanajuato, the state with the highest number of homicides in Mexico, on low wages. 'Clearly, in Guanajuato there is a development model that has failed,' she said. But Saucedo said that poverty doesn't explain it. Guanajuato is an industrial and farming hub where drug use is relatively high, but it also has rail and highway links that cartels are fighting over, because they are used to move drugs toward the border with the United States. 'According to that logic, the entire country would have the same problem, because there are low wages in the whole country,' Saucedo said. In the last weeks of López Obrador's presidency, Mexico's Congress formally handed the National Guard over to the control of the Defense Department. The 120,000-member force was originally supposed to be under civilian command, but had already been largely trained and recruited by the army. The shortcomings of that militarized approach is evident in provincial cities and towns, where the National Guard performs set-piece patrols and establishes security cordons like soldiers, but do little on-the-street investigative work like police, arrest relatively few people and build even fewer criminal cases. Inhabitants of rural areas say National Guard officers often refuse to leave their bases until they get orders from headquarters, even if crimes are being committed outside. And a good part of the National Guard's force is currently assigned to rounding up migrants before they reach the U.S. border, not fighting crime. García Harfuch pledged Tuesday to have the guard function more as a police force, though that is not their training. He pledged to create a sort of national security academy to train law enforcement, and establish an office to integrate intelligence on the gangs gathered by the army, navy and federal investigators. 'The need is to convert the intelligence the country has, into investigations,' said García Harfuch, who formerly served as Mexico City's police chief. Sheinbaum faces an ongoing problem, as illustrated by the killing last week of the mayor of Chilpancingo, the capital of southern Guerrero state. The mayor's head was apparently severed and left on the roof of a pickup truck in the gang-dominated city. And violence in the northern state of Sinaloa has heated up intensely after two top Sinaloa cartel capos flew to the United States in July, where they were detained. The two capos were from different factions of the cartel, and the idea that one of the capos forced the other onto the plane has sparked infighting. So far this year, from January to August, homicides were down 10.7% from their peak in the same period of 2018, but that year was an outlier because of cartel turf battles. The 2024 figures on homicides in the first eight months of the year were 8.6% higher than they were in 2017, under López Obrador's predecessor, Enrique Peña Nieto.	https://apnews.com/article/mexico-president-sheinbaum-cartel-violence-strategy-d7c03d1bdfd3985f58b1f5a935c564af	2024-10-08T07:50:37-07:00	
Woodward book reveals Trump's calls with Putin and Biden's private remarks on Obama and Netanyahu	WASHINGTON (AP) — Donald Trump has had as many as seven private phone calls with Vladimir Putin since leaving office and secretly sent the Russian president COVID-19 test machines during the height of the pandemic, Bob Woodward reported in his new book, 'War.' The revelations were made in the famed Watergate reporter's latest book, which also details President Joe Biden's frustrations with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman 's assortment of burner phones. The Associated Press obtained an early copy of the book, which is due out next week. Steven Cheung, Trump's communications director, denied the accounts in the book. 'None of these made up stories by Bob Woodward are true and are the work of a truly demented and deranged man who suffers from a debilitating case of Trump Derangement Syndrome,' Cheung said in a statement. Trump had previously spoken to Woodward for the journalist's 2021 book, 'Rage.' Trump later sued over it, claiming Woodward never had permission to publicly release recordings of their interviews for the book. The publisher and Woodward denied his allegations. Here is more from the new book: Trump has had multiple calls with Putin since his White House term ended Woodward reports that Trump asked an aide to leave his office at his Florida resort, Mar-a-Lago, so that the former president could have a private call with Putin in early 2024. The aide, whom Woodward doesn’t name, said there have been multiple calls between Trump and Putin since Trump left office, perhaps as many as seven, according to the book, though it does not detail what they discussed. Trump senior adviser and longtime aide Jason Miller told Woodward that he had not heard Trump was having calls with Putin and said, 'I'd push back on that.' But Miller also said, according to the book, 'I’m sure they’d know how to get in touch with each other.' Trump's relationship with Putin has been scrutinized since his 2016 campaign for president, when he memorably called on Russia to find and make public missing emails deleted by Hillary Clinton, his Democratic opponent. 'Russia, if you’re listening, I hope you’re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing,' he said. U.S. intelligence agencies later determined that Russia had meddled in the 2016 election to help Trump, though an investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller found no conspiracy between the Trump team and Russia. In 2018, Trump publicly questioned that finding following an in-person meeting with Putin in Helsinki. In recent years, Trump has criticized U.S. support for Ukraine as it fights off Russia’s invasion. He has said Ukraine should have made concessions to Putin before Russia invaded in 2022. He also previously touted his good relationship with Putin and called the Russian leader 'pretty smart' for invading Ukraine. Trump sent COVID-19 test machines to Putin for his personal use Woodward reports that Trump sent Putin COVID-19 test machines for his personal use as the virus began spreading in 2020. Putin told Trump not to tell anyone because people would be mad at Trump over it, but Trump said he didn’t care if anyone knew, according to the book. Trump ended up agreeing not to tell anyone. The book doesn’t specify when the machines were sent but describes it as being when the virus spread rapidly through Russia. It was previously reported by The Associated Press and other agencies that Trump’s administration in May 2020 sent ventilators and other equipment to several countries, including Russia. Vice President Kamala Harris, in an interview Tuesday with radio host Howard Stern, accused Trump of giving the machines to a 'murderous dictator' at a time when 'everyone was scrambling' to get tests. 'This person who wants to be president again, who secretly is helping out an an adversary while the American people are dying by the hundreds every day,' said Harris, the Democratic presidential candidate. Biden's anger at Netanyahu has boiled over in private The book also details Biden’s complicated relationship with Netanyahu as well as private moments when the president has been fed up with him over the Israel-Hamas war. Biden’s 'frustrations and distrust' of Netanyahu 'erupted' this past spring, Woodward writes. The president privately unleashed a profanity-laden tirade, calling him a 'son of a bitch' and a 'bad f——— guy,' according to the book. Biden said he felt, in Woodward’s accounting, that Netanyahu 'had been lying to him regularly.' With Netanyahu 'continuing to say he was going to kill every last member of Hamas.' Woodward wrote, 'Biden had told him that was impossible, threatening both privately and publicly to withhold offensive U.S. weapons shipment.' Biden and Netanyahu have long been acquainted, although their relationship has not been known to be close or overly friendly. Last week, Biden said he didn’t know whether the Israeli leader was holding up a Mideast peace deal in order to influence the outcome of the 2024 U.S. presidential election. Asked about the book's reporting, White House spokesperson Emilie Simons told reporters Tuesday that 'The commitment that we have to the state of Israel is ironclad.' Simons, when pressed on the details, said she wouldn't comment on every anecdote that may come out in reporting. She added of Biden and Netanyahu: 'They have a long-term relationship. They have a very honest and direct relationship, and I don’t have a comment on those specific anecdotes.' Biden criticized Obama's handling of the Russian invasion of Crimea The book details Biden’s criticism late last year of President Barack Obama’s handling of Putin’s earlier invasion of Ukraine, when Russia seized Crimea and a section of the Donbas in 2014, at a time when Biden was serving as the Democrat’s vice president. 'They f----- up in 2014,' Woodward wrote that Biden said to a close friend in December, blaming the lack of action for Putin’s actions in Ukraine. 'Barack never took Putin seriously.' Biden was angry while speaking to the friend and said they 'never should have let Putin just walk in there' in 2014 and that the U.S. 'did nothing.' Biden regrets choosing Garland as attorney general Woodward reports Biden was privately furious with Attorney General Merrick Garland for appointing a special counsel to investigate Biden’s son Hunter in a tax-and-gun prosecution. 'Should never have picked Garland,' Biden told an associate, according to Woodward. The journalist did not name the associate. Hunter Biden was convicted in June on federal gun charges and faces sentencing in federal court in Delaware in December. He pleaded guilty to federal tax charges in California and is also set to be sentenced in that case in December. Graham says going to Mar-a-Lago is ‘a little bit like going to North Korea’ One of Trump’s longest-term allies, South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, blamed Trump’s ongoing false claims that the 2020 election was rigged to a cult of personality in which the former president’s ensconcement at Mar-a-Lago and circle of aides and advisers 'constantly feed this narrative,' according to the book. The weekend after Russia invaded Ukraine, Graham was with Trump at Mar-a-Lago, which the senator characterized as 'a little bit like going to North Korea.' Graham added that 'everybody stands up and claps every time Trump comes in.' On politics, Woodward wrote that Graham’s counsel was part of what persuaded Trump to run again for the presidency. In March, during one of his many visits to the Middle East since Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, Graham told Woodward that he had been meeting with the Saudi crown prince when Graham suggested they call Trump. From 'a bag containing about 50 burner phones,' Prince Mohammed 'pulled out one labeled ‘TRUMP 45.’' On another trip, Woodward wrote, the Saudi leader retrieved another burner phone, 'this time labeled JAKE SULLIVAN ' when the men called Biden’s national security adviser. ___ Price reported from New York.

The Latest: Harris continues media blitz with 3 more national interviews	Vice President Kamala Harris is continuing her media tour Tuesday with three more interviews for national audiences, with Election Day now just four weeks away. The Democratic presidential nominee was scheduled to appear in New York with the women of 'The View,' speak with radio host Howard Stern, and tape a show with late-night comedian Stephen Colbert. The trio of appearances comes after Harris granted interviews to CBS’ '60 Minutes,' which aired Monday night, and Anderson's Cooper’s podcast, which was released Sunday. The blitz comes after Harris has largely avoided interviews since replacing President Joe Biden at the top of the Democratic ticket. Long past the midway point of her unexpected presidential campaign and with voting already underway, Harris is still introducing herself to Americans who will determine her fate in this year’s presidential election. Follow the AP’s Election 2024 coverage at: https://apnews.com/hub/election-2024. Here’s the latest: Woodward's book details Trump's post-presidency calls with Putin Bob Woodward writes in his new book 'War' that former President Donald Trump has had as many as seven private phone calls with Vladimir Putin since leaving office and that he secretly sent the Russian president COVID-19 test machines in 2020. Woodward reports that Trump asked an aide to leave his office at Mar-a-Lago so that the former president could have a private call with Putin in early 2024. Woodward also reports that Putin told Trump not to tell anyone about sending him COVID-19 test machines. Trump’s communications director Steven Cheung said the book was filled with 'made up stories.'

The Associated Press obtained an early copy of the book, which is due out next week. Poll shows Harris faring well and Trump faring poorly with Black voters Black registered voters have an overwhelmingly positive view of Harris, according to a recent poll from the AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. About 7 in 10 Black voters have a somewhat or very favorable view of Harris, with few differences between Black men and women voters on how they view the Democratic candidate. Black voters’ opinions of Trump, by contrast, were overwhelmingly negative, underscoring the challenges he faces as he seeks to erode Harris’ support among Black men. But the poll also found that despite this dramatic gap in views, many Black voters don’t see Harris as a candidate who will set the country on a better trajectory or make a substantial difference in their own lives. Jill Biden to launch 5-day campaign tour for Harris campaign Jill Biden will return to the campaign trail this week on a tour of battleground states to help boost the Harris-Walz campaign. Harris’ campaign and the White House announced Tuesday that the first lady will depart Friday on a five-day, five-state swing with stops in Arizona, Nevada, Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. The appearances will mark the first lady’s return to campaigning. She had campaigned extensively for her husband, President Joe Biden, when he was running for reelection. But she pulled back after Biden folded his campaign and endorsed Harris to replace him on the Democratic ticket. With four weeks to go until Election Day, Harris’ campaign said the first lady will be urging people to get out and vote. The campaign noted that early voting is set to start Wednesday in Arizona and that mail ballots are going out in the five states that Jill Biden will be visiting. Democratic senators take different approaches on Biden as he campaigns in swing states President Joe Biden is campaigning through two key swing states, but two Democratic senators locked in competitive reelection battles are taking markedly different approaches to the the outgoing president. Biden will be fully embraced by Democratic Sen. Bob Casey when he participates in a private campaign fundraiser in suburban Philadelphia for the senior Pennsylvania senator. But in Milwaukee, where Biden is spotlighting his administration’s efforts to replace the nation’s toxic lead pipes, incumbent Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin will be conspicuously absent. Biden has spent scant time on the campaign trail since ending his reelection effort in July. That makes his stops in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin — two tightly contested states that Harris and Trump see as crucial — all the more notable. But as Biden makes a quick swing through the key states, two Democratic senators locked in competitive reelection battles are taking markedly different approaches to the outgoing president, whose approval ratings in a significant swath of the country remain in the pits. Casey’s and Baldwin’s races are also seen as must-wins for Democrats who are trying to maintain their razor-tight control of the Senate. Trump speaks in Florida as Hurricane Milton approaches Trump spoke at Trump International Doral in Miami, headlining a memorial service for the attack on Oct. 7, 2023, against Israel, telling his audience the threat of Hurricane Milton wouldn't have kept him away. 'I think I’m the only person who flew into Florida today,' Trump said at the outset of his remarks. 'I wouldn’t have missed it, regardless.' Milton, a Category 5 hurricane, could come ashore Wednesday in the Tampa Bay region. Trump said he had never heard of a Category 5 hurricane hitting land. However, hurricanes Andrew and Michael in Florida were Category 5, the latter of which struck during his administration. Biden spoke with DeSantis about hurricane preparation President Joe Biden has spoken with Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis to discuss preparations in Florida for the approaching Hurricane Milton and ongoing recovery efforts from the devastation caused by Hurricane Helene. The White House confirmed the president’s call with the governor after Harris earlier on Monday accused DeSantis of 'playing political games' and engaging in 'political gamesmanship' over the federal response to Helene. Biden, according to the White House, asked DeSantis 'to call him directly if there is anything that can be done to further support the response and recovery efforts.' Harris’ office suggested earlier that DeSantis was dodging Harris, saying she reached out to the governor last week but the two never spoke. DeSantis said that he 'didn’t know that she had called' and 'they didn’t call me.' Biden also spoke on Monday with Tampa Mayor Jane Castor and received a detailed briefing from National Weather Service Director Ken Graham on the expected impact Milton will cause. Graham stressed during the briefing that people in the storm’s path should evacuate now while there’s time to do so.	https://apnews.com/article/harris-trump-election-2024-831fd5c5a53476639c664234b1dafe3b	2024-10-08T06:16:52-07:00

Blinken heads to Asia this week for a summit of regional leaders	WASHINGTON (AP) — Secretary of State Antony Blinken will make his 19th trip in office to Asia this week when he leads the U.S. delegation to a meeting of East Asian leaders in Laos. The State Department said Tuesday that Blinken would fill in for President Joe Biden at the annual East Asia Summit, hosted by the chair of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. Blinken will travel to Laos’ capital, Vientiane, for meetings on Thursday and Friday before returning home. He had been due to join Biden in Germany and Angola over the weekend but the White House announced that the president was postponing his travel due to the severe hurricane weather in the U.S. Frayed relations with China, particularly over Beijing's increasing assertiveness in the South China Sea regarding territorial disputes with its smaller neighbors, will be a major agenda item for Blinken, said Dan Kritenbrink, the top U.S. diplomat for Asia. Blinken late last month met with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly in New York, but Kritenbrink could not say if Blinken plans to hold separate meetings in Laos with Chinese officials. China will be represented at the summit by Premier Li Qiang. 'A number of (China)-related issues are likely to come up in the context of the ASEAN meetings, including the situation in the South China Sea and China’s continuing to take a number of escalatory and irresponsible steps designed to coerce and pressure many in the South China Sea claimants,' Kritenbrink said. 'Our channels of communication with (China) remain open, and we’ll continue to focus, as we always have, on not just defending U.S. national interests and those of our allies, but also to managing responsibly our competition with China,' he said.	https://apnews.com/article/blinken-laos-china-east-asia-summit-2e39cff49881c0cf2aba06264bcefdca	2024-10-08T05:13:36-07:00	
Manitoba's train is a lifeline for many towns. Now tourists are also discovering the route	The setting sun backlights a pristine panoply of pines of different sizes and species. Far northern Canadian countryside rolls by at a leisurely pace of a train ride, viewed through an upper deck glass-enclosed of a special observation car. Waves of green and brown in slightly varying shades sweep by. There’s no working Wi-Fi to interrupt with emails or social media demanding attention. It's mesmerizing and calming. Two or three hours pass peacefully without notice. Now repeat. Repeat again. And again. Two hours becomes two days. To get between Churchill, Manitoba, Canada — the polar bear and beluga whale capital of the world and a tourist hot spot for northern adventure tourism — and Winnipeg, Manitoba, there are only two options: A $1,100 one-way plane flight that takes two-and-a-half hours or a scenic 45-hour to 49-hour much cheaper train ride. It's a $200 train ride like few others from the glass ceiling of the observation car Canada’s VIA railroad bills it as a 'scenic adventure.' It starts with a vista of the tree-less but not quite barren tundra, then powers through hours of tall forests. They eventually give way to more manicured cropland with the occasional animal, even a herd of elk. Sunset glimmers off a lake. When night comes it holds the hope of a Northern Lights sighting stretching all around. If there are no glimmering auroras, there's a special beauty in the pitch black outside with only the lights of the train interrupting. And it goes on for 1,697 kilometers (1,054 miles). There are 10 listed stops enroute with some only for a few minutes and others a few hours. It's Churchill's connection to the rest of the world While it's promoted for tourism, the train is actually a lifeline for the town of Churchill. The community has roads inside town and for a few miles to the outskirts, but no roads go to other cities. So it's expensive flying or an overnight train ride at a more reasonable price tag. The semi-weekly trains bring tourists, residents, mail, food, fuel and other necessities. From May 2017 to October 2018, part of the rail line washed out because of storms and poor maintenance, stranding an entire community. Staples had to be delivered by air and propane fuel was brought in by ship through the Hudson Bay. Prices in town skyrocketed and lawsuits were filed over who was responsible for the repair costs. 'We had no rail service for about 18 months meaning Churchilleans couldn’t go out by rail to visit their families in other parts of Manitoba,' Churchill Mayor Mike Spence said. 'It was devastating.' The town and some First Nations in the area took over the rail line and it’s back to operating. Spence said with the community pouring tens of millions of dollars into repairs the lines should stay open even as the world's weather gets more extreme. It's a very long ride Sleeper berths are available on the train, along with shower cubicles the size of those in a New York hotel room, but for those traveling more cheaply or booking late, there are standard seats in the cabin. The seats recline — mostly. But it's not full laying down. Food is also limited. There is a small galley below the observation deck. It has some food, heated by a microwave. The train does serve beer, but limited brands. Frequent commuters and those who do their research know to bring their own snacks on board, and make the most of the restaurants at longer stops in towns on route. Stations along the way vary greatly: In Dauphin, passengers wait outside an historic brick station built in 1912, but in Wabowden, a single yellow sign nailed to a pole near the track that reads 'Muster Point' alerts passengers to the stop. For residents of smaller communities along the route, the train provides the only connection to other parts of Manitoba. At Thompson, passengers are better connected — and fed Many ride the train weekly, traveling to and from Thompson. At about 13,600 residents, it’s the biggest community the train stops at, besides Winnipeg, with amenities like big-box stores and restaurants. Thompson — just under halfway between Churchill and Winnipeg — is where many Churchill residents train journey ends. Residents said they often keep cars in Thompson, take the train there and then drive to Winnipeg. They can shave 17 hours off the trip that way, they said. All but two dozen passengers got off at Thompson, the closest bigger community connected to the rest of Manitoba by road. First Nation communities line the route After leaving Thompson, the train heads to remote First Nation communities on both sides of the route. And though the journey distance-wise is short, it takes hours by train, with many passengers passing the time playing cards and chatting with each other in the dining car. The town of Pas, a longer stop on the route, includes a bar right by the station. But the train's porter warned passengers off it, saying it was a rather rough establishment. She knew because she has been there. In Thicket Portage, population around 150, residents gather to meet their rides back to town at the stop, a small wooden shack near the tracks. Here, they unload their luggage and other goods, food, diapers and other staples. The train also ventured into a different zone in eastern Saskatchewan and the cute downtown of Canora, which strangely wasn’t on the train schedule for stops. As the train heads further south, the landscape changes, the northern forest giving way to crop fields and livestock as the route approaches Winnipeg in southern Manitoba. And finally, after 49 hours, the train pulls into Winnipeg. This glimpse into the beautiful monotony of vast stretches of untouched trees and tan tundra is a trip of a lifetime, which — for some passengers at least — seemed to last that long. ___ Read more of AP’s climate coverage at http://www.apnews.com/climate-and-environment ___ Follow Seth Borenstein and Joshua Bickel on X at @borenbears and @Joshuabickel ______ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Who is Naim Kassem, the acting leader of Hezbollah?	BEIRUT (AP) — Sheikh Naim Kassem has been the acting head of Hezbollah since its longtime leader Hassan Nasrallah was killed as part of an Israeli offensive that has taken out many of the Lebanese militant group’s senior officials. Kassem made a defiant televised speech Tuesday, claiming that the group's military capabilities are intact and Israelis will only suffer further as fighting continues. Like Nasrallah, Kassem is one of the founding members of the Shiite political party and armed group, but he is widely seen as lacking the former leader’s charisma and oratory skills. Still, the white-turbaned cleric with a gray beard has often been the public face of the group. After Nasrallah went underground out of fear of being assassinated by Israel, appearing only in televised speeches, Kassem continued to show up at rallies and ceremonies, and he has sat for interviews with foreign journalists. Mohanad Hage Ali, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Middle East Center think tank who researches Hezbollah, said that Kassem is perceived by many as 'more extreme' than Nasrallah, at least in his public statements. In practice, however, his power within the group was limited under Nasrallah. Hashem Safieddine, a cousin of Nasrallah who oversees the group’s political affairs — not Kassem — was generally regarded as the leader's heir apparent. But no announcement has been made, and Safieddine has not appeared publicly or made any public statements since Nasrallah’s death. Kassem has been sanctioned by the United States, which considers Hezbollah a terrorist group. He was born in the town of Kfar Fila in southern Lebanon and studied chemistry at the Lebanese University before working for several years as a chemistry teacher. At the same time, he pursued religious studies and participated in founding the Lebanese Union for Muslim Students, an organization that aimed to promote religious adherence among students. In the 1970s, Kassem joined the Movement of the Dispossessed, a political organization founded by Imam Moussa Sadr that pushed for greater representation for Lebanon’s historically overlooked and impoverished Shiite community. The group morphed into the Amal movement, one of the main armed groups in Lebanon’s civil war, and now a powerful political party. He then joined the nascent Hezbollah, formed with support from Iran after Israel invaded Lebanon in 1982 and occupied the country’s southern region. From 1991, he served as deputy secretary-general of the group, initially under Nasrallah’s predecessor, Abbas Mousawi, who was killed by an Israeli helicopter attack in 1992.	https://apnews.com/article/naim-kassem-hezbollah-hassan-nasrallah-90b79db6df55ff3cb77877a7c65790fd	2024-10-08T04:15:49-07:00	
MI5 spy chief says Russia and Iran are behind a 'staggering' rise in deadly plots	LONDON (AP) — Britain is facing a 'staggering rise' in assassination attempts on U.K. soil by Russia and Iran, as the hostile states recruit criminals to 'do their dirty work' for them, the head of the U.K.’s domestic intelligence agency said Tuesday. MI5 director Ken McCallum said his agents and police have tackled 20 Tehran-backed plots since 2022 and warned that Iran could expand its targets in the U.K. if Israel attacks in response to Iran’s missile barrage. The spy chief said the widening conflicts in the Middle East raise the risk 'of an increase in – or broadening of – Iranian state aggression in the U.K.' In a rare public speech setting out the major threats to the U.K. from both hostile states and terror groups, McCallum said there also is a risk that Israel’s conflicts with Iran-backed militant groups -- Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthis in Yemen - could trigger terror attacks in the U.K. The Middle East crisis has not translated 'at scale into terrorist violence' in Britain, he said, but hostile states, individual attackers and a revived Islamic State group combine to create 'the most complex and interconnected threat environment we’ve ever seen.' The number of state-threat investigations undertaken by MI5 has risen by 48% in the past year, with Iran, Russia and, China the main perpetrators, McCallum told journalists at the U.K.’s counterterrorism command center in London McCallum said that since the death of Mahsa Amini, who died in Iranian police custody in September 2022 after being detained for allegedly violating the Islamic republic’s mandatory headscarf law, 'we’ve seen plot after plot here in the U.K., at an unprecedented pace and scale.' He said MI5 and the police have responded to 20 potentially lethal Iran-backed plots since January 2022, an increase of a third on the figure of 15 the government gave at the end of January. McCallum said Russia’s military intelligence agency was trying to use 'arson, sabotage and more' to create 'mayhem' on the streets of Britain and other European countries. Both Russia and Iran often turn to criminals, 'from international drug traffickers to low-level crooks,' to carry out attacks, he said, The U.K.’s official terror threat level stands at 'substantial,' the middle of a five-point scale, meaning an attack is likely, and since 2017 MI5 and the police have disrupted 43 late-stage terror plots. While about three-quarters of terror plots stem from Islamic extremist ideology and a quarter from the extreme right, he said those labels 'don’t fully reflect the dizzying range of beliefs and ideologies we see,' drawn from a soup of 'online hatred, conspiracy theories and disinformation,' McCallum said. He also said there was worrying signs that the Islamic State group is back, despite the collapse of its self-declared caliphate in Iraq and Syria. McCallum said that 'after a few years of being pinned well back, they’ve resumed efforts to export terrorism.' 'The first 20 years of my career here were crammed full of terrorist threats,' McCallum said. 'We now face those alongside state-backed assassination and sabotage plots, against the backdrop of a major European land war.'	https://apnews.com/article/uk-intelligence-mi5-threats-russia-iran-936d7c24d303ffea41f6b1cef7c7b814	2024-10-08T03:30:58-07:00	
Small town in Thailand hold mass cremation for 23 who died in a school trip bus fire	LAN SAK, Thailand (AP) — Mourners wept and monks prayed at a cremation ceremony Tuesday in a small town in central Thailand for 23 young students and teachers who died in last week’s bus fire on a school field trip. A large cremation site was set up close to the temple in Lan Sak town whose compound hosts the school that was attended by the victims. Several furnaces with tall chimneys were erected, with floral adornments placed in front of them. Six teachers and 39 elementary and junior high school students were on the bus when it caught fire on Oct. 1 on a highway in Pathum Thani, a northern suburb of Bangkok. It spread so quickly that only 22 people were able to escape. After forensic work in Bangkok made positive identifications of the badly burnt bodies, the victims' remains were were returned to their hometown for funeral rites that began last week. The tragedy sparked national outrage over insufficient safety procedures and pushed the authorities to take immediate legal action. Police arrested the driver of the bus for alleged reckless driving and announced they were charging the woman in whose name the bus was registered with negligence causing death. Transport officials were being scrutinized after information emerged that the bus had passed an inspection about four months before the fire. In the wake of the accident, investigators found that the bus was fitted with 11 natural gas canisters although it had a permit for only six. Officials have said that the bus, which was more than 50 years old, had been modified to run on CNG — compressed natural gas — which is often used especially by commercial vehicles to save money. Police They believe that a gas tube from one of the canisters had come loose, with sparks then setting the leaking gas on fire. The more than 13,000 buses running on CNG were ordered inspected within 60 days, while the Education Ministry suspended school study trips in the meantime. Tuesday’s cremation in Uthai Thai province was held under the sponsorship of King Maha Vajiralongkorn, who sent the head of his Privy Council, former army chief and prime minister Surayud Chulanont, to represent him.	https://apnews.com/article/thailand-bus-fire-cremation-d549dd09b10e525b434f4dc3d4840d91	2024-10-08T03:03:04-07:00	
Japan prosecutors will not appeal acquittal of world's longest death-row inmate in retrial	TOKYO (AP) — Japanese prosecutors said Tuesday they will not appeal the acquittal of the world’s longest-serving death-row inmate in a retrial last month, bringing closure to the 1966 murder case after more than a half-century of legal battles. Prosecutor-general Naomi Unemoto said the prosecution decided not to appeal the Shizuoka District Court decision that found Iwao Hakamada not guilty in a retrial 58 years after his arrest, saying: 'We feel sorry for putting him in a legally unstable situation for an extremely long time.' Hakamada, an 88-year-old former boxer, was found not guilty on Oct. 26 by the Shizuoka court, which concluded that police and prosecutors collaborated in fabricating and planting evidence against him. The court said he was forced into confession by violent, hourslong interrogations. The top prosecutors’ decision to not appeal two days before the Oct. 10 deadline finalizes Hakamada’s acquittal by the district court. 'I’m delighted that we finally resolved this. Case closed,' his 91-year-old sister Hideko Hakamada told reporters after getting a phone call from her lawyer about the prosecutors’ decision. 'I kind of knew this was going to happen,' Hakamada said, with a laugh. Unemoto, in a statement on the Supreme Public Prosecutors Office website, also apologized for Hakamada's decades-long unstable legal situation amid a lengthy court process and pledged to investigate why the retrial took so long. Hakamada was convicted of murder in the 1966 killing of an executive and three of his family members and setting fire to their home in central Japan. He was sentenced to death in 1968 but was not executed, due to the lengthy appeal and retrial process in Japan’s notoriously slow-paced justice system. Hakamada became the fifth death row inmate to be found not guilty in a retrial in postwar Japan, where prosecutors have a more than 99% conviction rate and retrials are extremely rare. He spent more than 45 years on death row, making him the world’s longest-serving death-row inmate, according to Amnesty International. With Tuesday’s settlement of the retrial ruling, Hakamada is now entitled to receive government compensation of up to about 200 million yen ($1.4 million). His lawyer Hideyo Ogawa has said his defense team is considering filing a damage suit against the government and the Shizuoka prefecture over the collaboration of prosecutors and police in fabricating evidence, despite knowing it could send Hakamada to the gallows.	https://apnews.com/article/japan-hakamada-acquittal-retrial-death-penalty-prosecution-2e4f2930c6f73f398676e27caceb40b0	2024-10-08T02:54:47-07:00	
Biggest Kashmir party opposed to India's stripping of region's autonomy wins most seats in election	SRINAGAR, India (AP) — Kashmir’s biggest political party opposed to India's stripping of the region's semi-autonomy won the most seats in a local election, official data showed Tuesday, in a vote seen as a referendum against the move by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government. National Conference, or NC, won 42 seats, mainly from the Kashmir Valley, the heartland of the anti-India rebellion, according to the data. Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party secured 29 seats, all from the Hindu-dominated areas of Jammu. India’s main opposition Congress party, which fought the election in alliance with the NC, succeeded in six constituencies. 'People have supported us more than our expectations. Now our efforts will be to prove that we are worth these votes,' Omar Abdullah, the NC leader and the region’s former chief minister, told reporters in the main city of Srinagar. His father and president of the party, Farooq Abdullah, said that the mandate was to run the region without 'police raj (rule)' and try freeing people from jails. 'Media will be free,' he said. 'People have given their mandate, they have proven that they don’t accept the decision that was taken on August 5,' he added referring to India's move in Aug. 2019. The vote will allow Kashmir to have its own truncated government and a regional legislature, called an assembly, rather than being directly under New Delhi’s rule. However, there will be a limited transition of power from New Delhi to the assembly as Kashmir will remain a 'union territory' — directly controlled by the federal government — with India’s Parliament as its main legislator. Kashmir’s statehood must be restored for the new government to have powers similar to other states of India. Hundreds of the NC workers gathered outside counting centers and at the homes of the winning candidates to celebrate the party’s victory. It was the first such vote in a decade and the first since Modi’s Hindu nationalist government scrapped the Muslim-majority region’s long-held semi-autonomy in 2019. The unprecedented move downgraded and divided the former state into two centrally governed union territories, Ladakh and Jammu-Kashmir. Both are ruled directly by New Delhi through its appointed administrators along with unelected bureaucrats and security setup. The move — which largely resonated in India and among Modi supporters — was mostly opposed in Kashmir as an assault on its identity and autonomy amid fears that it would pave the way for demographic changes in the region. The region has since been on edge with civil liberties curbed and media gagged. India and Pakistan each administer a part of Kashmir, but both claim the territory in its entirety. The nuclear-armed rivals have fought two of their three wars over the territory since they gained independence from British colonial rule in 1947. Authorities tallied votes as thousands of additional police and paramilitary soldiers patrolled roads and guarded 28 counting centers. Nearly 8.9 million people were eligible to vote in the election, which began on Sept. 18 and concluded on Oct. 1. The overall turnout was 64% across the three phases, according to official data. In the region’s legislature, five seats are appointed and 90 elected, so a party or coalition would need at least 48 of the 95 total seats to form a government. The alliance of the National Conference and the Congress have 48 seats combined. Authorities have said the election will bring democracy to the region after decades of strife, but many locals viewed the vote as an opportunity not only to elect their own representatives but also to register their protest against the 2019 changes. Except for the BJP, most parties who contested the election campaigned on promises to reverse the 2019 changes and address key issues like rising unemployment and inflation. The Congress party favored restoring the region’s statehood. The BJP has also stated that it will restore statehood, but has not told when it would do. The BJP has vowed to block any move aimed at undoing most of the 2019 changes but promised to help in the region’s economic development. Meanwhile, Modi’s BJP appears to be heading for a victory in the northern state of Haryana, bordering New Delhi, which it has ruled for 10 years, leading in 50 constituencies and the Congress in 35 out of 90. The BJP has so far won 18 seats and is leading in 32 constituencies while the Congress has won 15 seats and is leading in 20, according to the Election Commission of India. A victory would give the BJP a record third five-year term in the state. The voting trend in Haryana state is a surprise since most exit polls had predicted an easy victory for the Congress party. Kashmir's last assembly election was held in 2014, after which the BJP for the first time ruled in a coalition with the local Peoples Democratic Party. But the government collapsed in 2018 after the BJP withdrew from the coalition. Polls in the past have been marked with violence, boycotts and vote-rigging, even though India called them a victory over separatism. Militants in the Indian-controlled portion of Kashmir have been fighting New Delhi’s rule since 1989. Many Muslim Kashmiris support the rebels’ goal of uniting the territory, either under Pakistani rule or as an independent country. India insists the Kashmir militancy is Pakistan-sponsored terrorism. Pakistan denies the charge, and many Kashmiris consider it a legitimate freedom struggle. Tens of thousands of civilians, rebels and government forces have been killed in the conflict. ___ Associated Press Writer Ashok Sharma in New Delhi contributed to this report. ___ Follow AP’s Asia-Pacific coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/asia-pacific	https://apnews.com/article/kashmir-india-election-assembly-modi-1d2531f3f1951bffe7cd2c13d49b0c60	2024-10-08T02:41:31-07:00	
FIFA bans Italian player Curto for 10 games for discrimination toward South Korean opponent	ZURICH (AP) — FIFA banned Italian soccer player Marco Curto for 10 games for making a discriminatory remark at South Korea forward Hee Chan Hwang in a preseason game between Como and Wolverhampton. The 25-year-old Curto also must do 'community services and undergo training and education with an organization approved by FIFA,' soccer’s governing body said in a statement on Tuesday. Como defended Curto after the game in July, claiming the remark that Hwang 'thinks he’s Jackie Chan' was not intended to be derogatory. Hwang reported the incident during the second half, leading to angry responses from his teammates, including Daniel Podence. The Portuguese forward was sent off for punching a Como player. The South Korea Football Association filed a formal complaint to FIFA, which notified Curto of his disciplinary ban late Monday. 'The player Marco Curto was found responsible for discriminatory behavior and sanctioned with a 10-match suspension,' FIFA said. Curto has since been loaned by top-tier Como to Serie B club Cesena and is set to miss five league games through Nov. 10. FIFA said it deferred five games of the ban for a probationary period of two years. FIFA this year urged all 211 of its member federations to take a coordinated approach to prosecuting incidents of alleged racism and discrimination. ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer	https://apnews.com/article/fifa-discrimination-como-curto-f15f287e3fa8cbb97cefd59536b069de	2024-10-08T01:56:22-07:00	
France tightens steps to prevent one of Osama bin Laden's sons from returning	PARIS (AP) — France’s interior minister said Tuesday he has taken additional steps against any effort by one of the sons of al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden to return to France. Omar bin Laden had been living in France’s Normandy region but left the country in October 2023 after French authorities withdrew his residency papers and ordered him out, the Interior Ministry said. At the time, authorities also barred him from returning to France for two years, the ministry added. In a post Tuesday on the social media platform X, French Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau said he imposed an additional ban to ensure that Omar bin Laden 'will not be able to return to France for any reason whatsoever.' French daily Le Parisien reported that Omar bin Laden now lives in Qatar. It said he had previously been living since 2016 in the Orne region of Normandy with his British wife and had been working as an artist. The newspaper said that last week he lost a legal battle to overturn the ban on him returning to France. Retailleau said French authorities had ordered him out of the country for social media posts deemed sympathetic of terrorism. His father Osama bin Laden, mastermind of the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks, was killed in a U.S. commando operation by U.S. Navy SEALs in 2011 in Pakistan.	https://apnews.com/article/france-alqaida-bin-laden-government-normandy-d51c5862a2ac8054a41c6cf432a3eb12	2024-10-08T01:28:07-07:00	
Water gushes through sand dunes after a rare rainfall in the Sahara desert	RABAT, Morocco (AP) — A rare deluge of rainfall left blue lagoons of water amid the palm trees and sand dunes of the Sahara desert, nourishing some of its driest regions with more water than they had seen in decades. Southeastern Morocco's desert is among the most arid places in the world and rarely experiences rain in late summer. The Moroccan government said two days of rainfall in September exceeded yearly averages in several areas that see less than 250 millimeters (10 inches) annually, including Tata, one of the areas hit hardest. In Tagounite, a village about 450 kilometers (280 miles) south of the capital, Rabat, more than 100 millimeters (3.9 inches) was recorded in a 24-hour period. The storms left striking images of water gushing through the Saharan sands amid castles and desert flora. NASA satellites showed water rushing in to fill Lake Iriqui, a famous lake bed between Zagora and Tata that had been dry for 50 years. In desert communities frequented by tourists, 4x4s motored through the puddles and residents surveyed the scene in awe. 'It’s been 30 to 50 years since we’ve had this much rain in such a short space of time,' said Houssine Youabeb of Morocco's General Directorate of Meteorology. Such rains, which meteorologists are calling an extratropical storm, may change the course of the region's weather in months and years to come as the air retains more moisture, causing more evaporation and drawing more storms, Youabeb said. Six consecutive years of drought have posed challenges for much of Morocco, forcing farmers to leave fields fallow and cities and villages to ration water. The bounty of rainfall will likely help refill the large groundwater aquifers beneath the desert that are relied upon to supply water in desert communities. The region's dammed reservoirs reported refilling at record rates throughout September. However, it's unclear how far September's rains will go toward alleviating drought. Water gushing through the sands and oases left more than 20 dead in Morocco and Algeria and damaged farmers' harvests, forcing the government to allocate emergency relief funds, including in some areas affected by last year's earthquake. ___ Ahmed reported from Bamako, Mali.	https://apnews.com/article/sahara-flooding-oasis-rain-morocco-2b6c28d2487a0ef370aff60775d0245d	2024-10-08T01:25:24-07:00	
Hezbollah leader says more Israelis will be displaced as the militants extend their rocket fire	BEIRUT (AP) — Hezbollah’s acting leader said Tuesday that even more Israelis will be displaced as the militant group extends its rocket fire deeper into Israel, in a defiant televised statement marking the anniversary of fighting that escalated into war last month. Sheikh Naim Kassem, the acting leader of Hezbollah, said its military capabilities are still intact and that it has replaced all of its senior commanders after weeks of heavy Israeli airstrikes across large parts of Lebanon, including targeted strikes that killed much of its top command in a matter of days. He also said Israeli forces have not been able to advance after launching a ground incursion into Lebanon last week. The Israeli military said a fourth division is now taking part in the incursion, which has expanded to the west, but operations still appear to be confined to a narrow strip along the border. The Israeli military says it has dismantled militant infrastructure along the border and killed hundreds of Hezbollah fighters. On Tuesday, it said a strike in Beirut had killed Suhail Husseini, who it described as a senior commander responsible overseeing logistics, budget and management of the militant group. There was no immediate comment from Hezbollah, and no way to confirm battlefield claims made by either side. In Gaza, meanwhile, heavy fighting was underway Tuesday between Israeli ground forces and Palestinian militants in the isolated north, where Israel has ordered another full-scale evacuation in recent days. Hezbollah says it has ‘no vacant posts’ 'We are firing hundreds of rockets and dozens of drones. A large number of settlements and cities are under the fire of the resistance,' Kassem said in a video address, speaking from an undisclosed location. 'Our capabilities are fine and our fighters are deployed along the frontlines.' He said Hezbollah's top leadership was directing the war and that the commanders killed by Israel have been replaced. 'We have no vacant posts,' he added. He said that Hezbollah will name a new leader to succeed Hassan Nasrallah, who was killed in an Israeli airstrike in a bunker in Beirut last month, 'but the circumstances are difficult because of the war.' The Israeli army said 85 projectiles were launched from Lebanon toward northern Israel on Tuesday. Israel’s aerial defense intercepted most of the rockets, the military said. A 70-year-old woman was moderately wounded by shrapnel and Israeli media aired footage of what appeared to be minor damage to buildings near the coastal city of Haifa. The military also said that it struck Hezbollah targets in the southern Beirut suburbs, known as the Dahiyeh, where the militant group is headquartered. Hezbollah began firing rockets into northern Israel on Oct. 8, 2023, the day after Hamas' surprise attack into Israel ignited the war in Gaza. Hezbollah and Hamas are both allied with Iran, and Hezbollah says its attacks are aimed at aiding the Palestinians. Israel has carried out airstrikes in response and the conflict steadily escalated, erupting into a full-fledged war last month. The Lebanese militant group has said it will stop the attacks if there is a cease-fire in Gaza, but months of diplomatic efforts on that front have repeatedly stalled. Rocket fire intensifies as Israel steps up strikes Israel has inflicted a punishing wave of blows against Hezbollah in recent weeks and says it will keep fighting until tens of thousands of displaced Israeli citizens can return to their homes in the north. More than 1,300 people have been killed in Lebanon and over a million displaced since the fighting escalated in mid-September. Since then, Hezbollah has extended its rocket fire into central Israel, setting off air raid sirens in the country's commercial hub of Tel Aviv. Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen have also launched missiles that reached central Israel. Most of the projectiles have been intercepted or fallen in open areas, disrupting life in Israel while causing few casualties and little property damage. Last, week Iran launched its own barrage of some 180 ballistic missiles at Israel, in what it said was a response to the killing of Nasrallah, an Iranian general who was with him at the time and Ismail Haniyeh, the top leader of Hamas, who was killed in an explosion in Iran's capital in July. Israel has vowed to respond to the missile attack, without saying when or how. Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant is in Washington this week to meet with Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin. The Biden administration says it is opposed to an Israeli attack on Iran's nuclear facilities, which could escalate regional tensions even further. Heavy fighting and evacuation orders in Gaza Northern Gaza, where heavy fighting raged Tuesday, was the first target of Israel’s ground offensive. Entire neighborhoods have been reduced to rubble and Israeli troops have largely isolated the region — which includes Gaza City — since last October, when up to a million people fled to the south following Israeli evacuation orders. Hundreds of thousands have remained in the north despite the harsh conditions, leading Israel to order another total evacuation in recent days. Israel has barred residents from returning to the north. Israeli forces are battling Hamas militants in Jabaliya, a densely populated urban refugee camp dating back to the 1948 war surrounding Israel’s creation. Palestinian residents said Israeli warplanes and artillery were pounding Jabaliya as well as Beit Hanoun and Beit Lahiya, towns near the border. The Israeli military said it killed around 20 militants in airstrikes and ground fighting in Jabaliya. It said troops located a large quantity of weapons, including grenades and rifles. The nearby Kamal Adwan Hospital said at least 15 people, including two women and four children, were killed Tuesday in the fighting in Jabaliya. It said the dead included four people who were trying to retrieve bodies. 'The situation is extremely difficult. The bombing and explosions haven’t stopped,' said Mahmoud Abu Shehatah, a Jabaliya resident. 'It’s like the first days of the war.' The war began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250. Israel’s retaliatory offensive has killed around 42,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities. They do not say how many were fighters, but say women and children make up more than half of all fatalities. ___ Goldenberg reported from Jerusalem.

Pioneers in artificial intelligence win the Nobel Prize in physics	STOCKHOLM (AP) — Two pioneers of artificial intelligence – John Hopfield and Geoffrey Hinton – won the Nobel Prize in physics Tuesday for helping create the building blocks of machine learning that is revolutionizing the way we work and live but also creates new threats to humanity, one of the winners said. Hinton, who is known as the Godfather of artificial intelligence, is a citizen of Canada and Britain who works at the University of Toronto, and Hopfield is an American working at Princeton. 'These two gentlemen were really the pioneers,' said Nobel physics committee member Mark Pearce. 'They ... did the fundamental work, based on physical understanding which has led to the revolution we see today in machine learning and artificial intelligence.' The artificial neural networks they pioneered are used throughout science and medicine and 'have also become part of our daily lives, for instance in facial recognition and language translation,' said Ellen Moons, a member of the Nobel committee at the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. Hinton predicted that AI will end up having a 'huge influence' on civilization, bringing improvements in productivity and health care. 'It would be comparable with the Industrial Revolution,' he said in an open call with reporters and officials of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. 'Instead of exceeding people in physical strength, it’s going to exceed people in intellectual ability. We have no experience of what it’s like to have things smarter than us. And it’s going to be wonderful in many respects,' Hinton said. 'But we also have to worry about a number of possible bad consequences, particularly the threat of these things getting out of control.' The Nobel committee that honored the science behind machine learning and AI also mentioned fears about its possible flipside. Moons said that while it has 'enormous benefits, its rapid development has also raised concerns about our future. Collectively, humans carry the responsibility for using this new technology in a safe and ethical way for the greatest benefit of humankind.' Hinton shares those concerns. He quit a role at Google so he could more freely speak about the dangers of the technology he helped create. 'I am worried that the overall consequence of this might be systems more intelligent than us that eventually take control,' Hinton said. On Tuesday, he said he was shocked at the honor. 'I’m flabbergasted. I had, no idea this would happen,' he said when reached by the Nobel committee on the phone. He said he was at a cheap hotel with no internet. There was no immediate reaction from Hopfield. Hinton, now 76, in the 1980s helped develop a technique known as backpropagation that has been instrumental in training machines how to 'learn' by fine-tuning errors until they disappear. It’s similar to the way a student learns from a teacher with an initial solution graded and flaws identified and returned to be fixed and repaired. This process continues until the answer matches the network’s version of reality. His team at the University of Toronto later wowed peers by using a neural network to win the prestigious ImageNet computer vision competition in 2012. That win spawned a flurry of copycats, giving birth to the rise of modern AI. Hinton and fellow AI scientists Yoshua Bengio and Yann LeCun won computer science’s top prize, the Turing Award, in 2019. 'For a long time, people thought what the three of us were doing was nonsense,' Hinton told The Associated Press in 2019. 'They thought we were very misguided and what we were doing was a very surprising thing for apparently intelligent people to waste their time on. My message to young researchers is, don’t be put off if everyone tells you what are doing is silly.' And Hinton himself uses machine learning in his daily life. 'Whenever I want to know the answer to anything, I just go and ask GPT4,' Hinton said at the Nobel announcement. 'I don’t totally trust it because it can hallucinate, but on almost everything it's a not very good expert. And that’s very useful.' 'Twenty years ago, I think people would have happily agreed that systems with the ability of GPT-4 or (Google’s) Gemini had achieved general intelligence comparable to that of humans,' Hinton told the AP this spring. 'Being able to answer more or less any question in a sensible way would have passed the test. But now that AI can do that, people want to change the test.' Hopfield, 91, created an associative memory that can store and reconstruct images and other types of patterns in data, the Nobel committee said. 'What fascinates me most is still this question of how mind comes from machine,' Hopfield said in a video posted online by The Franklin Institute after it awarded him a physics prize in 2019. Hinton used Hopfield's network as the foundation for a new network that uses a different method, known as the Boltzmann machine, that the committee said can learn to recognise characteristic elements in a given type of data. Six days of Nobel announcements opened Monday with Americans Victor Ambros and Gary Ruvkun winning the medicine prize for their discovery of tiny bits of genetic material that serve as on and off switches inside cells that help control what the cells do and when they do it. If scientists can better understand how they work and how to manipulate them, it could one day lead to powerful treatments for diseases like cancer. The physics prize carries a cash award of 11 million Swedish kronor ($1 million) from a bequest left by the award's creator, Swedish inventor Alfred Nobel. The laureates are invited to receive their awards at ceremonies on Dec. 10, the anniversary of Nobel’s death. Nobel announcements continue with the chemistry physics prize on Wednesday and literature on Thursday. The Nobel Peace Prize will be announced Friday and the economics award on Oct. 14. ___ Corder reported from The Hague, Netherlands and Borenstein reported from Washington.

France's fragile new government faces a no-confidence vote as far right offers critical support	PARIS (AP) — France’s minority government is expected to survive a no-confidence vote on Tuesday in a test for new conservative Prime Minister Michel Barnier, forced to rely on the far right’s good will to be able to stay in power. It comes as Barnier's fragile government faces a major challenge to get a budget for next year approved with no majority at parliament. Following June-July parliamentary elections, the National Assembly, France’s powerful lower house of parliament, is divided into three major blocs: the New Popular Front, Macron’s centrist allies and the far-right National Rally party. None of them won an outright majority. The no-confidence motion was brought by 192 lawmakers of a left-wing coalition, the New Popular Front, composed of the hard-left France Unbowed, Socialists, Greens and Communists. It needs 289 votes to pass. The far-right National Rally group, which counts 125 lawmakers, has said it would abstain from voting a no-confidence motion for now. Far-right leader Marine Le Pen, herself a lawmaker, said she decided to 'give a chance' to the government. Barnier’s cabinet is mostly composed of members of his Republicans party and centrists from French President Emmanuel Macron’s alliance who altogether count just over 200 lawmakers. Left-wing lawmakers denounced the choice of Barnier as prime minister as they were not given a chance to form a minority government, despite securing the most seats at the National Assembly. This government 'is a denial of the result of the most recent legislative elections,' the motion read.	https://apnews.com/article/france-minority-government-no-confidence-vote-7fa8b612dc28ab33cfeec526a21cce0c	2024-10-07T22:36:39-07:00	
Netflix series explores women's dreams in the body-slamming world of Japanese pro wrestling	TOKYO (AP) — 'The Queen of Villains' is a typical coming-of-age tale about a young woman’s road to empowerment and self-discovery — except it all takes place in the body-slamming, arm-twisting world of Japanese professional wrestling. The Netflix series, which began airing last month, tells the story of Dump Matsumoto, a real-life wrestling legend from the 1980s who grew up poor with a father who was often absent or abusive. Matsumoto grew up angry, she said, and went on to create in her wrestling persona a ferocious, almost camp villain character, known in the sport as a 'heel,' complete with outlandish Kabuki-like facial makeup, chains, sticks and a grotesque scowl. She loomed large as a symbol of fearless and defiant womanhood. 'I gave it my all to be evil,' Matsumoto said. A hefty woman with a friendly smile, Matsumoto makes a point even now to adamantly deny that she was ever a nice person or acknowledge that many people in Japan, especially women, love her. 'I still beat people up in matches. I stuck forks in them and made them bleed,' she said, adding, 'All the people who pretend to be good are the truly evil ones.' 'The Queen of Villains' follows the friendship between Matsumoto and Chigusa Nagayo of the popular wrestling tag team known as the Crush Gals. Nagayo served as an adviser, trainer and choreographer for the series’ dramatized wrestling scenes. Japanese professional wrestling fans still talk about the matches between Matsumoto and the Crush Gals, including the ones they fought in the U.S. The actresses in the series spent two years training for their roles. They gained weight and muscle, and learned techniques like the 'giant swing,' in which a wrestler grabs her opponent’s legs and moves in a dizzying circle, or the 'flying knee kick,' which involves a jump and kick to the body while airborne. The trick in professional wrestling is to execute the punches and body slams convincingly but in a controlled way to avoid serious injuries. A wrestler also must know how to fall properly. One key fight scene took a month to film as the actors went over each move, again and again. 'Dump played a role to be hated by the entire nation,' said Yuriyan Retriever, a professional comedian who stars as Matsumoto in the series. 'Previously, there was a limit, maybe even unintentionally, beyond which I couldn’t go. But when I played Dump, all those emotions had to come out and be expressed,' she said. She felt like she was no longer playing a role, she said, but that she had become Dump Matsumoto. 'It’s frightening to be hated, and I don’t think anyone wants to be hated,' Retriever said. 'When I finished a cut, I was crying. And my body was shaking. I can’t express it in words, but I understood all the pressures Dump must have felt.' The series not only presents a women-beating-the-odds story against a backdrop of sexism and abusive management but it also captures the postwar period of the Showa-era in a way that feels authentic. The scenes used thousands of extras, many of them serious wrestling fans. Some viewers say the real-life wrestling was more intense than the dramatized version in the new series. Rionne McAvoy, an Australian filmmaker who as a professional wrestler was hit with a stick by Matsumoto, said: 'The actors often fail to capture the intensity, grit and charisma required for these roles.' But for most viewers, it’s real enough and heartbreaking. 'This is an eternal but emotional story portraying ordinary girls who passionately pursued a dream, found friendship and also themselves,' director Kazuya Shiraishi said. 'It gave me a chance to reflect on my own 15-year filmmaking career, what I truly want to be, what kind of films I want to make. I just wanted to tell their story, which is also everyone’s story.' ___ Yuri Kageyama is on X: https://x.com/yurikageyama	https://apnews.com/article/netflix-japan-wrestling-matsumoto-women-entertainment-ad6bc62a6bda08470b0d84381520d87c	2024-10-07T20:39:18-07:00	
Mozambique's presidential election: Here's what to know	MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) — Mozambicans are expected to turn out in large numbers on Wednesday for an election that will choose a successor to President Filipe Nyusi after his two terms. Close to 17 million voters in the southern African nation of 31 million people are registered to vote for the next president along with 250 members of parliament and provincial assemblies. While the ruling Front for the Liberation of Mozambique, or Frelimo, is widely expected to retain power, at least four candidates have been campaigning to bring change to a country which faces a yearslong jihadist insurgency in its north and whose long Indian Ocean coastline is vulnerable to extreme climate conditions like flooding. Over 1.3 million people have been forced to flee their homes due to the insurgency, while millions more have faced severe food shortages due to drought. The local elections held in Mozambique a year ago were marred by allegations of vote-rigging and fraud, sparking violent protests in the capital, Maputo, and surrounding areas. This time, concerns have been muted. Here's what to know about Wednesday's vote: Who is running? The ruling Frelimo party, which has been in power since independence from Portugal in 1975, has fielded David Chapo as its presidential candidate. The 47-year-old Chapo is a former governor of the southern province of Inhambane, a strong driver of the country's tourism economy. Chapo is expected to face the most competition from 50-year-old Venacio Mondlane, a banker and forestry engineer who runs as an independent candidate under the slogan 'Save Mozambique, this country’s ours' and has drawn large crowds. Mondlane is backed by the Optimistic Party for the Development of Mozambique, or Podemos, set up by dissidents from the ruling party. He ran as a mayoral candidate in local elections last year, and his supporters alleged that he won but was robbed. The Democratic Movement of Mozambique has fielded Lutero Simango. His party was created in 2008, breaking away from the rebel group-turned-opposition party Mozambique National Resistance, or Renamo. Simango's party resonates with youth because of its policies on inequality and jobs. Renamo is represented by Ossufo Momade, who became the party's head after the death of the charismatic Afonso Dhlakama, a former rebel leader who died in 2018. What are the issues? Mozambique has been fighting an Islamic State-affiliated group that has launched attacks on communities in the northern province of Cabo Delgado since 2017, including beheadings. Around 600,000 of the 1.3 million people who fled have since returned home, many to shattered communities where houses, markets, churches, schools and health facilities have been destroyed, the United Nations said earlier this year. The candidates have promised to address development issues exacerbated by the insurgency, including the halting of a crucial gas project by French energy company TotalEnergies in northern Mozambique as a result of the extremist rebel insurgency there. Mozambique also faces high levels of unemployment and hunger, exacerbated by El Nino-induced severe drought. According to the U.N. World Food Program, 1.3 million people face severe food shortages. The ruling Frelimo party has been tainted by corruption scandals, including the so-called 'tuna bond' scandal in which former finance minister Manuel Chang was jailed earlier this year for taking payoffs to arrange secret loan guarantees for government-controlled fishing companies. The loans were plundered, and Mozambique ended up with $2 billion in 'hidden debt,' spurring a financial crisis as the International Monetary Fund halted financial support. When will we know the election winner? There is just one day of voting and counting starts immediately, with partial results announced as they trickle in. Official results will be announced by the National Election Commission after 15 days and subsequently validated by the Constitutional Council. Any party may file objections with the council, which will decide whether they have merit. ___ Magome reported from Johannesburg. ___ Follow AP's Africa coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/africa	https://apnews.com/article/mozambique-elections-president-nyusi-insurgency-climate-explainer-35d66b57f691671c343185dc5c493dd7	2024-10-07T19:10:35-07:00	
Israel's strikes are shifting the power balance in the Middle East, with US support	WASHINGTON (AP) — Israeli military strikes are targeting Iran's armed allies across a nearly 2,000-mile stretch of the Middle East and threatening Iran itself. The efforts raise the possibility of an end to two decades of Iranian ascendancy in the region, to which the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq inadvertently gave rise. In Washington, Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, and Arab capitals, opponents and supporters of Israel's offensive are offering clashing ideas about what the U.S. should do next, as its ally racks up tactical successes against Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthis in Yemen and presses its yearlong campaign to crush Hamas in Gaza. Israel should get all the support it needs from the United States until Iran's government 'follows other dictatorships of the past into the dustbin of history,' said Richard Goldberg, a senior adviser at Washington's conservative-leaning Foundation for the Defense of Democracies — calls echoed by some Israeli political figures. Going further, Yoel Guzansky, a former senior staffer at Israel’s National Security Council, called for the Biden administration to join Israel in direct attacks in Iran. That would send 'the right message to the Iranians — ‘Don’t mess with us,’'' Guzansky said. Critics, however, highlight lessons from the U.S. military campaign in Iraq and toppling of Saddam Hussein, when President George W. Bush ignored Arab warnings that the Iraqi dictator was the region's indispensable counterbalance to Iranian influence. They caution against racking up military victories without adequately considering the risks, end goals or plans for what comes next, and warn of unintended consequences. Ultimately, Israel 'will be in a situation where it can only protect itself by perpetual war,' said Vali Nasr, who was an adviser to the Obama administration. Now a professor at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, or SAIS, he has been one of the leading documenters of the rise of Iranian regional influence since the U.S. invasion of Iraq. With Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu giving limited weight to Biden administration calls for restraint, the United States and its partners in the Middle East are 'at the mercy of how far Bibi Netanyahu will push it,' Nasr said, referring to the Israeli leader by his nickname. 'It's as if we hadn't learned the lessons, or the folly, of that experiment ... in Iraq in 2003 about reshaping the Middle East order,' said Randa Slim, a fellow at SAIS and researcher at the Washington-based Middle East Institute. Advocates of Israel’s campaign hope for the weakening of Iran and its armed proxies that attack the U.S., Israel and their partners, oppress civil society and increasingly are teaming up with Russia and other Western adversaries. Opponents warn that military action without resolving the grievances of Palestinians and others risks endless and destabilizing cycles of war, insurgency and extremist violence, and Middle East governments growing more repressive to try to control the situation. And there’s the threat that Iran develops nuclear weapons to try to ensure its survival. Before the Israeli strikes on Hezbollah, Iranian leaders concerned about Israel’s offensives had made clear that they were interested in returning to negotiations with the U.S. on their nuclear program and claimed interest in improved relations overall. In just weeks, Israeli airstrikes and intelligence operations have devastated the leadership, ranks and arsenals of Lebanon-based Hezbollah — which had been one of the Middle East’s most powerful fighting forces and Iran's overseas bulwark against attacks on Iranian territory — and hit oil infrastructure of Yemen's Iran-allied Houthis. A year of Israeli airstrikes in Gaza appears to have reduced the leadership of Iranian-allied Hamas to a few survivors hiding in underground tunnels. However, Israeli forces again engaged in heavy fighting there this week, and Hamas was able to fire rockets at Tel Aviv in a surprising show of enduring strength on the Oct. 7 anniversary of the militant group's attack on Israel, which started the war. Anticipated Israeli counterstrikes on Iran could accelerate regional shifts in power. The response would follow Iran launching ballistic missiles at Israel last week in retaliation for killings of Hezbollah and Hamas leaders. It also could escalate the risk of all-out regional war that U.S. President Joe Biden — and decades of previous administrations — worked to avert. The expansion of Israeli attacks since late last month has sidelined mediation by the U.S., Egypt and Qatar for a cease-fire and hostage release deal in Gaza. U.S. leaders say Israel did not warn them before striking Hezbollah leaders in Lebanon but have defended the surge in attacks, while still pressing for peace. Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, said in an interview with CBS' '60 Minutes' aired Monday that the U.S. was dedicated to supplying Israel with the military aid needed to protect itself but would keep pushing to end the conflict. 'We’re not going to stop in terms of putting that pressure on Israel and in the region, including Arab leaders,' she said. Israel’s expanded strikes raise for many what is the tempting prospect of weakening Iran’s anti-Western, anti-Israel alliance with like-minded armed groups in Lebanon, Iraq, Syria and Yemen to governments in Russia and North Korea. Called the 'Axis of Resistance,' Iran's military alliances grew — regionally, then globally — after the U.S. invasion of Iraq removed Saddam, who had fought an eight-year war against Iran's ambitious clerical regime. Advocates of the U.S. invasion of Iraq, and overthrow of Saddam, said correctly that an Iraqi democracy would take hold. But the unintended effects of the U.S. intervention were even bigger, including the rise of Iran's Axis of Resistance and new extremist groups, including the Islamic State. 'An emboldened and expansionist Iran appears to be the only victor' of the 2003 Iraq war, notes a U.S. Army review of lessons learned. 'Two decades ago, who could have seen a day when Iran was supporting Russia with arms? The reason is because of its increased influence' after the U.S. overthrow of Saddam, said Ihsan Alshimary, professor of political science at Baghdad University. Even more than in 2003, global leaders are offering little clear idea on how the shifts in power that Israel’s military is putting in motion will end — for Iran, Israel, the Middle East at large, and the United States. Iran and its allies are being weakened, said Goldberg, at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies. So is U.S. influence as it appears to be dragged along by Israel, Nasr said. The conflict could end up hurting Israel if it bogs down in a ground war in Lebanon, for example, said Mehran Kamrava, a professor and Middle East expert at Georgetown University in Qatar. After four decades of deep animosity between Israeli and Iranian leaders, 'the cold war between them has turned into a hot war. And this is significantly changing — is bound to change — the strategic landscape in the Middle East,' he said. 'We are certainly at the precipice of change,' Kamrava said. But 'the direction and nature of that change is very hard to predict at this stage.' ___ AP reporters Julia Frankel in Jerusalem and Qassim Abdul-Zahra in Baghdad contributed.	https://apnews.com/article/iran-israel-middle-east-war-united-states-36d7c0bbc35964ed6ac9d21de17c632a	2024-10-07T19:05:55-07:00	
Stock market today: Wall Street claws back some of its losses	U.S. stocks are clawing back some of their losses from the day before as falling oil prices release some of the pressure that’s built up on the market. The S&amp;P 500 was 0.5% higher in early trading Tuesday and pulling closer to its all-time high set early last week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 130 points, or 0.3%, and nearing its own record. The Nasdaq composite was 0.5% higher. Markets around the world sank following scary swings in China, as euphoria about possible stimulus for the world’s second-largest economy gave way to disappointment. THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP’s earlier story follows below. Wall Street pushed higher early Tuesday even though Hong Kong's Hang Seng market plunged more than 9% after Beijing refrained from major spending initiatives as China's economy slows. Futures for the S&amp;P 500 rose 0.4% before the bell, while futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average inched up 0.2%. Rising bond yields, which sent stocks tumbling on Monday, stabilized early Tuesday and oil prices fell after five straight days of gains. U.S. stocks are hovering near record territory out of relief that interest rates are finally heading back down now that the Federal Reserve has widened its focus to include keeping the economy humming instead of just fighting high inflation. When Treasury bonds, which are seen as the safest possible investments, are paying more in interest, investors become less inclined to pay very high prices for stocks and other riskier investments. For investors, it is difficult to ignore that a 10-year Treasury is paying a 4.03% yield, up from 3.62% three weeks ago. The yield on the two-year Treasury, which more closely tracks expectations for the Fed, ticked down to 3.98% on Tuesday after jumping to 3.99% a day earlier. Treasury yields may also be feeling upward push from the recent jump in oil prices. Crude prices have been surging on fears that worsening tensions in the Middle East could ultimately disrupt the global flow of oil. Benchmark U.S. crude slipped $1.62 to $75.52. It had gained 3.7% on Monday and is up nearly 11% in October. Brent crude, the international standard, shed $1.68 to $79.25 per barrel. It had also jumped 3.7% Monday. With earning season kicking off, PepsiCo shares fell 1% after it lowered its organic revenue forecast for the year. U.S. consumers continue to pull back on buying its snacks and drinks after years of price increases. DocuSign jumped 5.6% after S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices announced the electronic document signing company would join the S&amp;P MidCap 400. DocuSign will replace MDU Resources, which will be bumped down to the S&amp;P SmallCap 600 after announcing last week that it was spinning off its construction services subsidiary, Everus Construction Group. In Asia, the Hang Seng index lost 9.4% to close at 20,926.79. Technology and China-related shares led the decline. Shares initially soared 10% in Shanghai on Tuesday but then slid back a bit as details of economic stimulus plans from officials in Beijing fell short of what investors were hoping for. The Shanghai Composite index closed 4.6% higher, at 3,489.78. In Shenzhen, Japan’s smaller market, the main index gained 8.9%. Hong Kong shares had logged strong gains over the past week while markets in mainland China were closed for a weeklong holiday and reopened Tuesday. The advances were fueled by recent announcements of Beijing's plans for more support for the economy and for financial markets. 'China’s markets rally has hit a wall, leaving investors deflated. The reopening surge from the week-long holiday barely had time to gather steam before fizzling out, and now the once-thrilled bulls are licking their wounds,' Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management said in a commentary. Shares in food delivery company Meituan tumbled 15.5% while e-commerce giant Alibaba sank 8.8%. It's rival JD.com plunged 11.9%. In other Asian trading, Tokyo's Nikkei 225 index lost 1% to 38,937.54. as the dollar fell to 147.79 Japanese yen from 148.18 yen. A stronger yen tends to pull share prices lower since it hurts profits of heavyweight export manufacturers. The Kospi in Seoul declined 0.6% to 2,594.36. Australia's S&amp;P/ASX 200 dropped 0.4% to 8,176.90. In early European trading, Germany’s DAX lost 0.2%, the CAC 40 in Paris shed 0.6% and London's FTSE 100 declined 1.1%.

Votes are being counted in the election for a truncated government in Indian-controlled Kashmir	SRINAGAR, India (AP) — Votes were being counted Tuesday in the recent election for a largely powerless local government in Indian-controlled Kashmir, the first since Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government stripped the disputed region of its special status five years ago. Thousands of additional police and paramilitary soldiers patrolled roads and guarded 28 counting centers as officials tallied votes. A final result was expected to be declared later Tuesday by the region’s electoral office. Nearly 8.9 million people were eligible to vote in the election that began on Sept. 18 and concluded on Oct. 1. The overall turnout was 64% across the three phases, according to official data. It was first such vote in a decade and the first since Modi’s Hindu nationalist government scrapped the Muslim-majority region’s long-held semi-autonomy in 2019. The unprecedented move downgraded and divided the former state into two centrally governed union territories, Ladakh and Jammu-Kashmir. Both are ruled directly by New Delhi through its appointed administrators along with unelected bureaucrats and security setup. The move — which largely resonated in India and among Modi supporters — was mostly opposed in Kashmir as an assault on its identity and autonomy amid fears that it would pave way for demographic changes in the region. The region has since been on edge with civil liberties curbed and media gagged. India and Pakistan each administer a part of Kashmir, but both claim the territory in its entirety. The nuclear-armed rivals have fought two of their three wars over the territory since they gained independence from British colonial rule in 1947. Early results may give an indication of the vote's direction. However, exit polls by major television channels in last two days projected the regional National Conference emerging as a single largest party followed by the Modi’s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party. Such mandate is likely to be seen as a referendum against Modi's 2019 move. The National Conference fought the election in alliance with India’s main opposition Congress party. Their coalition may still need support of some seats to form the government, that is likely to come from Peoples Democratic Party, another Kashmiri group. Five seats are appointed and 90 elected, so a party or coalition would need at least 48 of the 95 total seats to form a government. The vote will allow Kashmir to have its own truncated government and a regional legislature, called an assembly, rather than being directly under New Delhi’s rule. However, there will be a limited transition of power from New Delhi to the assembly as Kashmir will remain a 'union territory' — directly controlled by the federal government — with India’s Parliament as its main legislator. Kashmir’s statehood must be restored for the new government to have powers similar to other states of India. The region’s last assembly election was held in 2014, after which the BJP for the first time ruled in a coalition with the local Peoples Democratic Party. But the government collapsed in 2018, after the BJP withdrew from the coalition. Polls in the past have been marked with violence, boycotts and vote-rigging, even though India called them a victory over separatism. Militants in the Indian-controlled portion of Kashmir have been fighting New Delhi’s rule since 1989. Many Muslim Kashmiris support the rebels’ goal of uniting the territory, either under Pakistani rule or as an independent country. India insists the Kashmir militancy is Pakistan-sponsored terrorism. Pakistan denies the charge, and many Kashmiris consider it a legitimate freedom struggle. Tens of thousands of civilians, rebels and government forces have been killed in the conflict. ___ This version has corrected that there are 95 seats, 90 of them elected and five appointed, and 48 would be a majority. ___ Follow AP's Asia-Pacific coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/asia-pacific	https://apnews.com/article/kashmir-election-india-counting-votes-5590ef6cd2810cb16308f6efcdea23f4	2024-10-07T18:18:55-07:00	
No evidence of major fuel spill on Samoan reef where New Zealand navy ship sank	WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — Divers and marine experts found no evidence of a major fuel spill on a Samoan reef Tuesday after a New Zealand navy ship ran aground and sank, Samoa's deputy prime minister said. All 75 people on board the HMNZS Manawanui evacuated safely as the boat foundered about a mile off the coast of Upolu, Samoa, early Sunday. The ship was one of only nine in New Zealand’s navy and was the first the country lost at sea since World War II. Samoan Deputy Prime Minister Tuala Tevaga Iosefo Ponifasio had earlier said a fuel spill was 'highly probable.' But he said Tuesday there was no evidence of oil spilling onto the reefs, ashore and nearby area, except for 'small leakages of oil coming from the vessel.' That had been contained using specialized equipment, Ponifasio said in a statement. The vessel's passengers — including civilian scientists and foreign military personnel — left the vessel on life boats in 'challenging conditions' and darkness, New Zealand’s Chief of Navy Rear Admiral Garin Golding told reporters. It took five hours for the first survivors to reach land, he said. One person was treated in a hospital for minor injuries and has been discharged, the military said. Up to 17 others sustained cuts, bruises or suspected concussions. An Air Force plane carrying 72 people from the ship landed at an air base in Auckland on Monday night. New Zealand will hold a court of inquiry into the loss of the ship. The cause of the accident is not known, but Defense Minister Judith Collins told 1News on Monday that she had been told a loss of power to the vessel had led to its grounding. The specialist dive and hydrographic vessel had been in service for New Zealand since 2019, but was 20 years old and had previously belonged to Norway, Collins said. It was surveying a reef off the coast of Upolu, Samoa’s most populous island, when it ran aground on the reef and began taking on water. Photos and videos taken from the shore appeared to show the ship listing before disappearing completely below the waves, with a large plume of smoke rising where it sank. Manu Percival, a surfing tour guide who works in the area where the ship sank, told The Associated Press by phone that oil was not visible from the ship but debris had littered the water and shoreline, and locals were not gathering shellfish as they normally did. It was too soon to know if the 'fragile' reef ecosystem had been damaged, he said. Ponifasio said marine scientists were testing water samples from nearby beaches for any traces of oil. The military said the ship, purchased for $100 million NZ dollars ($61 million) in 2018, was not covered by replacement insurance. The state of New Zealand’s aging military hardware has prompted warnings from the defense agency, which in a March report described the navy as 'extremely fragile,' with ships idle due to problems retaining the staff needed to service and maintain them. Of the navy’s eight remaining ships, five are currently operational. Golding said the HMNZS Manawanui underwent a maintenance period before the deployment. The ship’s captain was an experienced commander who had worked on the vessel for two years, he said. ___ Follow AP's Asia-Pacific coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/asia-pacific	https://apnews.com/article/samoa-new-zealand-navy-ship-sinks-efca9775d80b63eaa31a81df434176e7	2024-10-07T17:25:39-07:00	
Lore Segal, esteemed Austrian American writer who fled the Nazis as a child, dies at 96	NEW YORK (AP) — Lore Segal, an esteemed Viennese American author and translator whose gift for words helped her family escape from the Nazis and who later drew upon her experiences as a Jewish refugee and immigrant for such fiction as 'Other People's Houses' and 'Her First American,' died Monday at 96. Segal, a longtime resident of Manhattan's Upper West Side, died in her apartment after a brief illness, her publisher Melville House said in a statement. After settling in the U.S. in 1951, Segal wrote novels, short stories, essays and children's books and translated the Bible and Grimms' fairy tales, which featured illustrations by her friend Maurice Sendak. Her life — filtered through memory and imagination — was her greatest muse. 'Other People's Houses,' released in 1964 and originally serialized in the New Yorker, closely followed her childhood in Austria, her years in foster care in London during World War II and her arrival in New York, where the growing familiarity with the city’s sights and sounds — 'charged thus upon the air' — makes the 'alien into a citizen.' 'Her First American' continued her early experiences in the U.S., while 'Lucinella' was a comic novella inspired by her time in the 1970s at the Yaddo artist retreat in upstate New York. Segal, who taught at Columbia University, Princeton University and several other schools, satirized academic life in 'Shakespeare's Kitchen.' In 2019, she compiled her fiction and nonfiction in the anthology 'The Journal I Did Not Keep,' in which she summarized the importance and imperfection of recapturing the past. 'I believe that the act of remembering and telling the story of what he remember will always be to some extent fatal to the thing remembered,' she wrote. 'So what really happened?' Her many admirers included such author-critics as Cynthia Ozick, Vivian Gornick and Alfred Kazin. In 2008, she was a Pulitzer Prize finalist for her novel 'Shakespeare’s Kitchen.' The American Academy of Arts and Letters inducted her in 2023. Gornick would cite her 'ironic intelligence' and 'gift for detachment.' In her fiction, Segal set a tone that was even, objective and occasionally cutting, like her description of an artist in 'Lucinella' who 'tends to mumble her words inside her mouth, so as to keep the option of eating them.' She could also be intimate and familiar, with such recurring characters as her alter ego Ilka, a Viennese refugee; and Carter Bayoux, a Black intellectual with whom Ilka has an affair in 'Her First American.' Her narratives were often sustained through passages of overheard conversation, whether at a literary cocktail party in Harlem or a gathering of faculty members in Connecticut. Several stories in her 2023 collection 'Ladies' Lunch' were structured around the midday meals of friends in advanced old age who share memories, regrets, fears and everyday concerns. 'I like writing dialogue,' she told the online publication The Millions in 2019. 'I like it better than explaining. I’d rather have a character develop and express him or herself through dialogue than explaining what they’re thinking. It’s a preference. I like how we discover and uncover ourselves through dialogue. I tell my students, you see any two people together, walk behind them, listen, get the tone of their voice.' Besides her books, Segal wrote for The New York Times, The New Republic, the Forward and other publications. The children's story 'When Mole Lost His Glasses,' with drawings by Sergio Ruzzier, was adapted into an educational video featuring Spike Lee and then-New York Knick Stephon Marbury. Segal married the literary editor David Segal in 1961 and had two children. Her husband died of a heart attack in 1970. She was born Lore Groszmann in Vienna in 1928, and grew up in a prosperous neighborhood until the Nazis annexed the country a decade later and antisemitism drove her family to ship her off on the Kindertransport to London, a time Segal and her mother would discuss in Mark Jonathan Harris’ Academy Award-winning documentary 'Into the Arms of Strangers.' Separation somehow empowered her. Inquisitive and often impulsive, she wrote so many letters to British authorities that they granted her parents the rare privilege of letting them join her in London, where they worked as domestic servants. Lore stayed with a series of families, including one whose incomprehension of her past inspired her first real storytelling. 'It seemed to me they had no idea of what it was like to live in Vienna under Hitler,' Segal told The Associated Press in 2011. 'They were asking me questions that didn’t seem to be relevant. They had some profound lack of information. So I got hold of one of those little exercise books, homework books. I filled the 36 pages in German with the story, which is essentially the story of ‘Other People’s Houses.’' After the war, Segal graduated from the University of London’s Bedford College and lived briefly in the Dominican Republic — where other family members had settled — until allowed in the United States. Before becoming a writer, she discovered the various careers she was not meant for: She was a 'bad file clerk,' a 'bad secretary' and 'pretty bad textile designer.' Writing, at first, also didn't seem to work because she believed she had nothing to say. She had never been in love and thought 'no big things' had happened to her, not even during the war. Her breakthrough came in a class at the New School for Social Research in New York. 'After the class we all kept meeting and doing our own creative writing class,' Segal told the AP. 'And somebody said to me, ‘How did you get to America?’ And I began to tell the stories. And there was that experience, of people listening. It was lovely. Nobody had ever done that. Most people don’t have that experience, their story being valued.'	https://apnews.com/article/lore-segal-dies-a1a1ba9ff4954c83a8f14fbf297b789b	2024-10-07T12:56:46-07:00	
Tunisia's President Saied wins landslide reelection after cracking down on opponents	TUNIS, Tunisia (AP) — Tunisia’s President Kais Saied won a landslide reelection victory in results announced Monday after a campaign season that saw his opponents jailed alongside journalists, activists and attorneys. The North African country’s Independent High Authority for Elections, known as ISIE, said Monday evening that Saied had won 90.7% of the vote. Saied's closest challenger, businessman Ayachi Zammel, won 7.4% of the vote after sitting behind for the majority of campaign season facing multiple prison sentences for election-related crimes. University of Tunis law professor Sghayer Zakraoui said the results were reminiscent of Tunisia under President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, who ruled the country for more than 20 years before becoming the first dictator toppled in the Arab Spring uprisings. Saied received a larger vote share than Ben Ali did in 2009, two years before fleeing the country amid protests. 'We’re heading for totalitarian, even dictatorial power,' Zakraoui told The Associated Press. Election officials reported 28.8% voter turnout — a significantly smaller showing than the first round of the country's two other post-Arab Spring elections and an indication of apathy plaguing the country's 9.7 million eligible voters. The turnout and Saied's margin of victory reflected how his supporters participated in Sunday’s race while the majority of his detractors chose to boycott. Fewer Tunisians voted for Saied in this year's race than in the second round of his first election. 'He will re-enter office undermined rather than empowered by these elections,' Tarek Megerisi, a senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations, wrote on X. Yet the president and his supporters hailed the result as an endorsement of his efforts to transform Tunisia, eliminate corruption and redistribute power away from the country's reviled political class, including both those in power before the Arab Spring and those who entered politics immediately after. 'We’re going to cleanse the country of all the corrupt and schemers,' Saied said at his campaign headquarters on Sunday after exit polls showed him with a massive lead. Such remarks echoed those he has made throughout his tenure, in which he used overtly populist appeals to accuse his detractors of being part of foreign or domestic plots to undermine Tunisia. As the president and his supporters celebrated, his detractors pledged to keep opposing his rule. Amri Sofien, a freelance filmmaker, said after she heard that Saied had trounced his two opponents so substantially she thought political turmoil and protests wouldn't die down. 'It’s possible that after 20 years our kids will protest on Avenue Habib Bourguiba to tell him to get out,' she said, referring to the capital's main thoroughfare. 'There is no hope in this country.' It was Tunisia’s third presidential race since the 2011 Arab Spring, when protests for 'bread, freedom and dignity' led to Ben Ali's ouster and paved the way for the country's transition into a multiparty democracy. In the years that followed, Tunisia enshrined a new constitution, created a Truth and Dignity Commission to bring justice to citizens tortured under the former regime and saw its leading civil society groups win the Nobel Peace Prize for brokering political compromise. But its new leaders were unable to buoy its flailing economy and quickly became unpopular amid constant political infighting and episodes of terrorism and political violence. Amid that backdrop, Saied — then 61, a political outsider and a populist — won his first term in 2019. As the economy continued to struggle, he began dismantling Tunisia's new democratic institutions midway through his tenure. In July 2021, he declared a state of emergency, suspended parliament and rewrote the constitution to consolidate the power of the presidency — a series of actions his detractors likened to a coup. In the years that followed, voter turnout plummeted in the parliamentary and local elections. Authorities unleashed a wave of repression on the country’s once-vibrant civil society. In 2023, some of his most prominent opponents from across the political spectrum were thrown in prison, including right-wing leader Abir Moussi and Islamist Rached Ghannouchi, the co-founder of the party Ennahda and former speaker of Tunisia’s parliament. Dozens of others were imprisoned on charges including inciting disorder, undermining state security and violating a controversial anti-fake news law critics say has been used to stifle dissent. The pace of the arrests picked up earlier this year, when authorities began targeting additional lawyers, journalists, activists, migrants from sub-Saharan Africa and the former head of the post-Arab Spring Truth and Dignity Commission. 'The authorities seemed to see subversion everywhere,' said Michael Ayari, senior analyst for Algeria &amp; Tunisia at the International Crisis Group. Dozens of candidates had expressed interest in challenging the president, and 17 submitted preliminary paperwork to run in Sunday’s race. However, members of the election commission approved only the three. Upon publication of the final list of candidates, Zammel was promptly jailed. The role of the commission and its members, all of whom are appointed by the president, came under scrutiny during the campaign season. They defied court rulings ordering them to reinstate three candidates they had previously rejected. The parliament subsequently passed a law stripping power from the administrative courts.	https://apnews.com/article/tunisia-kais-saied-wins-reelection-landslide-55f379cf7ecc2a996a8586e9f7a67b98	2024-10-07T09:29:05-07:00	
Florence Pugh and Andrew Garfield on living through 'We Live in Time'	TORONTO (AP) — In 'We Live in Time,' Florence Pugh and Andrew Garfield act an entire life of a relationship — a gamut of dating, falling in love, having a child and reckoning with cancer. So when Garfield recently went on a six-day retreat in the woods without his phone, one of his first texts was to his co-star. 'I came out and I sent Florence a message. I just felt compelled,' Garfield says. 'When you reconnect with yourself, you reconnect with a bunch of stuff that matters to you. And I was just like, man, I haven’t let Florence know for a few months how much this film and this time with her meant to me.' 'We Live in Time,' directed by John Crowley ( 'Brooklyn,' 'The Goldfinch') and penned by playwright Nick Payne, is the kind of movie that provokes an emotional response, including for its two stars. In playing their characters, Almut and Tobias, across a decade of time, 'We Live in Time' poignantly condenses, and remixes into a non-linear narrative, a wide spectrum of life. Right alongside each other are sex and heartbreak, stolen moments and life-changing ones, birth and death. It was enough to go through together as actors that Pugh and Garfield, when they spoke the morning of the film’s premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival last month, were still mourning it. 'I’ve never had this happen before in this way. We’ve literally spent the last two days trying to unpack it and everybody wants us to unpack it. And we don’t know,' says Pugh. 'When we finished the movie, every scene that got closer and closer to the end, it became harder and harder to process that we weren’t going to be able to do it anymore.' As two of the most in-demand actors of their generation, Pugh, 28, and Garfield, 41, have transformed themselves into all kinds of roles. They have donned Marvel costumes and joined period ensembles. Pugh was memorably outfitted in an elaborate flower dress for 'Midsommar.' But 'We Live in Time,' which A24 opens in theaters Friday, is a particularly unadorned view of two of the best actors working. It’s the first film in which Garfield has used his real voice. 'They’re two very beautiful creatures to look at, and have looked fantastically beautiful on screen — and do look very beautiful in this, by the way, just not in a glammed-up, aspirational fashion,' says Crowley. 'They’re also both British actors who have made significant inroads in American cinema, and to some eyes, people might only know them from that. To have them speak in their own accents allowed those roles to fall back much closer to them.' Chemistry can be a tricky thing to pin down. Crowley, whose 2007 film 'Boy A' was Garfield’s feature film debut, cast Garfield first. After that came Pugh. Crowley prefers to keep dress rehearsals subdued in order to save the energy for shooting. But there were, he says, 'flickers of something very special' between them. 'Much like two championship tennis players warming up, they couldn’t not once in a while hit the ball in an extraordinary way and have the other person hit it back,' says Crowley. In an interview together, the connection between Garfield and Pugh was abundantly clear. Their reaction to the meme that sprung from the movie's first image (in which a carousel horse appeared to be their uninvited co-star), was, itself, a viral video that hinted at their natural comic patter. But whatever chemistry is, Garfield is more inclined to attribute it to staying present as actors. 'You can’t predict it. I knew Florence was a magnificent actor. But that’s all I knew. I didn’t know whether we’d work together well. Neither of us did,' Garfield says. 'But for me, honestly, it exceeded my expectations. It’s an incomparable thing. There’s no way of comparing my experience with Florence with any other experience I’ve had. 'I said this to Florence last night, I was like, ‘It’s weirdly, in a way, one performance. It’s like we’re stitched together.’' For Pugh, chemistry is about showing up with the right intentions. 'We were willing and wanting to do that for each other,' says Pugh. 'There’s plenty of times when you’re willing to do it and someone isn’t. And that’s also fine because you can also create your own chemistry with yourself, I suppose. 'But it’s so much more hard work and much less fun,' adds Garfield, smiling. 'Just like self-pleasure.' In some ways, Garfield and Pugh were living alongside 'We Live in Time' and experiencing some of its chapters of life with their characters, albeit from different perspectives. When Almut is diagnosed with late-stage ovarian cancer, she is forced to make difficult decisions that weigh having children with her ambition as a chef. 'If you want to be successful, if you want to actually give your career a good crack at it, you’re going to be running through the time that is most optimum for having children,' says Pugh. 'It’s stuff that I’m now having to figure out since we made the movie, since the movie’s coming out. It’s for all ages of women that are trying to navigate this unbelievably tricky dilemma.' Some of the challenges faced by Almut and Tobias were deeply familiar to the actors. Garfield’s mother died of cancer in 2019. Others took more imagination. Neither Garfield or Pugh have children, but a lengthy birth scene, in a gas station bathroom, is the movie’s most show-stopping moment. To experience Almut’s cancer treatment, Pugh was convinced she needed to cut her hair. Crowley filmed Garfield cutting Pugh's hair for the scene. 'I wanted this to be gone now so I knew how she feels in these scenes that I’ve read in the script and thought about, but that I can’t imagine how she felt yet,' Pugh says, pointing at her hair. 'I loved that day. It was a very powerful day.' The experience has left both actors trying to hold onto something from 'We Live in Time.' Garfield began the interview by opening up a book, offering a poem and then reading aloud Kabir’s 'To Be a Slave of Intensity.' 'Just to remind myself that I’m a person, I guess,' he explains. 'And because this film is about being as vitality alive as humanly possible. I think it’s really hard to remember how to do that sometimes — a lot of the time. In fact, it’s all set up against us doing it. So we need practices to keep us in touch with that.' If 'We Live in Time' is ultimately about making peace with the fleeting nature of all that’s precious, and trying to appreciate those moments when they’re happening, Garfield is doing his best to carry on that mentality and be grateful for the time he and Pugh had together. 'Every relationship is sacred. Every deep intimacy is sacred,' Garfield says. 'And I think it’s such an amazing thing and a brave thing to do to actually address it and go: This is over now. We’re ending this now — much like Tobias and Alma have to do. So I think it all becomes life, art, imitation, whichever way around.'	https://apnews.com/article/florence-pugh-andrew-garfield-we-live-time-9468f8be87b273576b8efd71aa0dd80d	2024-10-07T09:22:28-07:00	
Thousands survived a brutal gang attack in Haiti that killed 70. Now they face an uncertain future	PONT-SONDÉ, Haiti (AP) — Under the cover of night, dozens of gang members crept toward the small town of Pont-Sondé in central Haiti armed with knives and assault rifles as families slept. The gang had traveled from nearby Savien in vehicles they ditched halfway through the trip, climbing into canoes for the last stretch for a quiet approach. Gunfire and screams woke the town. Those not shot dead were stabbed. Fires consumed homes. 'They tried to murder everyone,' said Jina Joseph, who survived. The Gran Grif gang killed babies and young mothers, older people and entire families, angry that a self-defense group had tried to limit gang activity in Pont-Sondé and prevent it from making money off a makeshift toll it had recently established on a nearby road. The gang escaped by foot through nearby rice fields after Thursday's attack, leaving more than 70 bodies strewn through the town. It was the biggest massacre that Haiti’s once peaceful central region had seen in recent history. Thousands now face an uncertain future, stripped of their jobs, homes and families. Jameson Fermilus, who had crouched in a corridor next to his house as smoke and gunfire filled the air, later joined more than 6,000 other survivors who walked for hours, seeking safety. 'We don’t know what we are going to do,' said another who joined them, 60-year-old Sonise Morino. 'We have nowhere to go.' HUNGRY, THIRSTY AND HOMELESS Thousands walked west to the coastal city of Saint-Marc. Days after the massacre, a crowd of men, women and children gathered around a Good Samaritan standing atop his car distributing food and drink. The newly homeless crowded into a church, a school and a public plaza shaded by trees. Those lucky enough to receive food sat on a dusty curb and ate. At night, they curled up on concrete floors and tried to sleep. 'These deaths are unimaginable,' Mayor Myriam Fièvre said as she met with survivors. A majority of the 6,270 people left homeless have found temporary shelter with relatives who live nearby, according to the U.N.’s International Organization for Migration. But more than 750 others have nowhere to go, joining the over 700,000 people already left homeless in recent years by gang violence across Haiti. Inside the school serving as a temporary shelter, one mother leaned against a chalkboard, slowly patting the back of her sleeping baby as she stared into the distance. ‘A MESSAGE SENT’ Massacres of the Pont-Sondé magnitude were once unheard of in Haiti’s central region despite a recent increase in gang violence. Such massacres had been reported only in the capital of Port-au-Prince, 80% of which is under gang control. But things changed when former legislator Prophane Victor began arming young men nearly a decade ago to secure his election and control the area. That led to the creation of the Gran Grif gang, which controls Savien, Pont-Sondé and other places in the Artibonite region, according to the U.N. Victor and the Gran Grif leader, Luckson Elan, were sanctioned by the U.S. last month. Elan also was sanctioned by the U.N. Security Council, which noted that Gran Grif 'is the largest and most powerful' gang in Artibonite, committing nine mass kidnappings from October 2023 to January 2024, including that of 157 people. During that time, Elan killed a woman for refusing to have sex with him, the U.N. said. The gang, whose name means 'Big Claw,' also has some of the highest levels of child recruitment in Haiti, according to the U.N. Gran Grif is one of at least 20 criminal groups that operate in Artibonite, where much of Haiti’s rice and other crops are produced. More than 22,000 people have been forced to flee in recent years as gunmen target farmers and steal crops and livestock, according to the U.N., which has called authorities' response 'inadequate and inconsistent.' In an interview Monday, Romain Le Cour, senior expert on Haiti for the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime, said he worried about the effects last week's massacre might have on other gangs despite a new U.N.-backed mission operating in Haiti. 'It’s a message sent: That they’re more powerful than the others and that they’re ready to use brutal force against the people to make sure that their territorial power and economic control remain untouched,' he said. Le Cour noted that Haitian National Police and the mission led by Kenyan police are struggling as they operate in Port-au-Prince alone. 'It’s going to be even harder to open multiple battlefronts,' he said. 'It’s a massive challenge for the government right now.' Since the massacre, Haiti’s government has deployed armored vehicles, elite police officers and medical supplies to Pont-Sondé and Saint-Marc and Prime Minister Garry Conille visited the lone hospital, overwhelmed with injured patients. On Monday morning, police were still trying to access areas of Pont-Sondé while members of the self-defense group who remained in the town declined to talk. The normally bustling main street remained largely empty. Gunfire rang out in the distance. ___ Coto reported from San Juan, Puerto Rico.	https://apnews.com/article/haiti-gang-attack-pontsonde-3611fcb55c88ec2b213ab8f8c5f4ec1b	2024-10-07T08:32:27-07:00	
Chagos islanders displaced for a US military base protest a deal on their future made without them	LONDON (AP) — Islanders who were forced to leave their remote Indian Ocean home to make way for a U.S. military base half a century ago protested outside the U.K. Parliament on Monday against a deal they say has decided their homeland’s fate without them. The British government announced last week that it is handing the Chagos Islands to Mauritius under an agreement that will see the American naval and bomber base stay on one of the islands, Diego Garcia. Opponents accuse the government of surrendering sovereignty over a British territory. And the deal has left displaced residents uncertain whether they can go home. 'They announced a deal without even consulting us, which is at the center of all this tragedy,' said Frankie Bontemps, who called the U.K.-Mauritius agreement 'history repeating itself.' 'They have a deal which is suitable for them, best for them, of course. And what about the people? What about the people that they ignored like 65 years ago?' The Chagos Islands, a tropical archipelago just south of the equator off the tip of India, have been under British control since 1814. They have been known as the British Indian Ocean Territory since 1965 when they were split off from Mauritius, a then-U.K. colony that gained independence three years later. Britain evicted as many as 2,000 people from the islands in the 1960s and 1970s so the U.S. military could build the Diego Garcia base, which has supported U.S. military operations from Vietnam to Iraq and Afghanistan. In 2008, the U.S. acknowledged it also had been used for clandestine rendition flights of terror suspects. Many of the islanders resettled in Britain and fought unsuccessfully in U.K. courts to return home. Their cause has garnered international support, notably among African nations and within the United Nations. In a non-binding 2019 opinion, the International Court of Justice ruled that the U.K. had unlawfully carved up Mauritius when it agreed to end colonial rule in the late 1960s. The U.N. General Assembly followed that opinion with a resolution demanding that Britain end its 'colonial administration' of the Chagos Islands and return them to Mauritius. Britain’s newly elected Labour government says that without the deal the status of the military base would be under threat from legal challenges. Foreign Secretary David Lammy said the new government 'inherited unfinished business' from the previous Conservative administration, which began negotiations with Mauritius in 2022. 'The status quo was not sustainable,' Lammy told lawmakers in the House of Commons. 'A binding judgement against the U.K. seemed inevitable.' Under the agreement, the U.K. will retain sovereignty of Diego Garcia for an initial period of 99 years, paying Mauritius an undisclosed rent. U.S. President Joe Biden welcomed the deal, saying it 'secures the effective operation of the joint facility on Diego Garcia into the next century.' But Britain’s Conservative opposition said the decision to hand over a piece of U.K. territory sets a worrying precedent for other far-flung possessions including Gibraltar, which is claimed by Spain, and the Falkland Islands, claimed by Argentina. The government strongly denies that. Starmer spokesman Dave Pares said Monday that 'British sovereignty of Gibraltar and the Falkland Islands is not up for negotiation.' The agreement will create a resettlement fund for displaced Chagossians aimed at letting them move back to the islands – apart from Diego Garcia. The U.K. says details of any returns are now the responsibility of Mauritius. 'They shouldn’t have made this deal without asking us what we wanted,' said Jemmy Simon, whose grandparents were expelled from the Chagos Islands. 'It might just be another island to them. It might just be a military base for them. It might just be keeping everybody else safe. But to us, it is home.' ___ Associated Press journalist Kwiyeon Ha contributed to this story.	https://apnews.com/article/chagos-britain-mauritius-american-base-diego-garcia-c5816d6b5cf79dedf4fc6b37376298f8	2024-10-07T07:36:09-07:00	
Pro-Palestinian protesters pitch encampment outside Jewish Democrat's Ohio home	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) — Masked pro-Palestinian demonstrators escalated their harassment of a Jewish congressman on the eve of Monday’s anniversary of the Oct. 7 attack, pitching an encampment outside Ohio Democratic Rep. Greg Landsman ’s Cincinnati residence. Landsman said Monday that the protesters arrived outside his home early Sunday. By evening, they set up tents, cots and sleeping bags in the road and spent the night harassing him and his family members, forcing them to secure a police escort in order to enter and exit safely, the congressman said. 'On the eve of the one-year anniversary of the October 7th terror attacks, when Jews were brutally murdered and kidnapped, these people came to the home of a Jewish family at night, dressed in all black and fully masked,' Landsman said in a statement. He said that he and his daughter would be forced to navigate the encampment in order to attend an Oct. 7 service later Monday. The group Midwest Direct Action 4 Pali! shared a video of the demonstration on Instagram. The video showed masked participants in black marching down the street in front of Landsman's home. Their faces were obscured as they carried white bundles that resembled shrouded bodies and brandished banners representing the numbers in the death toll. The group remained on site Monday, Landman's office said. 'On the eve of the one year mark since the beginning of the genocide in Palestine, local activists in Cincinnati have gathered outside Congressman Greg Landsman’s house to denounce his votes to conceal the death toll and continue funding mass murder in Gaza,' the group said in its post. 'We mark in solemn vigil that we will not rest until the genocide is over and Palestine is free.' Mike Madanat, a spokesman for the group, told The Associated Press that it's unclear how long they would remain at Landsman's home and that they have no intention of leaving anytime soon. Madanat noted that these types of decisions are something they work out 'day to day.' He said the activists involved are members of various groups but are all 'Cincinnati taxpayers' who have joined this action due to the Democrat being 'silent to our calls, post cards and attendance in town halls.' Madanat said the activists realize they are in a residential community and are doing everything they can to respect Landsman's neighbors and the area, including by speaking daily with local police and residents to ensure their actions remain legal. 'This is not and never been something to do with religion,' Madanat said. 'It is strictly about the death toll,' the congressman's 'support of that, the violence and the displacement.' It's not the first time Landsman and his district have been targeted since the conflict began. Just a month into the conflict, protestors placed a poster outside a building near Landsman's district office with his photo and the phrase 'This Ken supports genocide,' alongside other inflammatory language. In July, Landsman toured the Covedale Cemetery Complex in Cincinnati, where 176 Jewish gravestones had been toppled. ___________________ Associated Press writer Bruce Shipkowski contributed reporting from Toms River, New Jersey.	https://apnews.com/article/mideast-war-gaza-hamas-anniversary-ohio-greg-landsman-protest-israel-biden-c89db986dbfdb82e22205375dbec3778	2024-10-07T07:18:36-07:00	
Will global soccer be reshaped after EU's top court issued a major ruling in Lassana Diarra case?	The global soccer transfer market, worth more than $10 billion each season, is facing a revolutionary overhaul or a nuanced evolution following last week's ruling by the European Court of Justice in the Lassana Diarra case. By ruling that some FIFA regulations on player transfers are contrary to EU legislation relating to competition and freedom of movement, the bloc's top court has paved the way for deep changes in the sport's economy. Here is a look at the key elements of the case and the possible impact of the landmark ruling. Who is Lassana Diarra? Lassana Diarra is a former much-traveled footballer whose career saw him play for prestigious clubs such as Chelsea, Paris Saint-Germain and Real Madrid. He represented France 34 times. At one point in his career, Diarra moved to the Russian league. It’s a dispute with Lokomotiv Moscow that triggered the legal case examined by the European Court of Justice (ECJ). How did we get there? Diarra signed a four-year contract with Lokomotiv in 2013. The deal was terminated a year later after he was unhappy with alleged pay cuts. Lokomotiv applied to the FIFA dispute resolution chamber for compensation and the player submitted a counterclaim seeking compensation for unpaid wages. The Court of Arbitration for Sport found the Russian club terminated the contract 'with just cause' and the player had to pay 10.5 million euros ($11.2 million). Diarra said his search for a new team was hampered by FIFA rules stipulating that any new club would be jointly responsible with him for paying compensation to Lokomotiv. Why does the court believe FIFA rules are in breach of EU law? Free movement is a fundamental right of workers in the European Union within the single market. On that basis, the EU’s top court said that the FIFA rules, including the one that resulted in the refusal to provide Diarra with an international transfer certificate (ITC) for a move to Charleroi, restricted his freedom of movement. The court also found that FIFA regulations breached the bloc’s competition law because they aim at restricting and preventing 'cross-border competition which could be pursued by all clubs established in the European Union.' What is the next legal step? The ECJ ruling will now be referred back to the appeal court in Mons, Belgium, which will rule on the Diarra case. This could take years rather than months. Although FIFA said it was satisfied 'that the legality of key principles of the transfer system have been reconfirmed,' Diarra’s lawyers claimed 'total victory.' The judges in Luxembourg acknowledged having stability in player rosters and regularity in competitions are legitimate objectives for FIFA, but that rules must be applied proportionally. Is the Diarra ruling comparable to Bosman? Some analysts have compared it to the ECJ’s 1995 decision on Belgian Jean-Marc Bosman. That ruling removed restrictions placed on foreign EU footballers within national leagues and allowed players in the bloc to move to another club for free when their contracts ended. Those principles had an obviously wider focus than the narrower scope of Diarra, about terminating a contract for cause. For now, the decision on Diarra does not change how the transfer market functions. But many legal experts believe that the ruling will ultimately have major effects on the sport’s economy. 'The decision essentially says the current system is too restrictive and so will have to change,' said Ian Giles, a partner at Norton Rose Fulbright law firm. 'It’s entirely possible this means players will feel they can now break contracts and sign on with new clubs, without the selling club being able to hold them or demand significant transfer fees. This will likely result in reduced transfer fees and more economic power for players — but over time things will have to stabilize to allow clubs to remain economically viable.' It took more than five years after the Bosman ruling for updated FIFA transfer rules to be published in 2001. Some of those debates then will now be revisited. Effect on the European soccer industry A major reset of transfer fee values can seriously affect many smaller market clubs. Bosman already accelerated gaps in wealth and competitive balance across European soccer, which is increasingly dominated by a small group of clubs. They can lure free-agent players with higher signing bonuses and salaries – money that previously would be more widely distributed via transfer fees. Spending by super-wealthy clubs can still reward smaller ones who excel at investing time and expertise in scouting and developing local and global talent: Ajax, Brighton, Genk in Belgium, which nurtured Kevin De Bruyne, Thibaut Courtois and Leandro Trossard. The influential European Club Association, which represents more than 700 teams, sees potential threats to the industry’s health in the fallout from Diarra. Transfer fees and payments to clubs from former players being sold later in their career 'are an efficient and effective means of wealth distribution from bigger clubs to smaller ones,' the ECA noted. Lawfare against FIFA The soccer industry is increasingly a game being played by lawyers in courts and government offices. FIFA is being challenged in several legal arenas, in part because it works (Diarra, Super League, agents regulations ). There is also a growing perception FIFA does not listen before launching projects and that pro-transparency reforms demanded and passed a decade ago are in decline. Within hours of the Diarra ruling Friday, the group of domestic leagues and player unions announced a news conference in Brussels for Oct. 14 to explain their filing to the European Commission. The complaint on competition law grounds argues FIFA adds new and bigger tournaments to the congested calendar without proper consultation. European Leagues and FIFPRO once had a seat at FIFA’s Football Stakeholders Committee that was a key forum for debate, including on the transfer market. FIFA paused the panel in 2021 and soon its president Gianni Infantino pushed for playing World Cups every two years. The idea was resisted by a widespread backlash. The leagues group says the Diarra ruling shows how representation at FIFA is 'becoming legally essential.' FIFA had indicated before Friday it would consult widely on transfer market reforms it believes can focus on specific issues raised by Diarra, rather than a total overhaul. Diarra’s lawyer Jean-Louis Dupont — who also represented Bosman 30 years ago — sees a bigger picture. He appeared to be recruiting for a wider suit against FIFA by claiming 'all professional players have been affected by these illegal rules' and could now seek compensation. ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer	https://apnews.com/article/soccer-diarra-case-explainer-transfers-5cca63020ecd634172e6ba8ef7cda705	2024-10-07T06:23:18-07:00	
Trump and Harris mark somber anniversary of Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack on Israel	FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) — Former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris are marking the first anniversary of the deadliest attack on Jews since the Holocaust as the presidential candidates approach the final weeks of the campaign during a widening conflict in the Middle East. Trump will speak before Jewish community leaders at one of his Florida resorts in the Miami suburb of Doral. Harris will briefly speak to journalists and plant a pomegranate tree with her husband on the grounds of the Vice President’s residence in honor of the 1,200 people, including 46 U.S. citizens, who were killed by Hamas-led militants in the Oct. 7 attack last year. Harris’ husband Doug Emhoff, who is Jewish, will recite a prayer at an event to commemorate the anniversary with the American Jewish Committee. Trump has blamed both Harris and President Joe Biden for the war, arguing their administration empowered Iran, and tried to take advantage of some of the divisions within the Democratic Party with progressives protesting Israel’s military campaign, which has killed more than 41,000 Palestinians. Some of his statements on Israel overlook his association with people who spew antisemitic rhetoric such as far-right activist Nick Fuentes and rapper Ye, formerly known as Kanye West. Trump has also repeatedly said that Jewish voters who vote for Democrats 'should have their head examined' and recently said that if he loses the presidential election to Harris on Nov. 5 'the Jewish people would really have a lot to do with that.' In an excerpt released from an interview with CBS’ '60 Minutes' that will air Monday night, Harris appeared to avoid answering a question about whether Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is considered 'a real close ally,' and said that 'The better question is: Do we have an important alliance between the American people and the Israeli people? And the answer to that question is yes.' Trump’s own relations with Netanyahu have been rocky. They soured after the Israeli prime minister became one of the first world leaders to congratulate President Joe Biden for his 2020 victory, which Trump continues to deny. A few days after the Oct. 7 attack last year, Trump publicly criticized Netanyahu and said he 'was not prepared' for the deadly incursion from Gaza on Oct. 7. Trump said Netanyahu had let the U.S. down just before the U.S. killed top Iranian general Qassem Soleimani in 2020. Since then, the two have met to talk about a cease-fire deal for Gaza. Halie Soifer, head of the Jewish Democratic Council of America, said the conflict in the Middle East — including fighting with Hezbollah and Iran — has left Jewish voters 'with a sense of vulnerability and concern for Israel’s future.' Soifer previously advised Harris on national security issues. But she says Harris has been consistent with the message of commitment to Israel’s defense for the last year, and said Harris and Biden have directed U.S. forces to shoot down Iranian missiles targeting Israel on multiple occasions. ___ Megerian reported from Washington.	https://apnews.com/article/trump-harris-oct-7-hamas-israel-78ba85f87ea89fa93c6537f77ca81b25	2024-10-07T05:06:03-07:00	
The Latest: New analysis says both Trump and Harris' plans would increase the deficit	No one is likely to be happy with the projected higher deficits laid out in a new analysis of Kamala Harris’ and Donald Trump’s economic plans. The analysis released Monday by the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget suggests a Harris presidency could increase the national debt over 10 years by $3.5 trillion. The same analysis says former President Trump’s ideas could heap another $7.5 trillion onto the debt and possibly as much as $15.2 trillion. Follow the AP’s Election 2024 coverage at: https://apnews.com/hub/election-2024. Here’s the latest: For US adversaries, Election Day won’t mean the end to efforts to influence Americans Soon, the ballots will be cast, the polls will close and a campaign marked by assassination attempts, animosity and anxiety will come to an end. But for U.S. adversaries, the work to meddle with American democracy may be entering its most critical phase. Despite all the attention on efforts to spread disinformation in the months before the Nov. 5 election, the hours and days immediately after voting ends could offer foreign adversaries like Russia, Iran and China or domestic extremist groups the best chance to mess with America’s decision. That’s when Americans will go online to see the latest results or share their opinions as the votes are tabulated. And that’s when a fuzzy photo or AI-generated video of supposed vote tampering could do its most damage, potentially transforming online outrage into real-world action before authorities have time to investigate the facts. It’s a threat taken seriously by intelligence analysts, elected officials and tech executives, who say that while there’s already been a steady buildup of disinformation and influence operations, the worst may be yet to come. Many Republicans are skeptical of Turning Point’s ability to get out the vote Turning Point’s representatives have made two things clear in meetings with state and local Republican leaders — Donald Trump has blessed their conservative organization to help lead his get-out-the-vote effort, and local party officials ought to use the group’s new voter mobilization app. Both prospects terrify fellow Republicans. Soaring to prominence after Trump’s unexpected 2016 win, Turning Point earned a reputation for hosting glitzy events, cultivating hard-right influencers and raising prodigious sums of money while enriching the group’s leaders. They’ve had far less success helping Republicans win, especially in their adopted home state of Arizona. Now the organization has leveraged its ties to Trump to expand its influence in a way that could be potentially lucrative. Turning Point has sought to lead an effort to remake the GOP’s get-out-the-vote effort based on the theory that there are thousands of Trump supporters who rarely vote but could be persuaded to in this year’s election. And they are pitching their new mobile app as vital to this effort’s success.	https://apnews.com/article/harris-trump-vance-walz-election-81a24ac1389f5d7a83d064f9e6d358d2	2024-10-07T04:03:58-07:00	
A top official with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz's party quits, a year before the national election	BERLIN (AP) — A top official with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz's party announced his resignation on Monday, citing health problems, a year before an election in which the center-left Social Democrats face an uphill struggle, Kevin Kühnert, 35, has been the Social Democrats' general secretary — the party official responsible for day-to-day political strategy — since late 2021. Scholz led the party to a narrow win in that year's national election. But its poll ratings have dropped sharply since then as the chancellor's coalition with the environmentalist Greens and the pro-business Free Democrats has developed a reputation for constant infighting. Kühnert is a former head of the party's youth organization and was a leader of an unsuccessful campaign in early 2018 against the Social Democrats joining conservative then Chancellor Angela Merkel's final coalition government. In a letter to party members shared on his Instagram feed Monday, Kühnert noted that he had said recently that everyone in the party 'must and will surpass themselves' in the campaign for the next national election, scheduled for September 2025. 'I myself cannot surpass myself at the moment, because unfortunately I am not healthy,' he wrote, without offering details. 'For the foreseeable future, I need the energy that is necessary for my officer and an election campaign to get healthy again. So I am drawing the consequences.' Kühnert said he had informed the party's co-leaders, Saskia Esken and Lars Klingbeil, that he was stepping down on Monday. There was no immediate word on his successor. Kühnert's departure is the second significant personnel change in the governing parties in recent weeks. The two co-leaders of the Greens announced on Sept. 25 that they would step down after the latest in a string of disappointing election results. Their successors will be elected next month. The Social Democrats finished behind the conservative opposition Union bloc and the far-right Alternative for Germany in the European Parliament election in June and also saw dismal results in two of three state elections last month in eastern Germany.	https://apnews.com/article/germany-scholz-party-social-democrats-resignation-498879bf631edf88a94807a71cce6bb4	2024-10-07T03:35:08-07:00	
Ex-Philippine President Duterte to run as mayor despite his drug killings legacy	MANILA, Philippines (AP) — The Philippines's former President Rodrigo Duterte registered Monday to run for mayor of his southern home city despite his notorious legacy over his brutal anti-drugs crackdown that the International Criminal Court is investigating as a possible crime against humanity. Duterte, 79, filed his papers before the Election Commission in Davao city, where he had served as mayor for about two decades before winning the presidency in 2016. His son — incumbent Davao city Mayor Sebastian Duterte — would run as his vice-mayor in next year’s mid-term elections, officials said. More than 6,000 people, mostly poor drug suspects, were killed under a massive police-enforced crackdown against illegal drugs that Duterte oversaw when he was president, according to government pronouncements. But human rights groups say the death toll is considerably higher and should include many unsolved killings by motorcycle-riding gunmen, who may have been deployed by police. Duterte has denied condoning extrajudicial killings of drug suspects, although he has openly threatened suspects with death and has ordered police to shoot suspects who dangerously resist arrest. Despite his administration’s massive crackdown against illegal drugs, Duterte acknowledged that drugs remained a major problem. During his presidential campaign, he vowed to eradicate the drug problem in three to six months but said after winning the presidency that he underestimated the enormity of the problem. Duterte withdrew the Philippines from the ICC in 2019, in a move critics said was an attempt to evade accountability. The ICC prosecutor said the court still has jurisdiction over alleged crimes, while the Philippines was still a member of the court. When Duterte’s turbulent presidential term ended in 2022, he said he would retire from politics, but he has walked back on his public pronouncements multiple times. His daughter, current Vice President Sara Duterte, said in June that her father and two brothers were planning to run for seats in the 24-member Senate. But the former president told reporters in Davao city on Saturday that his frail health could not withstand the rigors of a campaign for any national position. Duterte has remained popular after stepping down from the presidency, but human rights groups and his political opponents would likely campaign hard to block his return to politics. He and his family have also been at odds with his successor, President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., whom he has publicly reviled as a weak leader and a drug addict. Marcos has laughed off Duterte’s allegations and shot back at Duterte as a user of fentanyl, a powerful opioid. Sara Duterte resigned from her posts of education secretary and head of an anti-insurgency body under the Marcos administration in July. It was the latest sign her alliance with Marcos has floundered over key differences, including the Marcos administration’s high-profile pushback against China’s increasingly aggressive actions in the disputed South China Sea. Marcos has strengthened his country’s treaty alliance with the U.S. as his country’s territorial disputes with China flared alarmingly since last year. During his presidency, Duterte nurtured cozy ties with Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian leader Vladimir Putin while lambasting the security policies of the United States and other Western governments.	https://apnews.com/article/philippines-duterte-mayor-election-davao-2607694be5e3fb6a725ace2ef31b9e6a	2024-10-07T03:13:27-07:00

Countries around the world commemorate the anniversary of Hamas attack on Israel	BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) — Vigils, commemorations and acts of remembrance were planned across the world on Monday to mark one year since the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel as world leaders called for an end to antisemitism and the release of Israeli hostages. Last year's surprise cross-border attack, which killed about 1,200 people, caught Israel unprepared on a major Jewish holiday, shattering Israelis’ sense of security and leaving many countries, already on edge over Russia's war in Ukraine, facing the prospect of another major conflict in the Middle East. The nations of Europe, home to many Jewish and Muslim communities, have sought to tamp down both antisemitic and anti-Muslim sentiment in the wake of the Hamas attack and Israel’s subsequent war against the militants in Gaza, which has killed over 41,000 people and displaced around 1.9 million in the embattled coastal territory. The Vatican marked the anniversary of the attacks by taking up a collection for the people of Gaza and publishing a letter from Pope Francis to Catholics in the region, expressing his solidarity. Francis made no mention of Israel, Hamas or the hostages in the letter dated Oct. 7. He referred to the 'fuse of hatred' being ignited one year ago and the spiral of violence that has ensued, insisting that what is needed is dialogue and peace. 'I am with you, the people of Gaza, long embattled and in dire straits. You are in my thoughts and prayers daily,' he wrote. After some comments that upset Israel early on in the conflict, Francis has usually tried to strike an even tone. But he recently suggested Israel was using disproportionate and 'immoral' force in Lebanon and Gaza. He said he was particularly close to those who have been forced to flee their homes to find refuge from bombing, to the mothers weeping over their dead children and those 'who are afraid to look up for fear of fire raining down from the skies.' The German chancellery in Berlin was adorned with a yellow ribbon commemorating the Israeli hostages taken by Hamas, around 100 of whom remain in captivity, with many of them feared dead. The names of the people killed and kidnapped in the attack on Israel were read out in front of the Brandenburg Gate starting at 5:29 a.m. local time in Germany, when Hamas’ onslaught began a year ago. Chancellor Olaf Scholz said to Germany’s 'dear friends in Israel' that 'we feel with you … we stand beside you.' But he also pointed to the suffering of Palestinians in Gaza and said 'the daily experience of violence and hunger is not a basis on which good things can grow.' Scholz said in an address to a conference in Hamburg that Germany is pressing for a cease-fire and the release of the hostages and 'for a political process, even if it is further away than ever.' He said the aim must be a two-state solution that is only possible if a wider conflagration in the region is prevented, adding that Hezbollah and Iran must cease their attacks on Israel. Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni, who has voiced strong support for Israel, commemorated the Oct. 7 anniversary by visiting the main synagogue in Rome and reaffirming Israel’s right to defend itself. She denounced the 'latent and rampant antisemitism' she said has arisen since the Hamas attack, citing in particular pro-Palestinian protests in Italy this past weekend, some of which turned violent. While asserting Israel’s lights to live safely within its borders, Meloni insisted it respect international law and lamented the devastation unleashed by Israeli forces in Gaza. She said Palestinians in Gaza had been 'victims twice over: first of Hamas’ cynicism, which uses them as human shields, and then of Israeli military operations.' French President Emmanuel Macron took to social media Monday to mark the anniversary of the Hamas attacks. 'The pain remains, as vivid as it was a year ago. The pain of the Israeli people. Ours. The pain of wounded humanity,' he said. 'We do not forget the victims, the hostages, or the families with broken hearts from absence or waiting. I send them our fraternal thoughts,' Macron wrote on the social media platform X. He was later expected to receive in Paris some of the family members of hostages held by Hamas. French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot attended a memorial service at the site of the Nova music festival, in Re’im, Israel, where hundreds were killed. Speaking to the families of victims, he expressed France’s support in the face of 'the worst antisemitic massacre in our history since the Holocaust.' 'The joyful dawn of what should have been a day of celebration was suddenly torn apart by unspeakable horror,' he said. In Poland's capital, the Jewish community paid tribute to Alex Dancyg, a Polish-born Yad Vashem historian who was abducted from the Nir Oz kibbutz on Oct. 7 and killed by Hamas. He was remembered as a man who worked for reconciliation and understanding between Poles and Jews, and between Israelis and Palestinians. In Australia, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese attended a vigil in Melbourne, where he walked with members of the Jewish community and lawmakers from across party lines. Thousands attended the vigil. Earlier in the morning, Albanese said the day carried 'terrible pain,' and that his government 'unequivocally' condemned Hamas’ actions. 'Since the atrocities of October 7, Jewish Australians have felt the cold shadows of antisemitism reaching into the present day, and as a nation we say never again,' he said. 'We unequivocally condemn all prejudice and hatred.' In Sydney, opposition leader Peter Dutton — who has vehemently decried Australia’s acceptance of Palestinian refugees — arrived to cheers at a vigil also attended by thousands at which he reiterated his party’s support for Israel. Dutton’s remarks to the crowd echoed those he made earlier Monday, in which he said the Oct. 7 attack 'awoke and exposed an antisemitic rot afflicting Western democracies.' 'Israel has every right to defend its territory and its people from existential threats,' he said. Hundreds of people gathered amid a heavy police presence Monday night at Sydney town hall for a vigil for Palestinian lives lost in the conflict. Thousands of pro-Palestinian protesters had rallied across Australia’s cities on Sunday. In Pakistan's largest city of Karachi, school children took part in a rally on Monday organized by the Pakistan Markazi Muslim League party to protest Israeli airstrikes in the Middle East and show solidarity with Palestinian people living in Gaza and Lebanon. Japanese officials expressed condolences to the Israelis who lost family members in the Hamas attacks, renewing their condemnation of terrorism and demanding the immediate release of all hostages. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi told reporters that Japan is seriously concerned about the continuing critical humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip, and urged all parties including Israel to comply with international humanitarian law and work toward a cease-fire. ___ Associated Press writers Geir Moulson in Berlin, Diane Jeantet in Paris, Nicole Winfield in Rome, Mari Yamaguchi in Tokyo, Vanessa Gera in Warsaw and Charlotte Graham-McLay in Wellington, New Zealand, contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/hamas-attack-israel-anniversary-protests-b8f7428b707f2cf4300405feca0b570e	2024-10-07T02:07:58-07:00

Ukraine strikes a Russian oil hub as Zelenskyy says the war is in 'a very important phase'	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukraine’s military said it struck a major oil terminal Monday in Crimea that provides fuel for Russia’s war effort as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the war has entered a key phase. Both sides are facing the issue of how to sustain their costly war of attrition — a conflict that started with Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and that shows no signs of a resolution. Ukraine’s General Staff said on social media that the oil terminal in Feodosia, on the south coast of the Russia-occupied Crimea Peninsula, has been supplying the Russian army with fuel and that the strike was part of an ongoing effort to 'undermine the military and economic potential of the Russian Federation.' Russian-installed authorities in the city of Feodosia on the coast of the Black Sea reported a fire at the terminal on Monday morning but did not say what might have caused it. Ukraine has increasingly targeted rear areas that are essential for Russia’s onslaught, now deep into its third year. It has developed long-range drones that have hit oil depots and refineries as well as armories. Ukraine's aim is to impair Russia’s ability to support its front-line units, especially in the eastern Donetsk region where the main Russian battlefield effort is stretching weary Ukrainian forces. Kyiv is still awaiting word from its Western partners on its repeated requests to use the long-range weapons they provide to hit targets on Russian soil. Developments on that question could come next weekend at Ramstein Air Base in Germany, when defense leaders from the 50-plus partner nations that coordinate military aid to Ukraine are due to meet. The conflict has largely been a war of attrition, which requires large amounts of ammunition. Late on Sunday, Zelenskyy said the war is in 'a very important phase' as the Ukrainian army works hard to hold the bigger Russian forces at bay in the east while also holding ground in Russia’s Kursk border region, which it captured two months ago. Ukraine needs to 'put pressure on Russia in the way that’s necessary for Russia to realize that the war will gain them nothing,' Zelenskyy said in a video statement. 'We will continue to apply even greater pressure on Russia — because only through strength can we bring peace closer,' he added. Meanwhile, Russia fired six missiles of various types and 74 Shahed drones at Ukraine overnight, Ukraine’s air force said. Missile debris fell in three districts of Kyiv, causing minor damage to civilian infrastructure and starting a fire, Mayor Vitalii Klitschko said. He said nobody was hurt. Three missile fragments fell on a kindergarten, he said without elaborating. The acting head of the Communications Department of Ukraine’s Air Force, Yurii Ihnat, said that two of the hypersonic Kinzhal missiles that were shot down over the Kyiv region were aimed at the capital city. 'Despite the fact that it’s getting harder, despite (Russia's) improvements and the use of new tactics, today we have two shoot-downs,' Ihnat said. Despite Ukraine’s high interception rates, some weapons still get through. 'They are learning from their mistakes and from our mistakes. They are improving their technology so that we are able to shoot down fewer of them,' Ihnat told AP. Russia’s Defense Ministry said it shot down almost two dozen Ukrainian drones overnight. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-crimea-oil-terminal-1d78b9819d1c4680a3f1ab8b34a24a6a	2024-10-07T00:50:12-07:00	
Russian court sentences a 72-year-old American to nearly 7 years in prison for fighting in Ukraine	MOSCOW (AP) — A Russian court on Monday sentenced a 72-year-old American in a closed trial to nearly seven years in prison for allegedly fighting as a mercenary in Ukraine. Prosecutors said Stephen Hubbard signed a contract with the Ukrainian military after Russia sent troops into Ukraine in February 2022 and he fought alongside them until being captured two months later. He was sentenced to six years and 10 months in a general-security prison. Prosecutors had called for a sentence of seven years in a maximum-security prison. Hubbard, from the state of Michigan, is the first American known to have been convicted on charges of fighting as a mercenary in the Ukrainian conflict. The charges carried a potential sentence of 15 years, but prosecutors asked that his age be taken into account along with his admission of guilt, Russian news reports said. Arrests of Americans have become increasingly common in Russia in recent years. Concern has risen that Russia could be targeting U.S. nationals for arrest to use later as bargaining chips in talks to bring back Russians convicted of crimes in the U.S. and Europe. Also on Monday, a court in the city of Voronezh sentenced American Robert Gilman to seven years and 1 month for allegedly assaulting law enforcement officers while serving a sentence for another assault. According to Russian news reports, Gilman was arrested in 2022 for causing a disturbance while intoxicated on a passenger train and then assaulted a police officer while in custody. He is serving a 3 1/2-year sentence on that charge. Last year, he assaulted a prison inspector during a cell check, then hit an official of the Investigative Committe, resulting in the new sentence, state news agency RIA-Novosti said. The U.S. and Russia in August completed their largest prisoner swap in post-Soviet history, a deal involving 24 people, many months of negotiations and concessions from other European countries, which released Russians in their custody as part of the exchange. Several U.S. citizens remain behind bars in Russia following the swap.	https://apnews.com/article/russia-american-ukraine-sentence-mercenary-84b846f4045320c58cdbe5c8d849662b	2024-10-07T00:16:03-07:00

Former Singapore Cabinet minister starts 1-year sentence for receiving illegal gifts	KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) — A former Singaporean Cabinet minister began a one-year prison term Monday for receiving illegal gifts after saying he would not appeal his sentence in the rare criminal case involving a government minister in the Asian financial hub. Former Transport Minister S. Iswaran said it was important to him that prosecutors reduced two corruption charges to charges of receiving illegal gifts at the start of the trial last month. Iswaran had pleaded guilty to one count of obstructing justice and four of accepting gifts from two businessmen with whom he had official business. His sentence of 12 months in prison exceeded what the defense and prosecution had requested, but the court agreed to let him start serving the sentence Monday. 'I will not be appealing the sentence handed down by the Court,' Iswaran said in a statement on social media. 'I accept that as a minister, what I did was wrong under section 165 (of the Penal Code). I accept full responsibility for my actions and apologise unreservedly to all Singaporeans.' With his prison term, he said he hoped he and his family can put 'the pain and anguish behind us, move forward and rebuild our lives together.' Singapor e’s ministers are among the world’s best paid, and the case has embarrassed the ruling People’s Action Party, which prides itself on clean governance. The last Cabinet minister charged with graft was Wee Toon Boon, who was found guilty in 1975 and jailed for accepting gifts in exchange for helping a businessperson. Another Cabinet minister was investigated for graft in 1986, but died before charges were filed. A day after Iswaran's sentence last week, a Malaysian hotelier who brought Formula One to Singapore was charged Friday for allegedly obstructing justice and abetting Iswaran's wrongdoings. Ong Beng Seng did not indicate how he would plead to the charges, and his case has been adjourned until next month. The second businessman will not be charged. Ong, a Malaysian businessman based in Singapore, is the managing director of Hotel Properties Limited, which owns 38 hotels and resorts in 17 countries. He is known for bringing Formula 1 to Singapore in 2008, and holds the rights to the Grand Prix night race in the city-state.	https://apnews.com/article/singapore-minister-corruption-sentence-d94a33a68654ef1ee6903483d4d4cf6e	2024-10-06T21:53:39-07:00	
A Pakistani separatist group claims bombing that killed 2 Chinese near Karachi airport	KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) — A Pakistani separatist group claimed responsibility for a late night bombing that targeted a convoy with Chinese nationals outside the country's largest airport, killing two workers from China and wounding eight people, officials and the insurgent group said Monday. The attack by the Baloch Liberation Army outside the airport in the southern port city of Karachi was the latest deadly assault on Chinese here and came a week before Pakistan is to host a summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, a security grouping founded by China and Russia to counter Western alliances. The explosion, which the BLA said was the work of a suicide bomber, also raised questions about the ability of Pakistani forces to secure high-profile events or foreigners in the country. Among the wounded were also police officers who were escorting the Chinese convoy when the attack happened. Initially, Pakistani authorities gave conflicting details and said the explosion may have been from an oil tanker but police later confirmed it was a bomb attack. Pakistani news channels broadcast videos of flames engulfing cars and a thick column of smoke rising from the scene. Troops and police cordoned off the area. On Monday, counterterrorism officials were investigating how the attacker reached Karachi, Pakistan's largest city. The spokesman for the separatist group, Junaid Baloch, said Monday that one of their suicide bombers targeted the convoy of Chinese engineers and investors as they left the airport. The Baloch Liberation Army is mainly based in the restive southwestern Balochistan province but it has also attacked foreigners and security forces in other parts of Pakistan in recent years. The Chinese Embassy in Islamabad said Chinese staffers working at the Port Qasim Electric Power Company — a coal-powered power plant that's a joint China-Pakistan venture — were in the convoy when it came under attack around 11 p.m. on Sunday. Two Chinese nationals were killed and one was wounded, the embassy said and added, without elaborating, that there were also Pakistani casualties. Pakistani security officials say a police bomb disposal unit in Sindh province, where Karachi is the capital, had cleared the road outside the airport ahead of the movement of the Chinese convoy, which was being escorted by police and security officials in several vehicles. However, the road had not been blocked to avoid inconvenience for residents and travelers going to or from the airport, the officials said, speaking to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity to discuss security details. Pakistan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs denounced the bombing, saying it was a 'heinous terrorist attack near Karachi airport.' It said another Chinese was injured in the attack. 'We extend our deepest condolences and sympathies to the families of the victims, both Chinese and Pakistani, and offer prayers for the swift recovery of the injured,' said the ministry in a statement. 'We remain resolute in bringing to justice those responsible for this cowardly attack.' Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said he was shocked and saddened, describing the attackers as 'enemies of Pakistan' and promising the perpetrators would be punished. 'I strongly condemn this heinous act and offer my heartfelt condolences to the Chinese leadership &amp; the people of China, particularly the families of the victims,' he wrote on the social media platform X. 'Pakistan stands committed to safeguarding our Chinese friends,' he added. 'We will leave no stone unturned to ensure their security &amp; well-being.' Authorities estimate that the BLA, which Pakistan and the United States have designated a terrorist organization, has around 3,000 fighters. It regularly targets Pakistani security forces but has also in the past attacked Chinese nationals. According to Abdullah Khan, a senior defense analyst and managing director of the Islamabad-based Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies, BLA has preferred attacks on 'moving targets' but its ability to launch high-profile attacks has increased in recent years. More BLA attacks around the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit next week cannot be ruled out, Khan told The Associated Press. Port Qasim Electric Power Company is owned by PowerChina Resource Ltd, a subsidiary of Power Construction Corporation of China whose spokesperson, Geng Xingqiang, said the company 'is in the middle of making arrangements to actively deal with the incident.' Pakistan hosts thousands of Chinese workers as part of Beijing’s multibillion-dollar Belt and Road Initiative, which is building major infrastructure projects. The outlawed BLA has long waged an insurgency seeking independence and has repeatedly warned against any Chinese working in Balochistan. The Sunday night attack followed deadly attacks in August that killed more than 50 people in Balochistan. Sharif at the time said the attackers sought to harm Chinese-funded development projects. The oil- and mineral-rich Balochistan is Pakistan’s largest but also least populated province. It is also a hub for the country’s ethnic Baloch minority whose members say they face discrimination and exploitation by the central government. Along with separatist groups, Islamic militants also operate in the province. In 2018, the BLA stormed the Chinese Consulate in Karachi, triggering an intense hourlong shootout that killed two Pakistani civilians and two police officers. All three assailants were also killed. In March, in northwestern Pakistan, a suicide bombing killed five Chinese engineers and their Pakistani driver as they headed to the Dasu Dam, the country's biggest hydropower project. In April, five Japanese workers were unharmed when a suicide bomber targeted their van as they were on their wat to a factory in Karachi. One bystander was killed. In July 2021, at least nine Chinese nationals working on a dam and four Pakistanis were killed when a suicide bomber targeted their bus in northwestern Pakistan. Local authorities first said it was a road accident but Beijing insisted it was a bombing, which Islamabad later confirmed. In 2022, three Chinese teachers and their Pakistani driver were killed when an explosion ripped through their van at the University of Karachi campus. ___ Ahmed reported from Islamabad.

Middle East latest: Palestinian militants in Gaza fire 4 rockets into Israel as mourners mark Oct 7	Palestinian militants in Gaza fired four rockets into Israel on Monday as mourners marked the anniversary of the Oct. 7 attack, without disrupting a nearby ceremony. Hamas also said it attacked Israeli forces in different parts of Gaza. The Israeli military said three rockets were intercepted and a fourth fell in an open area. There were no reports of casualties or damage. The military said it launched a wave of artillery and airstrikes overnight and into Monday to thwart what it said was an imminent attack. It said it targeted Hamas launch posts and underground militant infrastructure. The fighting on the anniversary underscored the militants’ resilience in the face of a devastating Israeli offensive that has killed around 42,000 Palestinians, according to local medical officials. It has also destroyed large areas of Gaza and displaced around 90% of its population. Hamas-led militants blew holes in Israel’s security fence and stormed into nearby army bases and farming communities in a surprise attack one year ago, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting another 250. They are still holding around 100 captives inside Gaza, a third of whom are believed to be dead. Israel is now at war with Hamas in Gaza and its ally Hezbollah in Lebanon. It has also vowed to strike Iran in response to a ballistic missile attack on Israel last week. ___ Here is The Latest: Group representing families of hostages announces death of captive TEL AVIV, Israel — A group representing the families of Israeli hostages announced on Monday the death of a captive whose body is still being held in Gaza. The Hostages and Families Forum said Idan Shtivi, 28, was captured from the Nova music festival on Oct. 7. He was thought to have been taken alive. Israeli media reported that he was killed that day and his body was taken into Gaza. It was not immediately clear how Shtivi’s death became apparent, but in previous such announcements, the Israeli military has discovered evidence indicating a hostage’s death. The announcement of Shtivi’s death comes as Israelis are marking one year since Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack, where militants killed 1,200 people and kidnapped 250 others. About 100 remain in captivity, although more than a third of those are said to be dead. Hundreds gather at Nova music festival site to remember Oct 7 victims RE’IM, Israel — Hundreds of families and friends of people killed at the Nova music festival gathered Monday at the site of the attack, where nearly 400 were gunned down during Hamas’ Oct. 7 assault. Families gathered around photos of their loved ones, which were arranged in a semicircle around what was the DJ stage. Many lit candles and added mementos or photos, crying and embracing. Overhead, army helicopters circled and constant booms echoed across the area, causing many to flinch. 'We can’t understand how a year has passed,' said Shimon Busika, whose son, Yarden, 25, was killed at the festival. 'It’s the most natural place to be, to be here for this moment of silence,' he said. Busika said it took them a long time, piecing together testimony from other survivors, to understand what happened in Yarden’s last moments. They now know he was killed around 9:20 near a yellow container at the festival where many others were killed, and they will hold a second minute of silence there at the moment he was killed. The last sounds of the trance track that was playing at the Nova site on Oct. 7 one year ago stopped abruptly, as hundreds of family members and friends of the more than 300 victims stood in a moment of silence. One woman’s piercing wail broke the silence as booms echoed from the fighting in Gaza, just a few kilometers (miles) away. 20 Indonesians who were evacuated from Lebanon arrive in Jakarta JAKARTA, Indonesia — Twenty Indonesian nationals and a Lebanese evacuated from Lebanon arrived in Jakarta on a commercial flight early Monday and will likely be followed by 20 more in the afternoon, officials said. President Joko Widodo has called to prioritize the evacuation of Indonesians in Lebanon as hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah escalate and fears of a wider regional war in the Middle East grow. 'I have directed the foreign affairs minister to take immediate action to ensure the safety and protection of our citizens and expedite their evacuation,' Widodo said last week. Indonesia’s Embassy in Beirut had prepared evacuation procedures for citizens as part of its contingency planning since August. The Embassy evacuated 25 Indonesian citizens who returned safely to Indonesia last month, said Judha Nugraha, Director of Indonesian Citizen Protection at the Foreign Affairs Ministry. There are 116 registered Indonesian citizens in Lebanon, most of them students, migrant workers and people married to Lebanese nationals. Many of them have chosen to remain there for various reasons, Nugraha said. Australian PM Albanese condemns Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on Israel CANBERRA, Australia — Australia’s Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said in a statement Monday that the day carried 'terrible pain' and his government 'unequivocally' condemned Hamas' attack on Israel a year ago. Hamas militants stormed from the blockaded Gaza Strip into nearby Israeli towns on Oct. 7 a year ago, killing dozens and abducting others in an unprecedented surprise attack. Albanese said that since the attack, Jewish Australians have 'felt the cold shadows of antisemitism reaching into the present day — and as a nation we say never again.' 'We unequivocally condemn all prejudice and hatred. There is no place in Australia for discrimination against people of any faith,' Albanese said. He added that 'every innocent life matters' and the number of civilians killed in the conflict was 'a devastating tragedy.' 'Today we reflect on the truth of our shared humanity, of the hope that peace is possible, and the belief that it belongs to all people,' Albanese said. New Israeli strikes hit Beirut suburbs as Hezbollah claims blasts in Israel's Haifa BEIRUT — A new round of airstrikes hit Beirut suburbs late Sunday as Israel intensified its bombardment of northern Gaza and southern Lebanon. Palestinian officials said a strike on a mosque in Gaza killed at least 19 people. Rocket sirens and blasts were heard in Haifa in northern Israel late Sunday, and Hezbollah claimed the attack. Israel’s military said at least five projectiles were identified coming from Lebanon and 'fallen projectiles' were found in the area. The military showed what appeared to be rubble along a street. The Magen David Adom ambulance service said it was treating a teen with shrapnel injuries to the head and a man who fell from a window due to a blast. A year after Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack, Israel has opened a new front in Lebanon against Hezbollah, which has traded fire with Israel along the border since the war in Gaza began. Israel also has vowed to strike Iran after a ballistic missile attack on Israel last week.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hezbollah-hamas-latest-mideast-7-october-2024-d3d272d83e70d420ba547dbd7e09ef52	2024-10-06T20:45:39-07:00	
South Korean woman sues government and adoption agency after her kidnapped daughter was sent abroad	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — A 70-year-old South Korean woman sued her government, an adoption agency, and an orphanage Monday over the adoption of her daughter, who was sent to the United States in 1976, months after she was kidnapped at age 4. The damage suit filed by Han Tae-soon, whose story was part of an Associated Press investigation published last month, could ignite further debate on the dubious child-gathering practices and widespread falsification of paperwork that tarnished South Korea’s adoption program, which annually sent thousands of kids to the West during the 1970-80s. It was the first known case of a Korean birth parent suing for damages against the government and an adoption agency over the wrongful adoption of their child, said Kim Soo-jung, one of the lawyers representing Han. Han searched for her daughter, Laurie Bender, for more than 40 years before they reunited through DNA testing in 2019. Speaking to reporters in front of the Seoul Central District Court, Han argued that the South Korean government was responsible for failing to prevent the adoption of Bender. Han had reported to police that her daughter was missing and desperately searched for her, frequently visiting police stations, government offices and adoption agencies and even going on Korean media. She had her daughter's picture displayed everywhere — in subway stations, on lamp posts, on bags of snacks that advertised missing children, the Korean version of American milk cartons. Han accuses Holt Children’s Services, South Korea’s biggest adoption agency, of facilitating Bender’s adoption without checking her background. Her lawyers said the Jechon Children’s Home made no effort to find the parents after Bender was placed at the facility by police in May 1975, a day after Han reported her as missing. In her adoption papers, Bender, named Shin Gyeong-ha at birth, is described as an abandoned orphan with no known parents. Under a new Korean name made by the orphanage, Baik Kyong Hwa, she was sent to the United States in February 1976. 'For 44 years, I wandered and searched for my child, but the joy of meeting her was only momentary and now I am in so much pain because we can’t communicate in the same language,' Han said, fighting back tears. 'It turns out they didn’t make an effort to find her clearly existing parents and instead disguised her as an orphan for adoption abroad. I want the government and Holt to explain to us how this happened.' Kim, the lawyer, said the government is at fault for the botched child search that led to Bender’s adoption, saying she could have easily been found if missing child information was properly shared between police stations or if officers had tried to search orphanages. 'While the state bears the large responsibility for not fulfilling its duty to help find missing children and reunite them with their families, we also believe that the (orphanage) and adoption agency cannot be spared from responsibility as well,' Kim said. 'We suspect that these child protection institutions failed to carry out their ethical obligation to help find the child’s parents, even when the child was saying (she) had a family and had parents.' Jeon Min Kyeong, another lawyer representing Han, said she is seeking about 600 million won ($445,000) in damages. The lawsuit lists Han, her husband and two of her younger children as plaintiffs, but not Bender, Jeon said. South Korea’s Justice Ministry, which represents the government in lawsuits, and Holt didn’t immediately comment on the suit. In an earlier interview with AP, Bender said she was approached by a strange woman while playing near her home in the city of Cheongju. She remembers the woman saying her family didn’t want her any more because Han had another baby. Distraught, Bender went with the woman, who, after taking her on a train ride, deserted her in Jechon, a city 50 miles away. After failing to find her daughter for four decades, Han registered her DNA with a nonprofit group called 325 Kamra, which helps Korean adoptees reunite with their families through genetic information. In the United States, Bender took a DNA test because her own daughter was curious about their heritage and 325 Kamra connected them in 2019. Just weeks after finding her mother, Bender and her daughter flew to Korea to meet Han. Recognizing Bender immediately, Han ran to her, screaming, moaning, running her fingers through Bender’s hair. 'It’s like a hole in your heart has been healed, you finally feel like a complete person,' Bender said. 'It’s like you’ve been living a fake life and everything you know is not true.' The AP investigation, which was also documented by Frontline (PBS), described how the South Korean government, Western nations and adoption agencies worked in tandem to place around 200,000 Korean children in the United States and other Western nations, despite years of evidence that children were being procured through dubious or dishonest means. Western nations ignored these problems and sometimes pressured South Korea to keep the kids coming as they focused on satisfying their huge domestic demands for babies. In 2019, Adam Crapser became the first Korean adoptee to sue the South Korean government and an adoption agency for damages, accusing them of mishandling his adoption to the United States, where he faced legal troubles after surviving an abusive childhood before being deported in 2016. After four years of hearings, the Seoul Central District Court last year ordered Crapser’s adoption agency, Holt, to pay him 100 million won ($74,000) in damages for failing to inform his adopters they needed to take separate steps to obtain his citizenship after his adoption was approved by a state court. However, the court dismissed Crapser’s accusations against the Korean government over alleged monitoring and due diligence failures. The case is now with the Seoul High Court after both Crapser and Holt appealed. ___ AP writer Claire Galofaro in Louisville, Kentucky, contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/south-korea-adoption-lawsuit-children-holt-593945988001c509943e5c6266885878	2024-10-06T20:42:05-07:00	
Today in History: October 7, surprise attacks spark Israel-Hamas War	Today is Monday, Oct. 7, the 281st day of 2024. There are 85 days left in the year. Today in history: On Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas-led militants launched air and ground attacks on Israel, killing nearly 1,200 and taking more than 250 hostages. The attacks, followed hours later by Israeli counterattacks, marked the beginning of the current Israel-Hamas War. Also on this date: In 1765, the Stamp Act Congress convened in New York to draw up colonial grievances against England. In 1913, the first moving assembly line began operation at the Ford Motor Company factory in Highland Park, Michigan.

In 1985, Palestinian gunmen hijacked the Italian cruise ship Achille Lauro (ah-KEE’-leh LOW’-roh) in the Mediterranean Sea. The hijackers shot and killed Leon Klinghoffer, a Jewish American tourist in a wheelchair, and pushed him overboard, before surrendering on Oct. 9. In 1992, trade representatives of the United States, Canada and Mexico initialed the North American Free Trade Agreement during a ceremony in San Antonio, Texas, in the presence of President George H.W. Bush, Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney and Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari. In 1998, Matthew Shepard, a gay college student, was beaten and left tied to a wooden fencepost outside of Laramie, Wyoming; he died five days later. Russell Henderson and Aaron McKinney are serving life sentences for Shepard’s murder. In 2001, the war in Afghanistan started as the United States and Britain launched air attacks against military targets and Osama bin Laden’s training camps in the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks.

Takeaways from AP's report on the destruction in Gaza a year into the war	Israel's yearlong offensive against Hamas, launched in response to the militant group's Oct. 7 attack into Israel, has killed tens of thousands of Palestinians and caused staggering destruction across the Gaza Strip that could take decades to rebuild. Hundreds of thousands of people are crammed into squalid tent camps with no homes to return to, even if there is a cease-fire. The mountains of rubble alone, laced with human remains, unexploded ordnance and other hazardous materials, could take years to remove. Israel blames the destruction on Hamas. Its Oct. 7 attack on Israel — in which some 1,200 people were killed and around 250 taken hostage — ignited the war. Hamas embedded much of its military infrastructure, including hundreds of kilometers (miles) of tunnels, in densely populated areas where some of the heaviest battles were fought. The fighting left roughly a quarter of all structures in Gaza destroyed or severely damaged, according to a U.N. assessment in September based on satellite footage. It said around 66% of structures, including more than 227,000 housing units, had sustained at least some damage. Here's a look at the main takeaways from an AP interactive report looking at the scope of the devastation. Tens of thousands were killed Israel's offensive has killed over 41,000 Palestinians in Gaza and wounded more than 96,000, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. It does not say how many were fighters, but says women and children make up more than half of those killed. It also says the toll may be higher as thousands of bodies remain buried under rubble or in areas that are inaccessible to medical teams. Israel says it has killed over 17,000 militants, but has not provided evidence. Over 720 Israeli soldiers have been killed since Oct. 7, including in the attack itself, the war in Gaza and the conflict with Lebanon's Hezbollah militant group. Hundreds of thousands displaced The U.N. estimates that around 90% of Gaza's population of 2.3 million people have been displaced, often multiple times. Israeli evacuation orders now cover around 90% of the territory. Schools have been turned into shelters, and hundreds of thousands have crammed into sprawling tent camps along the coast. The Shelter Cluster, an international coalition of aid providers led by the Norwegian Refugee Council, says it has struggled to bring in basic supplies because of Israeli restrictions, the ongoing fighting and the breakdown of law and order in Gaza. It estimates that some 900.000 people are in need of tents and bedding. Critical infrastructure has been destroyed The war has gutted Gaza's infrastructure, which was already in bad shape after a 16-year blockade imposed by Israel and Egypt when Hamas seized power in 2007. The U.N. says the war has damaged or destroyed over 92% of Gaza's main roads and more than 84% of its health facilities. It estimates nearly 70% of Gaza’s water and sanitation plants have been destroyed or damaged. That includes all five of the territory’s wastewater treatment facilities, plus desalination plants, sewage pumping stations, wells and reservoirs. The breakdown of water infrastructure has flooded the streets with sewage in many areas, contributing to the spread of disease among a population weakened by widespread hunger. Mountains of rubble will take years to remove Where houses, shops and office buildings once stood, there are now giant drifts of rubble laced with human remains, hazardous substances and unexploded munitions. The U.N. estimates the war has left some 40 million tons of debris and rubble in Gaza, enough to fill New York’s Central Park to a depth of eight meters (about 25 feet). It could take up to 15 years and nearly $650 million to clear it all away, it said. Rebuilding could take decades The World Bank estimated $18.5 billion in damage in Gaza from just the first three months of the war, before several major Israeli operations. That figure is nearly equivalent to the combined economic output of the West Bank and Gaza in 2022. Wealthy Arab countries like Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have said they are only willing to contribute to Gaza’s reconstruction as part of a postwar settlement that creates a path to a Palestinian state. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has ruled that out, saying he won’t allow Hamas or even the Western-backed Palestinian Authority to govern Gaza. He has said Israel will maintain open-ended security control and delegate civilian affairs to local Palestinians. But none are known to have volunteered, and Hamas has threatened to kill anyone who aids the occupation. Israel allowed construction materials in before the war, but the system was subject to heavy restrictions and delays. The Shelter Cluster estimates that it would take 40 years to rebuild all of Gaza’s destroyed homes under that system. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Gaza at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war	https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-anniversary-destruction-takeaways-a1ae8d316633fd7d1f3fe24cc527a2ee	2024-10-06T19:59:45-07:00	
How farmers in Burundi banded together to get fair prices for avocados	KAYANZA, Burundi (AP) — Farmers in a remote part of Burundi know to look for a truck parked by a highway when it is time to sell their avocados. They materialize from villages and form a crowd around the vehicle, watching closely as crews weigh and load the crated fruits. Such roadside exchanges, repeated regularly during peak harvest season, long provided a ready market for smallholder avocado growers in a country that’s sometimes ranked as the world’s poorest. But the transactions now promise real earnings thanks in part to the intervention of the national government and farmers’ cooperatives that worked to set terms for foreign avocado dealers. Just a year ago, farmers selling their avocados to the transporters earned 10 cents per kilogram (2.2 pounds), far less than the price for a small bottle of water. These days, they get roughly 70 cents for the same quantity, a meaningful increase for people who mainly farm to feed their families. A major change in the trade is that payments in U.S. currency now go into the bank accounts of cooperatives that pay their members directly almost as soon as the avocado haulers leave. Acting as intermediaries, groups such as Green Gold Burundi, which has its headquarters in the northern province of Kayanza and represents 200,000 farmers nationwide, say they are better positioned than individual growers to stem exploitation. The participation of the cooperatives is an important step toward regulating the country's avocado exports, said Ferdinand Habimana, vice president of Green Gold Burundi’s administrative board. Although the government is promoting avocado farming to diversify exports, avocados grown in Burundi are yet to be trademarked as coming from there, he said. 'So it is legally done now, but what we are developing now is that the (avocados) can reach the final destination as avocados taken from Burundi,' said Habimana, speaking of his group’s dealings with exporters in Tanzania and elsewhere in East Africa. Zacharie Munezero, who oversees quality management for Green Gold Burundi, acknowledged that the 70 cents farmers earn for a kilogram of avocados is still insufficient when exporters can fetch between $3 and $5 for the same quantity in international markets. Avocados are cheap in many parts of sub-Saharan Africa, where they can be purchased from farmers in bulk for almost nothing. In Burundi, avocados became more widely cultivated after the country's former leader, Pierre Nkurunziza, started extolling the fruit in 2007 as a source of nutrition and income. Many households that don’t produce the varieties favored by exporters usually look after at least one avocado plant of the local variety known to Burundians as 'amapeter,' in remembrance of Nkurunziza, who died in 2020. But while coffee and tea exports – Burundi’s traditional sources of much-needed foreign currency – have long been coordinated, the trade in Burundian avocados has remained unregulated, according to farmer representatives and a trade official. They said that avocado exports could be as profitable for the country as coffee if the government asserted its rule-making authority. Desirable measures include guaranteeing a minimum price for farmers, stopping foreign traders from dealing directly with farmers, and encouraging widespread cultivation of the Hass avocados favored by European consumers, they said. Burundi 'cannot rely only on coffee and tea,' Onesime Niyukuri, an adviser in the foreign trade department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said of the country's limited exports. If avocado dealers from elsewhere in East Africa 'can come and buy at a price that is already set by the government, there is no problem,' he said. The government ramped up its efforts to organize avocado exports earlier this year as dollar shortages fueled sporadic shortages of sugar and other goods. Under new regulations, which require foreign dealers to register with local authorities, exporters must submit copies of their supply contracts and specify market destinations for Burundian avocados, according to the Ministry of Trade, Transport, Industry and Tourism. Burundi aims to export more than 10 million tonnes (11 million tons) of avocados each year by 2030, said Niyukuri, citing the government’s strategic plan. Recent figures on Burundi’s foreign exchange earnings from the avocado crop were not readily available. The government’s target is to plant 50,000 avocado trees in each of Burundi’s 17 provinces. Local authorities in provinces such as Kayanza want each household to own at least 10 trees producing exportable avocados. That includes the Mexican variety Fuerte and especially Hass avocado, the most commercially successful variety globally. The fruit, which has dark bumpy skin and bright yellow-green flesh, takes more than two weeks to ripen and can survive several days in transit. Burundi, a small mountainous country about the size of Maryland, is home to 13 million people. Annual income per capita was $199 in 2023, among the lowest globally, and nearly 65% of the population lives below the poverty line, according to World Bank figures. Agriculture is the main economic activity, and many people in rural provinces such as Kayanza mostly grow the potatoes and vegetables they will consume through the year. For some, including those with a few avocado trees in their compounds, the pear-shaped green fruit has proven a surprisingly reliable source of income. Eric Nsabimana, a farmer in Kayanza, recalled starting as an avocado grower in response to the campaign of former leader Nkurunziza. Some farmers, feeling forced into planting avocados, uprooted the seedlings the government gave them and now rue the missed opportunity, Nsabimana said. 'The people who didn’t plant, they regret,' he said. Nsabimana, who anticipates making more than $6,000 a year selling avocados now that the price is higher, said he used his earnings to acquire five more hectares (12.4 acres) of land now planted with 500 avocado trees. Habimana, the senior official with Green Gold Burundi, said his group moved to mobilize avocado farmers for better rewards after it realized at the beginning of the year they were being exploited by foreign traders. One day in January, he followed a truck transporting Burundian avocados to neighboring Tanzania, believing the cargo was destined for consumption in the region. When he saw the avocados getting washed, weighed and packed in the town of Njombe, he realized the goods were bound for another export market abroad. 'There was another destination somewhere else, not in Njombe,' Nsabimana said. When he returned to Kayanza, Green Gold Burundi prioritized plans to register avocado farmers in a way that eliminated middlemen and guaranteed a reasonable price for farmers. The cooperative pays taxes and keeps a cut of avocado proceeds to sustain operations that include providing members with seedlings and organic manure. Munezero, the cooperative's quality management official, said that while the price of avocados 'is still a problem,' his group is 'focusing on capacity building' and encouraging residents to plant more avocado trees. Green Gold Burundi has distributed millions of seedlings in the past year, finding enthusiasm among farmers eager to join the avocado bandwagon. Even growers with only a few backyard Hass plants said they increasingly see avocado as a cash crop. 'Avocados mean dollars to us,' one such grower, Samuel Niyinyibutsa, said, adding that he knows some Kayanza residents who feel 'left behind' when they see others collect payments for their produce. 'But they still have time,' Niyinyibutsa said. 'They can be awakened and start planting avocados because avocado can do well to them as it is doing well to us.' ___ The Associated Press receives financial support for global health and development coverage in Africa from the Gates Foundation.

Stock market today: Asian shares climb after blockbuster US jobs report	Asian shares advanced Monday after a surprisingly strong U.S. jobs report raised optimism about the economy, sparking a rally on Wall Street. U.S. futures slipped and oil prices also fell. Japan's Nikkei 225 index gained 1.8% to 39,332.74 after the yen sank against the U.S. dollar. The Japanese currency has bounced on speculation over the central bank's plans for interest rates since Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba took office last week. Lower interest rates tend to boost prices of shares and other asset, and both Ishiba and the central bank governor suggested no hikes were likely soon. Nintendo gained 5% following reports that a Saudi wealth fund was planning to increase its investment in the Kyoto, Japan-based video game maker. In a policy speech on Friday, Ishiba said he wants to see salary increases that outpace inflation and that he will promote investment to create 'a virtuous cycle of growth and distribution.' He promised economic support for low-income households and measures for regional revitalization and disaster resilience. But he offered no major new initiatives, and his initial public support ratings are around 50% or lower, relatively low for a new leader, according to Japanese media. He plans to dissolve parliament on Wednesday for an election on Oct. 27. After gaining briefly against the dollar, the yen fell back late last week. Early Monday, the dollar was trading at 148.45 yen, down from 148.72 late Friday. Elsewhere in Asia, Hong Kong's Hang Seng index rose 1.1% to 22,977.97, and the Kospi in Seoul surged 1.3% to 2,602.23. Taiwan's Taiex gained 1.8%. Mainland Chinese markets reopen from a weeklong holiday on Tuesday, and the government said it plans to explain details of plans for economic stimulus at a morning news conference in Beijing. Before the Oct. 1 National Day holiday began, announcements of policies aimed at reviving the ailing property market pushed share benchmarks sharply higher and this week could bring more volatility. 'More fiscal stimulus to stabilize the property market and restructure local government debts, and structural reforms to address the over-capacity and deflation issues are needed to turn around the economy,' B of A Securities said in a research note, pointing to continued declines in home sales, housing prices and credit growth. On Friday, the S&amp;P 500 climbed 0.9% and got close to its all-time high set on Monday, closing at 5,751.07. The Dow gained 0.8% to 42,352.75, and the Nasdaq climbed 1.2% to 18,137.85. Leading the way were banks, airlines, cruise-ship operators and other companies whose profits can benefit the most from a stronger economy where people are working and better able to pay for things. Norwegian Cruise Line steamed 4.9% higher, JPMorgan Chase rose 3.5% and the small companies in the Russell 2000 index gained 1.5%. Worries over tensions in the Middle East still are casting a shadow, having pushed oil prices sharply higher as the world waits to see how Israel will respond to an Oct. 1 missile attack by Iran. But U.S. benchmark crude oil slipped 19 cents to $74.19 per barrel early Monday, while Brent crude, the international standard, lost 29 cents to $77.76 per barrel. Treasury yields soared Friday after the U.S. government said employers added 254,000 more jobs to their payrolls last month than they cut. That was an acceleration from August’s hiring pace of 159,000 and blew past economists’ forecasts. Recent encouraging data on the economy have raised hopes that the job market will hold up after the Fed pressed the brakes on the economy through higher rates in order to stamp out high inflation. The Fed has begun cutting interest rates and Friday’s jobs report was so strong traders are now forecasting it will not deliver another half-point interest rate cut before the end of the year after doing so in September. In other dealings early Monday, the euro was unchanged at $1.0967.	https://apnews.com/article/stocks-markets-rates-japan-oil-24925e5840a2491fbc1acc07543bc37d	2024-10-06T19:43:36-07:00	
Gaza is in ruins after Israel's yearlong offensive. Rebuilding may take decades	The Gaza Strip is in ruins. There are hills of rubble where apartment blocks stood, and pools of sewage-tainted water spreading disease. City streets have been churned into dirt canyons and, in many places, the air is filled with the stench of unrecovered corpses. Israel’s yearlong offensive against Hamas, one of the deadliest and most destructive in recent history, has killed more than 41,000 people, a little over half of them women and children, according to local health officials. With no end in sight to the war and no plan for the day after, it is impossible to say when – or even if – anything will be rebuilt. Even after the fighting stops, hundreds of thousands of people could be stuck living in squalid tent camps for years. Experts say reconstruction could take decades. 'This war is destruction and misery. It would make the stones cry out,' said Shifaa Hejjo, a 60-year-old housewife living in a tent pitched on land where her home once stood. 'Whoever sees Gaza ... It will make them cry.' Israel blames the destruction on Hamas. Its Oct. 7 attack on Israel — in which some 1,200 people were killed and around 250 taken hostage — ignited the war. Israel says Hamas embedded much of its military infrastructure, including hundreds of kilometers (miles) of tunnels, in densely populated areas where some of the heaviest battles were fought. The fighting left roughly a quarter of all structures in Gaza destroyed or severely damaged, according to a U.N. assessment in September based on satellite footage. It said around 66% of structures, including more than 227,000 housing units, had sustained at least some damage. If there's a cease-fire, around half of all families 'have nowhere to go back to,' said Alison Ely, a Gaza-based coordinator with the Shelter Cluster, an international coalition of aid providers led by the Norwegian Refugee Council. The devastation in Gaza rivals front-line towns in Ukraine Almost as many buildings have been destroyed or damaged in Gaza as in all of Ukraine after its first two years of war with Russia, according to Corey Scher and Jamon Van Den Hoek, U.S.-based researchers who use satellite radar to document the wars' devastation. To put that into perspective: Gaza is less than half the size of Ukraine's capital, Kyiv. The amount of destruction in central and southern Gaza alone, Scher said, is roughly equivalent to what was lost in the front-line town of Bakhmut, the scene of one of the deadliest battles in the Ukraine war and where Russian forces destroyed nearly every building in their path to force Ukrainian troops to withdraw. The destruction in northern Gaza is even worse, he said. Gaza’s water and sanitation system has collapsed. More than 80% of its health facilities — and even more of its roads — are damaged or destroyed. 'I can’t think of any parallel, in terms of the severity of damage, for an enclave or a country or a people,' Scher said. At the end of January, the World Bank estimated $18.5 billion of damage — nearly the combined economic output of the West Bank and Gaza in 2022. That was before some intensely destructive Israeli ground operations, including in the southern border city of Rafah. ’I couldn’t tell where people’s homes were’ When Israeli ground forces pushed into the southern city of Khan Younis in January, Shifaa Hejjo and her family fled their four-story home with only the clothes they were wearing. They spent months in various tent camps before she decided to return – and the sight brought her to tears. Her entire neighborhood had been destroyed, her former home and the roads leading to it lost in a sea of rubble. 'I didn’t recognize it,' she said. 'I couldn’t tell where people’s homes were.' Around 90% of Gaza’s 2.3 million people have been displaced by the war, often multiple times, according to U.N. estimates. Hundreds of thousands have crowded into sprawling tent camps near the coast with no electricity, running water or toilets. Hunger is widespread. Hejjo lived in a tent in the courtyard of a hospital. Before that, she was in Muwasi, the main tent camp in southern Gaza. 'It smelled bad,' she said. 'There were diseases spreading.' She said her husband, who was suffering from liver disease, was broken-hearted when he heard their home had been destroyed and he died shortly thereafter. She was among the first to return after Israeli forces withdrew in April. Her neighbors stayed away, fearful they would find bodies or unexploded bombs. But for her it was still home. 'It is better to live in my home, where I lived for 37 years, even though it is destroyed,' she said. Hejjo and her children dug through the rubble with shovels and their bare hands, going brick by brick and saving whatever could be reused. Torn clothes were used to feed cooking fires. Rats had crept in, and swarms of mosquitoes hovered over the ruins. There was broken glass everywhere. They set up a tent fortified by corrugated metal sheeting and some bricks salvaged from her destroyed home. A light drizzle wet their clothes as they slept. U.N. agencies say unemployment has soared to around 80% — up from nearly 50% before the war — and that almost the entire population is living in poverty. Even those with means would find it nearly impossible to import construction materials because of Israeli restrictions, ongoing fighting and the breakdown of law and order. There are mountains of rubble, little water and no electricity The first obstacle to any significant rebuilding is the rubble – mountains of it. Where houses, shops and office buildings once stood, there are now giant drifts of rubble laced with human remains, hazardous substances and unexploded munitions. The U.N. estimates the war has left some 40 million tons of debris and rubble in Gaza, enough to fill New York’s Central Park to a depth of eight meters (about 25 feet). It could take up to 15 years and nearly $650 million to clear it all away, it said. There’s also the question of where to dispose of it: The U.N. estimates about five square kilometers (about two square miles) of land would be needed, which will be hard to come by in the small and densely populated territory. It isn’t just homes that were destroyed, but also critical infrastructure. The U.N. estimates nearly 70% of Gaza’s water and sanitation plants have been destroyed or damaged. That includes all five of the territory’s wastewater treatment facilities, plus desalination plants, sewage pumping stations, wells and reservoirs. The employees who once managed municipal water and waste systems have been displaced, and some killed. And fuel shortages have made it difficult to keep operating facilities that are still intact. The international charity Oxfam said it applied in December for a permit to bring in desalination units, and pipes to repair water infrastructure. It took three months for Israel to approve the shipment, but it still has not entered Gaza, Oxfam said. The destruction of sewage networks has left streets flooded with putrid water, hastening the spread of disease. There has been no central power in Gaza since the opening days of the war, when its sole power plant was forced to shut down for lack of fuel, and more than half of the territory's electrical grid has been destroyed, according to the World Bank. Can Gaza be rebuilt? Wealthy Arab countries like Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have said they are only willing to contribute to Gaza’s reconstruction as part of a postwar settlement that creates a path to a Palestinian state. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has ruled that out, saying he won’t allow Hamas or even the Western-backed Palestinian Authority to govern Gaza. He has said Israel will maintain open-ended security control and delegate civilian affairs to local Palestinians. But none are known to have volunteered, and Hamas has threatened to kill anyone who aids the occupation. Rebuilding Gaza would also require the import of massive amounts of construction supplies and heavy equipment, which Israel is unlikely to allow as long as there’s a potential for Hamas to rebuild its militant infrastructure. In any case, Gaza has only a small number of crossings with limited capacity. The Israeli military body that coordinates civilian affairs in Gaza says it does not restrict the entry of civilian supplies and allows so-called dual-use items that could also be used for military purposes. Israel allowed some construction materials in before the war under what was known as the Gaza Reconstruction Mechanism, but it was subject to heavy restrictions and delays. The Shelter Cluster estimates that it would take 40 years to rebuild all of Gaza’s destroyed homes under that setup. For now, aid providers are struggling just to bring in enough basic tents because of the limited number of trucks going into Gaza and the challenges of delivering aid. Efforts to bring in more robust temporary housing are still in the early stages, and no one has even tried to bring in construction materials, according to Ely. In September, the Shelter Cluster estimated 900,000 people were still in need of tents, bedding and other items to prepare for the region's typically cold and rainy winters. ___ El Deeb reported from Beirut. ___ Follow AP’s coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/mideast-wars	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-anniversary-palestinians-gaza-destruction-6b41ad9f64887228e90793705dd379a7	2024-10-06T19:27:05-07:00	
A year after the Hamas attack shattered this Israeli community, going home still feels impossible	KFAR AZA, Israel (AP) — On a sun-dappled day in Kibbutz Kfar Aza, Liora Eilon stood at the spot where her son was killed. She stooped to pick a figurine from the pile of belongings scattered around an abandoned home nearby. 'Every time we come here, Tal leaves us a little message,' the 71-year-old said, turning over the plastic soldier in her hands. It has been a year since Hamas militants stormed into this community within sight of the border fence surrounding Gaza. Eilon's 46-year-old son, Tal, who was the Kfar Aza civilian defense commander, was killed in the early moments of the attack, as he ran to the kibbutz armory to grab a weapon. Now living in a university dormitory in Israel’s north, Liora Eilon wonders if she’ll ever return home to this place, seared into Israeli history for that day of mass death, when the militants killed some 1,200 people in southern communities and took about 250 others hostage. The attack sparked an ongoing Israeli campaign in Gaza that has killed more than 41,600 Palestinians and laid waste to much of the territory. 'How can I trust the government who abandoned me here, who betrayed me, promised me that my family was safe here?' she said. 'The government wants us to go back to Kfar Aza, but I need more to feel safe.' Only about 50 of Kfar Aza’s 1,000 residents have returned. They live among the skeletons of houses burned by explosives, riddled with bullet holes or reduced to rubble by tank shells during the battle that raged for days. The others are scattered in dorms and hotels further north. The Associated Press spoke to a dozen residents who shared feelings of extreme vulnerability to future attack and deep misgivings about Israel’s military and government, and the Palestinians on the other side of the fence. Some wondered whether such a scarred place could ever be lived in at all. 'Are we going to live inside a memorial? Are we going to see a plaque every few meters, he was killed here and he was killed here?' asked Zohar Shpack, 58, who has returned and serves in the civilian defense squad. 'I don’t know yet.' ‘It’s still the seventh of October’ The seasons have spun by since Oct. 7. Relatively untended, Kfar Aza’s orchards have borne new fruit. With few to harvest, soldiers guarding the community have their pick from loads of fresh avocadoes. The land still holds traces of the day. On trees hung with fresh pomegranates, some of last year’s fruit remains, charred and black like used grenades. Gardener Rafael Friedman says he still finds teeth and bones in the soil when he rakes back the overgrowth — likely remnants of Hamas militants killed in the fighting. Kfar Aza has always been a close-knit place. It takes just 15 minutes to walk from one end to the other, past neighborhoods, orchards and a soccer pitch. Many residents grew up here and raised families alongside each other. Now photos of slain young people, couples killed together and hostages are posted everywhere. During the day, former residents like Eilon guide tours, hold memorials and see familiar faces. When night falls, most disappear to hotel rooms to the north. Every Friday, survivors gather on Shachar Schnorman’s porch for dinner, filling the kibbutz with the rare sound of laughter. 'It’s the only place where people can talk about the seventh and all the people at the table understand exactly what they are talking about,' Schnorman said. 'We do whatever we can to try to build community, to try to show ... that people can live here,' he said. The government says it will rebuild. Meanwhile, it's constructing pre-fabricated houses for residents in another kibbutz, Ruhama, about 15 kilometers (10 miles) away. After two years there, they say authorities want them to return to Kfar Aza. About two-thirds of the community plan to move into the temporary housing. On a recent tour, some enthusiastically examined the box-like structures. It’s a chance, they said, to live together and rebuild on the southern land they’re accustomed to. But some weren’t convinced Kfar Aza will be rebuilt and not sure they’d ever feel safe returning. They want to know why it took so many hours before soldiers arrived at the kibbutz. The military has launched an investigation into what happened, but has not yet released its results. An investigation into the military’s failures at neighboring Kibbutz Be’eri found a 'lack of command and control, a lack of coordination and a lack of order' among the units that fought there. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government has brushed off calls for accountability, saying it will investigate at war’s end. Simona Steinbrecher feels too frozen in time to make a decision now about whether to return. Her daughter, Doron, a veterinary nurse who spent her girlhood in Kfar Aza, was dragged by militants into Gaza on Oct. 7. She is among 66 Israelis still held captive. Hamas is believed to hold the bodies of 35 others. The 65-year-old Steinbrecher last saw her daughter in a Hamas propaganda video. Doron’s skin was pale, her voice weak. 'Without Doron, it’s still the seventh of October,' her mother said. 'And we won’t go home until she’s home.' The military command structure collapsed when it was needed most Hostage families and many residents of southern communities are boycotting the government’s ceremony commemorating Oct. 7. To them, as long as it fails to bring hostages home and refuses to investigate and take responsibility for its mistakes, it has blood on its hands. Instead, residents of Kfar Aza will hold a small tribute and lower the kibbutz flag to half-mast. Residents said they have nothing but admiration for the troops who fought that day. But they are furious at the military higher-ups, blaming them for a command structure that collapsed when the kibbutz needed it most. When she recounts the day, Eilon is gripped with fury and astonishment — over 35 hours of horror her family endured and the military’s response. When the sirens began blaring that Saturday morning, Eilon thought it would take the army minutes to arrive, she told the AP as she toured the bullet-riddled remnants of her home. It took hours. Her family scrambled into their safe room. A son and daughter muscled the door shut against gunmen trying to get inside. Granddaughters, Gali and Mika, hid under the bed. Eilon got a message saying Tal had gone out to fight. The five huddled in the saferoom, hearing the attackers’ shouts and gunfire, not knowing whether Tal was dead or alive. Israeli troops finally gained control of their house, and Eilon said she saw how scared and confused the young soldiers looked. Gali shared with them desperate texts from her friends across the kibbutz trying to escape the rampage. 'She became a 15-year-old commander of an IDF elite unit,' said Eilon, using the acronym for the Israeli military. Still, the troops didn’t evacuate the family. It was only on Sunday afternoon, as militants were hiding out in the house again, that soldiers hustled them out. As she ran into her backyard, Eilon saw a tank swivel its cannon at her house. It fired, collapsing her home on the militants inside. Soon after being rescued, Eilon learned Tal was dead. 'I’d known it all along,' she said. 'But some part of me was hoping that he was injured, that he was unconscious in some hospital.' ‘They could have saved them’ As the battle still raged, some residents were evacuated early and sped away in army jeeps. Hanan Dann, a young father, recounted passing a cluster of soldiers at a gas station just outside the kibbutz, who looked like they were waiting for orders. 'I wanted to say, there’s fighting inside still, there’re people dying,' he said. 'They could have saved them.' Soldiers and militants fought in Kfar Aza for days. By the end, militants had killed 64 civilians and 22 soldiers and dragged 19 hostages into Gaza. Nearby, in the recesses of the Negev desert, stands a decrepit water tower. It’s a remnant of Be’erot Yitzhak, a kibbutz abandoned after a deadly 1948 Egyptian attack during the war that led to Israel’s creation. 'Will that be what Kfar Aza looks like 10 years from now?' asked Dann. 'Just a stop on the highway I can point out to my kids?' Even those who want to reinhabit it know Kfar Aza will never be the same. Shpack, the civilian guard member, said he understands why no one would bring a child here now, pointing to the border fence. Every few minutes, an Israeli warplane drops a bomb on Gaza, puncturing the kibbutz's silence with a loud boom. 'And even once the bombs end, how can you raise him here?' Shpack asked. 'How do you explain what happened here?' For some, the kibbutz’s fate is tied to Gaza. Some want Israel to take a hard line in the future. Marcus Scharfstein, 29, who lives in the kibbutz, said he won’t feel completely safe until Israel reestablishes Jewish settlements in Gaza. Israel unilaterally withdrew its soldiers and some 8,000 Jewish settlers from Gaza in 2005. 'If I will know that in Gaza right now, there are 10, 20 villages of Jewish people,' he said, 'I will feel in control again,' adding he did not feel that way before the Oct. 7 attack. But others say as long as there is no peace agreement with Palestinians, they will again be on the front lines of another Oct. 7. Some of Gaza's Palestinians once lived in these same arid reaches of what is now southern Israel. Almost no trace is left of their villages after Israeli troops drove them out during the 1948 war. 'We’ve tried war enough times and it never led to anything good,' Eilon said. She wants a new government that will talk to the Palestinians to find 'some arrangement for us to live together on the same land.' 'I’m dreaming for the day with an open fence from here to the sea, with two people living together.' ___ Find more coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/mideast-wars	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-gaza-war-kibbutz-attack-anniversary-344b289751d8ee80d4909f15864f508c	2024-10-06T19:21:49-07:00	
US court to review civil rights lawsuit alleging environmental racism in a Louisiana parish	NEW ORLEANS (AP) — A federal appellate court is set to hear oral arguments Monday in a civil rights lawsuit alleging a south Louisiana parish engaged in racist land-use policies to place polluting industries in majority-Black communities. The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans is reviewing a lawsuit filed by community groups claiming St. James Parish 'intentionally discriminated against Black residents' by encouraging industrial facilities to be built in areas with predominantly Black populations 'while explicitly sparing White residents from the risk of environmental harm.' The groups, Inclusive Louisiana, Rise St. James and Mt. Triumph Baptist Church, seek a halt to future industrial development in the parish. The plaintiffs note that 20 of the 24 industrial facilities were in two sections of the parish with majority-Black populations when they filed the complaint in March 2023. The parish is located along a heavily industrialized stretch of the Mississippi River between New Orleans and Baton Rouge, Louisiana, known as the Chemical Corridor, often referred to by environmental groups as 'Cancer Alley' because of the high levels of suspected cancer-causing pollution emitted there. The lawsuit comes as the federal government has taken steps during the Biden administration to address the legacy of environmental racism. Federal officials have written stricter environmental protections and committed tens of billions of dollars in funding. In the Louisiana case, U.S. District Judge Carl Barbier of the Eastern District of Louisiana in November 2023 dismissed the lawsuit largely on procedural grounds, ruling the plaintiffs had filed their complaint too late. But he added, 'this Court cannot say that their claims lack a basis in fact or rely on a meritless legal theory.' Barbier said the lawsuit hinged primarily on the parish's 2014 land-use plan, which generally shielded white neighborhoods from industrial development and left majority-Black neighborhoods, schools and churches without the same protections. The plan also described largely Black sections of the parish as 'future industrial' sites. The plaintiffs missed the legal window to sue the parish, the judge ruled. Yet the parish's land-use plan is just one piece of evidence among many revealing ongoing discrimination against Black residents in the parish, said Pamela Spees, a lawyer for the Center of Constitutional Rights representing the plaintiffs. They are challenging Barbier's ruling under the 'continuing violations' doctrine on the grounds that discriminatory parish governance persists, allowing for industrial expansion in primarily Black areas. The lawsuit highlights the parish's decision in August 2022 to impose a moratorium on large solar complexes after a proposed 3,900-acre (1,580-hectare) solar project upset residents of the mostly white neighborhood of Vacherie, who expressed concerns about lowering property values and debris from storms. The parish did not take up a request for a moratorium on heavy industrial expansion raised by the plaintiffs, the lawsuit states. These community members 'have tried at every turn to simply have their humanity and dignity be seen and acknowledged,' Spees said. 'That’s just been completely disregarded by the local government and has been for generations.' Another part of the complaint argues the parish failed to identify and protect the likely hundreds of burial sites of enslaved people by allowing industrial facilities to build on and limit access to the areas, preventing the descendants of slaves from memorializing the sites. The federal judge tossed out that part of the lawsuit, noting the sites were on private property not owned by the parish. At its core, the complaint alleges civil rights violations under the 13th and 14th amendments, stating the land-use system in the parish allowing for industrial buildout primarily in majority-Black communities remains shaped by the history of slavery, white supremacy and Jim Crow laws and governance. Lawyers for St. James Parish said the lawsuit employed overreaching claims and 'inflammatory rhetoric.' St. James Parish did not respond to a request for comment. 'The Civil War ain’t never been over,' said lifelong St. James Parish resident Gail LeBoeuf, 72, a plaintiff in the case who co-founded the local environmental justice organization Inclusive Louisiana. 'They’re trying to destroy the Black people in this country in any way they can.' LeBoeuf, who lives 1 mile (1.6 kilometers) from an alumina plant, was diagnosed with cancer in 2022 and blames her illness on the high levels of industrial pollution she has been exposed to for decades. She acknowledges the link cannot be proven but counters there is no way to prove industrial pollution was not the reason. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency found in a 2003 report that St. James Parish ranked higher than the national average for certain cancer deaths. In August, a federal judge barred the EPA from using the Civil Rights Act to fight industrial pollution alleged to have disproportionately affected minority communities in Louisiana. Besides a moratorium on industrial expansion in the parish, LeBoeuf's organization calls for real-time air monitoring of pollution and buffer zones around residential areas. Community groups have battled for years against plans by Taiwanese company Formosa to build a $9.4 billion plastics plant near a predominantly Black town in the parish. LeBoeuf and other prominent, local environmental activists met with White House officials in September to discuss the Biden administration's progress in responding to concerns raised by United Nations human rights experts over industrial expansion in the Chemical Corridor. LeBoeuf said she had rescheduled a doctor's appointment to meet with White House officials. She believes her advocacy for environmental justice is just as important a cure for her community as her ongoing chemotherapy treatment is for her body. 'Both are medicine,' LeBoeuf said. 'Fighting is medicine.' ___ Jack Brook is a corps member for The Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

In Mexico, the mayor of a state capital has been killed less than 1 week after he took office	MEXICO CITY (AP) — The mayor of a state capital in southern Mexico has been killed just one week after he took office, officials said Sunday. Alejandro Arcos was sworn in last Monday as mayor of Chilpancingo, a city so violent that a drug gang openly staged a demonstration, hijacked a government armored car and took police hostage in 2023 to win the release of arrested suspects. Chilpancingo is the capital of Guerrero state, where Acapulco is located. The state prosecutors’ office issued a statement Sunday confirming Arcos had been killed, but provided no details. Alejandro Moreno, the national leader of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, lamented Arcos' killing and said the newly installed secretary of the city council had also been murdered three days earlier. 'They had been in office less than a week,' Moreno wrote on his social media accounts. 'They were young and honest public servants who were seeking progress for their community.' Chilpancingo has long been the scene of bloody turf battles between two drug gangs, the Ardillos and the Tlacos. The battle has resulted in dozens of gruesome slayings and some high-profile scandals. A previous mayor was caught on video apparently holding a meeting with leaders of one of the gangs at a restaurant. She was subsequently expelled from her party. In July 2023, federal officials said a demonstration held by hundreds of people in Chilpancingo that month had been organized by the Ardillos gang to win the release of two gang leaders arrested for drugs and weapons possession. The demonstrators largely blocked all traffic on the highway between Mexico City and Acapulco for two days, battled security forces and commandeered a police armored truck and used it to ram down the gates of the state legislature building. The demonstrators abducted 10 members of the state police and National Guard, as well as three state and federal officials, and held them hostage to enforce their demands before releasing them.	https://apnews.com/article/mexico-guerrero-chilpancingo-mayor-killed-cartels-263349ff58e7bc5fd6b3c5ca9bdd4302	2024-10-06T19:13:48-07:00	
US spends a record $17.9 billion on military aid to Israel since last Oct. 7	WASHINGTON (AP) — The United States has spent a record of at least $17.9 billion on military aid to Israel since the war in Gaza began and led to escalating conflict around the Middle East, according to a report for Brown University's Costs of War project, released on the anniversary of Hamas’ attacks on Israel. An additional $4.86 billion has gone into stepped-up U.S. military operations in the region since the Oct. 7, 2023, attacks, researchers said in findings first provided to The Associated Press. That includes the costs of a Navy-led campaign to quell strikes on commercial shipping by Yemen's Houthis, who are carrying them out in solidarity with the fellow Iranian-backed group Hamas. The report — completed before Israel opened a second front, this one against Iranian-backed Hezbollah militants in Lebanon, in late September — is one of the first tallies of estimated U.S. costs as the Biden administration backs Israel in its conflicts in Gaza and Lebanon and seeks to contain hostilities by Iran-allied armed groups in the region. The financial toll is on top of the cost in human lives: Hamas militants killed more than 1,200 people in Israel a year ago and took others hostage. Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed nearly 42,000 people in Gaza, according to the territory's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in its count. At least 1,400 people in Lebanon, including Hezbollah fighters and civilians, have been killed since Israel greatly expanded its strikes in that country in late September. The financial costs were calculated by Linda J. Bilmes, a professor at Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government, who has assessed the full costs of U.S. wars since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, and fellow researchers William D. Hartung and Stephen Semler. Here's a look at where some of the U.S. taxpayer money went: Record military aid to Israel Israel — a protege of the United States since its 1948 founding — is the biggest recipient of U.S. military aid in history, getting $251.2 billion in inflation-adjusted dollars since 1959, the report says. Even so, the $17.9 billion spent since Oct. 7, 2023, in inflation-adjusted dollars, is by far the most military aid sent to Israel in one year. The U.S. committed to providing billions in military assistance to Israel and Egypt each year when they signed their 1979 U.S.-brokered peace treaty, and an agreement since the Obama administration set the annual amount for Israel at $3.8 billion through 2028. The U.S. aid since the Gaza war started includes military financing, arms sales, at least $4.4 billion in drawdowns from U.S. stockpiles and hand-me-downs of used equipment. Much of the U.S. weapons delivered in the year were munitions, from artillery shells to 2,000-pound bunker-busters and precision-guided bombs. Expenditures range from $4 billion to replenish Israel's Iron Dome and David’s Sling missile defense systems to cash for rifles and jet fuel, the study says. Unlike the United States' publicly documented military aid to Ukraine, it was impossible to get the full details of what the U.S. has shipped Israel since last Oct. 7, so the $17.9 billion for the year is a partial figure, the researchers said. They cited Biden administration 'efforts to hide the full amounts of aid and types of systems through bureaucratic maneuvering.' Funding for the key U.S. ally during a war that has exacted a heavy toll on civilians has divided Americans during the presidential campaign. But support for Israel has long carried weight in U.S. politics, and Biden said Friday that 'no administration has helped Israel more than I have.' U.S. military operations in the Middle East The Biden administration has bolstered its military strength in the region since the war in Gaza started, aiming to deter and respond to any attacks on Israeli and American forces. Those additional operations cost at least $4.86 billion, the report said, not including beefed-up U.S. military aid to Egypt and other partners in the region. The U.S. had 34,000 forces in the Middle East the day that Hamas broke through Israeli barricades around Gaza to attack. That number rose to about 50,000 in August when two aircraft carriers were in the region, aiming to discourage retaliation after a strike attributed to Israel killed Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Iran. The total is now around 43,000. The number of U.S. vessels and aircraft deployed — aircraft carrier strike groups, an amphibious ready group, fighter squadrons, and air defense batteries — in the Mediterranean, Red Sea and Gulf of Aden has varied during the year. The Pentagon has said another aircraft carrier strike group is headed to Europe very soon and that could increase the troop total again if two carriers are again in the region at the same time. The fight against the Houthis The U.S. military has deployed since the start of the war to try to counter escalated strikes by the Houthis, an armed faction that controls Yemen's capital and northern areas, and has been firing on merchant ships in the Red Sea in solidarity with Gaza. The researchers called the $4.86 billion cost to the U.S. an 'unexpectedly complicated and asymmetrically expensive challenge.' Houthis have kept launching attacks on ships traversing the critical trade route, drawing U.S. strikes on launch sites and other targets. The campaign has become the most intense running sea battle the Navy has faced since World War II. 'The U.S. has deployed multiple aircraft carriers, destroyers, cruisers and expensive multimillion-dollar missiles against cheap Iranian-made Houthi drones that cost $2,000,' the authors said. Just Friday, the U.S. military struck more than a dozen Houthi targets in Yemen, going after weapons systems, bases and other equipment, officials said. The researchers' calculations included at least $55 million in additional combat pay from the intensified operations in the region.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-us-military-spending-8e6e5033f7a1334bf6e35f86e7040e14	2024-10-06T19:09:45-07:00	
For US adversaries, Election Day won't mean the end to efforts to influence Americans	WASHINGTON (AP) — Soon, the ballots will be cast, the polls will close and a campaign marked by assassination attempts, animosity and anxiety will come to an end. But for U.S. adversaries, the work to meddle with American democracy may be entering its most critical phase. Despite all the attention on efforts to spread disinformation in the months before the Nov. 5 election, the hours and days immediately after voting ends could offer foreign adversaries like Russia, Iran and China or domestic extremist groups the best chance to mess with America's decision. That's when Americans will go online to see the latest results or share their opinions as the votes are tabulated. And that's when a fuzzy photo or AI-generated video of supposed vote tampering could do its most damage, potentially transforming online outrage into real-world action before authorities have time to investigate the facts. It's a threat taken seriously by intelligence analysts, elected officials and tech executives, who say that while there's already been a steady buildup of disinformation and influence operations, the worst may be yet to come. 'It's not like at the end of election night, particularly assuming how close this election will be, that this will be over,' said Sen. Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat who chairs the Senate Intelligence Committee. 'One of my greatest concerns is the level of misinformation, disinformation that may come from our adversaries after the polls close could actually be as significant as anything that happens up to the closing of the polls.' Analysts are blunter, warning that a particularly effective piece of disinformation could be devastating to public confidence in the election if spread in the hours after the polls close, and if the group behind the campaign knows to target a particularly important swing state or voting bloc. Possible scenarios include out-of-context footage of election workers repurposed to show supposed fraud, a deepfake video of a presidential candidate admitting to cheating or a robocall directed at non-English speakers warning them not to vote. When a false or misleading claim circulates weeks before the election, there's time for local election officials, law enforcement or news organizations to gather the facts, correct any falsehoods and get the word out. But if someone spreads a deceptive video or photo designed to make a big chunk of the electorate distrust the results the day after the election, it can be hard or even impossible for the truth to catch up. It happened four years ago, when a drumbeat of lies about the 2020 results spurred the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. Often, those arrested on accusations of trying to interfere with the transfer of power have cited debunked election fraud narratives that circulated shortly after Election Day. An especially close election decided in a handful of swing states could heighten that risk even further, making it more likely that a rumor about suitcases of illegal ballots in Georgia, to cite an example from 2020, could have a big impact on perceptions. President Joe Biden's victory over Donald Trump in 2020 wasn't especially close, and no irregularities big enough to affect the result were found — and yet false claims about vote-rigging were still widely believed by many supporters of the Republican, who's running for president again. The relatively long run-up to Inauguration Day on Jan. 20 gives those looking to sow doubt about the results ample time to do so, whether they are propaganda agencies in Moscow or extremist groups in the U.S. like the Proud Boys. Ryan LaSalle, CEO of the cybersecurity firm Nisos, said he won't feel relief until a new president is sworn in without any serious problems. 'The time to stay most focused is right now through the peaceful transfer of power,' LaSalle said. 'That’s when real-life activities could happen, and that’s when they would have the greatest chance of having an impact on that peaceful transfer.' Another risk, according to officials and tech companies, is that Russia or another adversary would try to hack into a local or state election system — not necessarily to change votes, but as a way of making voters question the security of the system. 'The most perilous time I think will come 48 hours before the election,' Microsoft President Brad Smith told lawmakers on the Senate Intelligence Committee last month. The hearing focused on American tech companies’ efforts to safeguard the election from foreign disinformation and cyberattacks. Election disinformation first emerged as a potent threat in 2016, when Russia hacked into the campaign of Democrat Hillary Clinton and created networks of fake social media accounts to pump out disinformation. The threat has only grown as social media has become a leading source of information and news for many voters. Content designed to divide Americans and make them mistrust their own institutions is no longer tied only to election seasons. Intelligence officials say Russia, China and other countries will only expand their use of online disinformation and propaganda going forward, a long-range strategy that looks beyond any one election or candidate. Despite the challenges, election security officials are quick to reassure Americans that the U.S. election system is impervious to any attack that could alter the outcome of the vote. While influence operations may seek to spread distrust about the results, improvements to the system make it stronger than ever when it comes to efforts to change votes. 'Malicious actors, even if they tried, could not have an impact at scale such that there would be a material effect on the outcome of the election,' Jen Easterly, director of the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, told The Associated Press.	https://apnews.com/article/election-interference-trump-harris-russia-china-efff7f7fcbc71032b1152d011c953eba	2024-10-06T19:04:50-07:00	
Tilda Swinton explores assisted suicide in Pedro Almodovar’s 'The Room Next Door'	TORONTO (AP) — Although 'The Room Next Door' is Pedro Almodóvar’s first English-language feature, Tilda Swinton notes that he’s never written in a language that anyone else truly speaks. 'He writes in Pedro language, and here he is making another film in another version of Pedro language, which just happens to sound a little bit like English,' Swinton said. Set in New York, Swinton stars as Martha, a terminally ill woman who chooses to end her life on her own terms. After reconnecting with her friend Ingrid, played by Julianne Moore, Martha persuades her to stay and keep her company before she goes through with her decision. Beyond the film’s narrative, Swinton said she believes individuals should have a say in their own living and dying. She acknowledges that she has personally witnessed a friend’s compassionate departure. 'In my own life I had the great good fortune to be asked by someone in Martha’s position to be his Ingrid (Julianne Moore),' Swinton said. She said that experience shaped her attitude about life and death: 'Not only my capacity to be witness to other people in that situation, but my own living and my own dying.' Swinton spoke to The Associated Press about 'The Room Next Door,' Almodóvar and he idea of letting people die on their own terms. Remarks have been edited for clarity and brevity. AP: Tackling that role, what was the challenge to get into the character? SWINTON: I felt really blessed by the opportunity. So many of us have been in the situation Julianne Moore’s character finds herself in, being asked to be the witness of someone who is dying. Whether that wanting to orchestrate their own dismount or not, to be in that position to be a witness is something that I’ve been privileged to experience many times in my life since I was quite young. AP: Many people experience watching terminally ill family members, can this film help them? SWINTON: It’s a really beautiful poem to a possibility of an attitude. I think (my character) Martha’s attitude to her own living is really inspiring. I would like to think that this is a really generous proposal and that it might inspire people to just know that it’s possible to face their own death with dignity, which is really what we’re talking about. It really is a fool’s errand to think we can avoid thinking about death because it’s not just unlucky people who get ill or who die. It’s an inevitability. And so we might as well, you know, embrace it. And by the way, the more we embrace it, I would suggest the more we will enjoy our living. AP: Your character goes to great extents to alleviate the criminality. Do you think that also shows that that perhaps that there is a place in a society for assisted suicide? SWINTON: There are many countries in the world where it is not criminal to assist somebody’s active will to orchestrate their own dying. And in the United States, there are 10 states where it is not criminal, where it’s possible for two doctors to assist in the active will of a patient to take charge of their own dying. And it’s there are just other places where and New York State, which is where our film is set, is not one of those 10 states. And there are all sorts of people, very wise and very compassionate people, very educated and very enlightened people, in my view, who are actively campaigning to broaden this acceptance. AP: You’ve worked with lots of great directors in your career, what was the adjustment to working with Pedro? SWINTON: I’d had a taste of it with short film, 'The Human Voice.' We made it in the middle of COVID. We shot it in nine days. Super, super fast… And I thought that Pedro was working very fast because it was a short film and because we were in the middle of COVID. No, no, that is the way Pedro works. I now discover super, super fast two takes, if you’re lucky. AP: Does his style put your performance on an organic path? SWINTON: I mean, it really helps always when you know the work of a filmmaker as well as it’s possible to know Pedro’s work. I’ve known it since I was a student, and I’ve loved it always. It’s like a country. I love to go to the world of Almodóvar and it’s not Spain, it’s somewhere else. It’s his environment. So, stepping into the frame of a filmmaker who creates that environment is always a bit of a trip. AP: At Venice, the film resonated with audiences with a very long standing ovation. How validating was that? SWINTON: It’s still a bit of a shock to us. When you’re in an audience, that’s the first indication of whether the souffle has risen or not. Apparently 18-and-a-half minutes is a record when you’re standing next to Pedro Almodóvar and you know that that is 18-and-a-half minutes of people really lovingly appreciating him. It pretty much doesn’t get much better than that. AP: Is awards season something that you look at when you’re doing a film like this? When you hear the buzz, is that something that’s ever on your mind? SWINTON: Not mine. To be honest, I’m ignorant really, of that in particular. I have other things on my mind. That’s like the weather. It’s like saying, do you have the weather in three months on your mind? Well, no. Let’s wait and see. Let’s keep it real. Let’s keep it today.	https://apnews.com/article/tilda-swinton-room-next-door-interview-abc0620a794b0a77c5f61b9b7f985c6f	2024-10-06T19:04:27-07:00	
Israelis, scarred and battling on multiple fronts, mark a year since Hamas' Oct. 7 attack	RE'IM, Israel (AP) — Israelis were holding vigils and somber ceremonies on Monday to mark a year since the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack, the deadliest in the country’s history, which sparked the war in Gaza and scarred Israelis indelibly. The surprise cross-border attack, which caught Israel unprepared on a major Jewish holiday, shattered Israelis’ sense of security and shook their faith in their leaders and their military. Its aftershocks still ripple one year later. The war in Gaza rages on, Israel is fighting a new war against Hezbollah, which began attacking Israel on Oct. 8, and an escalating conflict with Iran — which backs both Hamas and Hezbollah — threatens to drag the region into a far more dangerous conflagration. In Gaza, which is still buckling under the weight of the ongoing war, no formal commemorative event is planned. The massive destruction and displacement are a constant reminder of the retaliatory Israeli assault on the territory, which has no end in sight. Israelis were expected to flock to ceremonies, cemeteries and memorial sites around the country, remembering the hundreds of victims, the dozens of hostages still in captivity and the soldiers wounded or killed trying to save them. At 6:30 a.m. — the exact hour Hamas launched its attack — the families of those killed at the Nova music festival, joined by Israeli President Isaac Herzog, gathered at the site where almost 400 revelers were gunned down and from where many others were taken hostage. After briefly playing the same trance music that was blared during the festival, hundreds of family members and friends of the victims stood for a moment of silence. One woman’s piercing wail broke the silence as booms echoed from the fighting in Gaza, just a few kilometers away. 'When we are here, we are near our loved ones, this is the time they danced and fled,' said Sigal Bar-On, whose niece, Yuval Bar-On, 25, and her fiancée Moshe Shuva, 34, were supposed to get married in December 2023. At 6:31 a.m., four projectiles were launched from Gaza toward the very Israeli communities that came under fierce assault last year, the Israeli military said. The ceremony was not disrupted. At that same time, the families of hostages still held in Gaza — about 100, a third of whom are said to be dead — gathered near Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Jerusalem residence and stood during a two-minute siren, replicating a custom from the the most solemn dates on the Israeli calendar, Holocaust Remembrance and Memorial Day. 'We are here to remind (the hostages) that we haven’t forgotten them,' said Shiri Albag, whose daughter Liri is among the captives. Her message to Netanyahu: 'We wont let you rest until all of them are back, every last one of them,' she told the crowd, which hoisted the faces of the hostages. An official state ceremony focusing on acts of bravery and hope is set to be aired on Monday evening. The ceremony was prerecorded without an audience — apparently to avoid potential disruptions — in the southern city of Ofakim, where over two dozen Israelis were killed. But anger at the government’s failure to prevent the attack and enduring frustration that it has not returned the remaining hostages prompted the families of those killed and taken captive to hold a separate event in Tel Aviv. That event had been set to draw tens of thousands of people but was scaled back drastically over prohibitions on large gatherings due to the threat of missile attacks from Iran and Hezbollah. Hamas’ attack, which killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and dragged some 250 into Gaza as hostages, continues to cast a shadow over daily life in Israel. Dozens of hostages remain in captivity, with no end in sight to their struggle. Border communities have been upended and tens of thousands were displaced. Soldiers are being killed in Gaza and Lebanon. Israel faces ongoing international criticism over its wartime conduct, with two world courts examining its actions. The war in Gaza has killed more than 41,000 Palestinians, displaced most of the territory's 2.3 million population and sparked a humanitarian crisis that has led to widespread hunger. It has also left the tiny coastal enclave ravaged beyond recognition as U.S.-led cease-fire efforts have repeatedly sputtered. ___ Goldenberg reported from Tel Aviv, Israel. ___ Follow AP's coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/mideast-wars	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-one-year-anniversary-cf123f95609051e8e8eaf6aebe661b6a	2024-10-06T18:35:39-07:00	
Samoa warns of 'highly probable' oil spill from New Zealand navy ship that sank and caught fire	WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — An oil spill is 'highly probable' from a grounded New Zealand navy ship which sank and caught fire off the coast of Samoa, the Pacific island nation's acting prime minister said late Sunday. Officials in Samoa are conducting an environmental impact assessment in the area where the ship sank on Sunday morning, acting Prime Minister Tuala Tevaga Iosefo Ponifasio said in a statement. All 75 people on board the HMNZS Manawanui were taken to safety on life rafts in 'challenging conditions' and darkness, New Zealand’s Chief of Navy Rear Admiral Garin Golding told reporters. The vessel was about a mile from shore when it grounded on a reef and began taking on water, but it took the first survivors five hours to reach land, he said. New Zealand will hold a court of inquiry into the loss of the ship, which was one of nine in its navy. The cause of the disaster is not known. The specialist dive and hydrographic vessel had been in service since 2019. It was surveying a reef off the coast of Upolu, Samoa’s most populous island, when it ran aground on the reef. Photos and videos taken from the shore appeared to show the ship listing before disappearing completely below the waves, with a large plume of smoke rising where it sank. Defense Minister Judith Collins said she did not expect the vessel could be salvaged. 'This is a ship that unfortunately is pretty much gone,' she told reporters. Those on board included civilian scientists and foreign military personnel, Golding said. Authorities in Samoa said some were treated for minor injuries. There was 'a lot of fuel' on the ship and efforts had turned to assessing the potential environmental impact, Collins told Radio New Zealand Monday. New Zealand 'would obviously have to front up' if there was a spill, she added. The state of New Zealand’s ageing military hardware has prompted warnings from the defense agency, which in a March report described the navy as 'extremely fragile,' with ships idle due to problems retaining the staff needed to service and maintain them. Golding said the HMNZS Manawanui underwent its usual maintenance before the deployment. The ship’s captain was an experienced commander who had worked on the vessel for two years, he said.	https://apnews.com/article/samoa-zealand-navy-ship-sank-fire-spill-47500555456f78dad18a958b95ab500c	2024-10-06T13:47:47-07:00	
A massive blast outside Karachi Airport in Pakistan kills 2 and injures at least 8	KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) — A massive blast outside Karachi Airport in Pakistan on Sunday killed two people and injured at least eight, officials said. Police and the provincial government said a tanker exploded outside the airport, which is Pakistan’s biggest. But the provincial home minister, Zia Ul Hassan, told local TV station Geo that it was an attack targeting foreigners. A Home Ministry official told The Associated Press that it was an attack on Chinese nationals, one of whom was injured. He spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to the media. Thousands of Chinese workers are in Pakistan, most of them involved in Beijing’s multibillion-dollar Belt and Road Initiative that connects south and central Asia with the Chinese capital. Videos showed flames engulfing cars and a thick column of smoke rising from the scene. There was a heavy military deployment at the site, which was cordoned off. Deputy Inspector General East Azfar Mahesar told media that it seemed like it was an oil tanker explosion. 'We are determining the nature and reasons for the blast. It takes time.' Police officers were among the injured, he added. The home minister and inspector general also visited the blast site, but they did not talk to the press. Rahat Hussain, who works in the civil aviation department, said the blast was so big that it shook the airport’s buildings.	https://apnews.com/article/pakistan-karachi-airport-blast-6b6387efa177af341f1a125bc802102c	2024-10-06T10:30:52-07:00	
Over 6,000 people in Haiti leave their homes after gang attack killed dozens	SAINT-MARC, Haiti (AP) — Nearly 6,300 people have fled their homes in the aftermath of an attack in central Haiti by heavily armed gang members that killed at least 70 people, according to the U.N.’s migration agency. Nearly 90% of the displaced are staying with relatives in host families, while 12% have found refuge in other sites including a school, the International Organization for Migration said in a report last week. The attack in Pont-Sondé happened in the early hours of Thursday morning, and many left in the middle of the night. Gang members 'came in shooting and breaking into the houses to steal and burn. I just had time to grab my children and run in the dark,' said 60-year-old Sonise Mirano on Sunday, who was camping with hundreds of people in a park in the nearby coastal city of Saint-Marc. Bodies lay strewn on the streets of Pont-Sondé following the attack in the Artibonite region, many of them killed by a shot to the head, Bertide Harace, spokeswoman for the Commission for Dialogue, Reconciliation and Awareness to Save the Artibonite, told Magik 9 radio station on Friday. Initial estimates put the number of those killed at 20 people, but activists and government officials discovered more bodies as they accessed areas of the town. Among the victims was a young mother, her newborn baby and a midwife, Herace said. Prime Minister Garry Conille vowed that the perpetrators would face the full force of the law in comments in Saint-Marc on Friday. 'It is necessary to arrest them, bring them to justice, and put them in prison. They need to pay for what they have done, and the victims need to receive restitution,' he said. The U.N. Human Rights Office of the Commissioner said in a statement that it was 'horrified by Thursday’s gang attacks.' The European Union also condemned the violence in a statement on Friday, which it said marked 'yet another escalation in the extreme violence these criminal groups are inflicting on the Haitian people.' Haiti’s government deployed an elite police unit based in the capital of Port-au-Prince to Pont-Sondé following the attack and sent medical supplies to help the area’s lone, and overwhelmed, hospital. Police will remain in the area for as long as it takes to guarantee safety, Conille said, adding that he didn’t know whether it would take a day or a month. He also appealed to the population, saying 'the police cannot do it alone.' Gang violence across Artibonite, which produces much of Haiti’s food, has increased in recent years. Since that uptick, Thursday’s attack is one of the biggest massacres. Similar ones have taken place in the capital of Port-au-Prince, 80% of which is controlled by gangs, and they typically are linked to turf wars, with gang members targeting civilians in areas controlled by rivals. Many neighborhoods are not safe, and people affected by the violence have not been able to return home, even if their houses have not been destroyed. More than 700,000 people — more than half of whom are children — are now internally displaced across Haiti, according to the International Organization for Migration in an Oct. 2 statement. That was an increase of 22% since June. Port-au-Prince hosts a quarter of the country’s displaced, often residing in overcrowded sites, with little to no access to basic services, the agency said. Those forced to flee their homes are mostly being accommodated by families, who have reported significant difficulties, including food shortages, overwhelmed healthcare facilities, and a lack of essential supplies on local markets, according to the agency. ___ Hughes reported from Rio de Janeiro.	https://apnews.com/article/haiti-gang-attack-displaced-un-d45cbcbe3258523291d3b36bbd4f30f5	2024-10-06T10:26:11-07:00	
Minnesota man arrested after allegedly threatening to 'shoot up' synagogue	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — A Minnesota man was arrested after allegedly threatening to 'shoot up' a Minneapolis synagogue, officials announced on Saturday. Staff at Temple Israel reported to the Minneapolis Police Department on Sept. 11 that they had received several phone calls from a person threatening to 'shoot up' the synagogue. Then on Thursday, a special police detail assigned provide extra patrols around Temple Israel ahead of the Jewish new year and the one-year anniversary of the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel were notified of a man outside with a firearm. He fled the area, but officers arrested a 21-year-old man the next day. 'Everyone in Minneapolis has the right to feel safe in their communities, and we will ensure our Jewish neighbors are protected as they celebrate the holy days,' Minneapolis Police Chief Brian Chief O’Hara said at a news conference. 'We take all threats made against our religious institutions seriously, and will continue to hold the individuals accountable who threaten any of our city’s houses of worship.' O'Hara said officers learned the man had used a phone app to mask his voice as he made repeated threats against the synagogue. Officers did not recover a gun. The man was arrested for making 'terroristic threats' and charges will be referred to the Hennepin County Attorney’s Office. O’Hara said officers had not found evidence the threat was motivated by antisemitism, but he said the timing of the threats was concerning. 'Since the Oct. 7 terrorist attacks, the worst terrorist attack on our Jewish community since the Holocaust, our police officers have been present where a whole lot of hateful rhetoric has been said against our residents, against members of our community, simply because they are Jewish,' O’Hara said.	https://apnews.com/article/minneapolis-synagogue-shooting-threat-da711840fadd4c40377d20434af0bbf3	2024-10-06T08:22:26-07:00	
Pro-Palestinian and pro-Israeli crowds rally across the world on the eve of Oct. 7 anniversary	PARIS (AP) — Crowds were participating in pro-Palestinian and pro-Israeli protests and memorial events across the world on Sunday on the eve of the first anniversary of the Hamas attacks on Israel. Sunday’s events follow massive rallies that took place Saturday in several European cities, including London, Berlin, Paris and Rome. Other events are scheduled through the week, with an expected peak on Monday, the date of the anniversary. In Australia, thousands of people on Sunday protested in support of Palestinians and Lebanon in various cities, while a pro-Israeli rally also took place in Melbourne. Samantha Gazal, who came to the rally in Sydnay, said she was there 'because I can’t believe our government is giving impunity to a violent extremist nation and has done nothing. ... We’re watching the violence play out on livestream, and they’re doing nothing.' In Melbourne, supporters of Israel held up posters showing Israeli hostages who are still missing. 'We feel like we didn’t do anything to deserve this,' said Jeremy Wenstein, one of the participants. 'We’re just supporting our brothers and sisters who are fighting a war that they didn’t invite.' At a rally in Berlin, near the Brandenburg Gate, hundreds of pro-Israeli demonstrators set off up the famed Unter den Linden behind a banner that read 'Against all antisemitism,' accompanied by a police escort. With many Israel flags waving over head, some Jewish leaders led a song about 'shalom' — peace — while marchers chanted 'Free Gaza from Hamas!' and 'Bring them home,' referring to hostages still held in the Gaza strip. Some in the crowd held up photos of hostages still held by Hamas. Photos of several women featured the word 'Kidnapped' in German. Memorial events organized by the Jewish community for those killed in the Oct. 7 attack and prayers for those still in captivity were also to be held in Paris and London on Sunday afternoon. Security forces in several countries warned of heightened levels of alert in major cities, amid concerns that the escalating conflict in the Middle East could inspire new terror attacks in Europe or that some of the protests could turn violent. On Sunday, Italy’s Premier Giorgia Meloni expressed her 'full solidarity' with police, the day after after security forces used tear gas and water cannons to disperse violent demonstrators in Rome. Meloni firmly condemned clashes between a few pro-Palestinian demonstrators and law enforcement officers, saying it was 'intolerable that dozens of officers are injured during a demonstration.' Thirty police officers and four protesters were hurt in clashes at the pro-Palestinian march in Rome Saturday, local media said. In Rome’s central Piazzale Ostiense, hooded protesters threw stones, bottles and even a street sign at the police, who responded using water cannons and tear gas. Pope Francis, celebrating his Sunday Angelus prayer from the Vatican, issued a new appeal for peace 'on every front.' Francis also urged his audience not to forget the many hostages still held in Gaza, asking for 'their immediate liberation.' The pope called for a day of prayer and fasting on Monday, the first anniversary of the attack. On Oct. 7 last year, Hamas launched a surprise attack into Israel, killing 1,200 Israelis, taking 250 people hostage and setting off a war with Israel that has shattered much of the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip. More than 41,000 Palestinians have been killed since then in Gaza, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not differentiate between fighters and civilians. It says more than half were women and children. Nearly 100 Israeli hostages remain in Gaza, with fewer than 70 believed to be alive. Israelis have experienced attacks — missiles from Iran and Hezbollah, explosive drones from Yemen, fatal shootings and stabbings — as the region braces for further escalation. In late September, Israel shifted some of its focus to Hezbollah, which holds much of the power in parts of southern Lebanon and some other areas of the country, attacking the militants with exploding pagers, airstrikes and, eventually, incursions into Lebanon.	https://apnews.com/article/mideast-israel-gaza-war-protests-memorial-hostages-d1e8c03e14c28c64afa3fffe086c3e8f	2024-10-06T04:56:23-07:00	
Brazilians vote in tense local elections	RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) — Brazilians began voting in the first round of local elections on Sunday for mayors, deputy mayors and councilors in the country’s 5,569 municipalities. In Sao Paulo, three mayoral candidates are running neck-and-neck, including incumbent Ricardo Nunes, left-wing lawmaker Guilherme Boulos and self-help guru turned far-right politician Pablo Marçal. A runoff is scheduled for Oct. 27. Much of the attention leading up to Sunday’s vote has been on Brazil ’s biggest city, where the race has been marred by episodes of violence involving Marçal. Last month, José Luiz Datena, a former TV presenter turned candidate, slammed Marçal with a metal chair during a televised debate following references to allegations of sexual misconduct. In a later debate, an aide to Marçal thumped an adversary’s counterpart, resulting in a bloody face. Marçal sparked more controversy on Friday, when he published on social media a falsified medical report indicating cocaine use by Boulos. The document was widely debunked by local media that pointed to inconsistencies including the fact that it was signed by a doctor who had passed away. Boulos, a longtime campaigner for housing rights who is backed by President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, vehemently denied the veracity of the document. On Saturday, a judge sitting on Sao Paulo’s electoral court ordered the suspension of Marçal’s Instagram account for 48 hours and deemed that there are 'indications of various offenses under the Electoral Code.' Some of former President Jair Bolsonaro ’s political base has been drawn to Marçal, enthralled by his fiery rhetoric, although the far-right leader is supporting Nunes. In Rio de Janeiro, incumbent Eduardo Paes is hoping to avoid a second-round runoff. Polls indicated until recently that was possible. But his principal challenger Alexandre Ramagem has steadily climbed in the polls in recent weeks, rendering the outcome of Sunday’s vote uncertain. Ramagem, the former chief of Brazil’s intelligence agency under Bolsonaro, is being investigated as part of a wider probe into alleged spying on political opponents. He has denied the accusations. Bolsonaro is backing Ramagem, and his ascent in the polls is widely attributed to the former president's campaigning on his behalf. More than 155 million Brazilians are eligible to vote. Forty-three percent of the electorate is in the southeastern region, where Rio and Sao Paulo are located. Women make up around 52% of voters. Nearly 1,000 transgender politicians are running Sunday in every one of Brazil’s 26 states, according to the nation’s electoral court, which is tracking them for the first time. The number of candidacies has tripled since the last local elections four years ago, when trans rights group Antra mapped them. Polls opened at 8 a.m. Brasilia time and close at 5 p.m. (2000 GMT). A second round will be held in municipalities with more than 200,000 registered voters if none of the candidates for mayor obtains an absolute majority.	https://apnews.com/article/brazil-municipal-elections-nunes-marcal-1e762fc9bc72abba1049997d7c79ee55	2024-10-06T04:29:47-07:00	
Tropical Storm Milton could hit Florida as a major hurricane midweek	MIAMI (AP) — People across Florida were given notice Sunday that Milton, for now just a tropical storm off the coast of Mexico, could intensify rapidly into a major hurricane before slamming midweek into the storm-ravaged Gulf Coast. Tropical Storm Milton's center was about 860 miles (1,385 kilometers) west-southwest of Tampa, Florida, early Sunday, heading east at 5 mph (7 kph) with maximum sustained winds of 60 mph (95 kph), the National Hurricane Center in Miami said. 'Milton is moving slowly but is expected to strengthen rapidly,' the center said. 'There is increasing confidence that a powerful hurricane with life-threatening hazards will be affecting portions of the Florida west coast around the middle of this week.' Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said Sunday that while it remains to be seen just where Milton will strike, it's clear that Florida is going to be hit hard — 'I don't think there's any scenario where we don't have major impacts at this point.' 'You have time to prepare — all day today, all day Monday, probably all day Tuesday to be sure your hurricane preparedness plan is in place,' the governor said. 'Know your evacuation zone — there will be mandatory and voluntary evacuations.' DeSantis said as many as 4,000 National Guard troops are helping the Florida Division of Emergency Management and the Florida Department of Transportation to remove debris, and he declared a state of emergency in 35 counties ahead of Milton. He said Floridians should prepare for more power outages and disruption. 'All available state assets ... are being marshaled to help remove debris,' DeSantis said. 'We're going 24-7 ... it's all hands on deck.' FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell defended her agency's response to the destruction wrought by Hurricane Helene after Republicans’ false claims, amplified by former President Donald Trump, created a frenzy of misinformation across devastated communities. 'This kind of rhetoric is not helpful to people and it’s really a shame we’re putting politics ahead of helping people,' Criswell told ABC’s George Stephanopoulos. It's created fear and mistrust among residents against the thousands of FEMA employees and volunteers on the ground across the southeast, she said. Despite this, Criswell said the agency is already preparing for Milton, well before it's clear exactly where it will move across the Florida peninsula this week. 'We’re working with the state there to understand what their requirements are going to be, so we can have those in place before it makes landfall,' she said. The hurricane center said Mexico’s Yucatan peninsula, the Florida Peninsula, the Florida Keys and the northwestern Bahamas should monitor the system’s progress. Heavy rainfall was expected Sunday ahead of the storm itself, and will likely then combine with Milton's rainfall to flood waterways and streets in Florida, where forecasters said up to a foot (30 centimeters) of rain could fall in places through Wednesday night. 'There is an increasing risk of life-threatening storm surge and wind impacts for portions of the west coast of the Florida Peninsula beginning late Tuesday or Wednesday. Residents in these areas should ensure they have their hurricane plan in place, follow any advice given by local officials, and check back for updates to the forecast,' the center said. The Atlantic hurricane season has become more active as rescuers in the U.S. Southeast continue to search for people unaccounted for in the wake of Hurricane Helene, which left a huge trail of death and catastrophic damage from Florida into the Appalachian mountains. Hurricane Kirk diminished to a Category 2 hurricane in the open Atlantic early, with top winds of 105 mph (165 kph), sending large swells and 'life-threatening surf and rip current conditions' to Bermuda and northward along the U.S. and Canadian coasts, the center said. Hurricane Leslie also was moving northwest over the open Atlantic, with top winds of 85 mph (140 kph) but posing no threats to land.	https://apnews.com/article/tropical-weather-milton-helene-florida-fe1a0232599542fffeb080e5d3a3683e	2024-10-06T04:29:42-07:00	
Tunisians vote in an election with one of President Saied's 2 challengers in prison	TUNIS, Tunisia (AP) — Tunisians cast ballots Sunday in the country’s third presidential election since the pro-democracy revolt known as the Arab Spring, while one of the candidates remains in prison. Voters are deciding who among three candidates will lead the North African nation for the next five years — President Kais Saied, imprisoned businessman Ayachi Zammel or Zouhair Maghzaoui, a leftist who supported Saied before choosing to run against him. Saied, the 66-year-old first-term president, is considered the heavy favorite largely because of a crackdown on his opponents and the moves to remove checks and balances on his executive power. The majority of the opposition is boycotting the contest in protest of what they call an absence of democratic conditions for free and fair elections. Dozens of candidates had expressed interest to challenge Saied and 17 submitted preliminary paperwork to run in Sunday’s race. However, members of the election commission, all of whom are appointed by the president, approved only three. They ignored a court ruling ordering them to reinstate three other challengers. Zammel was later imprisoned and charged with forging voter signatures to qualify for the ballot, which his attorney denied. Tunisia's presidential election is its third since protests led to the 2011 ouster of President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali — the first autocrat toppled in the Arab Spring uprisings that also overthrew leaders in Egypt, Libya and Yemen.	https://apnews.com/article/tunisia-election-saied-opposition-11a1ba0d77ec1459928bb2266792551f	2024-10-06T03:00:50-07:00	
Central Thailand braces for inundation as rain stops in flooded Chiang Mai	CHIANG MAI, Thailand (AP) — Several provinces in central Thailand braced for floods Sunday after the Irrigation Department announced it was releasing water from a major dam after weeks of frequent heavy rain. The rain stopped in the northern city of Chiang Mai, but many people, especially the elderly, remained cut off by floodwaters that in some areas were waist-high or more. Volunteer rescue teams, often traveling by boat, worked to supply them with food or evacuate them. Further complicating the situation, electricity was cut off in some neighborhoods for safety reasons. Areas popular with tourists, such as the city’s Night Bazaar and Tha Pae Gate, were under as much as a meter (3 1/3 feet) of water. Central provinces, including the capital Bangkok, have been warned of possible flooding as the Irrigation Department plans to release water from the Chao Phraya Dam to keep it under capacity. The latest flooding in Chiang Mai began when the Ping River, which runs along the eastern edge of the city, began overrunning its banks on Friday. Flooding is an annual problem in many parts of Thailand during the monsoon season. Concern remained for animals that had been kept in parks and sanctuaries on the outskirts of Chiang Mai. Most of the the 125 elephants held at the city's Elephant Nature Park have been led to safety, though some escaped on their own to seek higher ground. Photos in Thai media showed elephants in water so deep that they could barely keep their heads above it. Thai media reported that at least two elephants have been found dead and several more were unaccounted for.	https://apnews.com/article/thailand-chiang-mai-floods-elephants-b94db0efe687b35755e694fa7d8b8944	2024-10-06T02:55:15-07:00	
Rwanda will deploy Marburg vaccine under trial as death toll rises to 12	KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) — Rwandan health authorities will begin a vaccine study against the Marburg hemorrhagic fever, officials said Sunday, as the East African country tries to stop the spread of an outbreak that has killed 12 people. Rwanda, which received 700 doses of a vaccine under trial from the U.S.-based Sabin Vaccine Institute on Saturday, will target health workers and emergency responders as well as individuals who have been in contact with confirmed cases, according to the Health Ministry. Health Minister Sabin Nsanzimana told reporters Sunday that the Rwanda Biomedical Centre had reviewed the vaccine shipment. There is no authorized vaccine or treatment for Marburg. Like Ebola, the Marburg virus is believed to originate in fruit bats and spreads between people through close contact with the bodily fluids of infected individuals or with surfaces, such as contaminated bed sheets. Without treatment, Marburg can be fatal in up to 88% of people who fall ill with the disease. In a statement, Sabin Vaccine Institute said it had 'entered into a clinical trial agreement with the Rwanda Biomedical Centre, the trial sponsor, to provide investigational doses' for the study. The Rwandan government said there were 46 confirmed cases, with 29 of them in isolation. Health authorities have identified at least 400 people who came into contact with confirmed cases of the virus. Rwanda declared an outbreak of Marburg on Sept. 27 and reported six deaths a day later. Authorities said at the time that the first cases had been found among patients in health facilities. There is still no confirmation of the source of the outbreak. Symptoms include fever, muscle pains, diarrhea, vomiting and, in some cases, death through extreme blood loss. In Rwanda, most of the sick are health workers in six out of the country's 30 districts. Some patients live in districts bordering Congo, Burundi, Uganda and Tanzania, according to the World Health Organization. Rwandans have been urged to avoid physical contact to help curb the spread. Strict measures include the suspension of school and hospital visits as well as a restriction on the number of those who can attend funerals for Marburg victims. Home vigils aren’t allowed in the event a death is linked to Marburg. The U.S. Embassy in Kigali has urged its staff to work remotely and avoid visiting offices. Marburg outbreaks and individual cases have in the past been recorded in Tanzania, Equatorial Guinea, Angola, Congo, Kenya, South Africa, Uganda and Ghana, according to WHO. The virus was first identified in 1967, after it caused simultaneous outbreaks of disease in laboratories in Marburg, Germany and Belgrade, Serbia. Seven people died after being exposed to the virus while conducting research on monkeys.	https://apnews.com/article/rwanda-marburg-outbreak-vaccine-4eb415e5ebd15755242ce85467368cf7	2024-10-06T02:08:15-07:00	
Pope names 21 new cardinals, significantly increasing pool who will one day elect successor	ROME (AP) — Pope Francis named 21 new cardinals Sunday, significantly increasing the size of the College of Cardinals and further cementing his mark on the group of prelates who will one day elect his successor. Among those named by history’s first Latin American pope were the heads of several major dioceses and archdioceses in South America. They include the heads of the Catholic Church in Santiago del Estero, Argentina; Porto Alegre, Brazil; Santiago, Chile; Guayaquil, Ecuador; and Lima, Peru. The new cardinals will get their red hats at a ceremony, known as a consistory, on Dec. 8, an important feast day on its own that officially kicks off the Christmas season in Rome. Even before Sunday’s announcement, Francis had already named the vast majority of the voting-age cardinals who will one day vote in a conclave to choose his successor. According to Vatican statistics, before Sunday, 92 of the cardinals under 80 — and thus eligible to vote in a conclave — had been named by Francis, compared with 24 named by Pope Benedict XVI and six by St. John Paul II. Added to their ranks on Sunday were two Vatican officials who hold positions that don’t usually carry with them a cardinal’s rank: the official in charge of the migrants section of the Vatican development office, the Rev. Fabio Baggio, and the official who organizes the pope’s foreign travels, the Rev. George Jacob Koovakad. In a nod to the current synod underway at the Vatican this month debating the future of the church, Francis also tapped the Rev. Timothy Radcliffe, a British theologian who is one of the spiritual advisers for the meeting. ___ Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

1 dead as Russia strikes Ukraine with drones and missiles	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — One person has died after Russian forces attacked Ukraine overnight with 87 Shahed drones and four different types of missiles, officials said Sunday. A 49-year-old man was killed in the Kharkiv region after his car was hit by a drone, said regional Gov. Oleh Syniehubov. A gas pipeline was also damaged and a warehouse set alight in the city of Odesa, Ukrainian officials reported. Ukraine’s air force said in a statement that air defenses had destroyed 56 of the 87 drones and two missiles over 14 Ukrainian regions, including the capital, Kyiv. Another 25 drones disappeared from radar 'presumably as a result of anti-aircraft missile defense,' it said. The barrage comes a day after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Saturday that he will present his 'victory plan' at the Oct. 12 meeting of the Ramstein group of nations that supplies arms to Ukraine. Zelenskyy presented his plan to U.S. President Joe Biden in Washington last week. Its contents have not been made public but it is known that the plan includes Ukrainian membership in NATO and the provision of long-range missiles to strike inside Russia. In a statement Sunday, the Ukrainian leader paid tribute to the country’s troops, which he also described as 'preparing (for) the next Ramstein.' 'They demonstrate what Ukrainians are capable of when they have enough weapons and sufficient range,' he said in a statement on social media. 'We will keep convincing our partners that our drones alone are not enough. More decisive steps are needed — and the end of this war will be closer.'	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-drone-strike-missiles-ramstein-fe11f1e598e66f456361a785237b9de0	2024-10-06T00:40:22-07:00	
International rescue teams arrive in Bosnia after devastating floods and landslides	SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) — Rescue teams from Bosnia's neighbors and European Union countries on Sunday were joining efforts to clear the rubble and find people still missing from floods and landslides that devastated parts of the Balkan country. Bosnia sought EU help after a heavy rainstorm overnight on Friday left entire areas under water and debris destroyed roads and bridges, killing at least 18 people and wounding dozens. 'Our hearts and thoughts are with the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina, hit by devastating floods,' EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said on X. 'We have activated our EU Civil Protection Mechanism and are sending rescue teams on the ground. This is EU solidarity in action.' Officials said that at least 10 people are still unaccounted for, many of them in the village of Donja Jablanica, in southern Bosnia, which was almost completely buried in rocks and rubble from a quarry on a hill above. Residents there have said they heard a thundering rumble and saw houses disappear before their eyes. 'We heard water and rock coming down from the hill. I told my son, Let's go up to the attic, we don’t know what’s going to happen,' recalled Munevera Dautbegovic. 'In the morning when we got out, we saw large amount of sand around.' Regional Gov. Nermin Niksic visited the village on Sunday, promising help to rebuild. 'All material damage can be compensated somehow but human lives cannot. Grief will stay on.' Earlier on Sunday, Luigi Soreca, who heads the EU mission in Bosnia, said on X that teams wer arriving to help. Bosnia is a candidate country for membership in the 27-nation bloc. Authorities said Croatian rescuers have already arrived while a team from Serbia is expected to be deployed in the afternoon, followed by a Slovenian team with dogs. Montenegro, North Macedonia, Poland, Czechia and Turkey have also offered help, a government statement said. Sunday is the date of a local election in Bosnia. Election authorities have postponed voting in the flood-hit regions, but the flooding has overshadowed the vote across the country. Ismeta Bucalovic, a resident of Sarajevo, Bosnia's capital, said 'we are all overwhelmed by these flooding events. We all think only about that.' Impoverished and ethnically divided, Bosnia has struggled to recover after the brutal war in 1992-95. The country is plagued by political bickering and corruption, stalling its EU bid.	https://apnews.com/article/bosnia-floods-eu-help-missing-3c2545e71652ebdd3a18cd0701d200b4	2024-10-05T23:45:38-07:00	
Lebanese worldwide fear for their homeland and loved ones as violence escalates	It was a year ago when Jomana Siddiqui visited Lebanon, where her father was born — and is now buried. She planned to return there soon; this time, she thought, she would take her two teenage daughters. Instead, Siddiqui, who lives in California, now worries about relatives there. As she watches from afar the violence and the recent escalation in Israel’s military campaign against Hezbollah in Lebanon, Siddiqui thinks about the people she met during her visit, the kindness and generosity she encountered. She thinks about her father’s grave — when, or if, she will get to visit it again. Her voice cracks with emotions. It’s been gut-wrenching, she said. 'It’s like the universal story of the Lebanese people,' she said. 'They have to keep leaving and not knowing when they can come back.' From the United States to South Africa, Cyprus, Brazil and beyond, many members of Lebanon’s far-flung and large diaspora are contending with the ripples of the violence — grieving, gripped by fear for loved ones and for their homeland, trying to find ways to help. Some 1,400 Lebanese, including civilians and fighters of the militant group Hezbollah, have been killed and some 1.2 million driven from their homes since Israel escalated its strikes in late September, saying it aims to push Hezbollah away from the countries’ shared border. For Lina Kayat, who moved to South Africa almost 36 years ago but still has a big family in Lebanon, the violence and tensions there have echoes of earlier turbulent chapters. 'We lived through a civil war for a long time; I was like seven years old,' she said. 'It feels like history repeating itself. ... It’s the unknown of who is going to get killed next.' Kayat, who lives in South Africa’s coastal city of Durban, speaks daily to her family, including her mother and her sister. 'They are very scared and very worried about what is going to happen,' she said. Generations of Lebanese have grappled with whether to leave to seek better opportunities or escape various times of tumult — from a 15-year-old civil war to military occupations, bombings and political assassinations — or stay in a Lebanon that despite its numerous scars retains its allure for many. Lebanon — home to multiple religious groups, including Christians and Sunni and Shiite Muslims — takes pride in its large emigrant communities, which include successful businessmen and celebrities of Lebanese heritage. The current military escalation unfolds amid fears that fighting could spread in the region and comes as the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza nears the grim one-year mark. 'It happening on top of Gaza is almost too much to bear,' said James Zogby, president of the Washington D.C.-based Arab American Institute. 'It almost makes you physically ill just trying to fathom the extent of the trauma,' added Zogby, whose father was born in Lebanon. Already, Lebanon had been on edge and struggling under the weight of an economic meltdown, the fallout from a massive 2020 port explosion and other crises. It’s been without a president for two years. Against such a somber backdrop, Zogby wonders what will become of the displaced. 'Who’s going to care for them? Where do the health services come from ... when the country is already as overstretched as it is and on the verge of collapse?' he said. 'At what point does it finally collapse? And who will care?' Fueling the pain, he said, is his anger at the U.S. response to the devastation in Gaza and now the escalation in Lebanon. 'There’s a sense of powerlessness, a sense of almost despair that, you know, it can get out of control. And as long as nothing here happens to restrain it, it will get worse.' Akram Khater, director of the Khayrallah Center for Lebanese Diaspora Studies at North Carolina State University, said that since the earliest diaspora, Lebanese who left have been contributing heavily to the economic well-being of Lebanon, sending large amounts of remittances. Watching the escalation in Lebanon, where he was born and raised, has been re-traumatizing, he said. 'I find myself amidst a swirl of emotions that are unresolved and that derive from this recurring nightmare,' he said. 'Yet, even amidst this our community comes together to create solidarity and provide solace and comfort for each other.' Recently, hundreds of Lebanese flags filled the night sky in Dearborn, Michigan, as some attended a rally to support Lebanon and protest the Israeli offensive there. At Sao Paulo’s international airport, two Lebanese brothers who’ve been living in Brazil, recently had a solemn reunion. They said eight of their loved ones — their sister, brother-in-law, four of their nephews and two of their nephews’ children — were killed in Lebanon in one of the attacks. Hussein Zeineddine, one of the brothers, had been on vacation with his family in southern Lebanon when the area was hit by Israeli attacks, he told The Associated Press. He and his family moved to a safer location until they could book flights back to Brazil. 'My wife was crying and asking us to leave. We left just with basic items. And then, shortly after, my sister’s house was bombed,' he said after his arrival. 'It will be tough here. But it will be tougher for people there,' he said. In Cyprus, Rosaline Ghoukassian said the overwhelming majority of Lebanese don’t want this war. She relocated to Cyprus with her husband Raffi Garabedian and their daughter Maria after the 2020 ammonium nitrate explosion in Beirut's port that killed more than 200 people. She said she'd been disenchanted with Lebanon's political leadership and also lamented Hezbollah's influence. 'We knew this was coming,' she said. 'The problem is in Lebanon. ... Because we don’t have a good government.' Their decision to leave Lebanon was never about money but safety, as their daughter explained in a letter she wrote in class in Cyprus: 'I don’t want to go there because I was saved in the explosion, and I don’t want to go live there because I don’t want to die.' The family chose to stay. 'I’m not here to make thousands of euros. No. I’m here just to live. To be happy, to be safe. This is what I want. To live,' Garabedian said. Hezbollah began firing into Israel the day after Hamas’ attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, in which the militants killed some 1,200 people and took about 250 others hostage. Since then, Israel’s military response in Gaza has killed more than 41,000 Palestinians, according to local health officials. Back in California, Siddiqui said coping with it all has been challenging. 'You grab the phone; you hesitate to open it because you’re afraid of what you’re going to see, but you kind of have to.' She talks to friends and others in her circle who can relate. 'We all feel kind of sad, depressed, helpless, rundown,' she said. 'We can do things like fundraise and donate and protest or anything like that, but at the end of the day, it still weighs on you.' ___ AP journalists Mogomotsi Magome in Johannesburg; Mauricio Savarese in Sao Paulo and Menelaos Hadjicostis in Nicosia, Cyprus, contributed reporting. ___ Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

Survivors grapple with aid cuts and the Taliban a year after massive Afghan earthquake	KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) — People had just seconds to flee their homes when the terrifying sound of earth cracking open reverberated across western Afghanistan's Herat province. Nobody knows for sure how many people died in a 6.3 magnitude earthquake on Oct. 7, 2023, or in the strong aftershocks that followed. The Taliban government estimated that at least 4,000 perished. The U.N. gave a far lower figure of about 1,500. Survivors stopped counting, exhausted after digging through dirt to save their loved ones or bury them. It was the deadliest natural disaster to strike Afghanistan in recent memory. It was also another major challenge for the Taliban since they seized power in 2021, a test of their readiness to lead a country beset by economic hardship, isolation, devastation from decades of war, and vulnerability to shocks like earthquakes and climate change. 'At that time, the government really cooperated in transporting patients and the dead,' said Ismatullah Rahmani, from the quake’s epicenter in Zinda Jan district, where every home, usually built of mud and timber, was levelled. His brother and nephew were killed, and he spent hours trying to free his wife from under 1 1/2-meter (60 inches) of soil. She survived. 'They opened hospitals and provided water and food to people for free,' he told The Associated Press from his new home in Zinda Jan. He said the Taliban went to camps and helped survivors over several months, a blessing ahead of the harsh Herat winter. 'After that, our aid stopped,' said Rahmani. Quake survivors rely on charities Charities had stepped in to build housing for survivors. But the accommodation they built lacks walls so there is no privacy, while the poor design leaves them vulnerable to storms or heavy rainfall. Houses either have no bathrooms or the bathrooms don’t have a roof. Rahmani's village, Naib Rafi, still doesn’t have a health clinic or a school. Instead, children are learning in tents. The government didn’t provide financial assistance, he said. Senior officials and Islamic scholars visited communities a few times, listened to people’s problems and left. Ahmadullah Muttaqi, spokesman and member of the Herat Earthquake Commission, said authorities worked with charities and nongovernmental groups to provide shelter and medical assistance. 'People’s problems haven’t been solved, of course, but the first necessity is building houses until they stand on their own feet. They have been given food and hospitals are still working,' he told AP. He said they were still working to rebuild mosques, schools, madrassas and parks. He did not answer questions about authorities' preparedness for future disasters. Foreign aid money is drying up Afghans were already struggling with displacement, food insecurity and poverty before the quake struck, and the tragedy put further pressure on public services. Aid agencies, which have been propping up Afghan health care and education for the past three years under the Taliban, became even more thinly stretched. The International Rescue Committee set up feeding corners after the earthquake so mothers could safely breastfeed children and get nutrition counselling. The relief agency said it also fixed water systems, provided emergency cash, hygiene kits, medical and mental health support to tens of thousands of people. But, with other global crises raging, such support is finite. International funding for Afghanistan has received less than a third of its target. Changing political priorities, economic troubles and wars are hitting donors’ pockets, especially those in the West. Widespread opposition to the Taliban’s treatment of Afghan women and girls is also having an effect. 'There is donor fatigue, for sure, but perhaps the bigger problem is a nervousness from many donors about supporting anything but the most urgent life-saving aid,' said Mark Calder from World Vision International. The U.N. says international recognition of the Taliban as the legitimate government of Afghanistan is nearly impossible while restrictions remain on female education and employment. The Taliban reject this position, demanding Afghanistan’s seat at the U.N. and saying that sanctions and the country's continued isolation are hurting people. Investment in quality development assistance would benefit Afghan women and girls disproportionately and it’s sometimes in their name that a reduction in aid to Afghanistan is promoted, said Calder. 'It’s difficult to imagine that Afghan communities are much better prepared for natural disasters than they were a year ago,' he added. Fears of another disaster Herat authorities have been unable to fully meet humanitarian needs, while damaged infrastructure has hampered recovery efforts. A near-total reliance on aid organisations for basics like health care and shelter has left people exposed. Four of Gul Ahmad Osmani’s children died in the disaster. He heard boys screaming under the soil in his village. It was impossible to pull them out, he said. He and his surviving family members spent the winter in a tent. 'The government took care of us, keeping my wife and children in a camp, but we didn’t see anything from the government that was specifically from them, like flour, cooking oil or rice,' Osmani said. 'Our own people, the people of Afghanistan, brought food for several days.' The helping hands came from other cities, districts and provinces to clear away rubble, bury the dead, and distribute everyday items like clothing. But it’s been almost six months since NGOs or well-wishers came to help the residents of Zinda Jan. A kind doctor from northern Baghlan province donated money recently. 'There are still earthquakes and these new houses are heavy,' said Osmani. 'Children are afraid. The help for the earthquake did not help us.' —- Haqjoo reported from Zinda Jan, Afghanistan.	https://apnews.com/article/afghanistan-herat-earthquake-taliban-c26e12ed6862a7f7f6ef29771c74ed9b	2024-10-05T19:45:22-07:00	
Apparent Israeli airstrike on mosque in central Gaza kills at least 18 people	DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — An apparent Israeli airstrike early Sunday killed at least 18 people in central Gaza, Palestinian medical officials said. The strike hit a mosque sheltering displaced people near the al-Aqsa Martyrs hospital in the town of Deir al-Balah, the hospital said in a statement. An Associated Press journalist counted the bodies at the hospital morgue. Hospital records showed that the dead were all men. Another two men were critically wounded, the hospital said. The Israeli military did not immediately comment about the strike on the mosque. The latest strikes add to the mounting Palestinian death toll in Gaza, which is nearing 42,000, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry. The ministry does not differentiate between civilian and militant deaths, but many of the dead were women and children. The attack early Sunday came after Israel bombarded Lebanon on Saturday as it targeted both Hezbollah and Hamas fighters. Thousands of people in Lebanon, including Palestinian refugees, continued to flee the widening conflict in the region, while rallies were held around the world marking the approaching anniversary of the start of the war in Gaza. The strong explosions Saturday began near midnight and continued into Sunday after Israel’s military urged residents to evacuate areas in Dahiyeh, the predominantly Shiite collection of suburbs on Beirut’s southern edge. AP video showed the blasts illuminating the densely populated suburbs, where Hezbollah has a strong presence. They followed a day of sporadic strikes and the nearly continuous buzz of reconnaissance drones. Israel’s military confirmed it was striking targets near Beirut and said about 30 projectiles had crossed from Lebanon into Israeli territory, with some intercepted. The strikes reportedly targeted a building near a road leading to Lebanon’s only international airport, and another building formerly used by the Hezbollah-run broadcaster Al-Manar. Social media reports claimed that one of the strikes hit an oxygen tank storage facility, but this was later denied by the owner of the company. Shortly thereafter, Hezbollah claimed in a statement that it successfully targeted a group of Israeli soldiers near the Manara settlement in northern Israel 'with a large rocket salvo, hitting them accurately.' On Saturday, Israel’s attack on the northern Beddawi camp killed an official with Hamas’ military wing along with his wife and two young daughters, the Palestinian militant group said. Hamas later said another military wing member was killed in Israeli strikes in Lebanon’s eastern Bekaa Valley. The aftermath showed smashed buildings, scattered bricks and stairways to nowhere. Israel has killed several Hamas officials in Lebanon since the Israel-Hamas war began , in addition to most of the top leadership of the Lebanon-based Hezbollah as fighting has sharply escalated. At least 1,400 Lebanese, including civilians, medics and Hezbollah fighters, have been killed and 1.2 million driven from their homes in less than two weeks. Israel says it aims to drive the militant group away from shared borders so displaced Israelis can return to their homes. Iranian-backed Hezbollah, the strongest armed force in Lebanon, began firing rockets into Israel almost immediately after Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack, calling it a show of support for the Palestinians. Hezbollah and Israel’s military have traded fire almost daily. Last week, Israel launched what it called a limited ground operation into southern Lebanon after a series of attacks killed longtime Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and others. The fighting is the worst since Israel and Hezbollah fought a brief war in 2006. Nine Israeli soldiers have been killed in the ground clashes that Israel says have killed 440 Hezbollah fighters. Iran’s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, told reporters in Damascus that 'we are trying to reach a cease-fire in Gaza and in Lebanon.' The minister said the unnamed countries putting forward initiatives include regional states and some outside the Middle East. Araghchi spoke a day after the supreme leader of Iran praised its recent missile strikes on Israel and said it was ready to do it again if necessary. On Saturday evening, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said 'Israel has the duty and the right to defend itself and respond to these attacks, and it will do so.' On Lebanon, he said 'we are not done yet.' ___ Magdy reported from Cairo, Egypt.	https://apnews.com/article/mideast-wars-lebanon-hezbollah-hamas-6-october-2024-0210e9d539a899e21ee89b52807b6af7	2024-10-05T19:39:16-07:00	
A year into the Israel-Hamas war, students say a chill on free speech has reached college classrooms	WASHINGTON (AP) — As a junior at George Washington University, Ty Lindia meets new students every day. But with the shadow of the Israel-Hamas war hanging over the Washington, D.C., campus, where everyone has a political opinion, each new encounter is fraught. 'This idea that I might say the wrong thing kind of scares me,' said Lindia, who studies political science. 'You have to tiptoe around politics until one person says something that signifies they lean a certain way on the issue.' He has seen friendships — including some of his own — end over views about the war. In public, he keeps his stance to himself for fear that future employers could hold it against him. 'Before Oct. 7, there wasn’t really a big fear,' said Lindia, of Morristown, New Jersey. A year after Hamas’ attack in southern Israel, some students say they are reluctant to speak out because it could pit them against their peers, professors or even potential employers. Social bubbles have cemented along the divisions of the war. New protest rules on many campuses raise the risk of suspension or expulsion. Tensions over the conflict burst wide open last year amid emotional demonstrations in the aftermath of the Oct. 7 attack. In the spring, a wave of pro-Palestinian tent encampments led to some 3,200 arrests. The atmosphere on U.S. campuses has calmed since those protests, yet lingering unease remains. Students reconsider what to say in classes In a recent class discussion on gender and the military at Indiana University, sophomore Mikayla Kaplan said she thought about mentioning her female friends who serve in the Israeli military. But in a room full of politically progressive classmates, she decided to stay quiet. 'In the back of my head, I’m always thinking about things that I should or shouldn’t say,' Kaplan said. Kaplan, who proudly wears a Star of David necklace, said that before college she had many friends of different faiths, but after Oct. 7, almost all of her friends are Jewish. The war began when Hamas-led fighters killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, in the Oct. 7 attack on southern Israel. They abducted another 250 people and are still holding about 100 hostages. Israel’s campaign in Gaza has killed at least 41,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. At the University of Connecticut, some students said the conflict doesn’t come up as much in classes. Ahmad Zoghol, an engineering student, said it remains a tense issue and he has heard of potential employers scrutinizing political statements students make in college. 'There’s definitely that concern for a lot of people, including myself, that if we speak about it there’s going to be some sort of repercussion,' he said. Campuses grapple with divisions Compared with the much larger campus protests of the Vietnam War era, when few students openly supported the war, campuses today appear more divided, said Mark Yudof, a former president of the University of California system. For many, the issues are more personal. 'The faculty are at odds with each other. The student body is at odds with each other. There’s a war of ideologies going on,' he said. Some universities are trying to bridge the divide with campus events on civil discourse, sometimes inviting Palestinian and Jewish speakers to share the stage. At Harvard University in Massachusetts, a recent survey found that many students and professors are reluctant to share views in the classroom. A panel suggested solutions including 'classroom confidentiality' and teaching on constructive disagreement. Meanwhile, many campuses are adding policies that clamp down on protests, often banning encampments and limiting demonstrations to certain hours or locations. At Indiana University, a new policy forbids 'expressive activity' after 11 p.m, among other restrictions. Doctoral student Bryce Greene, who helped lead a pro-Palestinian encampment last semester, said he was threatened with suspension after organizing an 11:30 p.m. vigil. That's a startling contrast to past protests on campus, including a 2019 climate demonstration that drew hundreds of students without university interference, he said. 'There’s definitely a chilling effect that occurs when speech is being restricted in this manner,' said Greene, who is part of a lawsuit challenging the new policy. 'This is just one way for them to restrict people from speaking out for Palestine.' New rules allow protests, but with conditions The tense atmosphere has led some faculty members to rethink teaching certain subjects or entering certain debates, said Risa Lieberwitz, general counsel for the American Association of University Professors. Lieberwitz, who teaches labor law at Cornell University, has been alarmed by the growing number of colleges requiring students to register demonstrations days in advance. 'It’s so contradictory to the notion of how protests and demonstrations take place,' she said. 'They’re oftentimes spontaneous. They’re not planned in the way that events are generally planned.' Protests have continued on many campuses, but on a smaller scale and often under the confines of new rules. At Wesleyan University in Connecticut, police removed a group of pro-Palestinian students from a campus building where they held a sit-in in September. Wesleyan President Michael Roth said he supports students' free speech rights, but they 'don’t have a right to take over part of a building.' Wesleyan is offering new courses on civil disagreement this year, and faculty are working to help foster discussion among students. 'It's challenging for students, as it is for adults — most adults don’t have conversations with people who disagree with them,' Roth said. 'We’re so segregated into our bubbles.' Schools try to find balance on free speech American universities pride themselves as being places of open discourse where students can engage across their differences. Since Oct. 7, they have been under tremendous pressure to uphold free speech while also protecting students from discrimination. The U.S. Education Department is investigating more than 70 colleges for reports of antisemitism or Islamophobia. Leaders of several prestigious colleges have been called before Congress by Republicans who accuse them of being soft on antisemitism. Yet finding the line where protected speech ends is as hard as ever. Leaders grapple with whether to allow chants seen by some as calls of support for Palestinians and by others as a threat against Jews. It's especially complicated at public universities, which are bound by the First Amendment, while private colleges have flexibility to impose wider speech limits. At George Washington University, Lindia said the war comes up often in his classes but sometimes after a warming-up period — in one class, discussion loosened after the professor realized most students shared similar views. Even walking to class, there is a visible reminder of the tension. Tall fencing now surrounds University Yard, the grassy space where police broke up a tent encampment in May. 'It’s a place for free expression, and now it’s just completely blocked off,' he said. Some students say moderate voices are getting lost. Nivriti Agaram, a junior at George Washington, said she believes Israel has a right to defend itself but questions America’s spending on the war. That opinion puts her at odds with more liberal students, who have called her a 'genocide enabler' and worse, she said. 'It’s very stifling,' she said. 'I think there’s a silent majority who aren’t speaking.' ___ Associated Press writer Michael Melia in Storrs, Connecticut, contributed to this report. ___ The Associated Press’ education coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

A faith is on the edge of vanishing in Georgia after being exiled from Russia centuries ago	GORELOVKA, Georgia (AP) — A 10-year-old boy proudly stands beside his father and listens to the monotone chanting of elderly women clad in embroidered headscarves and long colorful skirts. It is Ilya's first time attending a night prayer meeting in Gorelovka, a tiny village in the South Caucasus nation of Georgia, and he is determined to follow the centuries-old hymns that have been passed down through the generations. There is no priest and no iconography. It's just men and women praying together, as the Doukhobors have done since the pacifist Christian sect emerged in Russia in the 18th century. Thousands of their ancestors were expelled to the fringes of the Russian Empire almost two centuries ago for rejecting the Orthodox church and refusing to serve in Czar Nicholas I's army — much like the thousands of men who fled Russia two years ago to avoid being drafted to join Moscow's invasion of Ukraine. Today, only about 100 Doukhobors remain in the tight-knit Russian-speaking farming community in two remote mountainous villages. 'Our people are dying,' 47-year-old Svetlana Svetlishcheva, Ilya's mother, tells The Associated Press, as she walks with her family to an ancient cemetery. Prayer never stops Some 5,000 Doukhobors who were banished in the middle of the 19th century established 10 villages close to the border with the hostile Ottoman Empire, where they continued to preach nonviolence and worshipped without priests or church rituals. The community prospered, growing to around 20,000 members. When some refused to pledge allegiance to the new czar, Nicholas II, and protested by burning weapons, the authorities unleashed a violent crackdown and sent about 4,000 of them to live elsewhere in the vast Russian Empire. Nonviolence is the foundation of Doukhobor culture, says Yulia Mokshina, a professor at the Mordovia State University in Russia, who studies the group. 'The Doukhobors proved that without using force, you can stand up for the truth,' Mokshina says. 'They fought without arms but with their truth and internal power.' Their plight caught the attention of Russian novelist Leo Tolstoy, also a pacifist, who donated the profits from his final novel 'Resurrection' to help around 7,500 Doukhobors emigrate to Canada to escape persecution. And all the while, the prayers never stopped, not even when the Soviet authorities relentlessly cracked down on religious activities. 'There hasn’t been a single Sunday without prayer,' Yuri Strukov, 46, says with pride, in the village of Orlovka, where he has lived for 30 years. A shrinking community Like others in the rural community, Strukov owns cattle and produces cottage cheese, sour cream and a brined cheese called suluguni, which he sells in a nearby town. His way of life is challenging — he braves freezing temperatures during winter and droughts in the summer, and the remote village is a three-hour drive from the nearest big city — which does not appeal to many Doukhobors any longer. 'The community has changed because it became small,' Strukov says. 'The fact that there are few of us leaves a heavy residue in the soul.' In Soviet times, the Doukhobors maintained among the best collective farms in the region. But the nationalist sentiment that bubbled up in Georgia as the collapse of the Soviet Union loomed prompted many to return to Russia in the late 1980s. 'We didn’t relocate, we came back,' says 39-year-old Dmitry Zubkov, who was among the first convoy of 1,000 Doukhobors who left Gorelovka for what is now western Russia in 1989. Zubkov and his family settled in the village of Arkhangelskoye in Russia's Tula region. Strukov also thinks about moving. After several waves of Doukhobors departed, ethnic Georgians and Armenians — Orlovka is close to the Armenian border — moved in, and he says relations between them and the ever-shrinking community of Doukhobors are tense. His four family members are the last Doukhobors living in Orlovka. But the prayer house and his ancestors' graves keep him from leaving. 'The whole land is soaked with the prayers, sweat and blood of our ancestors,' he says. 'We always try to find the solution in different situations so we can stay here and preserve our culture, our traditions and our rites.' Keeping the traditions alive Doukhobor rites have traditionally passed from one generation to the next by word of mouth, and Strukov's 21-year-old daughter Daria Strukova feels the urgency to learn as much as she can from senior community members. 'I’m always worried that such a deep and interesting culture will just get lost if we don’t take it over in time,' Strukova says. She says she considered converting to the Georgian Orthodox Church as a student in the Georgian capital, Tbilisi, where that faith wields great influence. But her doubts were dispelled as she listened to a Doukhobor choir during a prayer meeting. 'I realized that this is what I missed, this is what I couldn’t find anywhere,' she says. 'I know now that the Doukhobor faith will always be with me till the end of my life.' Zubkov says Strukova's wavering faith is not unusual among Doukhobors in Russia. Once they assimilate into Russian society, experience big cities, speak the same language and share traditions with the locals, of course they will be tempted by the predominant religion. 'People didn’t want to stand out,' he says. 'Unfortunately, we have been assimilating very fast.' Around 750 Doukhobors settled in Arkhangelskoye more than 30 years ago. Now, only a few elderly women attend Sunday prayers, and only a couple of Doukhobors sing traditional anthems at funerals. Zubkov predicts that within a decade the culture will disappear from Arkhangelskoye altogether. Enduring faith The Doukhobors whose families started anew in Canada more than a century ago don't feel a strong connection to the villages that are sacred for the Strukov family. They say what is important is their faith and the pacifist principles that underscore it. 'We do not hold any specific place and historical places ... in some kind of spiritual significance,' said John J. Verigin Jr., who leads the largest Doukhobor organization in Canada. 'What we try to sustain in our organization is our dedication to those fundamental principles of our life concept.' But Ilya, in Gorelovka, is comforted by the knowledge that his community, culture and faith are rooted in a place established by his ancestors. 'I see myself a tall grown-up going to the prayers every day in Doukhobor clothes,' Ilya said. 'I will love coming here, I love it now too.' ___ Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

A year of blood and anguish: The Mideast war in AP photos	A year after Hamas launched a cross-border attack into southern Israel on Oct. 7, the images of that day and its ongoing aftermath still defy belief. No one thought they would see heavily armed Hamas gunmen going door-to-door on quiet Israeli streets or storming a crowded music festival, mowing people down for hours with no soldiers in sight. No one thought they would see entire neighborhoods in the Gaza Strip turned into rubble-strewn wastelands, with high-rises leveled, paved roads turned to dirt and people fleeing on foot with only what they could carry. Few thought it would last this long, or claim so many lives. Hamas' surprise attack and the war it triggered in Gaza have brought unprecedented death, destruction and anguish to both Israelis and Palestinians. Its ripples across the Middle East have raised the specter of an even larger conflict. Associated Press photographers have tried to capture its impact on ordinary people. They have photographed Israelis returning to the scenes of the killings, mobilizing for war and protesting their country's wartime leadership and its failure to return scores of hostages. They have been there as Palestinians dig for survivors after airstrikes and as the wounded are treated on the floors of overwhelmed hospitals. They have photographed people huddling in tents and crowding around aid stations, reaching with empty pots for desperately needed food, They have followed Palestinians from one end of Gaza to another as they flee airstrikes and evacuation orders, often traveling by foot or donkey cart with only what they can carry. And they have been to funerals — too many funerals — on both sides. As with all wars, civilians have paid the heaviest price. Young Israelis were killed by the hundreds at the music festival. Grandparents in their 70s and 80s were dragged into Gaza and held in tunnels, where many perished. Airstrikes killed Palestinian children in front of their parents and left thousands of orphans — some with no living relatives. Lebanon's Hezbollah militant group began firing rockets into Israel on Oct. 8, drawing retaliatory strikes in a cycle of escalation that has steadily worsened. In recent weeks, Israeli warplanes have pounded large areas of Lebanon, killing Hezbollah's leader and several of his top commanders, as well as many civilians. Ground operations commenced last week. The bombings have brought more giant plumes of smoke, more blackened craters where buildings once stood, more screaming ambulances and more people — by the hundreds of thousands — taking to the roads to flee the war's widening vortex. Through it all, there have been some moments of joy, however fleeting. There were happy homecomings — on both sides — last November after more than 100 hostages were freed in exchange for the release of Palestinians imprisoned by Israel. But a year on, everyone still seems to be trapped in the violent reality unleashed in the early hours of Oct. 7, with no end in sight.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-lebanon-photo-gallery-dc81e4fa104fa821ed74bd40fd9e56f5	2024-10-05T19:02:53-07:00	
A displaced family's year of fleeing across the devastated Gaza Strip	DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Ne’man Abu Jarad sat on a tarp on the ground. Around him, canvas sheets hung from cords, forming the walls of his tent. For the past year, Ne’man; his wife, Majida; and their six daughters have trekked the length of the Gaza Strip, trying to survive as Israeli forceswreaked destruction around them. It's a far cry from their house in northern Gaza — a place of comforting routine, of love, affection and safety. A place where loved ones gathered around the kitchen table or on the roof on summer evenings amid the scent of roses and jasmine flowers. 'Your house is your homeland. Everything good in our life was the home,' Ne'man said. 'Everything in it, whether physical or intangible -- family, neighbors, my siblings who were all around me. 'We are missing all that.' The Abu Jarad family lost that stability when Israel launched its campaign in Gaza in retaliation for Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack. They did exactly as the Israelis ordered in the devastating weeks and months of war that followed. They obeyed evacuation calls. They moved where the military told them to move. Seven times they fled, and each time, their lives became more unrecognizable to them, crowding with strangers in a school classroom, searching for water in a vast tent camp or sleeping on the street. The Associated Press traced the family's journey as they were driven from their home. Israel's campaign has displaced nearly the entire population of Gaza — 1.9 million of its 2.3 million Palestinians — and killed more than 41,600 people, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. Like the Abu Jarads, most families have been uprooted multiple times. For this family, the journey has taken them from a comfortable middle-class life to ruin. Before the war: A cozy life Living at the northernmost end of Gaza, most days before the war in Beit Hanoun were simple. Ne’man headed out each morning to work as a taxi driver. Majida got their daughters off to school. Their youngest, Lana, had started first grade. Hoda, the 18-year-old, was in her first year at university. The eldest, Balsam, just had her first baby. Majida spent much of her day doing housework — her face lights up when she talks about her kitchen, the center of family life. Ne’man had planted the garden with a grapevine and covered the roof with potted flowers. Watering them in the evenings was a soothing ritual. Then, the family and neighbors would sit on the front stoop or the roof to chat. 'The area would always smell nice,' he said. 'People would say we have perfume because of how beautiful the flowers are.' Oct. 7: The attack On the morning of Oct. 7, the family heard Hamas rockets firing and news of the militants’ attack into southern Israel, in which some 1,200 people were killed and 250 kidnapped. The Abu Jarads knew that the Israeli response would be swift and that their house, only about 2 kilometers (1.2 miles) from the border fence with Israel, would be on the front line. By 9 a.m., Ne’man and Majida, their six daughters, and Ne’man’s sister packed up what they could and fled, as the Israeli military issued one of its first evacuation orders. 'It makes no sense to be stubborn and stay,' Majida said. 'It is not about one person. I am part of a family and have girls.' Oct. 7-13: Staying with Majida's parents Like many, the family tried, at first, to stay close to home. They went to stay with Majida’s parents, in Beit Lahiya about a kilometer (.6 miles) away. 'The place was very comfortable, to be honest. I felt like I was at home,' Majida said. 'But we were living in fear and terror.' Already, Beit Lahiya was being heavily bombarded. Over the six days they were there, at least nine Israeli strikes hit the town, killing dozens, according to the conflict monitor Airwars. Entire families were killed or wounded under the rubble of their homes. As the explosions got closer, shrapnel pierced water tanks at Majida's parents' home. Windows shattered as the family huddled inside. It was time to move again. Oct. 13-15: Refuge at a hospital When they arrived at al-Quds hospital, the family saw for the first time the scale of displacement. The building and its grounds were packed with thousands of people. All around northern Gaza, families took refuge in hospitals, hoping they'd be safe. The family found a small space on the floor, barely enough room to spread their blanket amid the frantic medical staff struggling with the wounded. It was a black night and there were strikes, Majida remembers. 'The martyrs and wounded were strewn on the floor,' she said. The day after they arrived, a strike smashed into a house a few hundred meters away, killing a prominent doctor and some two dozen members of his family, many of them children. The Israeli military ordered all civilians to leave northern Gaza, setting in motion a wave of hundreds of thousands of people heading south across Wadi Gaza, the stream and wetlands that divide the north from the rest of the strip. The family joined the exodus. Oct. 15-Dec. 26: A cramped school The family walked 10 kilometers (6 miles) until they reached the U.N.-run Girls’ Preparatory School in the Nuseirat refugee camp. Every classroom and corridor was packed with families from the north. Majida, the daughters and Ne’man’s sister found a tiny space in a classroom already housing more than 100 women and children. For privacy in the cramped conditions, Ne’man moved in with the men in tents outside, in the schoolyard. This was their home for more than 10 weeks. Majida and the girls slept curled up on the floor, without enough space even to extend their legs. As winter set in, there weren’t enough blankets. The bathrooms were the worst part, Majida said. Only a few toilets served thousands of people. Getting a shower was a miracle, she said. People went weeks unable to bathe. Skin diseases ran rampant. Every day, the daughters went at dawn to wait in line at the few bakeries still working and came back in the afternoon, sometimes with only one flatbread. One day, Ne’man and his daughters walked 5 kilometers (3 miles) to the town of Deir al-Balah, looking for drinkable water. 'If it wasn’t for the kind people in Deir al-Balah who took pity on us and gave us half a gallon, we could have returned with nothing,' Ne’man said. As strikes continued, the family decided to go as far as possible, trekking 20 kilometers (12 miles) to Rafah, at Gaza’s southernmost end. Dec. 26-May 14: Life in a tent The Abu Jarads weren’t the only ones: As Israeli evacuation orders ate away at more and more of Gaza, nearly half of the population crammed into Rafah. Here, the family had their first taste of living in a tent. They set up amid the massive sprawl of tens of thousands of tents on Rafah’s outskirts, near U.N. aid warehouses known as 'the barracks.' 'In the winter, it was hell, water drenched us,' Majida said. 'We slept on the ground, nothing under us, and no covers.' They had no money to buy food in the markets, where prices soared. The youngest girls got sick with colds and diarrhea, and there was no nearby pharmacy to buy medicine. The family survived completely off U.N. handouts of flour and other basics. 'To buy one tomato or cucumber and find it in the tent was like a dream,' Ne’man said. Like so many others, they'd believed Rafah was the last safe place in Gaza. It was not. In the first week of May, Israel ordered the evacuation of all of Rafah. Then its troops pushed into the city. Bombardment intensified. Ne’man and Majida tried to stay as long as possible. But an airstrike hit nearby, he said, killing four of Ne’man’s cousins and a young girl. May 16-Aug. 16: 'Humanitarian zone' Palestinians who'd packed into Rafah — more than 1 million — all streamed out again, fleeing the Israeli offensive. They scattered across southern and central Gaza. New tent cities filled beaches, fields, empty lots, schoolyards, cemeteries, even dumpsites – any open space. The Abu Jarads moved by foot and donkey cart until they reached a former amusement park known as Asdaa City. Now its Ferris wheel stood above a landscape of tents stretching as far as the eye could see. Here, in Muwasi, a barren area of dunes and fields along the coast, Israel had declared a 'humanitarian zone' – though there was little aid, food or water. Every amenity once taken for granted was a distant memory. Now the kitchen was a pile of sticks for kindling and two rocks for setting a pot over the fire. No shower, only the occasional bucket of water. Soap was too expensive. Only a draped sheet separated them from their neighbors. Everything was filthy and sandy. Large spiders, cockroaches and other insects crept into the tent. Aug. 16-26: Fleeing to the sea Even the 'humanitarian zone' was unsafe. A raid by Israeli troops less than a kilometer (half-mile) away forced Majida and Ne’man to uproot their family once more. They headed toward the Mediterranean coast, not knowing where they'd stay. Fortunately, they said, they found some acquaintances. 'God bless them, they opened their tent for us and let us live with them for 10 days,' Ne’man said. Late August: Moving again, no end in sight When they returned to Muwasi, the Abu Jarads found their tent had been robbed – their food and clothes, all gone. Since then, the weeks blur together. The family finds survival itself loses meaning in a conflict that seems to have no end. Food has become even harder to find as supplies entering Gaza drop to their lowest levels of the war. Israeli drones buzz overhead constantly. The mental strain wears on everyone. One day, Ne’man said, his youngest daughter, Lana, told him, 'You stopped loving me. Because now when I come near you, you say you are fed up and tell me to stay away.' He kept telling her, 'No, darling, I love you. I just can’t bear it all.' They all dream of home. Ne’man said he learned that his brother’s house next door was destroyed in a strike, and his own home was damaged. He wonders about his flowers. He hopes they survived — even if the house is gone. The difference between then and now, Majida said, is 'the difference between heaven and earth.' Far from the warmth and affection of home, the Abu Jarads feel themselves surrendering to despair. 'We are jealous,' Majida said. 'Jealous of who? Of the people who were killed. Because they found relief while we are still suffering, living horrors, torture and heartbreak.' ___ AP writers Julia Frankel in Jerusalem and Lee Keath in Cairo contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-gaza-displacement-families-moving-161d9ad8d07e12b22bfd41c79d174c70	2024-10-05T19:00:59-07:00	
North Korea and China mark their 75th anniversary of ties as outsiders question their relationship	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — The leaders of North Korea and China marked the 75th anniversary of their diplomatic relations on Sunday by exchanging messages that expressed hopes for stronger ties, as outsiders raised questions about their relationship. The message exchange came as North Korea and Russia have been sharply expanding their cooperation while China apparently keeps its distance. Experts say that the level of exchanges and commemorative programs between North Korea and China in the coming months will provide a clue to the exact status of their ties. In a message sent to Chinese President Xi Jinping, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said his government will 'steadily strive to consolidate and develop the friendly and cooperative relations' between the two countries, according to North Korea’s official Korean Central News Agency. Xi, in his message to Kim, said that China is ready to jointly promote 'the stable and further advance of the socialist cause in the two countries,' KCNA said. Since North Korea and China established diplomatic ties on Oct. 6, 1949, their relationship has often been described as being 'as close as lips and teeth.' China, North Korea’s biggest trading partner and main aid provider, has been suspected of avoiding fully implementing U.N. sanctions on North Korea and sending clandestine aid shipments to help its impoverished neighbor stay afloat and continue to serve as a bulwark against U.S. influence on the Korean Peninsula. But many observers say China is reluctant to form a three-way, anti-West alliance with North Korea and Russia as it prefers a stable regional security environment to tackle numerous economic challenges and maintain relationships with Europe and its Asian neighbors. North Korea and Russia have moved significantly closer to each other amid widespread outside suspicions that North Korea has supplied conventional weapons to Russia for its war in Ukraine in return for military and economic assistance. During a meeting in Pyongyang in June, Kim and Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a pact stipulating mutual military assistance if either country is attacked, in what was considered the two countries’ biggest defense deal since the end of the Cold War. North Korea is locked in confrontations with the U.S., South Korea and their partners over its advancing nuclear program. Kim has said he was forced to expand both nuclear and conventional capabilities to cope with U.S.-led security threats. On Sunday, KCNA reported that Kim oversaw a live artillery firing drill by cadets of a military academy. After watching the drill, Kim said training programs at the military academy must focus on 'the guerrilla war tactics to wipe out the enemies through rapid mobile and surprise operations,' according to KCNA.	https://apnews.com/article/north-korea-kim-china-xi-f2b1aebf0016cc32fb40600802540a21	2024-10-05T18:57:18-07:00	
South Korean leader says North Korea wants US attention by showing off nuclear might	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korea’s recent disclosure of a nuclear facility was likely an attempt to grab U.S. attention ahead of next month's presidential election, and the North will likely stage major provocations like a nuclear test explosion and a long-range missile test, South Korea’s president says. President Yoon Suk Yeol shared his government’s assessment on the recent moves by North Korea with The Associated Press, before he leaves Sunday for a three-nation trip that includes a stop in Laos for summits with Southeast Asian and other world leaders. At Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)-related meetings, Yoon says he’ll emphasize that North Korea’s nuclear disarmament is essential to regional peace. 'At the upcoming ASEAN-related summits, I will stress the importance of denuclearization of North Korea, which is a prerequisite for realizing a free, peaceful and prosperous Indo-Pacific region,' Yoon said in written responses to questions from the AP. 'This will serve to send a clear message that the international community will never condone North Korea’s reckless actions,' he said. Concerns about North Korea have grown in recent weeks, with the country unveiling a secretive uranium-enrichment facility, vowing to build more nuclear weapons and continuing its provocative missile tests. Last week, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un threatened to destroy South Korea with his nuclear weapons, if provoked. Many foreign experts say North Korea eventually hopes to use an expanded nuclear arsenal as leverage to win outside concessions like sanctions relief, after a new U.S. president is elected. They say Kim likely thinks a win by Republican candidate Donald Trump, whom he engaged in high-stakes nuclear diplomacy in 2018-19, would increase his chances to get what he wants than Democratic candidate Kamala Harris. During campaigns, Trump boasted about his personal ties with Kim, while Harris said she won’t 'cozy up to tyrants and dictators like Kim Jong Un who are rooting for Trump.' The Sept. 13 disclosure of the nuclear site showed Kim’s defiance of U.S.-led efforts to eliminate his advancing nuclear program. It was North Korea’s first unveiling of a facility to produce weapons-grade uranium since the country showed one at its main Yongbyon nuclear complex to visiting American scholars led by nuclear physicist Siegfried Hecker in 2010. Hecker said the centrifuge hall shown in the recent North Korean photos was not the same one that he saw in 2010. 'North Korea seems to have recently disclosed its nuclear facility in order to draw attention from the United States and the international community in the run-up to the U.S. presidential election, and it is likely that North Korea will carry out additional provocations such as nuclear tests and ICBM (intercontinental ballistic missile) launches going forward,' Yoon said. Yoon didn’t elaborate whether South Korea has detected any suspicious activities in North Korea that indicate its preparations for nuclear and ICBM tests. He said South Korea is closely monitoring North Korea’s movements through the South Korea-U.S. combined intelligence and surveillance assets. North Korea has conducted six underground nuclear tests since 2006, and numerous ICBM test-launches in recent years. Additional tests are likely meant to further hone its nuclear and missile capabilities. Many observers assess North Korea has yet to possess functioning nuclear missiles that can reach the U.S. mainland, though it likely has ones that can strike all of South Korea and Japan. Since his inauguration in 2022, Yoon, a conservative, has made a stronger military alliance with the United States the center of his foreign policy to cope with North Korea's evolving nuclear threats. He’s also taken a major step toward moving beyond historical disputes with Japan to beef up a trilateral Seoul-Washington-Tokyo security partnership. Such moves have enraged North Korea, which has called Yoon 'a traitor' and ignored his calls for dialogue. There are some potential worries about the South Korea-U.S. alliance if Trump returns to the White House. He had previously asked South Korea to drastically increase its share for the cost of the U.S. military deployment on its soil. Some experts say Trump's possible push for a new round of negotiation with Kim could complicate Yoon's approach on North Korea's nuclear program. But Yoon said that he's confident that the 'ironclad' South Korea-U.S. alliance will continue to advance steadily regardless of the outcome of the U.S. election. 'There is a firm bipartisan support for the ROK-U.S. alliance in the United States,' Yoon said. 'Numerous leading U.S. Democrats and Republicans have publicly stated their staunch support for the alliance and are continuously visiting Korea for consultations to enhance the bilateral relations.' The ROK stands for the Republic of Korea, South Korea's formal name. Yoon also expressed confidence that South Korea and Japan will continue to advance their bilateral ties under Japan's new Cabinet led by Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, who took office last week. Yoon's office said the two countries are discussing arranging a meeting between Yoon and Ishiba on the sidelines of the ASEAN summit. Yoon said he believes North Korea's nuclear threats against South Korea are aimed at fomenting internal divisions in South Korea and tightening its domestic control with heightened military tensions on the Korean Peninsula. 'The North Korean regime’s past claim that its nuclear development was never intended to target the Republic of Korea, since we are one nation, has been debunked,' Yoon said. Asked about North Korea's repeated launches of trash-carrying balloons toward South Korea, Yoon said that North Korea 'will face consequences that it will find difficult to withstand' if the safety of South Korean people is jeopardized. He didn't elaborate what specific steps his government is considering. Before visiting Laos, Yoon is to travel to the Philippines and Singapore. At the ASEAN-related summits, Yoon said that a key issue that South Korea plans to raise other than the North Korean nuclear program is the establishment of the ROK-ASEAN comprehensive strategic partnership. He said South Korea will further expand cooperation with ASEAN on a range of areas such as politics, military exchanges, cybersecurity, environments and a safety net against financial crises.	https://apnews.com/article/south-korea-yoon-north-nuclear-asean-3e6a6839383efed921afc12351e3ba8c	2024-10-05T14:10:12-07:00

Health workers in Lebanon describe deadly Israeli attacks on colleagues and fear more	BEIRUT (AP) — Israel's military struck outside the gates of a hospital in southern Lebanon without warning on Friday, killing seven paramedics and forcing the facility to close, the hospital director told The Associated Press a day after one of the most deadly attacks on health workers in the weeks since fighting escalated between Israel and Hezbollah. The account of the Friday airstrikes that flung hospital doors off their hinges and shattered glass was the latest to detail attacks that Lebanon's health ministry says have killed dozens of health workers. Marjayoun hospital director Mounes Kalakesh said that even before Friday's attack, ambulance crews in the area were so reluctant to operate that the facility had not received anyone wounded for days. 'We have not been able to work. There was fear and panic among the staff,' he said. Kalakesh said the government hospital didn't receive any warning from Israeli forces before the attack, even though nearby villages have received such warnings to evacuate. Israel has not commented specifically on the incident. Friday's attack came hours before Israel’s Arabic-language military spokesman accused the Hezbollah militant group, based in southern Lebanon, of using ambulances to transport weapons and fighters, and warned medical teams to stay clear of the group. The spokesman provided no evidence. It is a charge that Lebanese officials and hospital directors, including Kalakesh, deny. Lebanon’s health minister has accused Israel of committing 'a war crime' by targeting medical teams and paramedics. The health ministry on Thursday said 40 paramedics, firefighters and health care workers had been killed in Israeli attacks over three days, making it even more challenging to care for people wounded in the intense fighting. The ministry has said more than 100 health workers have been killed in the year since the war in Gaza began and since Israel and Hezbollah stepped up exchanges of fire along the border. The paramedics with the Islamic Health Committee are part of the coordinated health ministry response to crises in Lebanon. Other civil defense teams have expressed concern for their safety, with some saying they came under attack while clearly identified and operating in areas where they were transporting the wounded or putting out fires. Israeli strikes have landed near the Marjayoun hospital before but never had come so close, Kalakesh said. He described the paramedics dying in their burning vehicles. The 45-bed hospital is now shut down. 'I am responsible for this staff. I must protect them,' Kalakesh said, explaining the decision to evacuate. At the time of the Friday attack, there were 30 staff in the hospital. His team was already exhausted after a year of working close to the front line. Other groups have expressed concern. A Lebanese Red Cross convoy, escorted by Lebanese troops and coordinated with the U.N. peacekeeping force in Lebanon, came under fire on Thursday. A Lebanese soldier was killed and four Red Cross volunteers were wounded. Separately on Thursday, Israeli forces struck rescue teams with the Islamic Health Committee in Beirut's southern suburbs and the southern village of Odeissah, killing at least four. In Odeissah, responding ambulances were hit by Israeli fire and three medics who were wounded in the initial attack were killed as rescuers tried to reach them, the health ministry said. In the Beirut suburbs, the team working to remove rubble from the initial airstrike was hit in a drone attack that killed a driver and wounded seven, said Islamic Health Committee spokesman Mahmoud Karaki. Targeting the health sector undermines the safety net for the public, Karaki said, He said 145 of his team members have been wounded over the past year. Lebanon’s health ministry has said nine hospitals and 45 health care centers have been damaged during that time. Hours after the Friday attack outside Marjayoun hospital, another hospital in the southern town of Bint Jbeil was shelled by Israeli forces after receiving a warning to evacuate. Nine members of the medical and nursing staff at Salah Ghandour Hospital were wounded, most of them seriously. The hospital later shut down because of the damage.	https://apnews.com/article/lebanon-israel-medics-hezbollah-hospitals-6c7f75c921c9deec0fa5c160ce639664	2024-10-05T11:39:25-07:00	
Born on Oct. 7, Ali's first year has played out against the backdrop of the Israel-Hamas war	NUSEIRAT, Gaza Strip (AP) — Ali Al-Taweel was born as Israeli warplanes started to pound the Gaza Strip after Hamas’ surprise cross-border attack on southern Israel. Now, the Palestinian child will celebrate his first birthday as the Israeli-Hamas war reaches its one-year mark. For his family, it's been a year filled with uncertainty and anxiety as they moved from place to place amid widespread destruction and limited resources. 'I had arranged another, very sweet life for him,' Ali’s mother, Amal Al-Taweel, told The Associated Press in an interview. 'The war has changed everything.' When the war began on Oct. 7 of last year, Al-Taweel was being rushed to a hospital in central Gaza to give birth to a child she and her husband, Mustafa Al-Taweel, had sought for three years. After Ali’s birth, his family returned to their home in the Zahrah neighborhood, just north of Wadi Gaza, but were forced to flee on Oct. 18, just a day before Israeli warplanes bombed the area, Al-Taweel said. Since then, they have been living in relatives’ homes and shelters across central and southern Gaza, including the city of Rafah before the Israeli military invaded it in May. They now shelter in the house of Al-Taweel’s parents in the Nuseirat refugee camp, along with 15 other relatives. 'It was a very difficult year, bad in every way — from a health perspective, from a psychological perspective,' the 30-year-old said, adding that her child has been raised against the backdrop of daily bombing and killing. The Hamas-led attack on Oct. 7, 2023, killed some 1,200 people — mostly civilians — and took about 250 hostage, including children and a newborn. Israel responded with one of the deadliest and most destructive military campaigns in recent history. The war has killed about 42,000 Palestinians, many of them women and children, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which doesn’t differentiate between civilians and combatants. More than 80% of Gaza’s population of 2.3 million have been forced to flee their homes and cram into a tent camp on Gaza’s shore. A quarter of the strip’s population faces starvation amid an Israel-imposed blockade, allowing only limited delivery of aid, according to the United Nations. Al-Taweel said every stage of Ali's life has been difficult 'from the time he started crawling, to when his teeth came out, to when he started his first steps, to when he started walking.' And she worried constantly about his safety, recalling that he was slightly injured when a strike hit close to her sister’s house in the camp, shattering the windows. Al-Taweel counted multiple challenges she and her husband, who lost his job as a day laborer in a seaside restaurant in Gaza City, have faced since the war began. Ali didn’t receive any vaccinations in his first six months, making him vulnerable to disease, his mother said. And, with the blockade in place, she has struggled to obtain formula and diapers. 'They do not exist, and if they exist, they are very expensive and we can’t afford them,' she said. Israel has severely restricted aid deliveries of food, water, medicine and other supplies into Gaza during the war. U.N. agencies and aid groups working in the enclave have long complained about lack of access and crippling restrictions on aid delivery. 'There is no single word that can describe the past year,' said Sondos Alashqar, who works with the Medical Aid for Palestine group. Alashqar said that the hardships Palestinians saw during this past year exceeded what their grandparents experienced during the 1948 Nakba — or catastrophe — when some 700,000 Palestinians fled or were forced from what is now Israel. 'We witnessed numerous death-and-life situations,' she said. 'It was one of the hardest years we’ve even lived — harder than what our grandparents experienced.' Al-Taweel said that constant bombing, displacement and destruction have made it difficult for her to raise her child as she had planned in his first year. 'It (the year) was full of tension, fear, anxiety, displacement, bombing and destruction,' she said. 'He was not like any other child who lives in a safe, peaceful, and healthy (environment).' ___ Magdy reported from Cairo.	https://apnews.com/article/gaza-israel-war-anniversary-birthday-child-515add1ecaeefeab07429ce4eded92b1	2024-10-05T07:46:50-07:00	
Congo finally begins mpox vaccinations in a drive to slow outbreaks	GOMA, Congo (AP) — Congolese authorities on Saturday began vaccination against mpox, nearly two months after the disease outbreak that spread from Congo to several African countries and beyond was declared a global emergency by the World Health Organization. The 265,000 doses donated to Congo by the European Union and the U.S. were rolled out in the eastern city of Goma in North Kivu province, where hospitals and health workers have been overstretched, struggling to contain the new and possibly more infectious strain of mpox. Congo, with about 30,000 suspected mpox cases and 859 deaths, accounts for more than 80% of all the cases and 99% of all the deaths reported in Africa this year. All of the Central African nation’s 26 provinces have recorded mpox cases. Although most mpox infections and deaths recorded in Congo are in children under age 15, the doses being administered are only meant for adults and will be given to at-risk populations and front-line workers, Health Minister Roger Kamba said this week. 'Strategies have been put in place by the services in order to vaccinate all targeted personnel,' Muboyayi ChikayaI, the minister's chief of staff, said as he kicked off the vaccination. At least 3 million doses of the vaccine approved for use in children are expected from Japan in the coming days, Kamba said. Mpox, also known as monkeypox, had been spreading mostly undetected for years in Africa before the disease prompted the 2022 global outbreak that saw wealthy countries quickly respond with vaccines from their stockpiles while Africa received only a few doses despite pleas from its governments. However, unlike the global outbreak in 2022 that was overwhelmingly focused in gay and bisexual men, mpox in Africa is now being spread via sexual transmission as well as through close contact among children, pregnant women and other vulnerable groups, Dr. Dimie Ogoina, the chair of WHO’s mpox emergency committee, recently told reporters. More than 34,000 suspected cases and 866 deaths from the virus have been recorded across 16 countries in Africa this year. That is a 200% increase compared to the same period last year, the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. But access to vaccines remains a challenge. The continent of 1.4 billion people has only secured commitment for 5.9 million doses of mpox vaccines, expected to be available from October through December, Dr. Jean Kaseya, head of the Africa CDC, told reporters last week. Congo remains a priority, he said. At the vaccination drive in Goma, Dr Jean Bruno Kibunda, the WHO representative, warned that North Kivu province is at a risk of a major outbreak due to the 'promiscuity observed in the camps' for displaced people, as one of the world's biggest humanitarian crisis caused by armed violence unfolds there. The news of the vaccination program brought relief among many in Congo, especially in hospitals that had been struggling to manage the outbreak. 'If everyone could be vaccinated, it would be even better to stop the spread of the disease,' said Dr. Musole Mulambamunva Robert, the medical director of Kavumu Hospital, one of the mpox treatment centers in eastern Congo. Eastern Congo has been beset by conflict for years, with more than 100 armed groups vying for a foothold in the mineral-rich area near the border with Rwanda. Some have been accused of carrying out mass killings. ___ Associated Press writers Jean-Yves Kamale in Kinshasa, Congo and Chinedu Asadu in Abuja, Nigeria contributed to this report. —— The Associated Press receives financial support for global health and development coverage in Africa from the Gates Foundation.

Ukraine downs a Russian warplane and Russia claims gains in the east	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukrainian forces said they shot down a Russian fighter plane on Saturday while Russia claimed it made gains in Ukraine’s east. The Russian bomber was shot down near the city of Kostiantynivka in the Donetsk province, head of the Kostiantynivka Military Administration Serhiy Horbunov was quoted as saying by Ukraine’s public broadcaster, Suspilne. Photos showed charred remains of an aircraft after it landed on a house that caught fire. Also in the partially occupied Donetsk province, Russia’s Defense Ministry claimed Saturday that it had taken control of the village of Zhelanne Druhe. If confirmed, the capture would come three days after Ukrainian forces said they were withdrawing from the front-line town of Vuhledar, some 33 kilometers (21 miles) from Zhelanne Druhe, following a hard-fought two-year defense. Although unlikely to change the course of the war, the loss of Vuhledar is indicative of Kyiv’s worsening position, in part the result of Washington's refusal to grant Ukraine permission to strike targets deep inside Russian territory and preventing Kyiv from degrading Moscow’s capabilities. Zelenskyy will present his victory plan to allies Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Saturday that he will present his 'victory plan' at the Oct. 12 meeting of the Ramstein group of nations that supplies arms to Ukraine. 'We will present the victory plan — clear, concrete steps towards a just end to the war. The determination of our partners and the strengthening of Ukraine are what can stop Russian aggression,' he wrote on X, adding that the 25th Ramstein meeting would be the first to take place at the leaders’ level. Zelenskyy presented his plan to U.S. President Joe Biden in Washington last week. Its contents have not been made public but it is known that the plan includes Ukraine’s membership of NATO and the provision of long-range missiles to strike inside Russia. Russia shells southern Ukraine and a Ukraine drone hits a bus Meanwhile, two people died in Russian shelling in Ukraine’s southern Zaporizhzhia region, regional Gov. Ivan Fedorov said. Ukraine’s air force said that Russia had launched three guided missiles and 13 attack drones at Ukraine overnight into Saturday. It said the missiles were intercepted, three drones were shot down over the Odesa region and 10 others were lost. Nine people were wounded when a Ukrainian drone struck a passenger bus in the city of Horlivka in the partially occupied Donetsk region, the city’s Russian-installed Mayor Ivan Prikhodko said. Russia’s Defense Ministry said Saturday that air defenses shot down 10 Ukrainian drones overnight in three border regions, including seven over the Belgorod region, two over the Kursk region, and one over the Voronezh region. ___ Morton reported from London. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-donetsk-4f53538ff4b20c74a36823d365f4d269	2024-10-05T03:52:07-07:00	
European cities brace for pro-Palestinian rallies amid high alert as Oct. 7 anniversary approaches	ROME (AP) — Hundreds of thousands of pro-Palestinian demonstrators were expected to take to the streets across Europe on Saturday calling for a cease-fire as the first anniversary of the Hamas attacks on Israel approached. Security forces in several countries warned of heightened levels of alert in major cities, amid concerns that the escalating conflict in the Middle East could inspire new terror attacks in Europe or that some of the protests could turn violent. Massive rallies are planned in several European cities, including London, Berlin, Paris and Rome through next week, with the largest gatherings expected from Saturday to Monday. Events will peak on Monday, the date of the anniversary. By midday Saturday, thousands had gathered in central London’s Russell Square amid a significant police presence. Some of the march’s organizers had said they planned to target companies and institutions they claimed were 'complicit in Israel’s crimes,' including Barclays Bank and the British Museum. Protests are also taking place in other parts of the world. In the Philippines on Saturday, dozens of left-wing activists protested near the U.S. Embassy in Manila, where police prevented them from getting closer to the seaside compound. On Oct. 7 last year, Hamas launched a surprise attack into Israel, killing 1,200 Israelis, taking 250 people hostage and setting off a war with Israel that has shattered much of the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip. More than 41,000 Palestinians have been killed since then in Gaza, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not differentiate between fighters and civilians. It says more than half were women and children. Nearly 100 Israeli hostages remain in Gaza, with fewer than 70 believed to be alive. Israelis have experienced attacks — missiles from Iran and Hezbollah, explosive drones from Yemen, fatal shootings and stabbings — as the region braces for further escalation. In late September, Israel shifted some of its focus to Hezbollah, which holds much of the power in parts of southern Lebanon and some other areas of the country, attacking the militants with exploding pagers, airstrikes and, eventually, incursions into Lebanon. Rally Banned in Rome Pro-Palestinian protests calling for an immediate cease-fire have repeatedly taken place across Europe and around the globe in the past year and have often turned violent, with confrontations between demonstrators and law enforcement officers. In Rome, a rally was planned for Saturday afternoon — with about 30,000 demonstrators expected — in spite of a ban by local police chiefs who refused to authorize protests in the Italian capital, citing public security concerns. Italian authorities believed that the timing of the planned rally risked the Oct. 7 attack being 'glorified,' local media reported. Interior Minister Matteo Piantedosi also stressed that, ahead of the key anniversary, Europe is on high alert for potential terror attacks. 'This is not a normal situation … We are already in a condition of maximum prevention,' he said. A large crowd was also expected to gather in central London on Saturday afternoon. Ben Jamal, director of the Palestine Solidarity Campaign in Britain, said he and others will keep organizing marches until action against Israel is taken. 'We need to be out on the streets in even bigger numbers to stop this carnage and stop Britain being drawn into it,' Jamal said. In Berlin, a march is scheduled from the Brandenburg Gate to Bebelplatz on Sunday. Local media reported that security forces have warned of potential overload due to the scale of protests. German authorities pointed to increasing antisemitic and violent incidents in recent days. France was also on alert for new protests on Saturday. Earlier this week, Interior minister Bruno Retailleau warned the country’s regional prefects, expressing concern about possible tensions and saying that the terrorist threat was high. —— Hui reported from London	https://apnews.com/article/mideast-israel-gaza-war-protests-rallies-propalestine-terror-alerts-b314ac9fc24ab91e3c0639405a15d5d0	2024-10-05T03:09:26-07:00	
Israel strikes Lebanon, hitting Beirut suburbs and the north	TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Israel expanded its bombardment in Lebanon on Saturday, hitting Beirut’s southern suburbs with 12 airstrikes and striking a Palestinian refugee camp deep in northern Lebanon for the first time. The attack on the Beddawi refugee camp near the northern city of Tripoli killed an official with Hamas’s military wing, along with his wife and two young daughters, the Palesitnian militant group said in a statement. Tripoli is much farther north than the majority of Israel’s strikes, which have been concentrated in southern Lebanon and Beirut. Israel has killed several Hamas officials in Lebanon since the Israel-Hamas war began in October last year, in addition to most of the top leadership of Hezbollah. Hundreds of thousands flee Lebanon as battle continues At least six people were killed in more than a dozen Israeli airstrikes overnight and into Saturday, according to National News Agency, Lebanon’s official news agency. The Israeli military said special forces were carrying out targeted ground raids against Hezbollah infrastructure in southern Lebanon, destroying missiles, launchpads, watchtowers and weapons storage facilities. The military said troops also dismantled tunnel shafts that Hezbollah used to approach the Israeli border. Some 1,400 Lebanese, including Hezbollah fighters and civilians, have been killed and some 1.2 million driven from their homes since Israel escalated its strikes in late September aiming to cripple Hezbollah and push it away from the countries’ shared border. On Tuesday, Israel launched what it called a limited ground operation into southern Lebanon. Nine Israeli troops have been killed in close fighting in the area in the past few days, the military said. Nearly 375,000 people have crossed from Lebanon into Syria fleeing Israeli strikes in less than two weeks, according to a Lebanese government committee. Associated Press journalists saw thousands of people continuing to cross the Masnaa Border Crossing on foot even after Israeli airstrikes left huge craters in the road leading up to it on Thursday. More strikes and evacuation orders in Gaza Also on Saturday, Palestinian medical officials said Israeli strikes in northern and central Gaza killed at least nine people, including two children. One strike hit a group of people in the northern town of Beit Hanoun, killing at least five people, including two children, according to the Health Ministry’s Ambulance and Emergency service. Another strike hit a house in the northern part of the Nuseirat refugee camp, killing at least four people, the Awda hospital said. The strike also left a number of people wounded, it said. The Israeli military did not have any immediate comment on the strikes, but it has long accused Hamas of operating from within civilian areas. The Israeli military warned Palestinians to evacuate along the strategic Netzarim corridor in central Gaza, which was at the heart of obstacles to a ceasefire deal earlier this summer. The military told people in parts of the Nuseirat and Bureij refugee camps to evacuate to Muwasi, an area along Gaza's shore the military has designated a humanitarian zone. It’s unclear how many Palestinians are currently living in the areas ordered evacuated, parts of which were evacuated previously. Almost 42,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza during the nearly year-long war, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry, which does not differentiate between civilian and militant deaths.	https://apnews.com/article/mideast-wars-lebanon-hezbollah-hamas-5-october-2024-a8b70daeccc57a86fc6d939c604f2caf	2024-10-05T02:44:37-07:00	
Russian prosecutors seek 7-year sentence for US man accused of fighting for Ukraine	MOSCOW (AP) — Russian prosecutors asked for a seven-year sentence in the trial of a U.S. citizen accused of fighting as a mercenary in Ukraine against Russia, Russian news agencies reported Saturday. Prosecutors asked the court to take into account 72-year-old Stephen Hubbard’s age and said he has admitted guilt, according to Interfax. They asked that Hubbard serve the sentence in a maximum-security penal colony. In Russia, participating in mercenary activities is a criminal offense punishable by imprisonment for a term of 7-15 years. Prosecutors accuse Hubbard of signing a contract with the Ukrainian military after Russia sent troops into Ukraine in February 2022, for which he allegedly was to receive at least $1,000. He reportedly underwent training, received a personal firearm and fought in the Ukrainian military as a mercenary until April 2022, when he was detained by the Russian military. The U.S. Embassy in Moscow told The Associated Press it was 'aware of the reports of the arrest of an American citizen,' but said it could not comment any further 'due to privacy restrictions'. Russian courts convict more than 99% of defendants, and prosecutors can appeal sentences that they regard as too lenient. Arrests of Americans have become increasingly common in Russia in recent years. Concern has risen that Russia could be targeting U.S. nationals for arrest to later use as bargaining chips in talks to bring back Russians convicted of crimes in the U.S. and Europe. The U.S. and Russia in August completed their largest prisoner swap in post-Soviet history, a deal involving 24 people, many months of negotiations and concessions from other European countries who released Russians in their custody as part of the exchange. Several U.S. citizens remain behind bars in Russia following the swap.	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-us-mercenary-prosecutors-85337ef2e4c84fd1df6962aec553bc7e	2024-10-05T00:52:32-07:00	
Rescue teams search for missing after floods, landslides kill at least 16 in Bosnia	JABLANICA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) — Rescue teams on Saturday searched for those still missing after flash floods and landslides hit parts of Bosnia, killing at least 16 people and injuring scores more. Construction machines worked to remove piles of rocks and debris covering the central town of Jablanica after the rainstorm early on Friday. Huge quantities of rain fell in the area around Jablanica and nearby Konjic, causing sudden floods that broke into people's homes as they were sleeping. Surging waters also triggered landslides that collapsed roads and hills, covering villages in mud and cutting off entire areas. Bosnian media are reporting that rocks from a nearby quarry fell on the village of Donja Jablanica, burying houses. Alka Gusic, a resident of Donja Jablanica, lost her brother and his entire family while her own son has been hospitalized. Overnight on Friday, she said, a frightening rumble woke her up from her sleep. 'I thought it was an earthquake,' said Gusic. She waited until morning to venture out. 'I saw my brother's son being pulled out. He was lying on the ground – it was obvious (he was dead).' 'God help us,' she cried. 'I lost four of them, house destroyed completely, no one stayed alive, no one.' Officials have said that at least 16 people are confirmed dead so far, including a baby. At least 10 are still missing while dozens are injured. Rescuers sealed off Jablanica, banning any entry for outsiders while the search took place. Some houses were submerged up to their roofs and as the water withdrew, rescuers could be seen walking over piles of rubble left behind. Near the town of Konjic that was also hit by the storm, officials said some villages remained cut off on Saturday. 'Kilometers of roads no longer exist, nearly all bridges have been destroyed,' Husein Hodzic from the local civil protection unit told regional N1 television. 'There is no electricity, all power poles have been swept away. There are no phone lines.' Bosnia's election authorities said local elections set for Sunday will be postponed in the flood-hit municipalities. Human-caused climate change increases the intensity of rainfall because warm air holds more moisture. This summer, the Balkans were also hit by long-lasting record temperatures, causing a drought. Scientists said the dried-out land has hampered the absorption of floodwaters. Flooding was also reported in Croatia and Montenegro in the previous days but caused less damage and no fatalities. ___ Jovana Gec contributed to this report from Belgrade, Serbia.	https://apnews.com/article/balkans-bosnia-floods-rain-missing-b771f8846c1e015b21a7e97321c9fd2f	2024-10-05T00:34:23-07:00	
Militants kill six Pakistani soldiers during a shootout in the country's northwest	PESHAWAR, Pakistan (AP) — Militants killed six Pakistani soldiers during a shootout in the northwest, the army said Saturday. It’s the latest unrest in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, which borders Afghanistan and is a base for armed groups including the Pakistani Taliban. The troops died in an overnight operation in North Waziristan on Saturday, according to an army statement. The statement also said six militants were killed. The army said a separate operation killed two militants in Swat, also in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. One of them was said to be involved in an attack on a convoy of foreign ambassadors in the area earlier this month. Also Saturday, cellphone services remained suspended in Islamabad as it entered a second day of a lockdown aimed at thwarting rallies in support of ex-leader Imran Khan. He is in prison on multiple charges. Shipping containers have blocked off the city’s entry and exit points, but videos from Khan’s political party showed his supporters piled into vehicles and attempting to head toward Islamabad. The chief minister of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Ali Amin Gandapur, and others in the convoy worked throughout the night to remove shipping containers from the road, the party said. Khan’s PTI party said it plans to hold a rally in Lahore.	https://apnews.com/article/pakistan-militants-northwest-imran-khan-rally-c85d8f925b616bbbf45bbb3a54a1e3a9	2024-10-05T00:13:07-07:00	
A van packed with migrants skids off a road in Croatia, killing 2 and injuring 25	ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) — A van packed with migrants slid off the road and overturned in central Croatia early Saturday, killing two people and injuring 25, including some seriously, police and doctors said. The accident happened around 1 a.m. near Peklenica, some 100 kilometers (60 miles) southeast of Zagreb, the capital, said a police statement. A patrol spotted the van with German license plates overnight and started to follow it when the driver increased the speed, the statement said. After several kilometers (miles), the officers saw the van overturned in a ditch by the road after it apparently hit a concrete bridge, a house and a power pole. Doctors told Croatian media that 9 people were seriously injured and were being treated in hospitals in the area. They include people from Iraq, Turkey and Syria, as well as Palestinians. A similar accident in September in Croatia injured 14 people, illustrating the dangers migrants face as they flee wars and poverty in the Middle East, Africa and Asia. Migrants often seek help from people smugglers to cross borders without authorization to reach wealthy Western European countries. Migrants are often forced to travel in crammed boats or vans. ___ Follow AP migration coverage at: https://apnews.com/hub/migration	https://apnews.com/article/croatia-migration-deadly-van-accident-d1db4dc5da650285d8ed44f948c44554	2024-10-04T23:03:41-07:00	
Middle East latest: Two Hamas officials killed in Israeli strikes in Lebanon	An Israeli strike on a refugee camp in north Lebanon has killed Hamas official Saeed Atallah Ali and his family, the militant group said Saturday. Hamas later said another military wing member was killed in an Israeli strike in Lebanon’s eastern Bekaa Valley. The strikes come a day after another Israeli airstrike cut off a main highway linking Lebanon with Syria, leaving two huge craters on either side of the road. Israel began a ground incursion Tuesday into Lebanon against the Hezbollah militant group. The Israeli military said nine soldiers have died in the conflict in southern Lebanon. Israel and Hezbollah have traded fire across the Lebanon border almost daily since the day after Hamas’ cross-border attack on Oct. 7, 2023, which killed 1,200 Israelis and took 250 others hostage. Israel declared war on the Hamas militant group in the Gaza Strip in response. As the Israel-Hamas war reaches the one-year mark, more than 41,000 Palestinians have been killed in the territory, and just over half the dead have been women and children, according to local health officials. Nearly 2,000 people have been killed in Lebanon in the latest conflict, most of them since Sept. 23, according to the Lebanese Health Ministry. ___ Here is the latest: Apparent Israeli airstrike kills at least 18 in central Gaza, Palestinian officials say DEAIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — An apparent Israeli airstrike early Sunday killed at least 18 people in central Gaza, Palestinian medical officials said. The strike hit a mosque sheltering displaced people near the al-Aqsa Martyrs hospital in the town of Deir al-Balah, the hospital said in a statement. An Associated Press journalist counted the bodies at the hospital morgue. Hospital records showed that the dead were all men. Another two men were critically wounded, the hospital said. The Israeli military did not immediately comment about the strike on the mosque. The latest strikes add to the mounting Palestinian death toll in Gaza, which is now nearing 42,000 according to the Palestinian Health Ministry. The ministry does not differentiate between civilian and militant deaths, but many of the dead were women and children. New explosions in south Beirut suburbs as Israel expands bombing in Lebanon Powerful new explosions rocked Beirut’s southern suburbs late Saturday as Israel expanded its bombardment in Lebanon, also striking a Palestinian refugee camp deep in the north for the first time as it targeted both Hezbollah and Hamas fighters. Thousands of people in Lebanon, including Palestinian refugees, continued to flee the widening conflict in the region, while rallies were held around the world marking the approaching anniversary of the start of the war in Gaza. The strong explosions began near midnight after Israel’s military urged residents to evacuate areas in Beirut’s Haret Hreik and Choueifat neighborhoods. AP video showed the blasts illuminating the densely populated southern suburbs, where Hezbollah has a strong presence. They followed a day of sporadic strikes and the nearly continuous buzz of reconnaissance drones. Israel’s military confirmed it was striking targets near Beirut and said about 30 projectiles had crossed from Lebanon into Israeli territory. Israeli troops destroy Hezbollah tunnel near the border in south Lebanon TEL AVIV — The Israeli military says its troops have located and destroyed a 250-meter-long Hezbollah tunnel in southern Lebanon near the Israeli border. The army said Saturday that troops uncovered command centers, combat packs and a large number of weapons in the tunnel. There were also living quarters equipped with showers, a kitchen and stockpiles of food. The army says the tunnel did not cross into Israeli territory. The military says it has been carrying out ground raids against Hezbollah infrastructure in southern Lebanon for days, destroying missiles, launchpads, weapons storage facilities and multiple tunnel shafts that it says Hezbollah used to approach the Israeli border. Brazil evacuates 229 people from Lebanon RIO DE JANEIRO — A plane chartered by the Brazilian Air Force has left Beirut for Brazil carrying 229 passengers including 10 infants. Brazil’s foreign ministry said in a statement Saturday that three pets are also on the flight headed for Sao Paulo — Brazil’s first flight evacuating nationals from Lebanon. The ministry says it was supposed to leave Friday but was stalled due to security reasons. It says a second flight is scheduled for next week, depending on security conditions on the ground. Two Brazilian adolescents have been killed by Israeli bombardments in Lebanon, which is home to the largest community of Brazilians in the Middle East at around 21,000. Iran’s foreign minister hints at cease-fire discussions DAMASCUS, Syria — Iran’s foreign minister says some countries are making efforts to broker cease-fires in Lebanon and the Gaza Strip. Abbas Araghchi told reporters in Damascus that 'we are trying to reach a cease-fire in Gaza and in Lebanon.' The minister did not name the countries involved, describing them as regional states and some from outside the Middle East. He declined to provide details, saying the efforts are still 'ideas.' Araghchi says any proposal should be accepted by the Palestinian and Lebanese sides and once that happens Iran and Syria would back them. He also reiterated that Iran will retaliate to any Israeli attack, warning it would be 'stronger, and they can test our will.' Rocket sirens sound across northern Israel JERUSALEM — Rocket alert sirens have been blaring all day in northern Israel. The Israeli military says some 90 projectiles have been fired Saturday from Lebanon into Israel. Most were intercepted or fell in open areas, but several rockets fell in the northern Arab town of Deir al-Asad, where police said three people were lightly injured, and in the nearby city of Karmiel, damaging an apartment building. Slovakia evacuates nationals and others from Lebanon BRATISLAVA, Slovakia — A Slovak government plane has landed in the capital Bratislava carrying 46 people who were evacuated from Lebanon. The Slovak Foreign Ministry says another plane carrying 44 people is expected later Saturday. The ministry says 34 Slovaks are among them, as well nationals from other European countries. The Czech Foreign Ministry says 10 Czechs and three relatives with Lebanese passports will be on the second flight. They were first evacuated from Beirut to Larnaca in Cyprus by military transport plane before traveling to Bratislava on the government plane. Hamas says an Israeli strike killed a member of its military wing in Lebanon BEIRUT — Hamas says one of its members was killed in an Israeli strike in Lebanon’s eastern Bekaa Valley. The Palestinian militant group says Mohammed Lweis, who was a member of the group’s military wing the Qassam Brigade, was killed Saturday in an Israeli attack on the eastern Lebanese village of Fayda. Hours earlier, Hamas announced the deaths of another member of its military wing, his wife and two daughters in a Palestinian refugee camp in northern Lebanon. Over the past year, Israel has killed several Hamas officials in Lebanon. Reports: Israeli drone strikes car in central Syria, killing 1 BEIRUT — A Syrian opposition war monitor and pro-government media are reporting that an Israeli drone strike on a car in central Syria killed one person and wounded three. It was not immediately clear who was the target of Saturday’s airstrike near the central city of Hama, which was reported by the U.K.-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights and pro-government Sham FM radio. They did not give further details. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military. Israel regularly carries out airstrikes inside government-controlled parts of war-torn Syria but rarely acknowledges them. When it has, it says it targets Iranian-backed groups or Hezbollah weapons shipments. Almost 375,000 people have fled Lebanon for Syria in 2 weeks BEIRUT — Nearly 375,000 people have crossed from Lebanon into Syria, fleeing Israeli bombardment, in less than two weeks, Lebanese officials said. The government's crisis management unit, citing figures from Lebanese General Security, said 374,621 people — Lebanese citizens and Syrians living in Lebanon — have crossed into Syria since Sept. 23, when Israel intensified its air bombardment campaign in Lebanon. Thousands have continued to cross on foot through the main Masnaa Border Crossing even after Israeli airstrikes cut off the road leading up to it on Thursday. Associated Press journalists on Saturday saw a nonstop stream of people walking through a huge crater created by the airstrike to waiting buses on the other side. Syria's Assad praises Iran's strike on Israel DAMASCUS, Syria — Syrian President Bashar Assad praised Iran for firing nearly 200 missiles at Israel earlier this week saying it was a message to Israel that Tehran and its allies 'can deter the enemy.' Assad spoke during a meeting with visiting Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi on Saturday. In comments carried by state media, Assad said that 'resisting occupation, aggression and mass killings is a legitimate right.' Assad said the Iran-led alliance known as Axis of Resistance will remain strong because of the backing of its people. Syrian state media said Assad and Araghchi discussed ending Israel’s attacks on Lebanon. Iran has been a main backer of Assad since Syria’s civil war began in March 2011. Israel conducts more ground raids in southern Lebanon TEL AVIV, Israel — The Israeli military said on Saturday its special forces were carrying out ground raids against Hezbollah infrastructure in southern Lebanon, destroying missiles, launchpads, watchtowers and weapons storage facilities. The military said troops also dismantled tunnel shafts that Hezbollah used to approach the Israeli border. Some 1,400 Lebanese, including Hezbollah fighters and civilians, have been killed and some 1.2 million driven from their homes since Israel escalated its strikes in late September aiming to cripple Hezbollah and push it away from the countries’ shared border. On Tuesday, Israel launched what it calls a limited ground operation into southern Lebanon. Nine Israeli troops have been killed in close fighting in the area in the past few days, which is saturated with arms and explosives, the military said. Israeli strikes in Lebanon have hit civilian areas and infrastructure including hospitals and paramedics. Israeli strikes hammer Beirut suburbs BEIRUT — Beirut’s southern suburbs was hit by 12 Israeli airstrikes early Saturday, including one that badly damaged a large hall Hezbollah has used to hold ceremonies, Lebanon’s state news agency said. Later in the day, more strikes hit the area, from which tens of thousands of people have fled over the past two weeks. Israeli airstrikes also hit areas in southern and eastern Lebanon, according to state media. At least six people were killed, according to NNA. Israeli strikes in Gaza kill 9, including 2 children CAIRO — Palestinian medical officials say Israeli strikes in northern and central Gaza early Saturday have killed at least nine people, including two children. One strike hit a group of people in the northern town of Beit Hanoun, killing at least five people, including two children, according to the Health Ministry’s Ambulance and Emergency service. Another strike hit a house in the northern part of Nuseirat refugee camp, killing at least four people, the Awda hospital said. The strike also left a number of wounded people, it said. The Israeli military did not have any immediate comment on the strikes, but has long accused Hamas of operating from within civilian areas. Almost 42,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza during the almost year-long war, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry, which does not differentiate between civilian and militant deaths. Israel orders more evacuations in central Gaza CAIRO — The Israeli military on Saturday warned residents in parts of central Gaza to evacuate, saying its forces will soon operate there in response to Palestinian militants. The warnings cover areas along a strategic corridor in central Gaza, which was at the heart of obstacles to a ceasefire deal earlier this summer. The military warned Palestinians in areas of Nuseirat and Bureij refugee camps, located along the Netzarim corridor, to evacuate to an along Gaza's shore called Muwasi, which the military has designated a humanitarian zone. It’s unclear how many Palestinians are currently living in the areas affected by the order, parts of which were evacuated previously. Less than an hour after the evacuation order, Palestinians reported Israel’s artillery shelling and smoke bombing in the northern areas of Nuseirat camp. There were no immediate reports of casualties. Israeli forces have repeatedly returned to heavily destroyed areas of Gaza where they fought earlier battles against Hamas and other militants since the start of the war one year ago. The vast majority of Gaza’s population of 2.3 million people has been displaced in the war, often multiple times, and hundreds of thousands are packed into squalid tent camps. Others have remained in their homes despite being ordered to leave, saying nowhere in the isolated coastal territory feels safe. An Israeli strike on a refugee camp kills a Hamas official BEIRUT — An Israeli strike on a refugee camp in north Lebanon has killed a Hamas official and his family, the militant group said Saturday. Hamas said in a statement that the early Saturday strike on the Beddawi refugee camp struck the home of Saeed Atallah Ali, an official with Hamas’s military wing, the Qassam Brigades. Ali’s wife, Shaymaa Azzam, and their two daughters, Zeinab and Fatima — whom the statement described as children — were also killed in the attack. Beddawi camp is near the northern city of Tripoli. It was the first such strike on the camp in the recent conflict. Israel has killed several Hamas officials in Lebanon since the Israel-Hamas war began in October 2023. South Korea evacuates 97 people from Lebanon SEOUL, South Korea — A military plane evacuating 97 people from Lebanon arrived in South Korea on Saturday. South Korea's Foreign Ministry said the group on the plane includes South Korean nationals and their family members. There are about 30 South Koreans left in Lebanon besides diplomats and embassy workers who are staying. South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol instructed officials Wednesday to send military aircraft to conflict areas in the Middle East as he called a meeting to discuss the impact of the intensified fighting in the region. There are about 480 South Korean nationals living in Israel and 110 in Iran.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hezbollah-hamas-latest-mideast-5-october-2024-e8c20151ce6d01f8ac697a835314e70d	2024-10-04T21:31:31-07:00	
AP PHOTOS: In their 80s, these South Korean women learned reading and rap	CHILGOK, South Korea (AP) — Wearing an oversized bucket hat, silver chains and a black Miu Miu shirt, 82-year-old Park Jeom-sun gesticulates, her voice rising and falling with the staccato delivery of rhymes about growing chili peppers, cucumbers and eggplants. Park, nicknamed Suni, was flanked by seven longtime friends who repeated her moves and her lines. Together, they're Suni and the Seven Princesses, South Korea 's latest octogenarian sensation. With an average age of 85, they're probably the oldest rap group in the country. Born at a time when women were often marginalized in education, Park and her friends were among a group of older adults learning how to read and write the Korean alphabet, hangul, at a community center in their farming village in South Korea’s rural southeast. They were having so much fun that they started dabbling with poetry. They began writing and performing rap in summer last year. Suni and the Seven Princesses enjoy nationwide fame, appearing in commercials and going viral on social media. South Korean Prime Minister Han Duck-soo sent them a congratulatory message last month on their first anniversary, praising their passion for learning. At a road near their community center in Chilgok on Thursday, Park and her friends were rehearsing for a performance Friday evening in the capital, Seoul, where they were invited to open an event celebrating hangul heritage. 'Picking chili peppers at the pepper field, picking cucumbers at the cucumber field, picking eggplants at the eggplant field, picking zucchini at the zucchini field!' the group rapped along with Park. 'We’re back home now and it feels so good!' Park said the group usually practices two or three times a week, more if they're preparing for a show. On Friday, hundreds of people applauded and cheered, and then the group lined up for a photo with South Korean Culture Minister Yu In Chon. Park talked about the joy of learning to read, saying she can now 'go to the bank, ride the bus and go anywhere' she wants without someone helping her. 'During and after the Korean War, I couldn’t study because of the social atmosphere, but I started learning hangul in 2016,' Park said, referring to the devastating war between North and South Korea from 1950 to 1953. 'Being introduced to rap while learning Hangeul has made me feel better, and I thought it would help me stay healthy and avoid dementia.' Kang Hye-eun, Park’s 29-year-old granddaughter and a local healthcare worker who helps older adults, said she was proud to see her grandmother on television and in viral videos. 'It’s amazing that she got to know hangul like this and has started to rap,' she said.	https://apnews.com/article/south-korea-rappers-older-literacy-women-education-db7a109b38827e08804e6da20fb9414f	2024-10-04T21:26:36-07:00	
Leslie strengthens into a hurricane in the Atlantic but isn't threatening land	MIAMI (AP) — Leslie has strengthened into a hurricane in the Atlantic Ocean and isn’t threatening land, forecasters said. The storm was located Saturday about 725 miles (1,170 kilometers) west-southwest of the southernmost Cabo Verde Islands and had maximum sustained winds of 75 mph (120 kph). There were no coastal watches or warnings in effect. Meanwhile, Hurricane Kirk remained a Category 4 major hurricane, and waves from the system were affecting the the Leeward Islands, Bermuda, and the Greater Antilles, forecasters said. The storm's swells were expected to spread to the East Coast of the United States, the Atlantic Coast of Canada and the Bahamas on Saturday night and Sunday. Forecasters warned the waves could cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Kirk was expected to weaken starting Saturday, the center said. Though there were no coastal warnings or watches in effect for Kirk, the center said those in the Azores, where swells could hit Monday, should monitor the storm's progress. Kirk was about 975 miles (1,570 kilometers) east-northeast of the northern Leeward Islands with maximum sustained winds of 130 mph (209 kph). The storms churned in the Atlantic as rescuers in the U.S. Southeast searched for people unaccounted for after Hurricane Helene struck last week, leaving behind a trail of death and catastrophic damage.	https://apnews.com/article/hurricane-leslie-atlantic-ocean-b9585e905919ce6c30eda0862b818ba1	2024-10-04T19:35:55-07:00	
Solar power companies are growing fast in Africa, where 600 million still lack electricity	FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) — Companies that bring solar power to some of the poorest homes in Central and West Africa are said to be among the fastest growing on a continent whose governments have long struggled to address some of the world's worst infrastructure and the complications of climate change. The often African-owned companies operate in areas where the vast majority of people live disconnected from the electricity grid, and offer products ranging from solar-powered lamps that allow children to study at night to elaborate home systems that power kitchen appliances and plasma televisions. Prices range from less than $20 for a solar-powered lamp to thousands of dollars for home appliances and entertainment systems. Central and West Africa have some of the world’s lowest electrification rates. In West Africa, where 220 million people live without power, this is as low as 8%, according to the World Bank. Many rely on expensive kerosene and other fuels that fill homes and businesses with fumes and risk causing fires. At the last United Nations climate summit, the world agreed on the goal of tripling the capacity for renewable power generation by 2050. While the African continent is responsible for hardly any carbon emissions relative to its size, solar has become one relatively cost-effective way to provide electricity. The International Energy Agency, in a report earlier this year, said small and medium-sized solar companies are making rapid progress reaching homes but more needs to be invested to reach all African homes and businesses by 2030. About 600 million Africans lack access to electricity, it said, out of a population of more than 1.3 billion. Among the companies that made the Financial Times' annual ranking of Africa's fastest growing companies of 2023 was Easy Solar, a locally owned firm that brings solar power to homes and businesses in Sierra Leone and Liberia. The ranking went by compound annual growth rate in revenue. Co-founder Nthabiseng Mosia grew up in Ghana with frequent power cuts. She became interested in solving energy problems in Africa while at graduate school in the United States. Together with a U.S. classmate, she launched the company in Sierra Leone with electrification rates among the lowest in West Africa. 'There wasn’t really anybody doing solar at scale. And so we thought it was a good opportunity,' Mosia said in an interview. Since launching in 2016, Easy Solar has brought solar power to over a million people in Sierra Leone and Liberia, which have a combined population of more than 14 million. The company’s network includes agents and shops in all of Sierra Leone’s 16 districts and seven of nine counties in Liberia. Many communities have been connected to a stable source of power for the first time. 'We really want to go to the last mile deep into the rural areas,' Mosia said. The company began with a pilot project in Songo, a community on the outskirts of Sierra Leone’s capital Freetown. Uptake was slow at first, Mosia said. Villagers worried about the cost of solar-powered appliances, but once they began to see light in their neighbors’ homes at night, more signed on. 'We have long forgotten about kerosene,' said Haroun Patrick Samai, a Songo resident and land surveyor. 'Before Easy Solar we lived in constant danger of a fire outbreak from the use of candles and kerosene.' Altech, a solar power company based in Congo, also ranked as one of Africa's fastest growing companies. Fewer than 20% of the population in Congo has access to electricity, according to the World Bank. Co-founders Washikala Malango and Iongwa Mashangao fled conflict in Congo's South Kivu province as children and grew up in Tanzania. They decided to launch the company in 2013 to help solve the power problems they had experienced growing up in a refugee camp, relying on kerosene for power and competing with family members for light to study at night. Altech now operates in 23 out of 26 provinces in Congo, and the company expects to reach the remaining ones by the end of the year. Its founders say they have sold over 1 million products in Congo in a range of solar-powered solutions for homes and businesses, including lighting, appliances, home systems and generators. 'For the majority of our customers, this is the first time they are connected to a power source,' Malango said. Repayment rates are over 90%, Malango said, helped in part by a system that can turn off power to appliances remotely if people don't pay. ___ The Associated Press receives financial support for global health and development coverage in Africa from the Gates Foundation.

Alleged plots against US campaign are only the latest examples of Iran targeting adversaries	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Iran has emerged as a twofold concern for the United States as it nears the end of the presidential campaign. Prosecutors allege Tehran tried to hack figures associated with the election, stealing information from former President Donald Trump’s campaign. And U.S. officials have accused it of plotting to kill Trump and other ex-officials. For Iran, assassination plots and hacking aren’t new strategies. Iran saw the value and the danger of hacking in the early 2000s, when the Stuxnet virus, believed to have been deployed by Israel and the U.S., tried to damage Iran’s nuclear program. Since then, hackers attributed to state-linked operations have targeted the Trump campaign, Iranian expatriates and government officials at home. Its history of assassinations goes back further. After the 1979 Islamic Revolution, Iran killed or abducted perceived enemies living abroad. A look at Iran’s history of targeting opponents: A history of hacks For many, Iran’s behavior can be traced to the emergence of the Stuxnet computer virus. Released in the 2000s, Stuxnet wormed its way into control units for uranium-enriching centrifuges at Iran's Natanz nuclear facility, causing them to speed up, ultimately destroying themselves. Iranian scientists initially believed mechanical errors caused the damage. Ultimately though, Iran removed the affected equipment and sought its own way of striking enemies online. 'Iran had an excellent teacher in the emerging art of cyberwarfare,' wryly noted a 2020 report from the King Faisal Center for Research and Islamic Studies in Saudi Arabia. That was acknowledged by the National Security Agency in a document leaked by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden in 2015 to The Intercept, which examined a cyberattack that destroyed hard drives at Saudi Arabia’s state oil company. Iran has been suspected of carrying out that attack, called Shamoon, in 2012 and again in 2017. 'Iran, having been a victim of a similar cyberattack against its own oil industry in April 2012, has demonstrated a clear ability to learn from the capabilities and actions of others,' the document said. There also were domestic considerations. In 2009, the disputed reelection of hard-line President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad sparked the Green Movement protests. Twitter, one source of news from the demonstrations, found its website defaced by the self-described 'Iranian Cyber Army.' There’s been suspicion that the Revolutionary Guard, a major power base within Iran's theocracy, oversaw the 'Cyber Army' and other hackers. Meanwhile, Iran itself has been hacked repeatedly in embarrassing incidents. They include the mass shutdown of gas stations across Iran, as well as surveillance cameras at Tehran’s notorious Evin Prison and even state television broadcasts. Hacks offer low costs and high rewards Iranian hacking attacks, given their low cost and high reward, likely will continue as Iran faces a tense international environment surrounding Israel's conflicts with Hamas and Hezbollah, Iran's enrichment of uranium to near weapons-grade levels and the prospect of Trump becoming president again. The growth of 3G and 4G mobile internet services in Iran also made it easier for the public — and potential hackers — to access the internet. Iran has over 50 major universities with computer science or information technology programs. At least three of Iran’s top schools are thought to be affiliated with Iran’s Defense Ministry and the Guard, providing potential hackers for security forces. Iranian hacking attempts on U.S. targets have included banks and even a small dam near New York City — attacks American prosecutors linked to the Guard. While Russia is seen as the biggest foreign threat to U.S. elections, officials have been concerned about Iran. Its hacking attempts in the presidential campaign have relied on phishing — sending many misleading emails in hopes that some recipients will inadvertently provide access to sensitive information. Amin Sabeti, a digital security expert who focuses on Iran, said the tactic works. 'It’s scalable, it’s cheap and you don’t need a skill set because you just put, I don’t know, five crazy people who are hard line in an office in Tehran, then send tens of thousands of emails. If they get 10 of them, it’s enough,' he said. For Iran, hacks targeting the U.S. offer the prospect of causing chaos, undermining Trump’s campaign and obtaining secret information. 'I’ve lost count of how many attempts have been made on my emails and social media since it’s been going on for over a decade,' said Holly Dagres, a nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council who once had her email briefly hacked by Iran. 'The Iranians aren’t targeting me because I have useful information swimming in my inbox or direct messages. Rather, they hope to use my name and think tank affiliation to target others and eventually make it up the chain to high-ranking U.S. government officials who would have useful information and intelligence related to Iran.' Iran’s killings and abductions abroad Iran has vowed to exact revenge against Trump and others in his former administration over the 2020 drone strike that killed the prominent Revolutionary Guard Gen. Qassem Soleimani in Baghdad. In July, authorities said they learned of an Iranian threat against Trump and boosted security. Iran has not been linked to the assassination attempts against Trump in Florida and Pennsylvania. A Pakistani man who spent time in Iran was recently charged by federal prosecutors for allegedly plotting to carry out assassinations in the U.S., including potentially of Trump. Officials take Iran's threat seriously given its history of targeting adversaries. After the 1979 Islamic Revolution, its leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini signaled how Iran would target perceived enemies by saying, 'Islam grew with blood.' 'The great prophet of Islam, he had the Quran in one hand, and a sword in the other hand — a sword to suppress traitors,' Khomeini said. Even before creating a network of allied militias in the Mideast, Iran is suspected of targeting opponents abroad, beginning with members of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi’s former government. The attention shifted to perceived opponents of the theocracy, both in the country with the mass executions of 1988 and abroad. Outside of Iran, the so-called 'chain murders' targeted activists, journalists and other critics. One prominent incident linked to Iran was a shooting at a restaurant in Germany that killed three Iranian-Kurdish figures and a translator. In 1997, a German court implicated Iran’s top leaders in the shooting, sparking most European Union nations to withdraw their ambassadors. Iran’s targeted killings slowed after that, but didn’t stop. U.S. prosecutors link Iran’s Revolutionary Guard to a 2011 plot to kill the Saudi ambassador to Washington. Meanwhile, a suspected Israeli campaign of assassinations targeted scientists in Iran’s nuclear program. In 2015, Iran signed a nuclear deal that saw it greatly reduce its enrichment in exchange for the lifting of sanctions. Two years later, Trump was elected pledging to unilaterally withdraw America from the accord. As businesses backed away from Iran, Tehran renewed a campaign of targeting opponents abroad, but this time capturing them and bringing them to Iran for trial. Belgium arrested an Iranian diplomat, Assadollah Assadi, in 2018 and ultimately convicted him of masterminding a thwarted bomb attack against an exiled Iranian opposition group. Iran also increasingly has turned to criminal gangs for some attempts, such as what U.S. prosecutors have described as plots to kill or kidnap opposition activist Masih Alinejad. Among those targeted after Soleimani's death was former U.S. national security adviser John Bolton. The U.S. has offered a reward of up to $20 million for information leading to the capture or conviction of a Revolutionary Guard member it said arranged to kill Bolton for $300,000. An FBI agent quoted Guard Gen. Esmail Ghaani as saying in 2022 in a court filing, 'Wherever is necessary we take revenge against Americans by the help of people on their side and within their own homes without our presence.'	https://apnews.com/article/iran-hacking-assassinations-plot-6cb2929fa7065ca8d8e21c6713087258	2024-10-04T19:13:00-07:00	
One year in, war casts a shadow over every aspect of life in Israel	TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — At a busy Tel Aviv entertainment district, diners spill into outdoor seating and clink glasses as music fills the air. There’s laughter, there’s life. But all around the patrons, staring down from lampposts and shop windows, are pictures of hostages held in Gaza, stark reminders that Israel is at war and forever scarred by the deadliest attack in its history. As Israel's war with Hamas reaches its one-year mark, it can seem on the surface that much of life in the country has returned to normal. But with many still reeling from Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack, hostages remaining in captivity and a new front of warwith Hezbollah in the north, many Israelis feel depressed, despondent and angry as the war stretches into its second year. Uncertainty over the future has cast a pall over virtually every part of daily life, even as people try to maintain a sense of normalcy. 'The conversation about the situation is always there,' said activist Zeev Engelmayer, whose daily postcard project featuring illustrations of hostages or Israel's new reality has become a fixture at anti-war protests. 'Even those who are sitting in coffee shops, they’re talking about it, in every single situation I see it. It’s impossible to get away from it. It has entered into every vibration of our life.' Rattled Israelis feel hopeless Hamas' attack in which some 1,200 people were killed and 250 kidnapped shattered Israelis’ sense of security and stability in their homeland. Many have been rattled by the war's evolution. Nearly 100 hostages remain in Gaza, with less than 70 believed to be alive. Israelis have experienced attacks — missiles from Iran and Hezbollah, explosive drones from Yemen, fatal shootings and stabbings — as the region braces for further escalation. They've watched as Israel is accused of committing war crimes and genocide in Gaza and becomes increasingly isolated internationally. 'I’m almost 80 — we grew up in this country with a feeling that we have short wars, and we win them quickly,' said Israeli historian Tom Segev, who described new feelings of utter hopelessness. 'We’re not used to a long war.' Israelis have long harbored a sense that their country, born of the Holocaust's ashes and surviving a panoply of regional threats, is a success story, Segev said. They've strived, he added, for a normality akin to that of European and North American people, though their reality for decades has been anything but. 'I think that history is going backward,' he said of the past year. 'Everything we have achieved on our way to becoming a normal state isn’t happening.' Reminders are everywhere. At a Hebrew University graduation in Jerusalem, a large yellow ribbon was placed in front of the stage. A graduate who didn't attend because his brother was killed in Gaza the previous day was honored. Internal divisions grow Israel's longstanding internal divisions briefly eased in the aftermath of Hamas’ attack, but have only intensified since. Weekly protests calling for a cease-fire deal that would free hostages are attended mostly by secular Jewish Israelis who oppose Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his government. According to a September poll by Jerusalem-based think tank Israel Democracy Institute, 61 percent of right-wing Jewish Israelis — Netanyahu's base — support the war continuing. Occupied with their own trauma, most Israelis paid scant attention to the ongoing destruction in Gaza, even as the Health Ministry there put the Palestinian death toll at more than 41,000. Israeli media have reported little on the devastation. Israelis calling for a cease-fire are driven overwhelmingly by the hostages' plight. Many Israelis are furious at leaders and the military for not preventing Hamas’ attack. Tens of thousands of people are expected at an alternative ceremony marking one year since then, as a statement against the government's official commemoration. The state ceremony is being prerecorded without a live audience, in part because of fears of heckling and disruptions. 'The thing we lost on Oct. 7 — and we haven’t gotten it back — is our feeling of security,' Muli Segev, executive producer of 'Eretz Nehederet,' a popular sketch comedy show. 'Despite everything, we have been able to create a life here that’s pretty open and Western. 'Especially in Tel Aviv, we go about our lives, and we don’t think about the fact that our lives are really just pauses between wars and between explosions of violence.' In the war's early months, the show's sketches were gentler, focusing on what united Israeli society, such as the massive civilian volunteer response. Over time, they featured more pointed satire, including a reimagining of negotiations if the hostages were Israeli politicians' children — released in less than two hours. Parts of life have rebounded — beaches full of people, bustling cafes, concerts and sports back on schedules. But residents also check for the nearest bomb shelter, deal with school cancellations when violence flares up, and avoid domestic travel hubs that are now off-limits. Heartbreaking news arrives regularly, including the deaths of six hostages in August. 'It’s a nightmare; we’re just getting used to it,' said Maya Brandwine, a 33-year-old graphic designer who witnessed the Jaffa shooting that killed seven on Tuesday. 'I have so little hope. I’m sure the situation will only get worse.' Dror Rotches, a 47-year-old graphic designer, said from a Tel Aviv coffee shop: 'We try to go out when we can, meet friends and try to forget for a few hours. Then we go home and keep slogging through the mud.' Others simply can't return home. More than 60,000 from Israel's northern border with Lebanon are displaced. Thousands from the southern towns ransacked Oct. 7 are in temporary housing. Tens of thousands of reserve soldiers are serving their second or third tour of duty, straining their families and jobs. 'As the war goes on and on and we can’t see the end, there’s also a type of very large worry over the future, and, for some, if there is even a future here,' Muli Segev said. At this cafe, life meets war Cafe Otef seems like any of Tel Aviv's ubiquitous coffee shops: Patrons laugh and sip specialty coffee beside a playground; light rock music plays. But next to the sandwiches and cakes are chocolates made from the recipes of Dvir Karp, who was killed in the Oct. 7 attack, and cheeses from Kibbutz Be’eri, where more than 100 died and 30 were taken hostage. Totes and T-shirts for sale declare 'We shall thrive again.' The cafe, named for the region next to the Gaza border, is run by residents of Re'im, one of the kibbutzes struck. It's the second shop in the new chain, each aiming to support people of a southern Israeli town where lives were upended. 'The war still continues for almost a year, and I feel that if we won’t live, we will die,' said Reut Karp, cafe owner and Dvir's ex-wife. She lives with most of her kibbutz in temporary housing nearby. The cafe gives her purpose as her community deals with trauma and the uncertainty of returning home. While it's strange to see people flowing through the doors, going about life as normal, she and the staff have found comfort in the routine. 'We must take ourselves out of bed and continue to live and to work and to have the hope,' Karp said. 'Because without this hope, we don’t have anything.'	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-gaza-war-israelis-mood-depression-28daf7e6aa8ddab419cf76e31b111d4f	2024-10-04T19:03:41-07:00	
The Biden administration isn't extending a two-year program for migrants from 4 nations	WASHINGTON (AP) — The Biden administration will not extend a two-year program that allows migrants from certain nations into the U.S. if they came by plane with sponsorship. The program began in 2022 with Venezuelans and was an effort to provide an alternative legal pathway for migrants who were increasingly coming to the U.S.-Mexico border while the administration simultaneously cracked down on illegal crossings. It later expanded to Cubans, Haitians and Nicaraguans — the nationalities of the migrants who most frequently tried to cross the border. The program allowed them to live and work in the U.S. for two years while they sought other legal status. The decision comes just a month before the 2024 presidential election, as Democrat Kamala Harris has worked to project a tougher stance on immigration. Republican Donald Trump has derided the administration's immigration policies and has increasingly insulted and spread lies about migrants in the U.S., particularly Haitians, in recent weeks. Homeland Security officials said Friday that those at the two-year mark must apply for another type of legal status, depart the country or face deportation. There are multiple different pathways for many of the nationalities, including what's called 'temporary protected status' for Venezuelans and Haitians, which allows them to stay in the U.S. because of extreme violence, unrest or devastating natural disasters in their home countries. 'This two-year period was intended to enable individuals to seek humanitarian relief or other immigration benefits for which they may be eligible, and to work and contribute to the United States,' Homeland Security spokesperson Naree Ketudat said. New migrants to the border may still apply for the program, and it does not affect those from Afghanistan or Ukraine.	https://apnews.com/article/biden-immigration-election-4cb4c80e3a71ab79ef47406136653b1a	2024-10-04T13:28:42-07:00	
Thousands of Jewish pilgrims come to Ukraine for Rosh Hashana despite official warnings	UMAN, Ukraine (AP) — Prayer chants and the sounding of traditional ram's horns fill the air in the town of Uman, in central Ukraine, as thousands of pilgrims join an annual gathering to mark the Jewish new year, despite the war against Russia. Uman, 200 kilometers (125 miles) south of the Ukrainian capital Kyiv, is transformed for the celebration of Rosh Hashana. The streets are plastered with signs in Hebrew for the pilgrims who come to pray at the tomb of Rabbi Nachman, the great-grandson of the founder of Hasidic movement. Despite Ukrainian and Israeli diplomats warning of the security threat, officials told The Associated Press that 35,000 pilgrims made the journey to Uman this year, the same as in earlier years. Rabbi Moshe Reuven Azman, a leading figure in Ukraine’s Jewish community, was one of those who urged international pilgrims not to visit Ukraine due to security concerns but acknowledged that many would still make the trip regardless of the potential risks involved. 'Every year (since Russia's full-scale invasion), I speak on Israeli television and radio, and I call on the (Jewish) pilgrims not to come to Ukraine. My primary concern is for the lives of people,' he said. As the war in Ukraine rages for a third year, Russian army fires barrages of drones and missiles at Ukraine almost daily, leaving no region completely safe. Active combat is taking place along a 1,000-kilometer (620-mile) front, as Russian forces press their advantage in the eastern Donetsk region. This year alone, the Russian army has managed to capture several thousand square kilometers (miles) of Ukrainian territory, with the capture of the city of Vuhledar being their most recent notable achievement. Nachman Shitrit, 18, who traveled to Uman from Haifa, Israel with his father, said he had made the pilgrimage over a dozen times. 'The war here didn’t scare me from traveling to Ukraine; there’s also war where I came from,' he told the AP. This year’s pilgrimage comes at an increasingly volatile time in the Middle East. Israel is now engaged in a multifront war that includes the battles with Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, attacks from Iran and strikes inside Syria, plus ongoing confrontations with armed militants in the West Bank and occasional attacks launched by Iranian-backed militants in Iraq and by the Houthis in Yemen. The hostilities posed additional challenges to some pilgrims travelling to Ukraine this year. Ukraine closed its air space in February 2022, at the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion, forcing visitors to travel overland via other European countries in order to reach Uman. The United Jewish Community of Ukraine said Wednesday that more than 14,000 pilgrims were unable to travel to Uman, partly as a result of Iran’s attack on Israel Tuesday. Iran fired a barrage of nearly 180 missiles, causing cancellation of multiple flights from Israel in an act Iranian officials called retaliation for Israel’s recent strikes on Hezbollah. Meir Shpanier, 23, who travelled from Tel Aviv, said the difficulty of the journey had made the experience more meaningful to him this year. 'I managed to get here by a miracle. My travel agent booked airplane tickets from Tel Aviv to Budapest. From there, a Ukrainian driver picked me up, and we drove 22 hours to Uman. But some of my friends had to travel through five countries.' 'Because I had to work hard to get here, it means more to me now. I think we’re all blessed to be here,' Shpanier said.	https://apnews.com/article/ukraine-rosh-hashana-uman-pilgrimage-jewish-hasidic-0bfda5004958450de38e90853a5c7fce	2024-10-04T11:18:39-07:00	
12 people have been killed in coordinated attacks in violent Mexican city	MEXICO CITY (AP) — Twelve people were killed in a series of coordinated and near-simultaneous attacks in the violence-wracked city of Salamanca, authorities in the central Mexican state of Guanajuato said Friday. The victims were found Thursday at multiple points across the refinery city of over 200,000. In at least one case, a banner signed by a drug cartel was left with some of the bodies. The massacre is the latest episode in a wave of violence in Salamanca, west of the state’s capital Guanajuato, where gunmen killed four men and wounded two others in an attack at a drug rehabilitation center late Tuesday. Authorities said there are no clear suspects and they continue to investigate. The industrial and agricultural state of Guanajuato has for years been the scene of a bloody turf battle between the Jalisco New Generation Cartel and a local gang, the Santa Rosa de Lima Cartel. Guanajuato has the highest number of homicides of any state in Mexico. Security analyst David Saucedo said that the Jalisco New Generation Cartel has control of urban areas, while Santa Rosa de Lima controls rural ones, but they continue to fight for control of cities like Salamanca. 'There’s been a presence of the National Guard but (the violence) hasn’t stopped,' he said. 'Salamanca has a very complicated situation.' Saucedo said that Salamanca has had three different police directors in the last three years, noting a lack of capability to take on the organized crime groups. Salamanca Mayor César Prieto Gallardo was quoted in the media as saying that city and state authorities are working in a coordinated manner. 'Unfortunately,' he said, 'This is a conflict between delinquent groups. The civil population has nothing to do with this.' ____ Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america	https://apnews.com/article/mexico-guanajuato-killings-cartel-violence-dfafc1b069d0af93bd079ce567ff0cd1	2024-10-04T10:43:20-07:00	
Ubisoft shares jump following reports of Tencent, Guillemot family considering buyout	LOS ANGELES (AP) — Shares of Ubisoft jumped more than 30% Friday, following reports that Tencent and the Guillemot family are considering a buyout of the video game maker. Bloomberg news reported that Tencent and Guillemot family — minority stakeholders in Ubisoft — have been discussing ways to stabilize the company after it lost more than half its market value this year. Shares surged 33.5% to about $15.57 Friday, according to FactSet. Ubisoft declined to comment. Tencent did not immediately respond to a request for comment. France-based Ubisoft is the publisher behind the well-known franchise 'Assassin’s Creed.' Ubisoft’s shares fell last month to their lowest point in more than a decade after its latest title 'Star Wars Outlaws' underperformed and the company announced that it would delay the latest 'Assassin’s Creed' game. Yves Guillemot, Ubisoft’s CEO, said in a statement last week that the company’s 'second quarter performance fell short of our expectations.'	https://apnews.com/article/ubisoft-tencent-guillemot-possible-buyout-64bb35d2a382cdad97ce34f5d70c4d71	2024-10-04T10:24:30-07:00

Drought has dried a major Amazon River tributary to its lowest level in over 122 years	MANAUS, Brazil (AP) — One of the Amazon River’s main tributaries has dropped to its lowest level ever recorded, Brazil’s geological service said Friday, reflecting a severe drought that has devastated the Amazon rainforest and other parts of the country. The level of the Negro River at the port of Manaus was at 12.66 meters on Friday, as compared with a normal level of about 21 meters. It is the lowest since measurements started 122 years ago. The previous record low level was recorded last year, but toward the end of October. The Negro River's water level might drop even more in coming weeks based on forecasts for low rainfall in upstream regions, according to the geological service's predictions. Andre Martinelli, the agency's hydrology manager in Manaus, was quoted as saying the river was expected to continue receding until the end of the month. Water levels in Brazil’s Amazon always rise and fall with its rainy and dry seasons, but the dry portion of this year has been much worse than usual. All of the major rivers in the Amazon basin are at critical levels, including the Madeira River, the Amazon River’s longest tributary. The Negro River drains about 10% of the Amazon basin and is the world’s sixth-largest by water volume. Manaus, the biggest city in the rainforest, is where the Negro joins the Amazon River. For locals, the drought has made basic daily activities impossible. Gracita Barbosa, 28, works as a cashier on a floating shop on the Negro River. She’s out of work because boats that once stopped there can no longer navigate the river due to the low water levels. Barbosa can no longer bathe in the river and now has to travel longer distances to collect drinking water. ___ Sá Pessoa reported from Sao Paulo.	https://apnews.com/article/brazil-amazon-drought-negro-river-rainforest-69d0930a06987973914c5ae24c1c05ff	2024-10-04T08:49:37-07:00	
2 sisters from Egypt were among those killed in Mexican army shooting	TAPACHULA, Mexico (AP) — An 11-year-old Egyptian girl and her 18-year-old sister were among those killed after Mexican army troops opened fire on a truck carrying migrants earlier this week, an official said Friday. The sisters, and four other migrants from countries including Peru and Honduras, were killed on Tuesday in the southern state of Chiapas. An official in the state’s prosecutors office confirmed the identification of the two sisters and said their father was wounded in the shooting, but survived. The official was not authorized to be quoted by name, but a second federal official confirmed that information on the same basis. Federal officials, including newly inaugurated President Claudia Sheinbaum, again refused Friday to confirm the ages or genders of the six migrants killed in the shooting, which occurred on Sheinbaum’s first day in office. The Egyptian embassy in Mexico and the Egyptian foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Soldiers claimed they heard shots and returned fire and officials have studiously avoided saying the migrants were killed by army gunfire. However, that appears to be the case, and two soldiers have been relieved of duty and turned over to civilian prosecutors for questioning. The killings placed in doubt Sheinbaum's statements over her first days in office that human rights will be at the forefront of her administration's policies. Asked about her immigration policy Friday, Sheinbaum said only that the killings were under investigation and doubled down on earlier claims that the government doesn't violate human rights. 'First of all, human rights are respected,' Sheinbaum said. 'That is very important, that is why it is called a humanistic immigration policy, because human rights are at the forefront.' Three of the dead were from Egypt, and one each from Peru and Honduras. The other has apparently not yet been identified. Ten other migrants were wounded in the shooting. but there has not been any information on their conditions. Peru’s foreign ministry confirmed one Peruvian was killed and demanded 'an urgent investigation' into the killings. Peru and Mexico have had damaged relations since a 2022 diplomatic spat. It was the worst killing of migrants by authorities in Mexico since police in the northern state of Tamaulipas killed 17 migrants in 2021. Sheinbaum has said the shootings are being investigated to see if any commanders might face punishment, and noted 'a situation like this cannot be repeated.' But she left out any mention of that Thursday at a ceremony at a Mexico City army base, where army and navy commanders pledged their loyalty to her in front of massed combat vehicles and hundreds of troops. 'In our country, there is not a state of siege, there are no violations of human rights,' Sheinbaum said, as she promised wage increases for soldiers and sailors. The shootings Tuesday occurred near the city of Tapachula, near the border with Guatemala. The Defense Department initially said that soldiers claimed to have heard shots as a convoy of three trucks passed the soldiers’ position. The Attorney General’s Office later said all three trucks ignored orders to stop and tried to flee. The soldiers pursued them and reported coming under fire from the convoy, and returned fire. One of the trucks eventually stopped, the driver reportedly fled, and a total of 33 migrants were found aboard, from the three countries already mentioned, as well as Nepal, Cuba, India and Pakistan. The Defense Department said four of the migrants were found dead, and 12 wounded. Two of the wounded later died of their injuries. Sheinbaum refused to say whether any weapons were found in the migrants’ truck. The area is a common route for smuggling migrants, who are often packed into crowded freight trucks. It has also been the scene of drug cartel turf battles, and the department said the trucks 'were similar to those used by criminal groups in the region.' Irineo Mujica, a migrant rights activist, said he doubted the migrants or their smugglers opened fire. 'It is really impossible that these people would have been shooting at the army,' Mujica said. 'Most of the time, they get through by paying bribes.' If the deaths were the result of army fire, as appears likely, it could prove a major embarrassment for Sheinbaum. The new president has followed the lead of former president Andrés Manuel López Obrador in giving the armed forces extraordinary powers in law enforcement, state-run companies , airports, trains and construction projects. It is not the first time Mexican forces have opened fire on vehicles carrying migrants in the area, which is also the object of cartel turf battles. In 2021, the quasi-military National Guard opened fire on a pickup truck carrying migrants, killing one and wounding four. The Guard officers initially claimed some of those in the migrants’ truck were armed and had fired shots, but the governmental National Human Rights Commission later found that was not true. And in 2021, state police in Tamaulipas killed 17 migrants and two Mexican citizens. Those officers also initially claimed to have come under fire from the migrants’ vehicles. They argued they were responding to shots fired and believed they were chasing the vehicles of one of the country’s drug cartels, which frequently participate in migrant smuggling. But that later turned out to be false, and the police in fact burned the victims’ bodies in an attempt to cover up the crime. Eleven of the policemen were convicted of homicide and sentenced to over 50 years in prison. ____ Associated Press reporter Fabiola Sánchez contributed from Mexico City. ____ Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america	https://apnews.com/article/mexico-soldiers-migrants-killed-egypt-peru-honduras-41131f083f36bb4cbea09fe7bd2aae24	2024-10-04T08:36:35-07:00	
US launches airstrikes by fighter jets and ships on Yemen's Iran-backed Houthi rebels	WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. military struck more than a dozen Houthi targets in Yemen on Friday, going after weapons systems, bases and other equipment belonging to the Iranian-backed rebels, U.S. officials confirmed. Military aircraft and warships bombed Houthi strongholds at roughly five locations, according to the officials. Houthi media said seven strikes hit the airport in Hodeida, a major port city, and the Katheib area, which has a Houthi-controlled military base. Four more strikes hit the Seiyana area in Sanaa, the capital, and two strikes hit the Dhamar province. The Houthi media office also reported three air raids in Bayda province, southeast of Sanaa. The strikes come just days after the Houthis threatened 'escalating military operations' targeting Israel after they apparently shot down a U.S. military drone flying over Yemen. And just last week, the group claimed responsibility for an attack targeting American warships. The rebels fired more than a half dozen ballistic missiles and anti-ship cruise missiles and two drones at three U.S. ships that were traveling through the Bab el-Mandeb Strait, but all were intercepted by the Navy destroyers, according to several U.S. officials. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss details not yet publicly released. Houthis have targeted more than 80 merchant vessels with missiles and drones since the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza started last October. They have seized one vessel and sunk two in the campaign that has also killed four sailors. Other missiles and drones have either been intercepted by a U.S.-led coalition in the Red Sea or failed to reach their targets, which have included Western military vessels. The group has maintained that they target ships linked to Israel, the U.S. or the United Kingdom to force an end to Israel’s campaign against Hamas in Gaza. However, many of the ships attacked have little or no connection to the conflict, including some bound for Iran. ___ AP writer Samy Magdy in Cairo contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/houthis-yemen-us-strikes-weapons-752dd1e5dd6c284a7909878f89c73149	2024-10-04T06:52:24-07:00	
Mexico’s new president promises to resume fight against climate change	MEXICO CITY (AP) — In her first days as Mexico’s new president, Claudia Sheinbaum made a point of distancing herself from the fossil fuel reliance promoted by her predecessor and mentor, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, and vowed to resume an energy transition that he halted. 'We are going to boost renewable energies. The goal is that by 2030, they will have a 45% share (of total electricity production),' she said Tuesday in her first public speech in the capital’s Zocalo square, shortly after being sworn in as the country’s first woman president. Specifics are still scant, but her speech marks a sharp departure from the energy policy of former President López Obrador, a fierce defender of fossil fuels who, among other things, spent more than $20 billion to build a new oil refinery and stopped the auctions that had allowed developers to build solar and wind farms in the country. The president said in the coming days she will unveil an 'ambitious energy transition program' aimed at 'the reduction of greenhouse gases that cause climate change.' Yet Sheinbaum has also promised to strengthen the nation's Federal Electricity Commission, which owns older plants that mainly burn fossil fuels, and state-owned oil company Pemex. Even without specifics, experts and environmentalists said the change in rhetoric was notable. 'The terms ‘sustainability’ or ‘renewable energy’ really never appeared,' in López Obrador’s policies, said Rosanety Barrios, who worked for more than a decade at the Mexican Energy Regulatory Commission. 'He didn't use the term in any speech, in any document. And she has been using it all the time.' During her campaign, Sheinbaum repeatedly promised to promote renewable energy to meet an increasing demand for electricity, due in part to rising temperatures from climate change. In a speech to Congress, also on Tuesday, with López Obrador sitting a few steps from her, the promises seemed more tangible. The goal of reaching 45% clean electricity by 2030 is well above the 24% it represented last year, according to the Ministry of Energy. If achieved, Mexico would be back on track to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement, which seeks to keep the global average temperature to no more than two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. The energy policy promoted by López Obrador led Climate Action Tracker, an organization which evaluates the actions countries take to comply with the Paris Agreement, to downgrade Mexico’s rating to 'critically insufficient.' In her speech to Congress, the president also announced what would be the country’s first ever limit on oil production – 1.8 million barrels per day. All crude oil in Mexico is produced by Pemex, and that amount is approximately what the company produced in 2023 on an average day. It is far less than the 2.6 million barrels per day López Obrador promised at the beginning of his term. Sheinbaum recalled that more than a decade ago, a 2013 energy reform promoted by then President Enrique Peña Nieto proposed production of 3 million barrels per day. 'That is environmentally impossible,' she said. 'It is better to promote efficiency and renewable sources.' At the same time, however, Sheinbaum has vowed to 'strengthen Pemex' and she never criticized the building of the new Dos Bocas refinery, paying several visits to it with López Obrador. Experts said Mexico would not be able to increase oil production using current methods, because its fields are getting tapped out. 'Mexico has ten years of oil left at its current rate of production, which is modest. Mexico is almost out of oil,' said Adrian Fernandez, who holds a PhD in environmental science from Imperial College London and directs the Mexico Climate Initiative, a think tank. But Fernández nevertheless praised Scheinbaum's words 'because it means she is not going to try to increase oil production.' Mexico would have to invest significant money either in hydraulic fracturing, also known as fracking, or deepwater exploration to increase production beyond current levels, he said. Up until now, the country has rejected both of these. Fernández also said Sheinbaum’s speech is 'totally consistent with her experience and knowledge.' The president has a PhD in energy engineering and degrees in physics, and was part of the United Nations panel of experts on climate change that won the Nobel Prize in 2007. This week, Sheinbaum saw firsthand the havoc that climate change is wreaking in Mexico. On Wednesday, on her first trip as the country’s leader, she visited Acapulco, in the southern state of Guerrero, to assess the damage caused by Hurricane John, which struck the coast first as a hurricane and then again as a tropical storm last week. The storm left a trail of devastation while the city was still recovering from last year’s Hurricane Otis. The strengh of both hurricanes was turbocharged by rising ocean temperatures due to global warming. But the big question is whether the new president will be able to achieve her goals within Mexico’s current legal framework. Before leaving office, López Obrador pushed through a constitutional reform that strongly favors the Federal Electricity Commission. On one hand, Sheinbaum has supported that legal change and promised the state will keep control of 54% of electricity generation. On the other, she has committed to reopening private investment in renewable energy, stopped by López Obrador to favor the state-owned CFE. 'From my point of view, the biggest problem Claudia has is legal uncertainty,' Barrios said. — The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

The Latest: Harris to visit Michigan while Trump heads to Georgia	Vice President Kamala Harris will visit the union stronghold of Flint, Michigan, on Friday as she battles with Donald Trump for working-class voters who could tip the scales in this year’s election. Her appearance in the battleground state comes the day after U.S. dockworkers suspended their strike in hopes of reaching a new contract, sparing the country a damaging episode of labor unrest that could have rattled the economy. Meanwhile, Trump is heading to Georgia to appear with Gov. Brian Kemp, the latest sign that he’s patched up his rocky relationship with the top Republican in a key battleground state. Follow the AP’s Election 2024 coverage at: https://apnews.com/hub/election-2024. Here’s the latest: Elon Musk will join Trump at Pennsylvania rally Elon Musk will join Donald Trump at his rally Saturday in Butler, the Pennsylvania city where the Republican presidential nominee survived an assassination attempt earlier this year. 'I will be there to support!' Musk wrote on his social platform X on Thursday in a retweet of Trump’s own promotion of the rally. The SpaceX and Tesla CEO will be among special guests in attendance, Trump’s campaign confirmed Friday. The event will mark the first time the billionaire businessman appears publicly at a campaign event for the former president since endorsing him. Musk has supercharged his support for Trump in recent months and has become personally more invested in politics — even agreeing to lead a government efficiency commission if Trump wins reelection. Saturday’s rally will take place at the same property where a gunman’s bullets grazed Trump’s right ear and killed his supporter, Corey Comperatore. The shooting left multiple others injured. Harris will travel to North Carolina on Saturday as the state recovers from Helene The Democratic presidential nominee has already been to Georgia, where she helped distribute meals and spoke with families in Augusta. More than 200 people died in the powerful storm that spread out across the Southeast, causing devastation. President Joe Biden, too, has traveled to areas hard-hit by the storm. From Georgia, Harris said she and Biden have been paying attention 'from the beginning to what we need to do to make sure the federal resources hit the ground as quickly as possible, and that includes what was necessary to make sure that we provided direct federal assistance. And that work has been happening.' Their travel comes as Republican Donald Trump is falsely claiming the federal government wasn't doing enough to help affected people in Republican areas. Biden was angered by the suggestion, calling it a lie. He said partisan politics should not be part of this conversation. Obama will campaign for Harris in key swing states Former President Barack Obama is planning to hit key swing states to boost Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign for the White House, starting on Thursday in Pittsburgh. The Harris campaign says Obama will travel around the country over the final 27 days ahead of the election. It noted that the former president and Harris have a friendship that goes back 20 years, from when they first met while he was running for Senate. Harris was also an early supporter of Obama’s 2008 presidential bid and knocked on doors for him in Iowa ahead of its caucus that led off voting in the Democratic primary. In his speech at the Democratic convention in August, Obama said Harris 'wasn’t born into privilege. She had to work for what she’s got.' 'And she actually cares about what other people are going through,' the former president added then.	https://apnews.com/article/harris-trump-vance-walz-election-cdf0cac197011d8a6e67fc339638f553	2024-10-04T05:15:08-07:00	
This week's gang attack on a Haitian town killed more than 50 people, activist says	PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) — The tally of victims killed in this week's brutal attack on a small town in central Haiti by heavily armed gang members has risen to more than 50, a human rights activist said Friday. Bodies lay strewn on the streets of Port-Sondé following Thursday’s attack in the Artibonite region, many of them killed by a shot to the head, Bertide Harace, spokeswoman for the Commission for Dialogue, Reconciliation and Awareness to Save the Artibonite, told Magik 9 radio station. Initial estimates were that about 20 people were killed, but activists and government officials have been gradually accessing areas of the town and discovering more bodies. Among the victims is a young mother, her newborn baby and a midwife, Herace said. The attack is blamed on the Gran Grif gang, which operates in the Artibonite region and is considered one of Haiti’s cruelest gangs. The motive remains unclear for what was one of the biggest massacres in the central region in recent years. Attacks of that kind have taken place in the capital of Port-au-Prince, 80% of which is controlled by gangs, and they typically are linked to turf wars, with gang members targeting civilians in areas controlled by rivals. But Port-Sondé is considered part of Gran Grif's own territory. The gang was created after former Haitian legislator Prophane Victor began arming young men in the area to secure his election and control over the Artibonite region nearly a decade ago, according to a U.N. report. Both Victor and the leader of Gran Grif, Luckson Elan, were sanctioned by the U.S. last month. The gang attacked Port-Sondé before dawn on Thursday and encountered little resistance, Herace said, though she said that contrary to some reports, police officers did try to repel the gang. 'The gang had total control of the area,' Herace said. Haiti’s government has deployed an elite police unit based in the capital of Port-au-Prince to Port-Sondé following the attack and sent medical supplies to help the area’s lone hospital overwhelmed by dozens of people injured. 'This heinous crime, perpetrated against defenseless women, men, and children, is not only an attack on these victims, but on the entire Haitian nation,' Prime Minister Garry Conille said in a statement Friday. Gang violence across Artibonite, which produces much of Haiti’s food, has increased in recent years. In January 2023, the Gran Grif gang was accused of attacking a police station in Liancourt, located near Pont-Sondé, and killing at least six officers. Violence unleashed by the gang also forced the closure of a hospital in February 2023 that serves more than 700,000 people.	https://apnews.com/article/haiti-gang-attack-port-sonde-saint-marc-massacre-da09975e15278b9a507e85c8ba731f55	2024-10-04T05:09:15-07:00	
Relatives say a whole family was killed in Israel's deadliest West Bank strike since Oct. 7	TULKAREM, West Bank (AP) — An Israeli airstrike on a West Bank cafe that the military said targeted Palestinian militants also killed a family of four, including two young children, relatives told The Associated Press on Friday. The strike slammed into a three-story building in the Tulkarem refugee camp late Thursday, setting it on fire, destroying a popular cafe and killing at least 18 Palestinians, according to the territory's Health Ministry. It was the deadliest strike in the West Bank since the start of the Israel-Hamas war nearly a year ago. On Friday, paramedics searched the rubble inside the blasted-out coffee shop, gathering human remains into small boxes. Young boys and men walked among the ruins of the shop, with holes in the ceiling and debris blanketing the ground, digging past bloodstained furniture and dislodged iron beams for anything to salvage. Among the dead was the Abu Zahra family: Muhammad, a bakery worker; his wife, Saja; and their two children, Sham, 8, and Karam, 6, according to the man's brother, Mustafa Abu Zahra, who said the family lived above the coffee shop. He added that one of Muhammad’s brothers-in-law was also in the apartment at the time and was killed. The Israeli military said the strike killed several militants, including Hamas’ leader in the camp, who it accused of planning and taking part in multiple attacks against Israeli civilians. Tulkarem, known to be a hotbed of Palestinian militancy, is a flashpoint in the West Bank and a frequent target of Israeli military raids. Hamas, which did not immediately claim any of the dead as its fighters, condemned the strike and called for Palestinians in Tulkarem to rise up. Israel has carried out several large-scale raids in the West Bank since the start of the war in Gaza, ignited by Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on southern Israel. While airstrikes used to be rare in the Palestinian territory, they have grown more common since the outbreak of war as Israeli forces clamp down, saying they aim to prevent attacks on their citizens. Israeli fire has killed at least 722 Palestinians in the West Bank since Oct. 7, Palestinian health officials say. In that time, Palestinian militants have launched a number of attacks on soldiers at checkpoints and within Israel. A shooting attack in Tel Aviv earlier this week that Israeli police said was carried out by Palestinians from the West Bank left at least six people dead. Nimer Fayat, the owner of Dr. Coffee, said the cafe was full with 'regular customers coming to eat and drink' when the strike occurred around 10:15 p.m. 'What happened was a very strong blow, the likes of which we had not seen in the past since the Al-Aqsa Intifada,' he said, using a Palestinian term for the second intifada, or uprising, in the early 2000s. Paramedics rushing to the area encountered a ghastly scene, with body parts flung onto power lines by the force of the blast, said Nebal Farsakh, a spokesperson for the Palestinian Red Crescent, whose teams brought nine dead to the hospital. A full list of the dead and wounded was not immediately released by the Palestinian Health Ministry. Yasser Jibra, another relative of the Abu Zahras, said the strike was 'like a lightning bolt.' 'Look around, the destruction is so obvious,' he said, adding that it was difficult to identify the bodies of his loved ones. The Israeli military did not immediately respond to a request for comment on civilian deaths in the strike. Israel says it takes care to guard against such deaths. But to Jibra, that means little. 'This is the work of the criminal occupation, which does not take into account the presence of a child or a woman, or an elderly or young person,' he said, as he stood inside the blasted-out cafe. 'Everything is permissible for them.' ___ Associated Press reporter Julia Frankel and producer Ibrahim Hazboun contributed to this report from Jerusalem.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-west-bank-strike-tulkarem-militants-1656f77bb28acdfb3d72ec5fccd628e9	2024-10-04T03:12:22-07:00	
Technical problem at German air traffic control causes delays and some cancellations	BERLIN (AP) — A technical problem at Germany's air traffic control agency caused disruptions on Friday, with some flights canceled at Frankfurt Airport, the country's biggest. The air traffic control company DFS said the problem that arose Friday morning affected flight plans and weather data. It was resolved by 10:30 a.m. but caused delays of varying severity across the country. Frankfurt Airport warned on its website that flight delays and cancellations could be expected throughout the day. Operator Fraport said about 70 flights were canceled but didn't expect many more because the data problem had been resolved, German news agency dpa reported. The country's biggest airline, Lufthansa, said there were a few cancellations and delays but long-haul services weren't affected.	https://apnews.com/article/germany-air-traffic-control-disruption-95725d9a827f3a8d86fb68754dfe4f3d	2024-10-04T03:06:31-07:00	
Two London police officers reinstated over stop and search of Black athletes	LONDON (AP) — Two former London police officers have been handed their jobs back and will receive back pay after winning an appeal Friday against a ruling that said they had lied about smelling cannabis during a stop and search of two Black athletes. The Police Appeals Tribunal overturned the conclusion by a disciplinary panel a year ago that the two former Metropolitan Police officers — Jonathan Clapham and Sam Franks — had lied. That conclusion was 'irrational' and 'inconsistent,' the appeals tribunal said. The two athletes, British sprinter Bianca Williams and her Portuguese partner Ricardo Dos Santos, told the police watchdog that they were racially profiled by a group of police officers on July 4, 2020. The couple were driving home in London with their 3-month-old son in the back seat when police followed their car and pulled them over outside their home. The athletes were handcuffed and searched on suspicion of having drugs and weapons but nothing was found. The appeals tribunal's chairman Damien Moore said Clapham and Franks were 'dedicated, hard-working and much respected officers' whose reputations had been 'ruined' by the original findings. 'Both officers did not lie,' Moore said. 'Both officers will now be reinstated to the Met Police. They should receive back pay.' Williams had filmed the original incident and the video was widely shared online. It shows her visibly distressed about being separated from her baby. The Met, which is the U.K.'s biggest police force, came under heavy criticism after the footage was aired. After the appeal decision, Dos Santos released a statement expressing his disappointment and said he and Williams will challenge the outcome in civil courts. 'Our drive home from training in 2020, with our baby, should never have turned into a violent incident where we were wrongly accused of smelling of drugs,' he said. 'We are professional athletes, we pride ourselves on not doing drugs,' he added. 'The actions and allegations of the officers were completely unacceptable.' The Metropolitan Police Federation, which represents police officers, said Friday's ruling represented 'yet another damning indictment' of the Independent Office for Police Conduct, which first assessed the incident. 'Justice has been served,' said Rick Prior, the group's chairman. 'Why it ever got to this point however remains an absolute mystery.'	https://apnews.com/article/london-metropolitan-police-officers-dismissed-racism-reinstated-3eb6722a3a6b9a4d73dd85904f4b77ec	2024-10-04T02:42:11-07:00	
Clashes in Kenya as people discuss the deputy president's impeachment motion	NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) — Supporters and opponents of Kenya's deputy president clashed Friday at public forums over an impeachment motion against him, which was introduced in parliament by the ruling alliance this week. Rigathi Gachagua is accused of supporting anti-government protests in June and of being involved in corruption and other irregularities, charges he denies. A motion for the impeachment of Gachagua was proposed in parliament on Tuesday and Kenyans were given until Friday to fill out public participation forms at their constituencies. Public forums are being held across the country to discuss the impeachment. In the capital, Nairobi, a public forum at the Bomas of Kenya turned violent as supporters of President William Ruto clashed with those supporting Gachagua. Chairs were thrown in the auditorium and an activist Morara Kebaso, known for exposing stalled government projects, said he had been injured. In central Kenya’s Nyeri county, police clashed with supporters of the deputy president as they chanted that there would be no president if his deputy is impeached. The two were elected on a joint ticket. In Nyandarua county, opponents were called out as being traitors and were chased out of the community hall. Some 291 legislators, more than the 117 constitutional requirement, signed the impeachment motion before it was introduced, but a number of them from the deputy president’s home tuff say they no longer support the motion after hearing contrary views from their constituents. 'If the deputy president is guilty, then his boss the president is equally guilty,' a woman supporter told Citizen TV. Gachagua is facing impeachment on 10 grounds that include corruption, ethnic discrimination and contradicting government policies. He has maintained that he is innocent and has vowed to fight the impeachment motion. The high court on Thursday declined to stop Friday’s public participation and set next Wednesday as the date for the hearing. President Ruto has not weighed into his deputy’s impeachment debate. He is on record in the earlier days of his presidency saying he would not publicly humiliate his deputy, alluding to the troubled relationship he had with his predecessor Uhuru Kenyatta during their second term in office. The senate is expected to hear the impeachment motion on Tuesday next week.	https://apnews.com/article/kenya-deputy-president-impeachment-ff1e3f2172b0e8b3b3753b68ca57893c	2024-10-04T02:21:58-07:00	
Iranian supreme leader praises missile attack on Israel, saying Iran will do it again if necessary	TEHRAN, Iran (AP) — Iran’s supreme leader on Friday praised the country’s recent missile strike on Israel and said it was ready to do it again if necessary, state TV reported. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, in his first appearance as leader at Friday prayers in about five years, called the missile strike a 'shining' job by Iran's armed forces. On Tuesday, Iran launched at least 180 missiles at Israel, the latest in a series of rapidly escalating attacks between Israel and Iran and its allies that threaten to push the Middle East closer to a regionwide war. Israel said it intercepted many of the missiles, and officials in Washington said U.S. destroyers assisted in Israel’s defense. Iran said most of its missiles hit their targets. There were no immediate reports of casualties. Khamenei, 85, said in a 40-minute speech to thousands of people at the Mosalla mosque, the main prayer site in Tehran, that the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel nearly a year ago on Oct. 7, 2023, was a legitimate action by the Palestinian people. He said Tuesday's missile barrage was based on international law, the country’s law and Islamic beliefs. He urged nations from 'Afghanistan to Yemen and from Iran to Gaza and Yemen' to be ready to take action against the enemy, and praised those who had died doing so. 'Our resisting people in Lebanon and Palestine, you brave fighters, you loyal and patient people, these martyrdoms and the blood that was shed shouldn’t shake your determination but make you more persistent,' he said. Khamenei gave half of the speech in Arabic as he addressed his comments to Arab nations. His last appearance at Friday prayers was after the death of Revolutionary Guard Gen. Qassem Soleimani, who was killed in 2020 in a U.S. drone strike in Baghdad. A ceremony commemorating the death of Lebanese Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah was held before Khamenei’s speech. Most high-ranking Iranian officials, including President Masoud Pezeshkian and top Revolutionary Guard generals, attended the ceremony. Iran is Hezbollah’s main backer and has sent weapons and billions of dollars to the group. Also on Friday, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi arrived in the Lebanese capital, Beirut, where he was expected to discuss ongoing fighting between Israel and Hezbollah with Lebanese officials. Foreign Ministry spokesperson Esmail Baghaei said Iran sent a shipment of aid to Lebanon, including 10 tons of food and medicine.	https://apnews.com/article/iran-israel-missile-strike-khamenei-2bce5479abfdac5fd953d5547d04941c	2024-10-04T01:42:26-07:00	
Malaysian billionaire hotelier charged in Singapore in relation to ex-minister's wrongdoings	KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) — A Malaysian billionaire hotelier who brought Formula One to Singapore was charged Friday for allegedly obstructing justice and abetting wrongdoings by a former Cabinet minister who was imprisoned a day earlier in a rare graft case. The two charges against Ong Beng Seng came just a day after f ormer Transport Minister S. Iswaran was sentenced to a year in prison, making him the first minister to be jailed in Singapore in nearly half a century. Iswaran, 62, pleaded guilty last week to a count of obstructing justice and four of accepting illegal gifts such as F1 tickets, wine and whisky from Ong and another businessman Lum Kok Seng. The commencement of Iswaran's sentence has been delayed to Monday. It is unclear if he will appeal the sentence. Ong, 78, is accused of helping Iswaran obtain two flights and accommodation in Doha in December 2022, and abetting Iswaran in obstructing the course of justice, the Attorney-General Chambers said in a statement. According to the charge sheet, Iswaran was at the time chairman of the F1 Steering Committee and was aware the paid-for trip was linked to an agreement for the race between Ong's Singapore GP and the Singapore Tourism Board. The charges against Ong corresponded to two of the charges to which Iswaran pleaded guilty to on Sept 24, the statement said. The prosecution will not be charging the other businessman, Lum, it added. 'In arriving at the decision, the prosecution considered all the relevant facts and circumstances of the case, including the role that Lum played in each of the transactions,' an AGC spokesman said in reply to queries on why Lum was let off. He didn't elaborate. Ong did not indicate how he would plead to the charges. Channal News Asia reported. His bail has been extended, and the case has been adjourned till next month. Ong, a Malaysian businessman based in Singapore, is the managing director of Hotel Properties Limited which owns 38 hotels and resorts in 17 countries. He is known for bringing Formula 1 to Singapore in 2008, and holds the right to the Grand Prix night race in the city-state. Shares of HPL, which owns brands such as Four Seasons Hotels, Intercontinental Hotels and Marriott International, were halted early Friday ahead of the court proceedings. Singapore ’s ministers are among the world’s best paid, and the case has embarrassed the ruling People’s Action Party, which prides itself on clean governance. The last Cabinet minister charged with graft was Wee Toon Boon, who was found guilty in 1975 and jailed for accepting gifts in exchange for helping a businessperson. Another Cabinet minister was investigated for graft in 1986, but died before charges were filed. Prime Minister Lawrence Wong said he was saddened as Iswaran had made significant contributions in his government roles but his 'past contributions do not right this wrong.' 'Those entrusted with public service must uphold the highest standards of integrity and their conduct must be beyond reproach. This is absolutely vital and non-negotiable,,' Wong said in a statement.	https://apnews.com/article/singapore-malaysia-businessman-minister-corruption-441bd273ef4cc1816e0fc3ff07538cc5	2024-10-04T01:22:23-07:00	
Landmark ruling from EU's top court says some FIFA rules on transfers are contrary to the bloc's law	The European Union's top court said Friday that some FIFA rules on player transfers are contrary to European Union legislation relating to competition and freedom of movement, in a ruling that will likely lead to a shakeup of the soccer market's regulations and could change the sport's economy. The European Court of Justice's ruling came after former France international Lassana Diarra legally challenged FIFA rules following a dispute with a club dating back to a decade ago. Diarra argued that FIFA's restrictions meant he was unable to find a new club after his contract with Russian club Lokomotiv Moscow was terminated in 2014. FIFA's rules state that if a player terminates his contract without 'just cause,' the player and any club wishing to sign him are jointly liable for paying compensation to the previous club. 'Those rules hinder the free movement of players and competition between clubs,' the court said in a statement. 'The rules in question are such as to impede the free movement of professional footballers wishing to develop their activity by going to work for a new club.' The ruling is seen as crucial because it could make it easier for players to terminate their contracts and join another team – potentially leading to a scenario where bigger clubs could more easily poach players from smaller rivals. The global players’ union FIFPro, which had supported Diarra's case, said the ruling 'will change the landscape of professional football.' However, it could take a couple of years before any changes to the system go into effect as Friday’s ruling is part of a Belgian court case that is still ongoing. And although the ruling was seen as a defeat for FIFA, the court recognized that the current transfer regulations can also be necessary to help maintain a form of stability within professional squads and guarantee the regularity of competitions. FIFA said it would 'analyze the decision in coordination with other stakeholders before commenting further.' Diarra's decade-long fight Diarra's lawyers called the ruling a 'total victory' after a long-running legal battle. Diarra had signed a four-year contract with Lokomotiv Moscow in 2013 but the deal was terminated a year later after Diarra was unhappy with alleged pay cuts. Lokomotiv Moscow applied to the FIFA dispute resolution chamber for compensation and the player submitted a counterclaim seeking compensation for unpaid wages. The Court of Arbitration for Sport ruled in favor of the Russian club and the player was ordered to pay 10.5 million euros ($11.2 million). Diarra claimed his search for a new club was hampered by FIFA's rules stipulating that any new side would be jointly responsible with him for paying compensation to Lokomotiv. The former Real Madrid player also argued that a potential deal with Belgian club Charleroi fell through because of the FIFA rules, and sued FIFA and the Belgian federation at a Belgian court for damages and loss of earnings of six million euros ($7 million). With the lawsuit still going through Belgian courts, the case was referred to the European Court of Justice for guidance. In Friday's ruling, the court added that current rules 'impose considerable legal risks, unforeseeable and potentially very high financial risks as well as major sporting risks on those players and clubs wishing to employ them which, taken together, are such as to impede international transfers of those players.' A significant impact? It was not immediately clear what impact the ruling will have on players and leagues more broadly, but some analysts have compared it to the ECJ’s 1995 decision on Belgian footballer Jean-Marc Bosman. That ruling removed restrictions placed on foreign EU players within national leagues and allowed players in the bloc to move to another club for free when their contracts ended. That ruling ultimately skewed the player trading market in favor of wealthier clubs in western Europe who could lure free agents with big salaries and avoided paying transfer fees that many smaller clubs relied on. If FIFA introduces rules making it easier for player to terminate their contracts and join new clubs when they want, the whole system of transfers largely based on transfer fees could be challenged, with clubs less tempted to invest millions in players with more freedom to leave. But it could also give more power to the richest clubs capable of luring players with gigantic salary offers. 'All professional players have been affected by these illegal rules and can therefore now seek compensation for their losses,' Diarra's lawyers claimed in a statement. FIFA willing to discuss adjustments The Diarra case went through FIFA judicial bodies before the 2016 election of FIFA president Gianni Infantino, who has made it a priority to modernize transfer market rules. During the progress of the Diarra case, FIFA indicated it is open to a wide-ranging consultation with unions, clubs and leagues to address the courts’ opinions. FIFA said the ruling 'only puts in question two paragraphs of two articles of the FIFA Regulations on the Status and Transfer of Players, which the national court is now invited to consider.' Concerning competition rules, the court slammed FIFA's rulings for restricting and preventing cross-border competition between European clubs. 'The Court recalls that the possibility of competing by recruiting trained players plays an essential role in the professional football sector and that rules which place a general restriction on that form of competition, by immutably fixing the distribution of workers between the employers and in cloistering the markets, are similar to a no-poach agreement,' it said. ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer ___ Graham Dunbar in Geneva and Lorne Cook in Brussels contributed.	https://apnews.com/article/fifa-diarra-case-transfers-contracts-eu-50fcc2d3c8bbafb31ac80503646a04ef	2024-10-03T23:47:33-07:00	
Rainstorms and heavy floods hit large parts of Bosnia, killing at least 14 people	KISELJAK, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) — A severe rainstorm struck Bosnia overnight Friday, killing at least 14 people in floods and landslides in several towns and villages in central and southern parts of the country. Rescue services in the south of the country reported several people missing and called on volunteers and the army to assist as roads were closed and houses left without electricity. Darko Juka, a spokesman for the local administration, said at least 14 people had died in and around the southern town of Jablanica. 'Those are the ones who have been discovered by rescuers,' he said. 'We still don't know the final death toll.' 'I don't remember such a crisis since the war,' Juka said referring to the 1992-95 war in Bosnia that left the country in ruins. 'The scale of this chaotic situation is harrowing.' Defense Minister Zukan Helez told N1 regional television that troops have been engaged to help and that the casualties were reported. Helez said that 'hour after hour we are receiving news about new victims … We sent everyone we could. Our first priority is to save the people who are alive and buried in houses where the landslides are.' A pregnant woman lost her baby after she was rescued from the floods and transferred to a hospital in the regional center of Mostar. Authorities said doctors were fighting for her life as well. Separately, a child was successfully rescued and hospitalized, local officials said. Rescue services in the towns of Jablanica and Kiseljak said the power was off overnight and mobile phones lost their signal. The Jablanica fire station said that the town was completely inaccessible because roads and trainlines were closed. 'The police informed us that the railroad is also blocked,' the state rescue service said in a statement. 'You can’t get in or out of Jablanica at the moment. Landline phones are working, but mobile phones have no signal.' It urged people not to venture out on the flooded streets. Human-caused climate change increases the intensity of rainfall because warm air holds more moisture. This summer, the Balkans were also hit by long-lasting record temperatures, causing a drought. Scientists said the dried-out land has hampered the absorption of floodwaters. Drone footage broadcast on Bosnian media showed villages and towns completely submerged under water, while videos on social networks showed dramatic scenes of muddy torrents and damaged roads. Photos show that one of the busiest roads linking Sarajevo with the Adriatic coast via Jablanica was swept into a river together with a railway line in a huge landslide. 'Many people are endangered because of big waters and landslides. There is information about victims and many injured and missing persons,' said the civic protection service. Authorities urged people to stay on upper floors. Reports said surging waters swept away domestic animals and cars as the water swiftly filled up the lower floors of buildings. The heavy rains and strong winds were also reported in neighboring Croatia where several roads were closed and the capital of Zagreb prepared for the swollen Sava River to burst its banks. Heavy winds have hampered traffic along the southern coast of the Adriatic, and flash floods caused by heavy rain threatened several towns and villages in Croatia. Floods caused by torrential rains were also reported in Montenegro, south of Bosnia, where some villages were cut off and roads and homes flooded. —- AP writers Dusan Stojanovic and Jovana Gec contributed from Belgrade, Serbia.	https://apnews.com/article/floods-bosnia-rainstorm-rescue-croatia-5c50ea065f9fbbef8307d500ddd3fbb3	2024-10-03T23:29:10-07:00	
The Nobel Prizes will be announced against a backdrop of wars, famine and artificial intelligence	STAVANGER, Norway (AP) — Wars, a refugee crisis, famine and artificial intelligence could all be recognized when Nobel Prize announcements begin next week under a shroud of violence. The prize week coincides with the Oct. 7 anniversary of the Hamas-led attacks on Israel, which began a year of bloodshed and war across the Middle East. The literature and science prizes could be immune. But the Peace Prize, which recognizes efforts to end conflict, will be awarded in an atmosphere of ratcheting international violence — if awarded at all. 'I look at the world and see so much conflict, hostility and confrontation, I wonder if this is the year the Nobel Peace Prize should be withheld,' said Dan Smith, director of the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. As well as events roiling the Middle East, Smith cites the war in Sudan and risk of famine there, the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, and his institute's research showing that global military spending is increasing at its fastest pace since World War II. 'It could go to some groups which are making heroic efforts but are marginalized,' Smith said. 'But the trend is in the wrong direction. Perhaps it would be right to draw attention to that by withholding the peace prize this year.' Withholding the Nobel Peace is not new. It has been suspended 19 times in the past, including during the world wars. The last time it was not awarded was in 1972. However, Henrik Urdal, director of the Peace Research Institute Oslo, says withdrawal would be a mistake in 2024, saying the prize is 'arguably more important as a way to promote and recognize important work for peace.' Civil grassroot groups, and international organizations with missions to mitigate violence in the Middle East could be recognized. Nominees are kept secret for 50 years, but qualified nominators often publicize their picks. Academics at the Free University Amsterdam said they have nominated the Middle East-based organizations EcoPeace, Women Wage Peace and Women of the Sun for peace efforts between Israelis and Palestinians. Urdal believes it's possible the committee could consider the Sudan Emergency Response Rooms, a group of grassroots initiatives providing aid to stricken Sudanese facing famine and buffeted by the country’s brutal civil war. The announcements begin Monday with the physiology or medicine prize, followed on subsequent days by the physics, chemistry, literature and peace awards. The Peace Prize announcement will be made on Friday by the Norwegian Nobel Committee in Oslo, while all the others will be announced by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in Stockholm. The prize in economics will be announced the following week on Oct. 14. New technology, possibly artificial intelligence, could be recognized in one or more of the categories. Critics of AI warn the rise of autonomous weapons shows the new technology could mean additional peace-shattering misery for many people. Yet AI has also enabled scientific breakthroughs which are tipped for recognition in other categories. David Pendlebury, head of research analysis at Clarivate’s Institute for Scientific Information, says scientists from Google Deepmind, the AI lab, could be among those under consideration for the chemistry prize. The company’s artificial intelligence, AlphaFold 'accurately predicts the structure of proteins,' and is already widely used in several fields, including medicine, where it could one day be used to develop a breakthrough drug. Pendlebury spearheads Clarivate’s list of scientists whose papers are among the world’s most cited, and whose work it says are ripe for Nobel recognition. 'AI will increasingly be a part of the panoply of tools that researchers use,' Pendlebury said. He said he would be extremely surprised if a discovery 'firmly anchored in AI' did not win Nobel prizes in the next 10 years.	https://apnews.com/article/norway-nobel-prizes-peace-wars-c72eac3761a1169356b5c8d32dbe177e	2024-10-03T22:40:50-07:00	
Middle East latest: An Israeli airstrike cuts a major highway linking Lebanon with Syria	An Israeli airstrike has cut off a main highway linking Lebanon with Syria, leaving two huge craters on either side of the road. The airstrike Friday rendered the road unusable for cars, leaving people to go on foot to the Masnaa Border Crossing where tens of thousands of people fleeing war in Lebanon have crossed into Syria over the past two weeks. On Tuesday, Israel began a ground incursion into Lebanon against the Hezbollah militant group while also conducting strikes in Gaza. The Israeli military said nine soldiers have died in the conflict in southern Lebanon. Israel and Hezbollah have traded fire across the Lebanon border almost daily since the day after Hamas’ cross-border attack on Oct. 7, 2023, which killed 1,200 Israelis and took 250 others hostage. Israel declared war on the Hamas militant group in the Gaza Strip in response. More than 41,000 Palestinians have been killed in the territory, and just over half the dead have been women and children, according to local health officials. Nearly 2,000 people have been killed in Lebanon since then, most of them since Sept. 23, according to the Lebanese Health Ministry. ___ Here is the latest: Dutch military plane lands in Beirut to pick up civilians fleeing Lebanon THE HAGUE, Netherlands — A Dutch military transport plane landed in Beirut early Friday afternoon to pick up citizens of the Netherlands fleeing Lebanon amid fighting between Israel and the Hezbollah militant group. Scores of people are expected to board the A330 plane in what the Dutch foreign ministry called a repatriation flight. The defense ministry says that if there were spare seats on the plane, it could also take citizens of other countries out of Beirut. Meanwhile Japan's foreign ministry announced that 11 Japanese and 4 French nationals were evacuated from Lebanon and arrived in Jordan Friday. Israel launched a ground incursion into Lebanon on Tuesday and its forces have been clashing with Hezbollah militants in a narrow strip along the border. Israeli jets also have been carrying out airstrikes in Lebanon, including one Friday that cut off a main highway linking Lebanon with Syria. War in Gaza leaves scores of children under the sole care of grandparents KHAN YOUNIS, the Gaza Strip— Almost a year of war in Gaza has left thousands of children either orphaned or separated from their parents, leaving their grandparents with the task of raising them on their own. Amir Ashour, 12, and his sister Fatima Ashour, 10, lost their parents and their 5-year-old brother Gheith when their house in Rafah was struck by the Israeli military in December 2023. They are now being taken care of by their Atta Ashour, their grandfather from their mother’s side. Sitting inside a tent, Fatima told The Associated Press she misses her parents and brother. 'My mother would comb my hair, dress me, and give me everything, and when I came back from school, she would help with schoolwork,' she said. The war also left four orphans in the care of their 52-year-old grandmother Najah al-Eish, who is concerned that she will not live for long to take care of them. 'No matter how much I care for them and raise them, I might not always stay with them,' she said. UNICEF estimates that 19,000 children are either unaccompanied, separated from family, or orphaned. The U.N. agency doesn’t have the exact number of orphans across the enclave. Iran warns of harsh retaliation if Israel carries out an attack on Iran BEIRUT - Iran’s foreign minister warned Israel on Friday that if it carries out an attack on Iran, Tehran will retaliate in a harsh way. Abbas Araghchi was in Beirut for meetings with Lebanese officials. His visit came three days after Iran launched at least 180 missiles into Israel, the latest in a series of rapidly escalating attacks that threaten to push the Middle East closer to a regionwide war. 'If the Israeli entity takes any step or measure against us, our retaliation will be stronger than the previous one,' Araghchi said after meeting Lebanon’s Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri. Israel says it struck an underground tunnel between Lebanon and Syria JERUSALEM — Israel’s military said Friday its fighter jets struck an underground tunnel between Lebanon and Syria and areas around a key border crossing used by many in recent days fleeing Israel’s offensive. Thursday’s strikes around the Masnaa Border Crossing effectively cut off the main highway linking Lebanon with Syria, Lebanon’s state-run National News Agency reported. Tens of thousands of people fleeing fighting in Lebanon have used crossing into Syria over the past two weeks. The military said that its fighter jets had struck the 3.5 kilometer-long (2.17 miles) underground tunnel between Lebanon and Syria because Hezbollah has used it to smuggle weapons from Iran and other proxies into the country. It said it struck the sites around the Masnaa border crossing because they were being used as militant infrastructure. There are half a dozen border crossings between the two countries, most of which are still open. Hezbollah is believed to have received much of its weapons from Iran via Syria. UN refugee agency says main Lebanon-Syria border closed to vehicles GENEVA — The U.N. refugee agency says Israeli airstrikes overnight near the main border crossing where people have been fleeing from Lebanon into Syria has 'put a halt on traffic' and closed the route to vehicles. UNHCR spokeswoman Rula Amin said the border crossing between Masnaa, Lebanon, and Jdaidit Yabws in Syria has been the main thoroughfare between the two countries, even though three other border crossings remain open. Amin, a spokeswoman for UNHCR’s Middle East and North Africa operations, also noted government figures that up to 1 million people have fled to places across Lebanon, and more than 185,000 have gone to Syria. Speaking from Amman, Jordan, to reporters in Geneva on Friday, Amin said most of the nearly 900 government-established collective shelters in Lebanon were full, forcing many people to sleep in the open air -- including along Beirut’s famed seaside Corniche. She said 60% of people who have crossed from Lebanon to Syria were children or adolescents, some of whom arrived alone. Israeli military says it killed Hezbollah communications chief JERUSALEM — The Israeli military said Friday that a strike in Beirut the day before killed Mohammed Rashid Skafi, the head of Hezbollah’s communications division. The military said in a statement that Skafi was 'a senior Hezbollah terrorist who was responsible for the communications unit since 2000' and was 'closely affiliated' with high-up Hezbollah officials. Hundreds of Americans leave Lebanon on US contract flights WASHINGTON — The U.S. State Department says some 350 American citizens, green card holders and family members have now left Lebanon on US-organized contract flights this week. The department announced the new number — up by about 100 since Thursday — after another flight from Beirut landed early Friday in Frankfurt, Germany. The flight had the capacity to carry 300 passengers but only 97 people were aboard, it said. State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said Thursday that the U.S. would continue to organize such flights as long as the security situation in Lebanon is dire and as long as there is demand. More than 6,000 American citizens have contacted the U.S. embassy in Beirut seeking information about departing the country over the past week since the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah has escalated. Miller said the department understood that some Americans, many of them dual U.S.-Lebanese nationals and long-time residents of the country, may choose to stay. Iran's leader praises missile strike on Israel in a speech at Friday prayers TEHRAN, Iran — Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei praised the country’s recent missile strike on Israel, state TV reported Friday. Khamenei was leading Friday prayers and was to deliver a rare public sermon in the Iranian capital, Tehran, that was being watched for signs of what Iran might plan next. In a 40-minute speech, he praised Tuesday's missile barrage against Israel as a shining job by Iranian armed forces. 'It will be done in the future again if it becomes necessary,' he said. There was a commemoration ceremony for the late Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah beforehand. Most high-ranking Iranian officials, including President Masoud Pezeshkian and the Revolutionary Guard’s top generals, attended the ceremony. Iran is Hezbollah’s main backer and has sent weapons and billions of dollars to the group over the years. Also on Friday, Iran’s foreign minister Abbas Araghchi arrived in Beirut, where he was expected to discuss the ongoing war between Israel and Hezbollah with Lebanese officials. Spokesperson Esmail Baghaei said Iran sent its first shipment of aid to Lebanon, including 10 tons of food and medicine. Japan prepares to evacuate citizens from Lebanon, urging nationals in Iran to leave, too TOKYO — As Japan prepared to evacuate its citizens from Lebanon, the government also urged those in Iran to leave as soon as possible, while commercial flights are still operating. Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya told reporters Friday that Japan’s embassy in Iran renewed its safety advisory to Japanese nationals this week after Iran fired missiles into Israel. On Thursday, the Japanese Defense Ministry dispatched two C-2 transport aircraft to Jordan to stand by for an evacuation of about 50 Japanese nationals from Lebanon. Iwaya said the government has not decided whether to also dispatch defense aircraft to Iran, where about 440 Japanese citizens are based, but 'we will do our utmost so that we can respond to any contingency in order to protect the safety of Japanese citizens.' Iran’s foreign minister is in Beirut to meet with Lebanese officials BEIRUT — Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi arrived in Beirut where he will discuss with Lebanese officials the ongoing war between Israel and Hezbollah. Iran is the main backer of Hezbollah and has sent weapons and billions of dollars to the group over the years. The Iranian official arrived in Lebanon as Israel launched new airstrikes on different parts of Lebanon, including Beirut’s southern suburb, south Lebanon, and the eastern Bekaa Valley. Araghchi’s visit to Beirut came after Iran launched at least 180 missiles Tuesday into Israel, part of a series of rapidly escalating attacks that threaten to push the Middle East closer to a regionwide war. Israeli strike cuts a main highway linking Lebanon with Syria BEIRUT — Lebanon’s state-run National News Agency says an Israeli airstrike has cut a main highway linking Lebanon with Syria. The agency gave no further details about Friday’s airstrike that led to the closure of a road near the Masnaa Border Crossing, from where tens of thousands of people fleeing war in Lebanon have crossed into Syria over the past two weeks. It’s the first time this major border crossing has been cut off since the beginning of the war. Lebanese General Security recorded more than 250,000 Syrian citizens and over 80,000 Lebanese citizens crossing into Syrian territory during the last week of September, after Israel launched a heavy bombardment of southern and eastern Lebanon. Dama Post, a pro-government Syrian media outlet, said Israeli warplanes fired two missiles and damaged the road between Masnaa Border Crossing in Lebanon and the Syrian crossing point of Jdeidet Yabous. There are half a dozen border crossings between the two countries and most of them remain open. Lebanon’s minister of public works said all border crossings between Lebanon and Syria work under the supervision of the state. Hezbollah is believed to have received much of its weapons from Iran via Syria. The Lebanese group has a presence on both sides of the border where it fights alongside Syrian President Bashar Assad’s forces. Australia's prime minister condemns comments by Iranian ambassador praising Hezbollah's slain leader SYDNEY — Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese on Friday condemned the Iranian ambassador’s comments praising a recently slain Hezbollah leader, but rejected opposition advice to expel the envoy. Ambassador Ahmad Sadeghi described Hezbollah Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah, who was killed by an Israeli missile strike in September in Lebanon, as a 'remarkable leader' on social media. 'The government condemns any support for terrorist organizations such as Hezbollah. We condemn the ambassador’s comments,' Albanese told reporters in Sydney. 'Australia has maintained a relationship with Iran since 1968 that has been continuous. Not because we agree with the regime, but because it’s in Australia’s national interest,' Albanese added. Opposition leader Peter Dutton, who could become prime minister at elections due by May, called for Sadeghi to be expelled over his post. Dutton described Sadeghi’s words as 'completely and utterly at odds with what is in our country’s best interests.' Sadeghi did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday. Australia officially rebuked Sadeghi in August for endorsing Hamas spiritual leader Ahmed Yassin’s hope that 'wiping out the Zionist plague out of the holy lands of Palestine happens no later than 2027.'	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hezbollah-hamas-latest-mideast-4-october-2024-22ce0cdc4813e1f0d657d67868a2da61	2024-10-03T21:58:15-07:00	
Malaysia's Anwar to visit Bangladesh to discuss trade, migrant workers with interim leader Yunus	DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) — Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim will visit Bangladesh on Friday to meet with interim leader Muhammad Yunus, who took over in August after the former prime minister fled during a mass uprising. Anwar's hourslong visit will focus on trade and investment, migrant workers and the Rohingya refugee crisis, officials and media reports said. It is the first visit by a foreign leader to Bangladesh since Yunus took over on Aug. 8 after former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina fled to India . It is also the first state visit by a Malaysian leader to Bangladesh in 11 years. Anwar, who is arriving from Pakistan, is leading a 58-member delegation. Next year, Malaysia will chair the Association for Southeast Asian Nations, and Bangladesh is eager to increase its trade with that region. Bangladesh is also pursuing a policy of increasingly involving ASEAN in resolving the Rohingya refugee crisis. More than 1 million Rohingya refugees from Myanmar live in camps in Bangladesh. Bangladesh was Malaysia’s second-largest trading partner in South Asia in 2023, with total trade reaching $2.78 billion, according to official figures. Malaysia is also one of the leading destinations for Bangladeshi migrant workers. Hundreds of thousands of Bangladeshi workers are employed as low-skilled workers in Malaysia’s construction, manufacturing, plantation and services sectors. But the recruiting process is often corrupt, and allegations of rights violations by Malaysian employers and Bangladeshi recruiting agencies are rampant. More than 6,000 Bangladeshi students study at Malaysian higher education institutions, according to 2023 figures.	https://apnews.com/article/bangladesh-malaysia-yunus-anwar-59c33187e4f6152af362c6e46084c014	2024-10-03T21:52:47-07:00	
Israeli airstrikes rock southern suburbs of Beirut and cut off a key crossing into Syria	BEIRUT (AP) — Israel carried out a series of massive airstrikes overnight in southern suburbs of Beirut and another that cut off the main border crossing between Lebanon and Syria. The new wave of strikes came after Israel warned people to evacuate communities in southern Lebanon that are outside a United Nations-declared buffer zone, as the yearlong conflict between Israel and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah escalates. Israel launched a ground incursion into Lebanon on Tuesday and its forces have been clashing with Hezbollah militants in a narrow strip along the border. A series of attacks before the incursion killed some of the group's key members, including longtime leader Hassan Nasrallah. The blasts overnight rocked Beirut’s southern suburbs, sending huge plumes of smoke and flames into the night sky and shaking buildings kilometers (miles) away in the Lebanese capital. The Israeli military did not immediately comment on what the intended target was, and there was no information immediately available on casualties. Lebanon’s state-run National News Agency reported that there were more than 10 consecutive airstrikes in the area late Thursday. The agency also reported that an Israeli airstrike led to the closure of the road near the busy Masnaa Border Crossing, from which tens of thousands of people fleeing war in Lebanon have crossed into Syria over the past two weeks. It gave no other details. The airstrike that cut the busiest border crossing between the two countries came a day after an Israeli military spokesperson said Lebanon’s Hezbollah has been trying to transport military equipment through the border crossing. Hezbollah is believed to have received much of its weaponry from Iran via Syria. The group has a presence on both sides of the border, a region where it has been fighting alongside Syrian President Bashar Assad’s forces. Dama Post, a pro-government Syrian media outlet, said Israeli warplanes fired two missiles, damaging the road between Masnaa Border Crossing in Lebanon and the Syrian crossing point of Jdeidet Yabous. It was the first time this major border crossing has been cut off since the beginning of the war. Lebanese General Security recorded 256,614 Syrian citizens and 82,264 Lebanese citizens crossing into Syrian territory between Sept. 23 — when the Israel launched a heavy bombardment of southern and eastern Lebanon — and Sept. 30. There are half a dozen border crossings between the two countries and most of them remain open. Lebanon’s minister of public works said all border crossings between Lebanon and Syria work under the supervision of the state. Israel and Hezbollah have traded fire across Lebanon's southern border almost daily since the day after Hamas’ cross-border attack on Oct. 7, 2023, in which the militants killed 1,200 Israelis and took 250 others hostage. Meanwhile, the Israeli army said it carried out a strike Thursday in Tulkarem, a militant stronghold in the West Bank, in coordination with the Shin Bet internal security service. The Palestinian Health Ministry said 18 people were killed in an Israeli strike on a refugee camp there. Violence has flared across the Israeli-occupied territory since the Israel-Hamas war erupted in October 2023. Tulkarem and other northern cities have seen some of the worst violence. Israel declared war on Hamas in the Gaza Strip in response to their Oct. 7 attack. More than 41,000 Palestinians have since been killed in the territory, and just over half the dead have been women and children, according to local health officials. Nearly 2,000 people have been killed in Lebanon in that time, most of them since Sept. 23, according to the Lebanese Health Ministry.	https://apnews.com/article/mideast-wars-lebanon-hezbollah-hamas-4-october-2024-5f2e512d5334b6f7fd7f5a46400e6979	2024-10-03T21:51:52-07:00

Japan's new leader expresses regret for governing party slush fund scandal, vows stronger defense	TOKYO (AP) — New Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba opened his first policy speech in office Friday by expressing deep regrets over the governing party's slush funds scandal that dogged his predecessor. Ishiba replaced Fumio Kishida on Tuesday with the paramount mission of quickly pacifying public anger over financial misconduct in the Liberal Democratic Party and regaining support ahead of an Oct. 27 parliamentary election. 'I will achieve politics that is not for politicians but for the people,' Ishiba said, pledging to provide sincere explanations and ensure that lawmakers abide by the rules. He set five policy pillars to uphold, including security, economy and disaster resilience. Ishiba said he will bolster Japan's military capability to defend itself from threats from China, Russia and North Korea under the framework of the Japan-U.S. security alliance. He did not mention two goals he advocated before taking office — making the Japan-U.S. security alliance more equitable and establishing a NATO-like collective defense system in Asia — apparently to avoid controversy ahead of the election that the LDP must win. Omitting those goals also saves him from possibly irking Washington, but may disappoint those who saw him as willing to speak up even when he risked disagreement with his own party. Ishiba noted violations of Japanese airspace last month by Chinese and Russian warplanes and North Korea’s advancing missile technology and testing as examples of the worsening security environment that Japan faces and stressed the need for a further buildup of Japan’s military. He said he will promote a 'strategic, mutually beneficial relationship' with China and increase communication on all levels to build 'stable and constructive' ties. He also said he will further strengthen and expand Japan’s ties with South Korea and the trilateral cooperation Japan has with it and the United States. He called the Japan-U.S. security alliance a cornerstone of Japanese diplomacy and security as well as the foundation of peace and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region and international society. The first public support ratings for Ishiba as prime minister were around 50% or even lower, the lowest levels for a new leader, according to Japanese media. Opposition leaders have criticized him for rushing to hold an election after only adding a new face and fresh image to the party without any concrete results. He plans to dissolve parliament next Wednesday for an election on Oct. 27, allowing only a few days of debate on his policies. On the economy, Ishiba said in his speech that he wants workers to have sustainable salary increases that exceed inflation, and will promote investment to create 'a virtuous cycle of growth and distribution.' He promised economic support for low-income households and measures for regional revitalization and disaster resilience. Despite earlier supporting a phasing out of nuclear power following the Fukushima nuclear plant disaster, he pledged to maximize the use of nuclear energy and push for geothermal and other renewable sources to meet the soaring electricity needs of data centers in the age of AI. ___ Follow AP's Asia-Pacific coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/asia-pacific	https://apnews.com/article/japan-ishiba-policy-us-china-security-economy-a5412430588c624ea25ee5dc8f38ae7f	2024-10-03T21:05:10-07:00	
Tunisia votes Sunday in its third presidential election since the Arab Spring	TUNIS, Tunisia (AP) — With his major opponents imprisoned or left off the ballot, Tunisian President Kais Saied faces few obstacles to winning reelection on Sunday, five years after riding anti-establishment backlash to a first term. The North African country's Oct. 6 presidential election is its third since protests led to the 2011 ouster of President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali — the first autocrat toppled in the Arab Spring uprisings that also overthrew leaders in Egypt, Libya and Yemen. International observers praised the previous two contests as meeting democratic norms. However, a raft of arrests and actions taken by a Saied-appointed election authority have raised questions about whether this year's race is free and fair. And opposition parties have called for a boycott. What's at stake? Not long ago, Tunisia was hailed as the Arab Spring’s only success story. As coups, counter-revolutions and civil wars convulsed the region, the North African nation enshrined a new democratic constitution and saw its leading civil society groups win the Nobel Peace Prize for brokering political compromise. But its new leaders were unable to buoy its struggling economy and were plagued by political infighting and episodes of violence and terrorism. Amid that backdrop, Saied, then 61 and a political outsider, won his first term in 2019. He advanced to a runoff promising to usher in a 'New Tunisia' and hand more power to young people and local governments. This year's election will offer a window into popular opinion about the trajectory that Tunisia’s fading democracy has taken since Saied took office. Saied’s supporters appear to have remained loyal to him and his promise to transform Tunisia. But he isn’t affiliated with any political party, and it’s unclear just how deep his support runs among Tunisians. It’s the first presidential race since Saied upended the country’s politics in July 2021, declaring a state of emergency, sacking his prime minister, suspending the parliament and rewriting Tunisia’s constitution consolidating his own power. Those actions outraged pro-democracy groups and leading opposition parties, who called them a coup. Yet despite anger from career politicians, voters approved Saied’s new constitution the following year in a low-turnout referendum. Authorities subsequently began arresting Saied’s critics including journalists, lawyers, politicians and civil society figures, charging them with endangering state security and violating a controversial anti-fake news law that observers argue stifles dissent. Fewer voters turned out to participate in parliamentary and local elections in 2022 and 2023 amid economic woes and widespread political apathy. Who's running? Many wanted to challenge Saied, but few were able to. Seventeen potential candidates filed paperwork to run and Tunisia’s election authority approved only three: Saied, Zouhair Maghzaoui and Ayachi Zammel. Maghzaoui is a veteran politician who has campaigned against Saied’s economic program and recent political arrests. Still, he is loathed by opposition parties for backing Saied’s constitution and earlier moves to consolidate power. Zammel is a businessman supported by politicians not boycotting the race. During the campaign, he has been sentenced to prison time in four voter fraud cases related to signatures his team gathered to qualify for the ballot. Others had hoped to run but were prevented. The election authority, known as ISIE, last month dismissed a court ruling ordering it to reinstate three additional challengers. With many arrested, detained or convicted on charges related to their political activities, Tunisia’s most well-known opposition figures are also not participating. That includes the 83-year-old leader of Tunisia’s most well organized political party Ennahda, which rose to power after the Arab Spring. Rached Ghannouchi, the Islamist party’s co-founder and Tunisia’s former house speaker, has been imprisoned since last year after criticizing Saied. The crackdown also includes one of Ghannouchi’s most vocal detractors: Abir Moussi, a right-wing lawmaker known for railing against Islamists and speaking nostalgically for pre-Arab Spring Tunisia. The 49-year-old president of the Free Destourian Party also was imprisoned last year after criticizing Saied. Other less known politicians who announced plans to run have also since been jailed or sentenced on similar charges. Opposition groups have called to boycott the race. The National Salvation Front — a coalition of secular and Islamist parties including Ennahda — has denounced the process as a sham and questioned the election’s legitimacy. What are the other issues? The country’s economy continues to face major challenges. Despite Saied’s promises to chart a new course for Tunisia, unemployment has steadily increased to one of the region’s highest at 16%, with young Tunisians hit particularly hard. Growth has been slow since the COVID-19 pandemic and Tunisia has remained reliant on multilateral lenders such as the World Bank and the European Union. Today, Tunisia owes them more than $9 billion. Apart from agricultural reform, Saied’s overarching economic strategy is unclear. Negotiations have long been stalled over a $1.9 billion bailout package offered by the International Monetary Fund in 2022. Saied has been unwilling to accept its conditions, which include restructuring indebted state-owned companies and cutting public wages. Some of the IMF’s stipulations — including lifting subsidies for electricity, flour and fuel — would likely be unpopular among Tunisians who rely on their low costs. Economic analysts say that foreign and local investors are reluctant to invest in Tunisia due to continued political risks and an absence of reassurances. The dire economic straits have had a two-pronged effect on one of Tunisia’s key political issues: migration. From 2019 to 2023, an increasing number of Tunisians attempted to migrate to Europe without authorization. Meanwhile, Saied's administration has taken a harsh approach against migrants arriving from sub-Saharan Africa, many who have found themselves stuck in Tunisia while trying to reach Europe. Saied energized his supporters in early 2023 by accusing migrants of violence and crime and portraying them as part of a plot to change the country’s demography. The anti-migrant rhetoric prompted extreme violence against migrants and a crackdown from authorities. Last year, security forces targeted migrant communities from the coast to the capital with a series of arrests, deportation to the desert and the demolition of tent camps in Tunis and coastal towns. Bodies continue to wash ashore on Tunisia’s coastline as boats carrying Tunisians and migrants from sub-Saharan Africa manage only to make it a few nautical miles before sinking. What does it mean overseas? Tunisia has maintained ties with its traditional Western allies but also forged new partnerships under Saied. Much like many populist leaders who’ve taken power worldwide, Saied emphasizes sovereignty and freeing Tunisia from what he calls 'foreign diktats.' He has insisted that Tunisia won’t become a 'border guard' for Europe, which has sought agreements with him to better police the Mediterranean. Tunisia and Iran lifted visa requirements and in May announced plans to boost trade ties. It has also accepted millions in loans as part of China’s Belt and Road Initiative to build hospitals, stadiums and ports.

A year later, Israeli survivors reflect on the lingering toll of Oct. 7	Lilach Almog walks past the remains of a police station seized by Hamas militants and buildings pockmarked by bullets in her southern Israeli town multiple times a day. 'Every corner has become a memorial,' she said. 'Even if you want to forget for a bit, you can’t. You look outside at the wall and it reminds you of everything all over again.' Almog joined the roughly 120,000 Israelis displaced by the Israel-Hamas war but has returned home to constant reminders of the Oct. 7, 2023, attack. A year later, survivors reflect on that day that changed everything. They hid in bedrooms, bomb shelters, safe rooms and beneath trees as Hamas militants poured across the border. In the aftermath, they've mourned loved ones, struggled with anxiety, suffered survivor's guilt and questioned whether they will ever return home to places that still bear the scars of their ordeal. Lilach Almog, 37, Sderot The force of a blast at the police station across from her apartment building knocked Almog off her feet on Oct. 7. She had scrambled to her home's fortified room after air raid sirens sounded in Sderot and watched from the window in disbelief as dozens of gunmen walked down her street with rocket-propelled grenades on their shoulders. They seized the police station, and a dayslong battle raged before the Israeli military bulldozed the building with militants still inside. More than 30 civilians and police officers were killed in the area around the station. Almog fled Sderot with her children and mother, living in a hotel in Tel Aviv for eight months, but government assistance ran out in August, forcing her to return to Sderot and memories of that day, when Hamas-led militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took about 250 hostage. The resulting war has killed more than 41,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not differentiate between fighters and civilians but says more than half were women and children. The anxiety of the past year has overwhelmed her, forcing her to leave her work as an architect and interior designer and go on disability leave. Her 9-year-old son began wetting the bed. Her 11-year-old daughter refuses to go anywhere without her. 'As long as the war is still continuing, there’s no way to feel calm, to return to our lives,' she said. 'We still have the hostages there. We still have nightmares. There’s no end.' Ziv Abud, 27, Nova music festival survivor and girlfriend of hostage Eliya Cohen When Ziv Abud spotted the bomb shelter on the side of the road as she was trying to escape the attack on the Nova music festival, she breathed a sigh of relief, thinking it would be a safe place to wait out the rockets. 'We know now that the shelter we went into was basically going into a death trap,' she said. Nearly 30 people had crammed into the concrete shelter meant to hold about 10. When Hamas militants arrived, they started tossing grenades inside. A former soldier was able to toss out eight grenades, but the ninth exploded inside the shelter, instantly killing about half the people, Abud said. In the smoke and chaos, militants grabbed people to take as hostages and sprayed the shelter with bullets. Abud survived, protected by the crush of bodies above her. When she opened her eyes, she saw the bodies of her nephew and his girlfriend but no trace of her boyfriend, Eliya Cohen. Four people, including Israeli-American Hersh Goldberg-Polin, were kidnapped, and six others survived. Over the past year, Abud has campaigned tirelessly for the hostages and flown around the world to press for Cohen’s return. 'I think less about my own trauma, just how to bring Eliyah home,' she said. Shlomo Margalit, 86, and Hanna'le Margalit, 79, Kibbutz Nir Oz Shlomo and Hanna'le Margalit still struggle to comprehend how they survived. All of the residents on both sides of their home in Kibbutz Nir Oz were killed or kidnapped on Oct. 7. Hamas militants entered their home three times but did not go into the safe room where they were hiding. Of Nir Oz's nearly 400 residents, 42 were killed and 75 were kidnapped that day. But the couple, part of the founding generation on the kibbutz, was spared. The Margalits have been married for 64 years and lived in Nir Oz nearly all that time, working to transform the barren desert into a village filled with towering trees and green lawns. The kibbutz was devastated by the attack and will take years to rebuild, though questions remain about how — or even if — it should be. Like most of the residents of Nir Oz, the couple is living in temporary housing, a development of new apartment buildings about an hour northeast. 'I still can’t think about what was lost. I think for me that will happen much later,' Hanna'le Margalit said. 'Right now, all the energy and our work is for survival, to get used to a new place, to hope the hostages will come home.' Shlomo Margalit returns to the kibbutz about once a week to care for the cemetery, a job he held before Oct. 7. But now many graves have been added. Each time he is there, he chooses one person and goes to their ruined house to properly bid them farewell. 'It’s too many to do all at once,' he said. 'It’s too sad and too hard. It’s impossible.' Eilat Shalev, 47, Nova festival survivor Eilat Shalev remembers that the pomelos — large citrus fruits — were about to be harvested a few days after Oct. 7 in southern Israel. She knows that because farmers had already set out large collection bins, which she hid behind as Hamas militants overran the road leading to the Nova music festival, where she had been dancing with her husband, Shai. The two got separated as militants began shooting at their car. Shalev ran toward nearby fields, jumping in and out of vehicles, until she found herself near a pomelo orchard. 'I grabbed the first tree I saw on the left side. I hid with my hands on my head and my face in the earth, just praying to God that God will rescue me so I will live and return to my kids,' she said. Minutes later, a bullet hit just centimeters from her head. She played dead for hours before making her way back to the road. Eventually, Israeli security forces brought her to a police station. As the hours passed and her husband didn't make contact, she grew increasingly worried. He was pronounced dead five days later. Shalev said she and her four children, ages 12 to 23, have turned to Judaism for comfort. But she has trouble sleeping at night and struggles to run her household alone. 'As the days go by, one day and another day and another day, it’s actually getting worse. It doesn’t get better,' Shalev said. 'Missing him gets stronger because you understand more and more that he’s not coming back. He’s really not coming back.' Liat Atzili, 50, hostage from Kibbutz Nir Oz After 54 days in captivity in Gaza, Liat Atzili was determined to return to her work as a high school history and civics teacher to wrest back control of her identity. 'I feel most comfortable and most at ease, and it’s the thing that comes the most naturally for me to be in a classroom,' she said. 'It’s a real connection to what I used to be like and what my life was before.' She counts herself lucky to have been held in an apartment in conditions much better than the hostages kept in underground tunnels. Still, during her captivity, Atzili had no idea whether her family had survived. The day after her release as part of a November cease-fire deal, the Israeli military announced that her husband, Aviv, had been killed and his body was being held in Gaza. Two of her three children were on the kibbutz, and both survived. The upcoming anniversary is more difficult than Atzili anticipated, a milestone for how much she has lost over the past year. On Oct. 7, she plans for at least part of the day to stay in bed and watch 'Dirty Dancing.' Next month, Atzili hopes to return to one of her passions, giving tours at Yad Vashem, Israel’s Holocaust Museum. She understands the parallels people want to draw between the Holocaust and what happened to her, but the reality in the Middle East is different, she said. 'The Israeli Jews sort of wish that the Palestinians disappeared, and the Palestinians sort of wish that the Jews disappeared, but that’s not going to happen,' she said. 'Nobody’s going anywhere. We don’t have to love each other, but we have to get along, and we have to find a way that everybody can live here in safety.'	https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-gaza-war-anniversary-survivors-fb65aa677e344a873566dc948d6bf52a	2024-10-03T19:12:20-07:00	
For migrant women who land in Colorado looking for jobs, a common answer emerges: No	AURORA, Colo. (AP) — East Colfax Avenue was the best place to find a job. That's what everyone told Sofia Roca. Never mind the open drug use, the sex workers or the groups of other migrant women marching the sidewalks soliciting work at the very same Mexican restaurants and bakeries. On East Colfax in Aurora, Colorado, bosses and customers would speak Spanish and might be willing to hire someone like Roca — a 49-year-old immigrant from Colombia — without legal authorization to work. That was the rationale for going back to Colfax each morning, fruitless as it was. 'Do you know how to cook Mexican food?' asked one woman, looking up from the limes she was quartering, when Roca inquired about a kitchen position advertised on the door. Roca’s accent was a giveaway: not Mexican. 'I can learn,' Roca replied in Spanish. Responded the woman: 'We’re not hiring.' As record numbers of South Americans attempt to cross the U.S. southern border seeking better economic opportunities, many are landing in communities that are unprepared for them — and sometimes outright hostile. And many migrants have also been unprepared for the realities of their new home. An influx of migrants strains one town Women are leaving Colombia, and to a greater extent Venezuela, to escape starvation and violence, to provide for their children and to seek medical care. They represent some of the more than 42,000 migrants who have arrived in the Denver area over two years. Many didn’t know anyone in Denver. But it was the closest city to which Texas was offering free bus rides, both to relieve pressure on its towns and to make a political point to liberal-leaning cities about immigration’s impact on the border. From Denver, untold numbers made their way to the neighboring suburb of Aurora, lured by cheaper rent and abundant Spanish speakers. But finding a job and an affordable place to stay has been anything but easy, and women face their own particular challenges. Last year, nearly 900,000 women and girls tried to cross the U.S. southern border, more than a fivefold increase over the last decade, U.S. Customs and Border Protection data shows. Like many of them, Roca came to the United States to help her children. Her adult daughter back in Colombia suffers from lupus and can’t afford 'the good medicines.' The economy in Colombia never recovered from pandemic shutdowns, and Roca heard from acquaintances that in the United States she could earn $1,000 a week. 'That’s a lot of money in Colombia,' she said. Back home, 'one U.S. dollar can buy breakfast for your entire family.' Roca set out for the United States with an uncle. He was detained in Mexico, but Roca made it across the border in Juárez and told U.S. agents she was seeking asylum. She heard from a shelter worker in El Paso that Denver was offering free housing for migrants and Texas would pay to get her there. As of September, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott has bused at least 119,000 migrants from the border to cities run by Democratic mayors, including Denver, New York, Chicago and Washington, D.C., according to a press release from the governor’s office. Roca arrived in November and stayed for two weeks in a hotel-turned-shelter paid for by the city of Denver. When she went looking for work in front of Home Depot and along East Colfax, she observed an icy reception from locals. 'They said horrible things about Venezuelans,' she said. She didn't know the benefits many recent migrants have received — specifically, a path to a temporary work visa and with it better-paying jobs — were causing resentment among Aurora's large Mexican community. Many have loved ones in the country illegally or have themselves lived for years in the United States without legal permission to work. As chaos and economic collapse drove more migrants to the border, President Joe Biden’s administration created and expanded legal pathways to enter the U.S., with the possibility of applying for work permits. However, in June, Biden temporarily suspended asylum for new immigrants who cross illegally, ending a main pathway to legal work. Roca never was eligible for a work permit, but Mexican residents in Aurora still associate her with the many migrants who are. Resentment for newcomers was building in another corner of Aurora, too — City Hall. Aurora officials in February had warned other communities against housing migrants there, vowing not to spend city money to help them. This summer, Aurora’s mayor repeated a landlord’s claim that a notorious Venezuelan gang had taken over an apartment building, saying he would investigate how so many Venezuelans ended up living in Aurora. Even though police say gangs hadn't taken over the building, former President Donald Trump took up the claim, mentioning it at his campaign rallies. The mayor last month walked back some of his comments. She wants a job — but not in ‘the business’ Roca never made a deliberate decision to settle in Aurora. To her, it wasn't clear where Denver ended and Aurora began, or that Denver was more eager to help migrants coming to the area. So when her time is almost up at the Denver shelter, she does the only thing she knows to do: She heads to East Colfax in Aurora. She walks up and down the sidewalks, dodging people who’d taken over the bus shelters to shoot up drugs or smoke fentanyl and who sell apparently shoplifted toiletries on the sidewalks. She approaches migrants holding cardboard signs and begging for money outside Walmart, asking if they know of work or a place to stay. A man standing by his truck parked outside a Goodwill thrift store catches her attention. He is singing along to rap music in Spanish. He seems happy, she thinks. He seems like a good guy. He says he can help her and her cousin, who arrived a few weeks earlier. But not in Colorado. She can come back to Kentucky with him and his family. To hold her over in the short term, the man — El Cubano, she calls him — gives her $10 and invites her for ice cream. After more than a week of staying with the family in Kentucky and cooking and eating meals together, Roca learns El Cubano's wife works in el negocio, or 'the business.' There is not much work in Kentucky, so she earns her money through sex work, she tells Roca, while her kids play a few feet away. A few days later, while they are cooking dinner together at the couple’s trailer, a Mexican man in his 30s pulls up outside in a pickup truck. He’d seen a picture of Roca and liked her — and would pay $1,000 for two nights with Roca, the wife says. Roca would keep $600, the couple would get $400. Roca would have to pay him $6 for each ride to and from his house. Roca stops chopping the onion and looks at her cousin. Don’t go with that man, the cousin says. You don’t know him. Roca considers all of the jobs she’s done in her life. Caring for Alzheimer’s patients as a home health aide. Answering phones at a call center. Selling beauty products on the street in Mexico. In her month in the United States, she has quickly come to understand she'll have to make sacrifices in this country. That the reports she’d heard back in Colombia about earning $1,000 a week were likely hyperbole. That she’ll have to push her body to its limits doing manual labor. She’ll have to accept below-standard wages until she gets work permission, if it ever comes. She’ll have to stay in someone’s living room with other new arrivals and give up her privacy. But subjecting herself to the whims of a stranger in such an intimate and vulnerable way? 'No,' she tells the woman. 'I’m not going anywhere with anyone.' The man is told to leave. The insults start immediately. How are you going to earn money, girl? asks the woman. You’re not going to just live here for free. The food here is good, isn’t it? But it’s not free. Roca doesn't know what to expect — maybe violence. She and her cousin have no money or transportation. They're essentially trapped. But a few days later, Roca leaves as El Cubano yells insults from his trailer. A Venezuelan woman she met outside Home Depot finds someone to help them leave Kentucky. Where did they want to go? Somewhere she knew people, she remembers thinking. Somewhere with other migrants. Back to Aurora and East Colfax Avenue. Even among Aurora's migrants, life isn't better Back in Aurora, Roca reached out to a Venezuelan woman she'd met briefly begging for money outside the Walmart on Colfax. Soon she took a place in the woman’s living room, sharing a queen-sized blow-up mattress with the woman’s teenage son. Roca found a job on the weekends helping a man set up and break down his stall at an outdoor flea market. She hefted large sacks of used clothing over her shoulders, put out the clothing on display, talked to customers. All for $10 an hour. 'It’s an abusive wage,' she said, 'but it’s a job.' She tried standing outside Home Depot, but found many people propositioned her for sex or wouldn’t pay her after she completed legitimate jobs. She gave up standing outside a day laborer’s center in Aurora when she didn’t feel safe trying to jockey for work against dozens of men, who would push her out of the way and jump onto moving trucks rounding up workers. On most days walking along Colfax Avenue, Roca says, men would solicit her for sex, holding up their fingers to signal how many hundreds of dollars they were willing to pay. As she looked for work in March, she came across what looked like an old motel, a place she hadn’t tried before. 'Is this a hotel or a motel? I don’t know,' she said as she opened the heavy metal door. 'Let’s check.' In the small vestibule, a 1970s-era cigarette vending machine stood in the corner. A grandfatherly man waited behind a plexiglass sliding window. There were no vacancies, but he urged her to try the bar in the back. 'They’re always looking for girls,' he said. Roca walked to the rear of the building and recognized the name of the bar. 'I know about this place,' she said. At a few Mexican cantinas around Aurora and Denver, women are paid to talk and drink with men. 'Ficheras,' as the women are known in Spanish, sell beers at a significant markup to men and pocket the profits. It can be a fast way to earn money, but also a route to sex trafficking or the drug trade. Visit these establishments, and you can see some 'ficheras' wearing government-issued ankle bracelets with their sky-high heels. The bracelets were given to them by federal immigration officials to monitor their movements while they await immigration hearings. 'I don’t think I have to do that yet,' Roca said. 'But this street — it only offers prostitution.' She boards another Greyhound — and moves on Since returning to Aurora, Roca had discovered she has few options for establishing legal residence or working legally in the U.S. She told U.S. Border Patrol officials she plans to plead for asylum at her deportation hearing next year, but she doubts they will grant it. Ironically, what happened to her in Kentucky could help her win a visa. The U.S. government issues special visas to victims of sex trafficking here, but Roca has never wanted to report the Cuban couple, fearing they might come after her. She had gotten in touch through Facebook with a high school friend from Colombia living for the last year in the northeastern United States. 'She’s told me she can get me a job at a hotel and I can stay with her,' she said. 'What would you do if you were me?' she asked a reporter. 'Would you go?' The idea of learning to move around a new American city exhausted Roca. But without more work, there wasn’t much keeping her in Aurora. Her roommates were headed to eviction court the next week. She didn’t know where she would go if they lost the apartment. Two days later, with about $80 in her pocket, Roca boarded a Greyhound bus paid for by the city of Denver. She landed in a new town — one that hasn’t received busloads of migrants from Texas — and reunited with her high school friend. (The Associated Press is not identifying her new location, since Roca is afraid the Cuban couple might seek her out after she spoke about them in the media.) Roca’s friend followed through on her promises, allowing her to live with her and connecting her to a job cleaning hotel rooms. Roca has already changed jobs and has found one she likes better. She walks through the city with ease — and anonymously. 'It’s a huge difference from my life in Denver,' she says. 'There’s less chaos, and no one has disrespected me. It's been a great refuge.' She's not sure how long she'll stay. But Sofia Roca will never live in Aurora, Colorado, again. ___ The Associated Press’ education coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Record-setting number of transgender candidates risk their lives in Brazil	RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) — Benny Briolly beamed as she strode through the concrete favela alleyway in a snow-white dress, volunteers proudly waving campaign flags emblazoned with her face. The city councilwoman and nearly 1,000 other transgender politicians are running Sunday in every one of Brazil's 26 states, according to the nation’s electoral court, which is tracking them for the first time. The number of candidacies has tripled since the last local elections four years ago, when trans rights group Antra mapped them. As trans people have set their sights on political office, many have been met with intimidation efforts bent on turning them away, including a candidate in Brazil’s biggest city who survived an assassination attempt last week. Trans advocates report record deaths in Brazil More trans people — 100 — were murdered in Brazil last year than in any other country, according to Transgender Europe, a network of global non-profits that tracks the data. Those precise statistics are almost certainly driven by a combination of poor reporting elsewhere and Brazil's active network of advocates, but experts agree that transphobia is ubiquitous. On International Women’s Day last year, Nikolas Ferreira — the federal lawmaker who received more votes than any other — donned a blond wig in Congress’ lower house. He said it allowed him to speak as a woman and denounce trans people. In 2022 Rio state lawmaker Rodrigo Amorim called Briolly 'an aberration of nature' in the state's legislature. Such tactics rally voters by portraying trans people as a menace to be courageously fought, according to Ligia Fabris, a gender and law specialist and a visiting professor at Yale University. Legacy of a far-right president for trans politicians Both Amorim and Ferreira were staunch allies of far-right former President Jair Bolsonaro. Transgender politician Leonora Áquilla, a candidate for city council in Sao Paulo this year, said that Bolsonaro had inflamed transphobia and that she has had to stare down people shouting death threats to her face. Bolsonaro lost his re-election bid to leftist Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva in 2022 but transphobia has far from retreated. Since entering the public eye, Briolly has received over 700 death threats. Some have included the address of her home in Rio de Janeiro’s metro area and warnings that she would suffer the same fate as city councilwoman Marielle Franco, a champion for LGBTQ+ rights who was gunned down in 2018. That threat prompted the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights to demand that Brazil provide Briolly protection. She won’t be scared off her reelection bid even though some may want her dead. 'When we get into politics, our bodies become threats and we become constant targets,' Briolly told the Associated Press, with the city of Niteroi — across the bay from Rio — stretching out behind her. 'Our bodies are revolutionary, are daring ... they are bodies that emanate hope to all those who were left behind.' An armed escort and a bulletproof vest Áquilla narrowly escaped an assassination attempt on Sept. 26. She was in northern Sao Paulo on her way to look into reports of transphobia when a motorcycle deliberately slammed into her car. When she got out, the driver revved his engine, and instinctively she ducked. The bullet from his gun missed her, and he fired more shots as she lay there, pretending to be dead. He escaped and Áquilla has ceased in-person campaigning. 'There have been so many threats they became banal; we never thought it would happen. I’m completely in shock. I’m taking a sedative, because I can’t control my nervousness, my anxiety,' she said in a video call. 'Right on the eve of the election, the moment when I most need to be on the streets, they’re trying to silence me.' Duda Salabert, who is running for mayor in Brazil’s sixth biggest city, Belo Horizonte, made history in 2022 when elected alongside another trans woman to Brazil’s lower house of Congress. Their victories were widely regarded as a breakthrough for trans representation, but Salabert said that during that campaign she received death threats daily. 'I had to walk with an armed escort ... I had to vote with a bulletproof vest, according to police instructions, and I couldn’t go into large crowds because I risked being attacked,' she said. This year, Salabert said she is seeking to become the first trans mayor of a major city in Latin America. 'It’s a joy, because we’re making history, but it’s sad because our candidacy highlights the entire history of exclusion, violence and alienation of the transvestite and transgender community from electoral processes in Brazil and Latin America,' she said in a video call. Positive changes accompany the violence and fear Indianarae Siqueira, a trangender sex worker and longtime activist running to be a city councilor in Rio, says that increasingly seeing trans people occupy places of power has had a snowball effect. 'Those who managed to win and are there — I think this is a reference and gives incentive so that people want to enter (politics),' she said during an interview on the steps leading to Rio’s municipal assembly. Back in the Niteroi favela, Briolly agreed that there’s an element of joy to playing an active role in politics, even amid the threats. 'For me, it’s pride — a latent, powerful pride — that grows more and more in my heart and in the heart of each and every person who believes that my body and my voice are just a reflection, an empowerment of the collective struggle,' she said. 'When a Black trans woman moves, she moves the whole of society.'	https://apnews.com/article/brazil-transgender-trans-candidates-elections-41e80c76edee7fea645bd6e859ee0143	2024-10-03T19:08:27-07:00	
Stock market today: Wall Street wobbles higher after strong jobs data pushes up rate forecasts	NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks are wobbling higher on Friday after a surprisingly strong jobs report raised optimism about the economy but also forced a rethink about how much lower interest rates will go over the next year. The S&amp;P 500 was up 0.4% in midday trading after paring a bigger gain. The Dow Jones Industrial Average went from an early gain of 300 points to a modest loss and back to a gain of 71 points, or 0.2%, as of 11 a.m. Eastern time. The Nasdaq composite was 0.7% higher. Banks, cruise-ship operators and other companies whose profits tend to benefit the most from a stronger economy led the way. Norwegian Cruise Line steamed 5.8% higher, JPMorgan Chase rose 1.8% and the small companies in the Russell 2000 index gained 1.2%. Stock indexes are clawing back some of their losses from earlier in the week, caused by worries that worsening tensions in the Middle East could lead to disruptions in the global flow of oil. Crude prices ticked higher again on Friday, but the moves were more modest than earlier in the week, as the world continues its wait to see how Israel will respond to Iran’s missile attack from Tuesday. In the meantime, the strength of the U.S. economy reclaimed its spot as the top mover of markets. Treasury yields jumped in the bond market after the U.S. government said employers added 254,000 more jobs to their payrolls last month than they cut. That was an acceleration from August’s hiring pace of 159,000 and blew past economists’ forecasts. It was a 'grand slam' of a report, according to Lindsay Rosner, head of multi-sector investing within Goldman Sachs Asset Management. She said policy makers at the Federal Reserve, who have been trying to pull off the difficult feat of keeping the economy humming while getting inflation under control, 'must be smiling.' Friday’s report capped a week of mostly encouraging data on the job market. Such strength helps allay one of Wall Street’s top questions: whether the job market will continue to hold up after the Federal Reserve earlier kept interest rates at a two-decade high. Before Friday’s jobs report, data had been showing the general trend was a slowdown in hiring by U.S. employers. That’s not surprising given that the Fed had been trying to press the brake hard enough on the economy to stamp out high inflation. But Friday's blowout numbers bolstered hope that the U.S. economy will indeed avoid a recession, particularly now that the Federal Reserve has made a drastic switch in policy and begun cutting interest rates to give it more juice. The Fed last month lowered its main interest rate for the first time in more than four years and indicated more cuts will arrive through next year. Friday's jobs data was strong enough to push traders to downgrade their forecasts for how steeply the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates by at its next meeting in November. They’re now forecasting less than a 10% probability that the Fed will deliver another larger-than-usual cut, according to data from CME Group. That’s down from the better-than-a-coin-flip’s chance they saw a week ago. That in turn sent the yield on the two-year Treasury shooting up to 3.88% from 3.71% late Thursday. The 10-year yield rose to 3.95% from 3.85%. Such increases in yields hurt stocks of home builders, real-estate owners and other companies that would have benefited the most from a continued easing in rates for mortgages and other loans. D.R. Horton, PulteGroup and Lennar all sank at least 3% for three of the biggest losses in the S&amp;P 500. Home Depot dropped 1.7% and was the biggest reason the Dow Jones Industrial Average was lagging other stock indexes. Friday's jobs report was so strong that it means the Federal Reserve may ultimately not need to cut interest rates as much as investors had been thinking. 'This report tells the Fed that they still need to be careful as a strong labor market along with sticky housing/shelter data shows that it won’t be easy to engineer meaningfully lower inflation from here in the nearer term,' according to Scott Wren, senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. At Bank of America, economist Aditya Bhave said he expects the Federal Reserve to stop cutting when its federal funds rate reaches a range of 3% to 3.25%, or a quarter of a percentage point higher than he was earlier forecasting. The rate is currently sitting in a range of 4.75% to 5%. Also Friday, some 45,000 dockworkers at East and Gulf coast ports are returning to work after their union reached a deal to suspend its three-day strike until Jan. 15 to provide time to negotiate a new contract. That helped calm worries that a lengthy strike could have pushed up on inflation and dragged on the economy.

North Korea's Kim threatens to destroy South Korea with nuclear strikes if provoked	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korean leader Kim Jong Un threatened to use nuclear weapons and destroy South Korea permanently if provoked, state media reported Friday, after the South’s leader warned that Kim’s regime would collapse if he attempted to use nuclear arms. The exchange of such rhetoric between the rival Koreas is nothing new, but the latest comments come during heightened animosities over the North’s recent disclosure of a nuclear facility and its continuation of missile tests. Next week, observers say North Korea's rubber-stamp parliament is expected to constitutionally declare a hostile 'two-state' system on the Korean Peninsula to formally reject reconciliation with South Korea and codify new national borders. During a visit to a special operation forces unit on Wednesday, Kim said his military 'would use without hesitation all the offensive forces it possesses, including nuclear weapons,' if South Korea attempts to use armed forces encroaching upon the sovereignty of North Korea, according to the North’s official Korean Central News Agency. 'If such a situation comes, the permanent existence of Seoul and the Republic of Korea would be impossible,' Kim said, using South Korea’s official name. Kim’s statement was a response to South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol’s speech at his country’s Armed Forces Day on Tuesday. Unveiling South Korea’s most powerful Hyunmoo-5 ballistic missile and other conventional weapons that could target North Korea, Yoon said the day that North Korea tries to use nuclear weapons would be the end of the Kim government because Kim would face 'the resolute and overwhelming response' of the South Korean-U.S. alliance. Kim responded that Yoon’s address fully betrayed his 'bellicose temerity' and showed 'the security uneasiness and irritating psychology of the puppet forces.' In a derisive comment, Kim called Yoon 'an abnormal man,' saying that 'the puppet Yoon bragged about an overwhelming counteraction of military muscle at the doorstep of a state that possesses nuclear weapons.' On Thursday, Kim’s sister and senior official, Kim Yo Jong, also ridiculed South Korea's showcasing of the Hyunmoo-5 missile, saying there there’s no way for South Korea to counter the North Korea’s nuclear forces with conventional weapons. Since adopting an escalatory nuclear doctrine in 2022, Kim has repeatedly threatened to use nuclear weapons preemptively. But many foreign experts say it's still unlikely that he would use his nuclear arms first because his military is outmatched by the U.S. and its allied forces. In July, South Korea and the U.S. signed a defense guideline on integrating South Korea's conventional capabilities with the U.S. nuclear forces to better deal with North Korea's advancing nuclear program. South Korea has no nuclear weapons. Animosities between the Koreas are at the worst point in years with Kim's provocative run of missile tests and the South Korean-U.S. military exercises intensifying in a cycle of tit-for-tat. All communication channels and exchange programs between the rivals remain stalled since 2019, when a broader U.S.-North Korea diplomacy on ending the North's nuclear program collapsed. In January, Kim called for rewriting North Korea’s constitution to eliminate the idea of a peaceful unification between the war-divided countries and to cement the South as an 'invariable principal enemy.' He also reiterated that his country does not recognize the Northern Limit Line, a western sea boundary that was drawn by the U.S.-led U.N. Command at the end of the 1950-53 Korean War. He called for the new constitution to include a clear definition of the North’s territories. North Korea has traditionally insisted upon a boundary that encroaches deeply into waters currently controlled by South Korea. On Friday, South Korea’s military said North Korea was again flying balloons likely carrying trash across the border into South Korea. Since late May, North Korea has launched thousands of rubbish-carrying balloons toward South Korea, prompting South Korea to resume anti-Pyongyang propaganda loudspeaker broadcasts at border areas. ___ Follow AP's Asia-Pacific coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/asia-pacific	https://apnews.com/article/north-korea-kim-nuclear-weapons-south-b10f3ee96e9a1171ad8043f2d8d0f8bb	2024-10-03T14:54:23-07:00	
Did this happen to me also? Korean adoptees question their past and ask how to find their families	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — Dozens of South Korean adoptees, many in tears, have responded to an investigation led by The Associated Press and documented by Frontline (PBS) last week on Korean adoptions. The investigation reported dubious child-gathering practices and fraudulent paperwork involving South Korea’s foreign adoption program, which peaked in the 1970s and `80s amid huge Western demands for babies. Here are some of the problems adoptees who responded say they faced, along with tips for finding histories and birth families. KYLA POSTREL — Adoption paperwork tells multiple stories Kyla Postrel's paperwork tells two different stories, neither of which she’s sure is true. After a DNA test last year, Postrel found a half-brother who was also adopted to the West. Comparing their paperwork made her even more skeptical of the stories they’d been told. But part of her is reluctant to keep looking 'for something that may or may not exist and could be absolutely devastating.' She has been flooded with messages from other adoptees looking for help, and tells them not to be disappointed if they can't track down their stories. 'I just don’t want any adoptees feeling like their life is a lie,' she says. 'Their life is everything that they’ve built since then.' If her birth mother is still out there, Postrel would want her to know her daughter has had a good life. CODY DUET — Not enough information in the file Cody Duet, adopted to rural Louisiana in 1986, requested his full file a decade ago. He got back less than one page, saying his mother was a young factory worker, his father was unknown and there was nothing more they were required to give him. 'It was probably one of the most angry moments in my life,' Duet says. 'Who are you to tell me that I don’t get to know who I am?' He fell into a depression and couldn’t sleep. He struggled with abandonment, like he was easy to get rid of, easy not to love. But now, he wonders, was that story even true? The AP investigation found that children were systemically listed as abandoned, even though researchers have found that the vast majority had known relatives. Now Duet wants to resume his search. He wants to find his mother, to tell her he’s reached a point in his life that he’s proud of. AMY McFADDEN — Some adoptees don't know what to believe Amy McFadden always believed what the adoption agency told her parents — that she was abandoned on a staircase at 5 weeks old. Adopted to the United States in 1975, she’d heard stories about fraudulent adoptions, but always thought of them as one-off problems that had nothing to do with her. She’s grateful for her American life and close to her adoptive parents, and never felt the longing so many other adoptees do to reconnect with their roots. But when she found out from the AP stories that mothers in South Korea have searched for their missing children for decades, she says, she was in shock for three days. Waves of nausea radiated over her. She wants to submit her DNA, in case a family has been looking for her. CALLIE CHAMBERLAIN — Not everyone has a happy ending For Callie Chamberlain, waiting for word on whether her birth parents wanted to connect felt like standing on the edge of a cliff. Her original documents said her mother was young, unmarried and uneducated, she says. Her full files from the South Korean agency contained a different story: Her mother was married and she was born of an affair. DNA testing showed both stories were untrue, and identified her mother and father as married both back then and now. When they connected, her mother said she’d nearly died giving birth. The family was poor. Disoriented from labor and medications, her mother said she only vaguely remembered hospital staff insisting she was very sick and the child deserved a better home. The baby disappeared the next day. She lived with that shame for years, and the entire family searched for Chamberlain. They have now invited her — and her adoptive family — with open arms. But Chamberlain has met many without such happy endings, and feels a sort of survivor's guilt. She also questions the belief that reunions will answer all questions and make you whole. 'There is so much grief and there’s so much sorrow,' she says. 'There’s this sense of death. And then there’s also so much that gets to be born. It’s an ancestral sorrow that I can feel sometimes, like this wasn’t supposed to happen.' She has learned of a Korean cultural concept called 'han,' an existential and endless grief, born from colonization, war, poverty and the line that cleaves Korea into North and South, splitting families for generations. 'That’s something we experience too,' she said. 'We are Koreans.' ___ Here are some steps Korean adoptees could take to learn more about their past: Do birth family searches Adoptees can request information from their adoption agencies or the South Korean government's National Center for the Rights of the Child. Birth searches can take months and aren’t always successful. Less than a fifth of 15,000 adoptees who have asked the government for help with family searches since 2012 have managed to reunite with relatives, according to data obtained by AP. Failures are often caused by inaccurate records or the practice of describing children as abandoned even when they had known parents. Many adoptees also criticize the consent process for reunions. Adoption agencies and the NCRC can only use traditional mail, and only up to three times, to contact birth parents for their consent to provide personal details to adoptees and meet them. Privacy laws prevent agency and NCRC workers from accessing birth parents’ phone numbers. Still, the Korean-language adoption documents kept by South Korean agencies often have more background information than translated files sent to Western adoptive parents. When they fail to locate birth parents, NCRC may recommend that adoptees register their DNA with South Korean police or diplomatic offices, or help them publish their stories in South Korean media. Take a DNA test Frustrated with search failures and unreliable records, many Korean adoptees in recent years have attempted to reconnect with their birth families through DNA. Adoptees can register their DNA with a South Korean embassy or consulate in the country where they live. They can also register their DNA with a local police station if they travel to South Korea. DNA testing isn’t common in South Korea, and the process usually depends on whether the birth family had also been trying to find the adoptee through DNA. Once collected at diplomatic or police offices, adoptees’ genetic information is cross-checked with South Korea’s national DNA database for missing persons. When there is a match, the NCRC takes steps to arrange a reunion. Some adoptees have also found birth relatives through commercial DNA tests popular in the West. The nonprofit group 325 Kamra helps South Korean adoptees and birth families reunite through DNA, by allowing adoptees to upload their commercial test results to a database or providing test kits. Join adoptee and volunteer groups There are various Facebook groups — some open, others closed for adoptees only — where adoptees talk about their lives and interactions with adoption agencies. One of the most active pages is run by Banet, a volunteer group named after the Korean word for newborn baby clothing. The group helps adoptees search for birth families, connects them with government and police, and provides translation during meetings with Korean relatives. Some websites are tailored to adoptees sharing the same agency, such as Paperslip, which helps adoptees placed through Korea Social Service with birth family searches and adoption document requests. The Seoul-based nonprofit Global Overseas Adoptees’ Link assists adoptees with birth family searches as well as language education, social events and obtaining visas for employment in South Korea. KoRoot, another Seoul-based civic group, also helps adoptees searching for their families and backgrounds and runs advocacy programs. —- This story is part of an ongoing investigation led by The Associated Press in collaboration with FRONTLINE (PBS).
