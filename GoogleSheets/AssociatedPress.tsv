8 people killed in a collision between a bus and a truck on Mexico's Gulf coast	MEXICO CITY (AP) — A collision between a bus and a truck on Mexico’s Gulf coast Friday left eight people dead and 27 others injured. Prosecutors in Veracruz state said the accident happened before dawn on a stretch of highway near the state capital, Xalapa. Most of the victims were apparently passengers aboard the ADO-line bus. The dead included three men, four women and a girl. The 27 injured were being treated at local hospitals, but there was no immediate information on their condition. The cause of the accident was unclear, but some roads in the mountainous area are known for their pronounced curves.	https://apnews.com/article/mexico-bus-truck-crash-8-killed-4d3d847421585eeaca78256c560e727c	2024-12-27T15:42:33-08:00	
Israeli airstrikes hit a Yemen airport as a jet with hundreds onboard was landing, UN official says	UNITED NATIONS (AP) — Israeli airstrikes hit Yemen’s main airport as a civilian Airbus 320 with hundreds of passengers on board was landing and a U.N. delegation was waiting to leave, the U.N.'s top humanitarian official in Yemen said Friday. Julien Harneis told U.N. reporters that the most frightening thing about the two airstrikes on Thursday wasn’t their effect on him and about 15 others in the VIP lounge at the international airport in Yemen's capital, Sanaa, including the head of the U.N. World Health Organization. Rather, it was the destruction of the airport control tower as a Yemenia Airways plane was taxiing in after touching down. 'Fortunately, that plane was able to land safely and the passengers were able to disembark, but it could have been far, far worse,' said Harneis, who was with WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus in the lounge. He said one airstrike landed approximately 300 meters (330 yards) south of the VIP lounge and another about 300 meters to the north around 4:45 p.m., while about five members of the U.N. team were outside the building. 'Not only obviously did we have zero indication of any potential airstrikes, but we cannot remember the last time there were airstrikes in Sanaa during daylight hours,' Harneis said in a video news conference from Sanaa. The U.N. said at least three people were killed and dozens injured in the strike. Among the injured was a crew member from the U.N. Humanitarian Air Service, which was about to fly the U.N. delegation of some 20 people out of Sanaa. He suffered a serious leg injury from shrapnel and lost a lot of blood, Harneis said. Immediately after the airstrikes, Harneis said, U.N. security officials moved the delegation out of the VIP building and into five armored cars where they waited for approximately 40 minutes to ascertain what happened and help the injured crew member. He was taken to a hospital in Sanaa and underwent four hours of surgery while the rest of the delegation spent the night in a U.N. compound, Harneis said. The U.N. plane with Tedros and the U.N. team, including the injured crew member, was able to depart for Jordan on Friday afternoon – without an operating control tower. The United Nations said the injured crew member was taken to a hospital in Jordan, and Tedros was heading back to Geneva, where WHO is based, Yemen’s Iran-backed Houthi rebels, who control Sanaa and much of the country’s north, have gone after Israel since it started attacking Gaza following the Oct. 7, 2023 attacks by Gaza's Hamas militants on southern Israel. The Houthis have attacked ships in the Red Sea, disrupting one of the world’s main maritime routes, and recently stepped up missile and drone attacks on Israel. Early Saturday, the Israeli Air Force reported intercepting yet another missile from Yemen, as sirens woke Israelis around Jerusalem and the Dead Sea. Israel has escalated its response. The Israeli army said it wasn’t aware that the WHO chief or U.N. delegation were at the Sanaa airport on Thursday. Israel said it bombed the airport because it is used by the Houthis and Iran. Harneis responded, stressing that the airport is civilian, not military, and is used for transporting U.N. and other humanitarian workers, and for one civilian flight — Yemenia to and from Amman, Jordan. The flight operates as a result of an international agreement, and thousands of Yemenis have used the flight to get advanced medical treatment abroad, he said. Yemen is the Arab world’s poorest nation and has been engulfed in a 10-year civil war between the Houthi rebels, who control Sanaa and much of the country's north, and the internationally recognized government forces in the south. Tedros was in the country to discuss its worsening humanitarian crisis and to seek the release of about 50 people detained by the Houthis since June from the U.N., nongovernmental organizations and civil society. Harneis said 18 million Yemenis — about half the country’s population — need humanitarian assistance this year, and the U.N. expects the number to increase to 19 million next year because of the worsening economy. In addition to airstrikes on the Sanaa airport, Israel has been attacking the country's key port of Hodeida, in western Yemen. Harneis said Yemen relies on imports through Hodeida for 80% of its food and more than 90% of its medical supplies to the north. A recent Israeli airstrike destroyed two tugboats and is estimated to have reduced the harbor's capacity by 50%, the U.N. official said, while damage from Thursday's airstrikes hasn't been assessed yet. As for the detainees, Harneis said he joined the WHO chief at meetings with the Houthi prime minister, foreign minister and a member of the group's Supreme Political Council. He said they received commitments on the detainees' possible release and a pathway to it, and on conditions under which they are being held.	https://apnews.com/article/un-yemen-airport-israel-airstrikes-who-humanitarian-17690daff9dbb47c6ef7ce77447c5fe0	2024-12-27T14:57:03-08:00	
Trump asks Supreme Court to delay TikTok ban so he can weigh in after he takes office	President-elect Donald Trump asked the Supreme Court on Friday to pause the potential TikTok ban from going into effect until his administration can pursue a 'political resolution' to the issue. The request came as TikTok and the Biden administration filed opposing briefs to the court, in which the company argued the court should strike down a law that could ban the platform by Jan. 19 while the government emphasized its position that the statute is needed to eliminate a national security risk. 'President Trump takes no position on the underlying merits of this dispute. Instead, he respectfully requests that the Court consider staying the Act’s deadline for divestment of January 19, 2025, while it considers the merits of this case,' said Trump’s amicus brief, which supported neither party in the case and was written by D. John Sauer, Trump’s choice for solicitor general. The argument submitted to the court is the latest example of Trump inserting himself in national issues before he takes office. The Republican president-elect has already begun negotiating with other countries over his plans to impose tariffs, and he intervened earlier this month in a plan to fund the federal government, calling for a bipartisan plan to be rejected and sending Republicans back to the negotiating table. He has been holding meetings with foreign leaders and business officials at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida while he assembles his administration, including a meeting last week with TikTok CEO Shou Chew. Trump has reversed his position on the popular app, having tried to ban it during his first term in office over national security concerns. He joined the TikTok during his 2024 presidential campaign and his team used it to connect with younger voters, especially male voters, by pushing content that was often macho and aimed at going viral. He said earlier this year that he still believed there were national security risks with TikTok, but that he opposed banning it. The filings Friday come ahead of oral arguments scheduled for Jan. 10 on whether the law, which requires TikTok to divest from its China-based parent company or face a ban, unlawfully restricts speech in violation of the First Amendment. The law was was signed by President Joe Biden in April after it passed Congress with broad bipartisan support. TikTok and ByteDance filed a legal challenge afterwards. Earlier this month, a panel of three federal judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit unanimously upheld the statute, leading TikTok to appeal the case to the Supreme Court. The brief from Trump said he opposes banning TikTok at this junction and 'seeks the ability to resolve the issues at hand through political means once he takes office.' In their brief to the Supreme Court on Friday, attorneys for TikTok and its parent company ByteDance argued the federal appeals court erred in its ruling and based its decision on 'alleged ‘risks’ that China could exercise control' over TikTok’s U.S. platform by pressuring its foreign affiliates. The Biden administration has argued in court that TikTok poses a national security risk due to its connections to China. Officials say Chinese authorities can compel ByteDance to hand over information on TikTok’s U.S. patrons or use the platform to spread or suppress information. But the government 'concedes that it has no evidence China has ever attempted to do so,' TikTok’s legal filing said, adding that the U.S. fears are predicated on future risks. In its filing Friday, the Biden administration said because TikTok 'is integrated with ByteDance and relies on its propriety engine developed and maintained in China,' its corporate structure carries with it risk.	https://apnews.com/article/tiktok-ban-supreme-court-trump-b96013a8447e9bdb5508ebe436aadf9a	2024-12-27T13:44:11-08:00	
US to send $1.25 billion in weapons to Ukraine, pushing to get aid out before Biden leaves office	WASHINGTON (AP) — The United States is expected to announce that it will send $1.25 billion in military assistance to Ukraine, U.S. officials said Friday, as the Biden administration pushes to get as much aid to Kyiv as possible before leaving office on Jan. 20. The large package of aid includes a significant amount of munitions, including for the National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile Systems and the HAWK air defense system. It also will provide Stinger missiles and 155 mm- and 105 mm artillery rounds, officials said. The officials, who said they expect the announcement to be made on Monday, spoke on condition of anonymity to provide details not yet made public. The new aid comes as Russia has launched a barrage of attacks against Ukraine’s power facilities in recent days, although Ukraine has said it intercepted a significant number of the missiles and drones. Russian and Ukrainian forces are also still in a bitter battle around the Russian border region of Kursk, where Moscow has sent thousands of North Korean troops to help reclaim territory taken by Ukraine. Earlier this month, senior defense officials acknowledged that that the Defense Department may not be able to send all of the remaining $5.6 billion in Pentagon weapons and equipment stocks passed by Congress for Ukraine before President-elect Donald Trump is sworn in. Trump has talked about getting some type of negotiated settlement between Ukraine and Russia, and spoken about his relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Many U.S. and European leaders are concerned that it might result in a poor deal for Ukraine and they worry that he won't provide Ukraine with all the weapons funding approved by Congress. The aid in the new package is in presidential drawdown authority, which allows the Pentagon to take weapons off the shelves and send them quickly to Ukraine. This latest assistance would reduce the remaining amount to about $4.35 billion. Officials have said they hope that an influx of aid will help strengthen Ukraine’s hand, should Zelenskyy decide it’s time to negotiate. One senior defense official said that while the U.S. will continue to provide weapons to Ukraine until Jan. 20, there may well be funds remaining that will be available for the incoming Trump administration to spend. According to the Pentagon, there is also about $1.2 billion remaining in longer-term funding through the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, which is used to pay for weapons contracts that would not be delivered for a year or more. Officials have said the administration anticipates releasing all of that money before the end of the calendar year. If the new package is included, the U.S. has provided more than $64 billion in security assistance to Ukraine since Russia invaded in February 2022.	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-military-aid-kyiv-biden-9b926a275c235c59d591a649e2450746	2024-12-27T10:42:45-08:00	
US sanctions the founder of Georgia's ruling political party	WASHINGTON (AP) — The Biden administration has imposed sanctions on the founder of Georgia’s ruling political party, which has steered the country away from a pro-Western stance and towards Russia, U.S. officials said Friday. The State and Treasury departments said they hit Georgian Dream party founder and honorary chairman Bidzina Ivanishvili with penalties 'for undermining the democratic and Euro-Atlantic future of Georgia for the benefit of the Russian Federation,' according to a statement. The designation of Ivanishvili is the latest in a series of sanctions the U.S. has slapped on Georgian politicians, lawmakers and others this year. Those sanctions include freezes on assets and properties those targeted may have in U.S. jurisdictions or that might enter U.S. jurisdictions as well as travel bans on the targets and members of their families. 'We strongly condemn Georgian Dream’s actions under Ivanishvili’s leadership, including its ongoing and violent repression of Georgian citizens, protestors, members of the media, human rights activists, and opposition figures,' the State Department said in a statement. 'The United States is committed to promoting accountability for those undermining democracy and human rights in Georgia.' Ivanishvili is a shadowy billionaire who made his fortune in Russia and served briefly as Georgia’s prime minister. In 2012, he founded Georgian Dream, Georgia’s longtime ruling party. Critics have accused Georgian Dream of becoming increasingly authoritarian and tilted toward Moscow. The party recently pushed through laws similar to those used by the Kremlin to crack down on freedom of speech and LGBTQ+ rights, prompting the European Union to suspend Georgia’s membership application process indefinitely. In October, Georgian Dream won another term in a divisive parliamentary election that has led to more mass protests. Last month, the country’s prime minister, Irakli Kobakhidze, announced a four-year suspension of talks on Georgia's bid to join the European Union, fueling further public outrage.	https://apnews.com/article/georgia-dream-sanction-bidzina-ivanishvili-russia-d22fe108cdef72b221769a113d980c45	2024-12-27T10:12:33-08:00	
A 9th telecoms firm has been hit by a massive Chinese espionage campaign, the White House says	WASHINGTON (AP) — A ninth U.S. telecoms firm has been confirmed to have been hacked as part of a sprawling Chinese espionage campaign that gave officials in Beijing access to private texts and phone conversations of an unknown number of Americans, a top White House official said Friday. Biden administration officials said this month that at least eight telecommunications companies, as well as dozens of nations, had been affected by the Chinese hacking blitz known as Salt Typhoon. But Anne Neuberger, the deputy national security adviser for cyber and emerging technologies, told reporters Friday that a ninth victim had been identified after the administration released guidance to companies about how to hunt for Chinese culprits in their networks. The update from Neuberger is the latest development in a massive hacking operation that has alarmed national security officials, exposed cybersecurity vulnerabilities in the private sector and laid bare China's hacking sophistication. The hackers compromised the networks of telecommunications companies to obtain customer call records and gain access to the private communications of 'a limited number of individuals.' Though the FBI has not publicly identified any of the victims, officials believe senior U.S. government officials and prominent political figures are among those whose whose communications were accessed. Neuberger said officials did not yet have a precise sense how many Americans overall were affected by Salt Typhoon, in part because the Chinese were careful about their techniques, but a 'large number' were in the Washington-Virginia area. Officials believe the goal of the hackers was to identify who owned the phones and, if they were 'government targets of interest,' spy on their texts and phone calls, she said. The FBI said most of the people targeted by the hackers are 'primarily involved in government or political activity.' Neuberger said the episode highlighted the need for required cybersecurity practices in the telecommunications industry, something the Federal Communications Commission is to take up at a meeting next month. 'We know that voluntary cyber security practices are inadequate to protect against China, Russia and Iran hacking of our critical infrastructure,' she said. The Chinese government has denied responsibility for the hacking.	https://apnews.com/article/united-states-china-hacking-espionage-c5351ef7c2207785b76c8c62cde6c513	2024-12-27T09:00:29-08:00	
US teacher jailed in Russia is formally designated as wrongfully detained	WASHINGTON (AP) — An American schoolteacher arrested in Russia on drug charges more than four years ago has been designated by the U.S. government as wrongfully detained, the State Department said Friday. Marc Fogel, a history teacher from Pennsylvania, is serving a 14-year prison sentence after being arrested in August 2021 at a Russian airport and possessing what his family and supporters said was medically prescribed marijuana. After Fogel was omitted from a massive prisoner swap last August that resulted in the release of Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich and corporate security executive Paul Whelan, among others, his family's lawyers made another push for the Biden administration to secure his freedom, including by designating him as wrongfully detained. The State Department considers a range of factors in deciding whether to designate an American jailed in a foreign country as wrongfully detained, including if there's credible information that the person is innocent. The factors also include if they are being held for the primary purpose of influencing U.S. policy or securing concessions from the U.S. government. Officials confirmed Friday that Fogel had now received that designation. 'The United States has been working to secure Marc Fogel’s release for some time. We have long called for his humanitarian release and tried to include him in the August 1 deal, but were unable to. The Secretary determined Marc is wrongfully detained in October,' the department said in a statement. The designation traditionally shifts supervision of a detainee's case to the office of the Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs, a State Department office focused on negotiating for the release of hostages and other Americans classified as being wrongfully detained in other countries.	https://apnews.com/article/marc-fogel-russia-state-department-prisoner-swap-pennsylvania-putin-af3906fd2692d13ca168f507ef448fda	2024-12-27T08:16:44-08:00

Montenegro approves the extradition of cryptocurrency mogul Do Kwon to the United States	PODGORICA, Montenegro (AP) — Montenegro has approved the extradition of a South Korean mogul known as 'the cryptocurrency king' to the United States, the Balkan country's Justice Ministry said on Friday. Minister Bojan Bozovic has issued a deposition allowing the handover of Do Kwon, the founder of the Singapore crypto firm Terraform Labs who was arrested in Montenegro last year, according to the ministry. It was not immediately clear when exactly Kwon would be sent to the U.S. The move follows a months-long legal saga in the case of Do Kwon. Both South Korea and the U.S. had requested Do Kwon’s extradition and various courts in Montenegro over the past months have brought and overturned multiple rulings to extradite Kwon either to the U.S. or South Korea. The Justice Ministry statement cited the latest ruling of Montenegro's Supreme Court which said that conditions have been met for Kwon to be extradited to one of the two countries, and that the final decision lies with the justice minister. The ministry said on Friday that more legal criteria were in favor of extradition the U.S. Kwon’s lawyers in Montenegro said they learned about the decision from the media and that their client cannot be extradited until they receive the ruling. 'Behind such illegal behavior of the minister is the fact that the courts, on two occasions ... made a decision to extradite Do Kwon to South Korea,' lawyers Goran Rodić i Marija Radulović said in a statement. Kwon was charged in the U.S. with fraud by federal prosecutors in New York over a $40 billion crash of Terraform Labs’ cryptocurrency, which devastated retail investors around the world. He and another South Korean were arrested in Montenegro while trying to depart for Dubai, United Arab Emirates, using fake Costa Rican passports. Kwon has served a prison term in Montenegro for using a fake passport. Kwon and five others connected to Terraform had been wanted on allegations of fraud and financial crimes in relation to the implosion of its digital currencies in May 2022. TerraUSD was designed as a 'stablecoin,' a currency which is pegged to stable assets like the dollar to prevent drastic fluctuations in prices. However, around $40 billion in market value was erased for the holders of TerraUSD and its floating sister currency, Luna, after the stablecoin plunged far below its $1 peg.	https://apnews.com/article/montenegro-cryptocurrency-do-kwon-extradition-60abd631009d8474f8ee9e3afed9146f	2024-12-27T07:28:14-08:00	
NATO will step up Baltic Sea patrols as Finland probes the possible sabotage of undersea cables	BRUSSELS (AP) — NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte said Friday that the military alliance will step up patrols in the Baltic Sea region as Finnish investigators work to establish whether a ship linked to Russia sabotaged undersea cables there this week. Finnish authorities seized control of the ship, the Eagle S, on Thursday as they tried to establish whether it had damaged a power cable linking Finland and Estonia and several data cables. It was the latest in a string of incidents involving the disruption of key infrastructure in the region. In a post on X, Rutte said that he had spoken to Finland’s President Alexander Stubb 'about the ongoing Finnish-led investigation into possible sabotage of undersea cables.' Rutte said that 'NATO will enhance its military presence in the Baltic Sea.' Asked for details about what might be done and when, NATO headquarters would say only that the 32-country alliance 'remains vigilant and is working to provide further support, including by enhancing our military presence' in the region. Finland, which shares a 1,340-kilometer (832-mile) border with Russia, joined NATO in 2023, abandoning a decades-old policy of neutrality. In October 2023, in response to similar incidents, NATO and its allies deployed more maritime patrol aircraft, long-distance radar planes and drones on surveillance and reconnaissance flights, while a fleet of minehunters was also dispatched to the region. The Eagle S is flagged in the Cook Islands but has been described by Finnish customs officials and European Union officials as being part of Russia’s shadow fleet of tankers shipping oil and gas in defiance of international sanctions imposed over its war on Ukraine. The aging vessels, often with obscure ownership, routinely operate without Western-regulated insurance. Russia’s use of the vessels has raised environmental concerns about accidents given their age and uncertain insurance coverage. The Eagle S’s anchor is suspected of causing damage to the cable, Finland’s Yle state broadcaster has reported, relying on police statements. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov was asked about the seizure on Friday but declined to comment. After a high-level meeting about the incident, Stubb posted on X that 'the situation is under control. We have no reason to be worried,' while adding that the investigation continues. He said that Finland and Estonia had requested extra NATO help. He said new measures could include 'inspections of the insurance certificates of vessels' in the region. Stubb added that 'we are also looking at ways, based on international maritime law, to respond more effectively to similar incidents in the future.' The Estlink-2 power cable, which takes electricity from Finland to Estonia across the Baltic Sea, went down on Wednesday but had little impact on services. The incident follows damage to two data cables and the Nord Stream gas pipelines, both of which have been termed sabotage. Those data cables — one running between Finland and Germany and the other between Lithuania and Sweden — were severed in November. Germany’s defense minister said 'sabotage' was the likely cause but he didn’t provide evidence or say who might have been responsible. The Nord Stream pipelines that once brought natural gas from Russia to Germany were damaged by underwater explosions in September 2022. Authorities have said the cause was sabotage and launched criminal investigations. NATO had already boosted patrols near undersea infrastructure after the Nord Stream pipeline was hit. Last year, it also set up a coordination cell to deepen ties between governments, armed forces, and the defense industry and better protect undersea installations.	https://apnews.com/article/finland-estonia-cable-undersea-russia-sabotage-nato-6460b68ab5236d9892551867b024b0a0	2024-12-27T07:23:07-08:00	
Customs agents seize 22,000 fake Pennsylvania vehicle inspection stickers shipped from Israel	HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — The U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency said it has seized more than 20,000 counterfeit Pennsylvania vehicle inspection stickers that were shipped from Israel to an address in Philadelphia. Customs officers found the stickers in two different shipments that arrived on two different days, Nov. 26 and Dec. 9, and confirmed with Pennsylvania authorities that the stickers were counterfeit, the agency said. The agency did not say in a Thursday statement who sent the stickers, who was to receive them or what purpose the stickers were going to serve. The agency said it made no arrests. Had they been real, the 22,000 stickers would have a value of $1.4 million, the agency said. Selling fake vehicle inspection stickers is illegal and a persistent problem for law enforcement, although at a much smaller scale. Pennsylvania requires that motor vehicles be inspected annually to ensure they meet minimum mechanical, safety and emissions standards. Punishment for using a counterfeit inspection sticker can mean a penalty of up to $500 and jail time, the agency said.	https://apnews.com/article/customs-border-protection-counterfeit-pennsylvania-inspection-stickers-0312bdc96137305d85d5c80708ff6d7c	2024-12-27T07:21:45-08:00	
Student marches, traffic blockades in Serbia as protests persist over concrete canopy fall	BELGRADE, Serbia (AP) — Serbian university students left piles of old school books outside the education ministry building on Friday as part of almost daily street protests demanding accountability over the collapse nearly two months ago of a concrete canopy that killed 15 people in the country's north. Scattered traffic blockades were also held on various locations throughout Serbia at 11:52 a.m. — the exact time that the concrete construction on the front of the railway station building in Novi Sad crashed onto the people below. The traffic blockades have been held every Friday since the Nov. 1 crash, lasting 15 minutes for the 15 victims. Many in Serbia blame the collapse on widespread corruption and sloppy work on the railway station building in the city of Novi Sad that was twice renovated in recent years as part of questionable mega projects involving Chinese state companies. Persistent protests in Serbia reflect widespread anger at the accident but also wider discontent with the rule of populist President Aleksandar Vucic and his government. Tens of thousands joined a big rally last Sunday in Belgrade led by the university students. Prosecutors have arrested 13 people over the Novi Sad tragedy, including a government minister whose release later fueled public skepticism about the honesty of the investigation. Striking university students have garnered support from various walks of life, challenging the tight grip on power of Vucic's government. The movement's symbol — a red handprint telling authorities they have blood on their hands — has been used by actors, farmers and others backing the protests. In Belgrade, more than 2,000 students marched to the education ministry. A speaker told the crowd that 'we are sick of being called political mercenaries and attacked in the streets.' In Novi Sad, a student rally criticized the way the state-run RT Vojvodina reports about the protests and the canopy collapse. Populist officials and the pro-government mainstream media have described the protests as a ‘hybrid war’ against Vucic under the orders of foreign intelligence services. Though Serbia is formally seeking European Union membership, Vucic has faced accusations of curbing democratic freedoms rather than advancing them. University students in neighboring Bosnia’s capital, Sarajevo, and the northwestern town of Banja Luka on Friday gathered in support of their Serbian colleagues and to draw attention to problems in their own country.	https://apnews.com/article/serbia-protest-students-roof-collapse-b4661370906d314c909daad8d5feb2ae	2024-12-27T05:13:52-08:00	
Israeli troops burn northern Gaza hospital after forcibly removing staff and patients, officials say	DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Israeli troops stormed one of the last hospitals operating in northern Gaza on Friday, igniting fires and forcing many staff and patients outside to strip in winter weather, the territory’s health ministry said. Kamal Adwan Hospital has been hit multiple times over the past three months by Israeli troops waging an offensive against Hamas fighters in surrounding neighborhoods, according to staff. The ministry said a strike on the hospital a day earlier killed five medical staff. Israel's military said it was conducting operations against Hamas infrastructure and militants in the area of the hospital, without details. It repeated claims that Hamas fighters operate inside Kamal Adwan but provided no evidence. Hospital officials have denied that. The Health Ministry said troops forced medical personnel and patients to assemble in the yard and remove their clothes. Some were led to an unknown location, while some patients were sent to the nearby Indonesian Hospital, which was knocked out of operation after an Israel raid this week. Israeli troops during raids frequently carry out mass detentions, stripping men to their underwear for questioning in what the military says is a security measure as they search for Hamas fighters. The Associated Press doesn’t have access to Kamal Adwan, but armed plainclothes members of the Hamas-led police forces — tasked with keeping security and officially separate from the group’s armed wing — have been seen in other hospitals. The Health Ministry said Israeli troops also set fires in several parts of Kamal Adwan, including the lab and surgery department. It said 25 patients and 60 health workers remained in the hospital out of 75 patients and 180 staff who had been there. The account could not be independently confirmed, and attempts to reach hospital staff were unsuccessful. 'Fire is ablaze everywhere in the hospital,' an unidentified member of the staff said in an audio message posted on the social media accounts of hospital director Hossam Abu Safiya. The staffer said some evacuated patients had been unhooked from oxygen. 'There are currently patients who could die at any moment,' she said. A largely isolated north Since October, Israel’s offensive has virtually sealed off the northern Gaza areas of Jabaliya, Beit Hanoun and Beit Lahiya and leveled large parts of them. Tens of thousands of Palestinians were forced out but thousands are believed to remain in the area, where Kamal Adwan and two other hospitals are located. Troops raided Kamal Adwan in October, and on Tuesday troops stormed and evacuated the Indonesian Hospital. The area has been cut off from food and other aid for months , raising fears of famine. The U.N. says Israeli troops allowed just four humanitarian deliveries to the area from Dec. 1 to Dec. 23. The Israeli rights group Physicians for Human Rights-Israel this week petitioned Israel’s High Court of Justice seeking a halt to military attacks on Kamal Adwan. It warned that forcibly evacuating the hospital would 'abandon thousands of residents in northern Gaza.' Before the latest deaths Thursday, the group documented five other staffers killed by Israeli fire since October. Israel launched its campaign in Gaza vowing to destroy Hamas after the group’s Oct. 7, 2023, attack on southern Israel in which militants killed around 1,200 people and abducted some 250 others. Around 100 Israelis remain captive in Gaza, around a third believed to be dead. Israel’s nearly 15-month-old campaign of bombardment and offensives has devastated the territory’s health sector. A year ago, it carried out raids on hospitals in northern Gaza, including Kamal Adwan, Indonesian and al-Awda Hospital, saying they served as bases for Hamas, though it presented little evidence. Israel’s campaign has killed more than 45,400 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, and wounded more than 108,000 others, according to the Health Ministry. Its count does not distinguish between civilians and combatants. Deaths from the cold in Gaza More than 90% of Gaza’s 2.3 million Palestinians have been driven from their homes, most of them now sheltering in sprawling, squalid tent camps in south and central Gaza. Children and adults, many barefoot, huddled Friday on the cold sand in tents whose plastic and cloth sheets whipped in the wind. Overnight temperatures can dip into the 40s Fahrenheit (below 10 Celsius), and sea spray from the Mediterranean can dampen tents just steps away. 'I swear to God, their mother and I cover ourselves with one blanket and we cover (their five children) with three blankets that we got from neighbors.

Chinese man sentenced to death for killing 35 people by driving into a crowd	BEIJING (AP) — A Chinese court has sentenced a man to death for killing 35 people last month by driving into crowd, in an attack that raised national concern about mass killings. The court in the southern city of Zhuhai handed down the sentence on Friday to Fan Weiqiu, saying the nature of the crime was extremely vile, the means were particularly cruel and the consequences were particularly severe. The court found that Fan was venting anger because he was unhappy with his divorce settlement. In the days after the attack, Chinese leader Xi Jinping ordered local governments to take steps to prevent future 'extreme cases.'	https://apnews.com/article/china-crowd-mass-killing-death-sentence-532cf8651cc13a036771b83da03f0e44	2024-12-27T04:09:28-08:00

Two climbers found dead on Italy's Gran Sasso massif five days after falling into ravine	ROME (AP) — The bodies of two Italian climbers have been found on Italy's Gran Sasso massif five days after they disappeared during an excursion, rescuers said. Rescue teams supported by a helicopter managed to reach the location on Friday where the two men went missing in the central Abruzzo region. The area is a stretch of rocks and snow and the rescue operation was hampered by adverse weather conditions, with strong winds and a high risk of avalanches. The mountaineers were climbing the Gran Sasso on Sunday when they slipped into a ravine and lost visual contact with each other, Italian media reported. Despite the difficult circumstances, one of them was able to make an emergency call. According to media reports, they were about 20 meters (66 feet) apart and could hear each other. Rescuers battled a violent storm and had to spend two nights in a shelter at an altitude of 2,100 meters due to the strong winds and snowfall.	https://apnews.com/article/italy-climbers-gran-sasso-bodies-ravine-1052c3f5eab831269b4bac1a4453146c	2024-12-27T03:37:12-08:00	
Nearly 70 migrants died when their boat sank en route to Spain, a Malian minister says	BAMAKO, Mali (AP) — Nearly 70 migrants died when their boat sank as they tried to reach Spain earlier this month, Mali’s Minister for Malians Living Abroad said. In a press release on Thursday, Mossa Ag Attaher announced that a migrant boat bound for Spain sank on Dec. 19. The migrants in this boat 'numbered 80 at the start, with only 11 survivors,' according to the Ministry. The Malian authorities have identified nine Malians among the survivors, and '25 young Malians have unfortunately been formally identified among the victims,' the minister added. The Atlantic route for migrants from West Africa to the Canary Islands is one of the deadliest in the world. Located nearer to Africa than mainland Spain, the archipelago is seen by most as a step toward continental Europe. Many of those making the journey come from Mali, Senegal, Mauritania, and other West African countries, seeking better job opportunities abroad or fleeing violence and political instability. Several of the Malian victims are from the Kayes region in the west of the country, according to Doulaye Keita, adviser to the ministry, in a statement to the AP on Friday. 'Among the 25 Malians dead, there are 8 Malians from my commune,' Mamadou Siby, the mayor of the commune of Marena in the Kayes region, told The Associated Press. 'These dead young men left my commune seven months ago to work in the construction industry in Mauritania. Unfortunately, they were in contact with their friends in Europe and America, who encouraged them to come to these countries, and in most cases, they took the perilous journey without even informing their families back home.'	https://apnews.com/article/mali-migrants-spain-aee72e17c46d6993fd887643627928bd	2024-12-27T03:36:27-08:00	
China sanctions 7 companies over US military assistance to Taiwan	BEIJING (AP) — The Chinese government placed sanctions on seven companies on Friday in response to recent U.S. announcements of military sales and aid to Taiwan, the self-governing island that China claims as part of its territory. The sanctions also come in response to the recent approval of the U.S. government's annual defense spending bill, which a Chinese Foreign Ministry statement said 'includes multiple negative sections on China.' China objects to American military assistance for Taiwan and often imposes sanctions on related companies after a sale or aid package is announced. The sanctions generally have a limited impact, because American defense companies don't sell arms or other military goods to China. The U.S. is the main supplier of weapons to Taiwan for its defense. The seven companies being sanctioned are Insitu Inc., Hudson Technologies Co., Saronic Technologies, Inc., Raytheon Canada, Raytheon Australia, Aerkomm Inc. and Oceaneering International Inc., the Foreign Ministry statement said. It said that 'relevant senior executives' of the companies are also sanctioned, without naming any. Any assets they have in China will be frozen, and organizations and individuals in China are prohibited from engaging in any activity with them, it said. U.S. President Joe Biden last week authorized up to $571 million in Defense Department material and services and military education and training for Taiwan. Separately, the Defense Department announced that $295 million in military sales had been approved. The U.S. defense bill boosts military spending to $895 billion and directs resources toward a more confrontational approach to China. It establishes a fund that could be used to send military resources to Taiwan in much the same way that the U.S. has backed Ukraine. It also expands a ban on U.S. military purchases of Chinese products ranging from drone technology to garlic for military commissaries. Zhang Xiaogang, a Chinese Defense Ministry spokesperson, said earlier this week that the U.S. is hyping up the 'so-called' threat from China to justify increased military spending. 'U.S. military spending has topped the world and keeps increasing every year,' he said at a press conference. 'This fully exposes the belligerent nature of the U.S. and its obsession with hegemony and expansion.' The Foreign Ministry statement said the U.S. moves violate agreements between the two countries on Taiwan, interfere in China’s domestic affairs and undermine the nation's sovereignty and territorial integrity. Taiwan's government said earlier this month that China had sent dozens of ships into nearby seas to practice a blockade of the island, a move that Taiwan said undermined peace and stability and disrupted international shipping and trade. China has not confirmed or commented on the reported military activity.	https://apnews.com/article/china-sanctions-us-military-sales-taiwan-33e27d5389740e4a1f6c2f1ff7381931	2024-12-27T02:58:38-08:00	
Ukrainian drone attack was under way before Azerbaijani plane's crash, Russian aviation chief says	Russia's aviation chief said Friday that a Ukrainian drone attack was under way in the region of Chechnya at the time an Azerbaijani airliner attempted to land before diverting to Kazakhstan and crashing there earlier this week. Dmitry Yadrov, head of Russia’s civil aviation authority Rosaviatsia, didn’t comment on statements by an Azerbaijani lawmaker and many aviation experts who blamed Wednesday’s crash on Russian air defense fire. Azerbaijan Airlines’ Embraer 190 was flying from Azerbaijan’s capital of Baku to Grozny, the regional capital of the Russian republic of Chechnya, but it turned to Aktau in Kazakhstan across the Caspian Sea and crashed while making an attempt to land there. The crash killed 38 people and left all 29 survivors injured. Authorities in Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and Russia were tight-lipped about a possible cause of the crash pending an official probe, but a member of Azerbaijan's parliament, Rasim Musabekov told the Azerbaijani news agency Turan on Thursday that the plane was fired on while in the skies over Grozny and urged Russia to offer an official apology. Asked about Musabekov's statement, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov declined to comment, saying that it will be up to investigators to determine the cause of the crash. 'The air incident is being investigated and we don't believe we have the right to make any assessments until the conclusions are made as a result of the investigation,' Peskov said in a conference call with reporters. Yadrov, the Russian aviation chief, said that as the plane was preparing to land in Grozny in deep fog, Ukrainian drones were targeting Grozny, prompting authorities to close the area for air traffic. Yadrov said that after the captain made two unsuccessful attempts to land in Grozny, he was offered other airports as an alternative but decided to fly to Aktau across the Caspian Sea. 'The situation in the area of Grozny airport was quite difficult,' he said in a statement. 'There are many circumstances that it's necessary to investigate jointly.' Investigators from Azerbaijan are working in Grozny as part of the crash probe, Azerbaijani Prosecutor General’s office said in a statement. As the official crash probe started, some aviation experts pointed out that holes seen in the plane’s tail section suggested that it could have come under fire from Russian air defense systems fending off a Ukrainian drone attack. Ukrainian drones had previously attacked Grozny, the capital of the Russian republic of Chechnya, and other regions in the country’s North Caucasus. FlightRadar24 said in an online post that the aircraft had faced 'strong GPS jamming' that interfered with flight tracking data. Russia has extensively used sophisticated jamming equipment to fend off drone attacks. Following Wednesday's suspension of flights from Baku to Grozy and Makhachkala, Azerbaiajan Airlines announced Friday that it would also halt service to more Russian cities, cutting air links to Mineralnye Vody, Sochi, Volgograd, Ufa, Samara. It said in a statement that the flights will be suspended 'following the preliminary results of the investigation into the crash of the Embraer 190 aircraft operating flight J2-8243 from Baku to Grozny, caused by physical and technical interference, and considering potential risks to flight safety.' The company will continue to operate flights to six other Russian cities including Moscow, St. Petersburg and Kazan. Those cities also have been repeatedly targeted by Ukrainian drone strikes in the past. Kazakhstan's Qazaq Air also announced Friday that it was suspending flights from Astana to the Russian city of Yekaterinburg in the Ural Mountains for a month. The day before, Israeli El Al suspended flights from Tel Aviv to Moscow citing 'developments in Russia’s airspace.' The airline said it would reassess the situation next week to decide whether to resume the flights. __ Associated Press writer Aida Sultanova contributed to this report from London.	https://apnews.com/article/azerbaijan-airliner-crash-aktau-kazakhstan-russia-embraer-f23c1bb34a3c6911be5d00ae8fdccbdc	2024-12-27T02:43:21-08:00	
Suzuki Motor former boss Osamu Suzuki, who turned the minicar maker into a global player, dies at 94	TOKYO (AP) — Osamu Suzuki, the charismatic former boss of Suzuki Motor Corp. who helped turn the Japanese mini-vehicle maker into a globally competitive company, has died, the company said Friday. He was 94. Suzuki was known for his candid remarks and friendliness, calling himself an 'old guy from a small to mid-size company.' He became CEO of Suzuki in 1978 and was leading the company when it became the first Japanese automaker to start local production in India, where its cars proved hugely popular. Born on Jan. 30, 1930 as Osamu Matsuda, Suzuki worked in banking after graduating from Tokyo's Chuo University School of Law. He joined Suzuki Motor, which is based in the central Japanese city of Hamamatsu, in 1958 when he married a daughter of the company's then-president Shunzo Suzuki, who belonged to the company’s founding family. As is sometimes the custom in such situations, Matsuda adopted his wife’s maiden name. In 1979, a year after he became Suzuki Motor's fourth company president, he launched an affordable minicar, which became a big hit and was promoted to world markets. Under Suzuki's leadership, the company's sales grew more than tenfold to 3 trillion yen ($19 billion) in the 2000s. . Suzuki also led business tie-ups with other global leaders such as General Motors and Volkswagen AG in the 2000s. Amid intensifying competition and industrial transformation, Suzuki also formed a capital alliance with Toyota Motor Corp. in 2019 to co-develop self-driving vehicles. While other Japanese automakers have expanded in the U.S. and Chinese markets, offering a wide range of vehicles, Suzuki has stuck with mini and compact cars, mostly in South and Southeast Asia. Suzuki stressed the importance of understanding the grassroots level. 'Making good quality and low-price products is the basis of manufacturing,' Suzuki once told an interview with the broadcaster NHK television. 'We cannot lower costs while sitting in the offices of president or chairperson, so I have to be in a factory to understand the work and get ideas.' Suzuki stepped down as president at age 85 in 2015, handing the post to his son, Toshihiro Suzuki. He served as an advisor to the company after resigning as chairman in 2021. The company said Suzuki died Wednesday of malignant lymphoma.	https://apnews.com/article/japan-suzuki-motor-india-495bf88bbc55c2e96faa447a5b5806f0	2024-12-27T02:13:35-08:00	
Middle East latest: Houthi rebels fire missile at Israel hours after airstrikes on Yemen airport	Houthi rebels in Yemen fired a missile at Israel early Friday, hours after a wave of Israeli airstrikes hit Yemen's main airport as the World Health Organization’s director-general was about to board a flight there. Three people were killed and dozens were wounded in the Israeli airstrikes, including a member of the U.N. plane’s crew, the U.N. said. The crew member underwent surgery and was in stable condition, it said Friday. The Israeli military said the Houthi missile was intercepted by its air defenses on Friday before it entered Israeli territory. For several days this past week, Houthi launches have set off air raid sirens in Israel. The Houthis have also been targeting shipping in the Red Sea corridor in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza. Israel's war in Gaza has killed over 45,000 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and civilians in its count. Hamas ignited the war with its Oct. 7, 2023, attack in southern Israel in which about 1,200 people were killed and 250 taken hostage by Palestinian militants. Around 100 hostages are still being held in Gaza, although only two-thirds are believed to still be alive. Here’s the latest: Israel carries out more airstrikes deep inside Lebanon, state media say BEIRUT — Israeli warplanes carried three airstrikes deep into eastern Lebanon on Friday for the second time since a ceasefire ended the war between Hezbollah and Israel a month ago, Lebanon’s state-run news agency said. No casualties were reported in the strikes on the Bekaa Valley town of Qousaya and the target remained unclear. The Israeli military said its air force struck 'infrastructure used to smuggle weapons via Syria' to Hezbollah near the Janta crossing on the Syrian-Lebanese border, about 9 kilometers (5 miles) north of Qousaya. Israel accused Hezbollah’s Unit 4400 of overseeing smuggling operations from Iran through Syria, adding that it had killed the unit’s commander in early October. Since the ceasefire took effect on Nov. 27, the Israeli army has conducted near-daily operations in southern Lebanon, including shootings, house demolitions, excavations, tank shelling and airstrikes. These actions have killed at least 27 people, wounded more than 30 and destroyed residential buildings, including a mosque. The United Nations peacekeeping mission, UNIFIL, said it has observed 'concerning actions' by Israeli forces, including the destruction of homes and road closures. On Thursday, the Lebanese army accused Israeli troops of breaching the ceasefire by encroaching into southern Lebanon. Israeli bulldozers erected dirt barricades to block roads in Wadi Al-Hujayr. The Lebanese army later on Thursday said that following intervention by the ceasefire supervision committee, Israeli forces withdrew, and Lebanese soldiers removed the barriers to reopen the road in the area. The U.S.-brokered ceasefire, which ended the 14-month war, demands that Hezbollah and Israeli forces withdraw from southern Lebanon within 60 days, allowing Lebanese troops to gradually deploy south of the Litani River. Houthi rebels fire a missile at Israel following airstrikes on Yemen’s main airport JERUSALEM — Yemen’s Houthi rebels fired a missile toward Israel early Friday, hours after Israel carried out a wave of airstrikes on Yemen’s main airport. The Israeli military said the Houthi missile was intercepted by air defenses before it entered Israeli territory. Air raid sirens were set off in several areas in central Israel. A day earlier, a wave of Israeli airstrikes hit Yemen’s main airport outside the capital, Sanaa, killing three people and wounding dozens of others, according to the U.N. The strikes hit just as the World Health Organization’s director-general was about to board a flight at the airport. Israel said it attacked infrastructure used bv the Houthis. For several days this past week, Houthi launches have set off air raid sirens in Israel. The Houthis have also been targeting shipping in the Red Sea corridor, saying their attacks are in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza. Last week, Israeli jets bombed Sanaa and Hodeida, killing nine people. The U.S. military also has targeted the Houthis in Yemen in recent days. 83-year-old woman stabbed to death in Israel TEL AVIV — A Palestinian from the West Bank stabbed to death an 83-year-old woman in Israel on Friday, police said. The attack took place in the town of Herzliya on the Mediterranean coast outside Tel Aviv. Police said the attacker was arrested. A medic with Israel’s emergency services, Kobi Avriel, said first responders found the woman unconscious on the sidewalk outside a nursing home with stabbing wounds. The Tel Aviv Ichilov Medical Center said she was pronounced dead on arrival. Israel has experienced an increase in attacks amid a surge in violence in the West Bank since the start of the military’s nearly 15-month-old campaign of bombardment and offensives in Gaza triggered by the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attacks on southern Israel. Displaced Syrians face dire winter conditions in tent camps, UN says UNITED NATIONS – An estimated 730,000 people living in tents in camps for the displaced in northwest Syria are experiencing dire conditions this winter including from flooding, the U.N. humanitarian office said. The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, or OCHA, said Thursday that more than 200 family tents in camps in Idlib and northern Aleppo were damaged by flooding from heavy rainfall on Dec. 23. 'Since the start of 2024, flooding and strong winds have damaged more than 8,800 family tents – including nearly 2,000 that were fully destroyed – across 260 camps,' OCHA said. On another issue, OCHA quoted a report from the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a war monitor based in Britain, that since Dec. 8 -– when Syrian President Bashar Assad was ousted --- episodes involving explosive ordnance have killed more than 70 civilians including a dozen children and five women, with scores more injured. OCHA said mine experts have identified 109 new minefields across Idlib, Aleppo, Hama and Latakia since Nov. 26. So far, it said experts have destroyed more than 850 individual items of explosive ordnance. Elsewhere, OCHA said Israeli forces on Wednesday reportedly wounded six civilians when they opened fire in Al-Suweisah town in Quneitra province, which includes the Golan Heights. It said residents were ordered to evacuate and Israeli forces imposed a curfew.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-syria-lebanon-news-27-december-2024-0240c348e19255d1c1ceedc8b9ff3722	2024-12-27T01:58:19-08:00	
Germany's president dissolves parliament, sets national election for Feb. 23	FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier on Friday ordered parliament dissolved and set new elections for Feb. 23 in the wake of the collapse of Chancellor Olaf Scholz's coalition, saying it was the only way to give the country a stable government capable of tackling its problems. Scholz lost a confidence vote on Dec. 16 and leads a minority government after his unpopular and notoriously rancorous three-party coalition collapsed on Nov. 6 when he fired his finance minister in a dispute over how to revitalize Germany’s stagnant economy. Steinmeier said he made the decision because it was clear after consultation with party leaders that there was no agreement among Germany's political parties on a majority for a new government in the current parliament. 'It is precisely in difficult times like these that stability requires a government capable of taking action and a reliable majority in parliament,' he said as he made the announcement in Berlin. 'Therefore I am convinced that for the good of our country new elections are the right way.' Since the post-World War II constitution doesn’t allow the Bundestag to dissolve itself, it was up to Steinmeier to decide whether to dissolve parliament and call an election. He had 21 days to make that decision. Once parliament is dissolved, the election must be held within 60 days. Leaders of several major parties agreed earlier on the election date of Feb. 23, seven months earlier than originally planned. Steinmeier warned about outside interference in the poll, saying it is 'a danger to democracy, whether it is covert, as was evidently the case recently in the Romanian elections, or open and blatant, as is currently being practiced particularly intensively on platform X.' A top Romanian court annulled the first round of the country’s presidential election, days after allegations emerged that Russia ran a coordinated online campaign to promote the far-right outsider who won the first round. The campaign is already well underway. Polls show Scholz’s party trailing the conservative opposition Union bloc led by Friedrich Merz. Vice Chancellor Robert Habeck of the environmentalist Greens, the remaining partner in Scholz’s government, is also bidding for the top job — though his party is further back. If recent polls hold up, the likely next government would be led by Merz as chancellor in coalition with at least one other party. Key issues include immigration, how to get the sluggish economy going, and how best to aid Ukraine in its struggle against Russia. The populist, anti-immigration Alternative for Germany, or AfD, which is polling strongly, has nominated Alice Weidel as its candidate for chancellor but has no chance of taking the job because other parties refuse to work with it. Germany’s electoral system traditionally produces coalitions, and polls show no party anywhere near an absolute majority on its own. The election is expected to be followed by weeks of negotiations to form a new government. It’s only the fourth time that the Bundestag has been dissolved ahead of schedule under Germany’s post-World War II constitution. It happened under Chancellor Willy Brandt in 1972, Helmut Kohl in 1982 and Gerhard Schroeder in 2005. Schroeder used the confidence vote to engineer an early election narrowly won by center-right challenger Angela Merkel.	https://apnews.com/article/germany-election-steinmeier-32a9c393067faac264fae7bb29b3e4ef	2024-12-27T01:09:00-08:00	
South Korea's opposition-controlled National Assembly votes to impeach acting President Han	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea’s opposition-controlled National Assembly voted Friday to impeach acting President Han Duck-soo despite vehement protests by governing party lawmakers, further deepening the country’s political crisis set off by President Yoon Suk Yeol’s stunning imposition of martial law and ensuing impeachment. Han’s impeachment means he will be stripped of the powers and duties of the president until the Constitutional Court decides whether to dismiss or reinstate him. The court is already reviewing whether to uphold Yoon's earlier impeachment. The impeachments of the country’s top two officials has worsened its political turmoil, deepened economic uncertainties and hurt its international image. The single-chamber National Assembly passed Han’s impeachment motion with a 192-0 vote. Lawmakers with the governing People Power Party boycotted the vote and surrounded the podium where assembly Speaker Woo Won Shik was seated, shouting that the vote was 'invalid' and demanding Woo's resignation. No violence or injuries were reported. The PPP lawmakers protested after Woo called for a vote on Han’s impeachment motion after announcing its passage required a simple majority in the 300-member assembly, not a two-thirds majority as claimed by the PPP. Most South Korean officials can be impeached by the National Assembly with a simple majority vote, but a president’s impeachment needs the support of two-thirds. There are no specific laws on the impeachment of an acting president. In a statement, Han called his impeachment 'regrettable' but said he respects the assembly's decision and will suspend his duties to 'not add to additional confusion and uncertainty.' He said he will wait for 'a swift, wise decision' by the Constitutional Court. Han’s powers were officially suspended after copies of his impeachment document were delivered to him and the Constitutional Court. The deputy prime minister and finance minister, Choi Sang-mok, took over. Later Friday, Choi's office said he instructed the military to boost its readiness to help prevent North Korea from miscalculating the situation and launching provocations. He also told the foreign ministry to inform the U.S., Japan and other major partners that South Korea's foreign policies remain unchanged. Han, who was appointed prime minister by Yoon, became acting president after Yoon, a conservative, was impeached by the National Assembly about two weeks ago over his short-lived Dec. 3 imposition of martial law. Han quickly clashed with the main liberal opposition Democratic Party as he pushed back against opposition-led efforts to fill three vacant seats on the Constitutional Court, establish an independent investigation into Yoon’s martial law decree and legislate pro-farmer bills. At the heart of the fighting is the Democratic Party’s demand that Han approve the assembly's nominations of three new Constitutional Court justices to restore its full nine-member bench ahead of its ruling on Yoon’s impeachment. That’s a politically sensitive issue because a court decision to dismiss Yoon as president needs support from at least six justices, and adding more justices will likely increase the prospects for Yoon’s ouster. Yoon’s political allies in the governing party oppose the appointment of the three justices, saying Han shouldn’t exercise the presidential authority to make the appointments while Yoon has yet to be formally removed from office. On Thursday, Han said he wouldn’t appoint the justices without bipartisan consent. Later in the day, the Democratic Party, which holds a majority in the assembly, submitted an impeachment motion against Han and passed bills calling for the appointment of three justices. South Korean investigative agencies are probing whether Yoon committed rebellion and abuse of power with his marital law decree. Yoon has repeatedly ignored requests by authorities to appear for face-to-face questioning, His defense minister, police chief and several other senior military commanders have already been arrested over the deployment of troops and police officers to the National Assembly, which prompted a dramatic standoff that ended when lawmakers managed to enter the chamber and voted unanimously to overrule Yoon’s decree. South Korean media reported that prosecutors indicted former Defense Minister Kim Yong Hyun for allegedly playing a key role in Yoon's rebellion plot and committing abuse of power and obstruction. The reports said Kim, a close associate of Yoon, became the first person to be formally charged over the martial law decree. Calls to a Seoul prosecutors' office were unanswered. Han's impeachment motion accuses him of collaborating and abetting Yoon's declaration of martial law. It also accuses Han of attempting to obstruct the restoration of the Constructional Court's full membership and of delaying investigations into Yoon's alleged rebellion by not appointing independent counsels. The martial law enactment, the first of its kind in more than 40 years in South Korea, lasted only six hours but it caused political turmoil in South Korea, triggered alarms from its neighbors and rattled markets. Yoon has defended his decree as an act of governance, saying it was a warning to the Democratic Party which he said has been using its parliamentary majority to obstruct his agenda.	https://apnews.com/article/korea-impeach-acting-leader-han-president-yoon-0276374e86e88d9a97c7c2a06d9fabfd	2024-12-26T22:47:17-08:00	
Leaders and politicians pay homage to India’s former prime minister, Manmohan Singh	NEW DELHI (AP) — Authorities in India have declared a seven-day mourning period to honor Manmohan Singh, officials said Friday, as politicians and public paid tributes to the country’s former prime minister widely regarded as the architect of India’s economic reform program. Officials canceled all cultural and entertainment events for the week, with government buildings flying the national flag at half staff across India. Singh, who died late Thursday at age 92, is scheduled to be cremated on Saturday. Singh's body was put in a glass casket, adorned with flowers and wrapped in the Indian flag, as leaders and mourners paid their respects. Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited his home and offered condolences to his family. Later, Modi in a video message said Singh’s life 'was a reflection of his honesty and simplicity.' 'He saved the country from an economic crisis by providing a road towards a new economy. As a prime minister, his contribution towards the development and progress of the country will always be remembered,' Modi said. A mild-mannered technocrat, Singh was prime minister for 10 years and leader of the Congress Party in the Parliament’s upper house, earning a reputation as a man of great personal integrity. He was chosen to fill the role in 2004 by Sonia Gandhi, the widow of assassinated Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi. Singh was reelected in 2009, but his second term as prime minister was clouded by financial scandals and corruption charges over the organization of the 2010 Commonwealth Games. This led to the Congress Party’s crushing defeat in the 2014 national election by the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party under the leadership of Narendra Modi. Singh adopted a low profile after relinquishing the post of prime minister.	https://apnews.com/article/india-manmohan-singh-prime-minister-abedf0aefaec10815cb7418a6e0a5de5	2024-12-26T22:25:44-08:00	
We fall and we rise': Some amputees in Sierra Leone turn to farming to combat discrimination	FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) — Lahai Makieu struck the bamboo with a machete until it cracked and fell. Balancing on his crutch, he reached to pick it up. But colleagues pulled the bamboo's other end, and he tumbled into the dense grass. 'They forgot I had one leg,' the 45-year-old said, laughing. The trainer at a center for amputee farmers picked himself up and added: 'We fall and we rise.' The phrase encapsulates his journey since the civil war in Sierra Leone. From 1991 to 2002, conflict in the West African country created some 28,000 amputees like him. Amputation by machete was one terror tactic by rebels. But even now, amputation rates remain high in Sierra Leone due to motorbike accidents, poor medical care and delayed treatment by traditional healers, according to medical researchers. The government doesn't collect data on amputees, but the United Nations estimates there are about 500,000 disabled people in the country. Makieu's left leg was amputated as a child after rebels shot him and he received no medical attention for a week. More than 20 years later, in a nation ranked near the bottom of the U.N. development index, amputees still face discrimination, often regarded as a shameful reminder of the civil war. Many resort to begging and live in the streets. 'No one cares about you as an amputee in Sierra Leone,' Makieu said. The Farming on Crutches initiative where Makieu works near the capital, Freetown, offers a rare refuge. It aims to restore amputees’ confidence and independence by teaching them skills to start a farm business. They’ve trained 100 amputees and want to expand their work. The training has transformed Makieu's life. After his amputation in 2002, he lived in a small room with a friend in Freetown, dependent on him for food, money and shelter. At a displacement camp for 270 amputees in Freetown, he met Mambud Samai, the founder of Farming on Crutches and a pastor. 'Many (amputees) are being rejected by their families and communities. They don’t believe they have love,' the 51-year-old Samai said. He felt moved to help after being a refugee himself in Guinea during the civil war. First, Samai organized beach football matches for amputees in Freetown, boosting their confidence. During a visit to Sierra Leone, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon saw the project and funded a site for an amputee football club outside the capital. But Samai decided football was not enough. As a farmer, he saw agriculture as a path to self-sufficiency. In 2020, he set up a demonstration farm to teach amputees how to farm and become rural leaders. His project's name reflects amputees' widespread use of crutches instead of prosthetic legs in Sierra Leone. Foreign donors distributed them after the civil war but many people say they don’t fit well and cause sores. And the country's only prosthetic clinic is too expensive for many. Makieu was one of the first Farming on Crutches trainees in 2022. He learned how to use farm waste for organic fertilizer and bamboo sticks for fences. He set up a small farm operation this year with his wife, Zanib, also an amputee. They met during the training and now have a child. Makieu wants to inspire future farmers. 'It’s my dream to teach people about life. It’s about changing your mindset,' he said. Morning mist rolled over the nearby mountains as the camp rose for exercises ahead of a strenuous day. They gathered in a circle, harmonizing on local songs before Samai spoke. 'We are created for fellowship, not isolation,' he said. 'When we return, we are not as we came. We go home to serve our community as rural leaders.' Makieu interjected: 'I sustain my life through farming, I met my wife here. This training can be a big package for you.' But the vast majority of amputees in Sierra Leone have no such support. Alimany Kani, 30, lives in a camp built by the Norwegian Refugee Council for amputees on the outskirts of Freetown. He lost his leg when he was a baby, to the same bullet that killed his father in the civil war. Despite holding a master’s degree in social work, he cannot find a job. 'Even if you have qualifications, an able-bodied with less education will always get the job,' Kani said. Sierra Leone’s National Commission for Persons with Disability told AP that discrimination towards amputees has improved in the last decade since the Disability Act in 2011 aimed to provide equal opportunities and punish discrimination. Kani firmly disagreed and called on the government to deliver reparations to victims of the civil war. Sierra Leone’s Truth and Reconciliation Commission in 2009 recommended that amputees receive pensions, access to healthcare, accommodation and education. But many of those pledges remain unfulfilled, including for Kani. Only 1,300 out of 32,000 have received a full reparations package due to lack of resources, according to the U.N.’s International Organization for Migration. 'The government don’t keep their promises. It’s inhumane,' Kani said. There currently is no specific support for amputees from the government, the National Commission for Persons with Disability said. Sierra Leone's health ministry, the president's office and the National Commission for Social Action office that manages the reparations program did not respond to questions. A farming charity in Britain, Pasture for Life, is financing Farming on Crutches in full, but Samai said they need support from Sierra Leone's government to expand. Meanwhile, the government is investing over $600 million in agriculture but some believe this will largely benefit large-scale agriculture over small-scale farmers, such as Farming on Crutches' trainees, who form 70% of the population. Two such smallholders are cousins and Farming on Crutches trainees, Amara and Moustapha Jalloh, aged 19 and 21, in central Sierra Leone. Both recently harvested rice and cassava. Moustapha, who was born without a leg, said his harvest surplus allowed him to pay for computer science training. He dreams of being an agricultural engineer. 'Any successful story, there must be painful experiences,' he said. ___ For more on Africa and development: https://apnews.com/hub/africa-pulse ___ The Associated Press receives financial support for global health and development coverage in Africa from the Gates Foundation.

AP PHOTOS: A river route for food and crime: The dual nature of a major South American waterway	VILLA GOBERNADOR GALVEZ, Argentina (AP) — From its headwaters in Brazil, the Paraguay River flows hundreds of miles (kilometers) south to where it joins the Parana River to form a single 2,100-mile (3,400-kilometer) waterway that carries much of the agricultural and mineral wealth of South America to the Atlantic. The riverine waterway connects Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay and carries much of the world’s soybeans, ore and minerals. While the Amazon River is longer and bigger, the Parana-Paraguay waterway carries almost as much freight. In a sense, it is the Mississippi River for the nations of South America’s southern cone. Given the nature of the freight — bulk cargos — most of the thousands of ships that ply this waterway are huge, hulking transports carrying loads for international food conglomerates like Cargill. They tower above the low-lying port towns that dot the length of the Paraguay-Parana. Into the bowels of the ships are fed unimaginably large quantities of soy beans from warehouses holding equally gargantuan piles of soy, the basic foodstuff for millions of farm animals around the globe. But like the Mississippi, the waterway known locally as the 'hidrovía' also conserves traces of its past. Fisherman Dante Andino rises at dawn, around 5 a.m. His son Pablo, 14, accompanies him, learning the trade. The elder Andino puts on his rubber boots and once on the water carefully uncoils the net he will cast by hand four or five times in a day from the prow of his tiny row boat. On average, that will earn him around $20 per day. His net is the most valuable tool he owns, and the one that is most at risk from the huge freighters. 'If we are not careful, they run over our nets and cut them.' 'This waterway has made it very difficult for us fisherman, because for these big ships to pass, they have to dredge out (the river bottom) very deep,' said Andino, as he prepared his net. 'They tell us that the river is for agricultural exports, not for fishermen.' 'But we have families, daily expenses, we can't stop,' he said. 'I am 35 years old, and stopping fishing now and looking for other work would be difficult.' Gustavo Idígoras, the head of Argentina's oil and seed business chamber, said the freight traffic on the waterway cannot stop. It's a question of 'world food security,' he says. 'It is truly a highway that connects our country with 120 overseas markets,' said Idígoras. But the waterway also carries violence and drug trafficking. And the drug cartels, among them, Brazil’s First Capital Command, have found devious and complex ways to use the waterway to ship cocaine as far away as Belgium and Holland. In the last two years, more than 50 tons of cocaine that traveled this route through South America were seized from the European ports of Antwerp, Belgium and Rotterdam in the Netherlands. Much of it was controlled by the First Capital Command. The trafficking is so large-scale that it can sometimes be downright brazen. In July, authorities at a river port on the outskirts of Asuncion, Paraguay seized four tons of cocaine that had been packed into sugar sacks in a container bound for Antwerp, Belgium. The traffickers apparently hoped that one sack of white crystals would look much like any other. According to a 2019 investigation by Paraguay’s anti-drug agency, Senad, huge loads of cocaine were produced in Bolivia. From there, traffickers loaded it aboard small airplanes and landed in Paraguay’s Chaco region, which borders Bolivia. It’s the perfect geography for drug trafficking, said Francisco Ayala, a spokesman for Senad. 'It is an ideal terrain for trafficking all kinds of products, it is ideal,' said Ayala. 'It is a sparsely populated area with rough terrain, directly on the border with Bolivia.' 'Paraguay’s Chaco (region) has, and lends itself to, setting up clandestine airstrips' for drug flights mainly from Bolivia, he said. Once in Paraguay, the drugs in the 2019 case were taken by land to Seguro de Villeta, a shipping port on the upper Paraguay River. There, the cocaine was hidden in freight containers bound for Belgium and Holland. Farther down the river is Rosario, Argentina, the picturesque hometown of soccer star Lionel Messi and revolutionary Ernesto 'Che' Guevara. It lies just 180 miles (300 kilometers) from where the vast river enters the sea. Here, the trafficking and violence intensifies as the shipments get closer to the sea and drug gangs vie to protect their shipments. Homicide numbers in Rosario are five times the national average for Argentina. Rosario’s link to soccer goes beyond Messi; in November, authorities said they were investigating the killings of two leaders of the fan club for the city’s soccer team, Rosario Central, as a possible hit by rivals or drug gangs. Things got so bad that President Javier Milei instituted a crackdown on crime. Known as 'Plan Bandera (the Flag Plan),' police were sent into the city’s roughest neighborhoods and tightened control on gang leaders running their operations from inside prisons.	https://apnews.com/article/parana-paraguay-river-waterway-freight-soy-4db7484e84696d8823be8cb52ec2957f	2024-12-26T20:11:08-08:00	
Croatia's outspoken president is seeking reelection. He faces several contenders in Sunday's vote	ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) — Croatia’s left-leaning president, an outspoken critic of Western military support for Ukraine in its war against Russia, is running for reelection this weekend against an array of contenders, including the candidate backed by the conservative government. President Zoran Milanović is seen as a favorite ahead of the presidential election on Sunday, though he is unlikely to score an outright victory. If none of the eight contenders gain more than half of the ballots cast in the first round, a runoff between the top two will be held on Jan. 12. The most popular politician in Croatia, 58-year-old Milanović had served as prime minister in the past. Populist in style, Milanovic has been a fierce critic of current Prime Minister Andrej Plenković and a continuous sparring of the two has lately marked Croatia's political scene. Ahead of Sunday's vote, Plenković's Hrvatska Democratska Zajednica party, or Croatian Democratic Union party has backed pediatrician and university professor Dragan Primorac for the presidency. Primorac has sought to portray himself as a unifier and Milanovic as divisive. Though the presidency is largely ceremonial in Croatia, an elected president holds political authority and acts as the supreme commander of the military. Milanović has criticized the European Union's support for Ukraine and has often insisted that Croatia should not take sides. He has said Croatia should stay away from global disputes, thought it is a member of both NATO and the EU. Milanovic has also blocked Croatia's participation in a NATO-led training mission for Ukraine, declaring that 'No Croatian soldier will take part in somebody else’s war.' His main rival in the election, Primorac, has stated that 'Croatia's place is in the West, not the East.' His presidency bid, however, has been marred by a high-level corruption case that landed Croatia’s health minister in jail last month and which featured prominently in pre-election debates. Political expert Andjelko Milardović said Milanović’s reelection would be good for democracy in Croatia because the ruling party holds a tight grip over all other government institutions. 'We are interested to see a balance and control of power,' said Milardović. Milanović is backed by center-left Social Democrats, the biggest opposition party. Some analysts believe that Marija Selak Raspudić, a conservative independent candidate polling third in pre-election surveys, could stand a better chance against Milanovic if she somehow makes it to the runoff. Selak Raspudić was close to a right-wing party in the past but now runs as non-partisan. She has focused on economic troubles of ordinary citizens and issues such as population decline in the country of some 3.8 million and corruption. Trailing fourth in the polls is the only left-green contender in the race, Ivana Kekin, from Možemo, or We Can, party which governs Zagreb, Croatia's capital. Married to a popular rock musician, Kekin says she is a 'president for a new generation.' As a psychiatrist, Kekin has accused Primorac and HDZ of syphoning money from Croatia's health system in shady corruption deals. Four more candidates are running but none are believed to stand a chance to reach the second round. Zagreb resident Ilka Matić said she expects Milanović to win another five-year mandate but that 'there is little difference between them all.' Croatia, the newest member state of the EU after joining the bloc in 2013, has around 1.6 million eligible voters.	https://apnews.com/article/croatia-president-election-milanovic-73147e652adbbfb3a9bdb3de89316122	2024-12-26T20:03:05-08:00	
China launches amphibious assault ship that can launch fighter jets	BANGKOK (AP) — China launched a new amphibious assault ship Friday, capable of launching fighter jets and designed to strengthen the navy's combat ability in distant seas. The Sichuan, the first ship of the 076 type, is China's largest such ship yet, displacing 40,000 tons and equipped with an electromagnetic catapult which will allow fighter jets to launch directly off its deck, according to the official Xinhua news agency. The ship is designed to launch ground troops in landing crafts and provide them with air support. Developed by Chinese researchers, it's also equipped with an 'arrestor technology' which allows fighter jets to land on its deck. China's first amphibious assault ships, the type 075, launched in 2019. China’s People’s Liberation Army Navy, or PLAN, has been working on modernizing its forces for more than a decade, with the aim of being able to operate globally rather than being restricted to waters near the Chinese mainland. China first managed to launch fighter jets with the new electromagnetic technology on its indigenously made aircraft carrier, the Fujian, which launched two years ago. Chinese military expert Song Zhongping compared the Sichuan to a 'light aircraft carrier,' according to the Global Times. The ship will undergo further testing, including sea trials. China has the largest navy in the world and is consistently trying to upgrade its fleet. Recently, researchers found that the country is working on designing a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, which would allow it to deploy its ships in distant waters without needing a base to refuel. The U.S. currently has 11 aircraft carriers, all nuclear powered, allowing it to keep multiple strike groups deployed around the world at all times, including in the Asia-Pacific. ___ AP researcher Yu Bing contributed to this report from Beijing.	https://apnews.com/article/china-new-amphibious-ship-596a481b3bc3b808947080005ab433c7	2024-12-26T19:57:00-08:00	
Stock market today: Asian shares advance after a mixed finish on Wall Street	BANGKOK (AP) — Asian shares were mostly higher on Friday, with Japan’s benchmark registering strong gains for a second straight day. Oil prices and U.S. futures declined. Tokyo's Nikkei 225 index climbed 1.4% to 40,139.90, while the Japanese yen sank further after the central bank governor indicated that interest rate hikes might be delayed by threats to the economy such as higher U.S. tariffs on imports. The dollar fell to 157.66 Japanese yen from 158.00 yen. It had been trading below 150 yen until the past few days. Hong Kong's Hang Seng edged 0.1% higher to 20,120.54, while the Shanghai Composite index was up 0.3% at 3,407.89. South Korea's Kospi was the outlier, falling 1.4% to 2,393.60 after the country's main opposition party submitted a motion on Thursday to impeach the country’s acting leader over his reluctance to fill three Constitutional Court vacancies ahead of the court’s review of rebellion charges against impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol stemming from his short-lived martial law decree on Dec. 3. 'U.S. equities are stuck in a holding pattern as trading volumes dry up following the holiday break,' Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management said in a commentary. 'Liquidity remains razor-thin, and market moves appear more about year-end housekeeping than aggressive positioning.' The S&amp;P 500 fell less than 0.1% to 6,037.59 after spending the day wavering between small gains and losses. The tiny loss ended the benchmark index’s three-day winning streak. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.1% to 43,325.80 and the Nasdaq composite fell 0.1% to 20,020.36. Trading volume was lighter than usual as U.S. markets reopened following the Christmas holiday. Semiconductor giant Nvidia, whose enormous valuation gives it an outsize influence on indexes, slipped 0.2%. Meta Platforms fell 0.7%, and Amazon and Netflix each fell 0.9%. Tesla was among the biggest decliners in the S&amp;P 500, finishing 1.8% lower. Some tech companies fared better. Chip company Broadcom rose 2.4%, Micron Technology added 0.6% and Adobe gained 0.5%. Health care stocks were a bright spot. CVS Health rose 1.5% and Walgreens Boots Alliance added 5.3% for the biggest gain among S&amp;P 500 stocks. Several retailers also gained ground. Target rose 3%, Ross Stores added 2.3%, Best Buy rose 2.9% and Dollar Tree gained 3.8%. Traders are watching to see whether retailers have a strong holiday season. The day after Christmas traditionally ranks among the top 10 biggest shopping days of the year, as consumers go online or rush to stores to cash in gift cards and raid bargain bins. U.S.-listed shares in Honda and Nissan rose 4.1% and 16.4%, respectively. The Japanese automakers announced earlier this week that the two companies are in talks to combine. The Labor Department reported that U.S. applications for unemployment benefits held steady last week, though continuing claims rose to the highest level in three years. Wall Street has several economic reports to look forward to next week, including updates on pending home sales and home prices, a report on U.S. construction spending and snapshots of manufacturing activity. In other dealings early Friday, U.S. benchmark crude oil picked up 7 cents to $69.69 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, gained 7 cents to $72.92 per barrel. The euro slipped to $1.0412 from $1.0424. ___ AP Business Writers Alex Veiga and Matt Ott contributed.	https://apnews.com/article/stocks-markets-tech-china-rates-c80cb10ca9cdb0313b11d6e636a532d6	2024-12-26T19:26:08-08:00

China probes personal disputes after mass killings. Many fear further infringement on freedoms	BANGKOK (AP) — The order came from the top. China's leader Xi Jinping wants the recent spree of mass killings that shocked the country not to happen again. He ordered local governments to prevent future 'extreme cases.' The attacks, where drivers mow down people on foot or knife-wielding assailants stab multiple victims, are not new in China. But the latest surge drew attention. Local officials were quick to vow to examine all sorts of personal disputes that could trigger aggression, from marital troubles to disagreements over inheritance. However, the increasing reach into people’s private lives raises concerns at a time when the Chinese state has already tightened its grip over all social and political aspects in the East Asian nation. 'Revenge on Society Crimes' This is how people in China label these attacks. In November alone, three took place: A man struck people at an elementary school in Hunan province, wounding 30, after suffering investment losses. A student who failed his examination stabbed and killed eight at a vocational school in the city of Yixing. The most victims, 35 people, resulted from a man mowing down a crowd in the southern city of Zhuhai, supposedly upset over his divorce. While pinpointing the exact motive of such attacks can be difficult, there is an overwhelming feeling of being pressured within Chinese society, experts say. 'On the surface, it seems like there are individual factors, but we see there’s a common link,' Wu Qiang, a former political science professor, said. 'This link is, in my personal opinion, every person has a feeling of injustice. They feel deeply that this society is very unfair and they can’t bear it anymore.' Since 2015, Chinese police have targeted human rights lawyers and non-profit advocacy groups, jailing many, while keeping tight surveillance on others, effectively destroying the civil society that had been active from the early 2000s to 2010s. Wu was fired from Tsinghua University after conducting fieldwork during the 2014 Occupy protests in Hong Kong. He says police officers have been regularly stationed outside his home in Beijing since last year. Keeping a tight lid on the killings A decade ago, media outlets could report an incident as it developed and even share a suspect’s name. Nowadays, it's rarely possible. During the 24 hours before the death toll was released in the Zhuhai slaying, state censors were quick to remove any videos of the incident and eyewitness accounts shared online. In the case of the Hunan elementary school attack, authorities shared the number of the wounded only after the court sentencing, nearly a month later. A tally of violent attacks can be documented in other countries; notably, the U.S. had 38 mass killings so far this year, according to an Associated Press database. But in China, a lack of public data makes it hard to decipher mass killing trends. 'From 2000 to 2010, there was a lot of discussions, including how do we help these people by making structural changes to reduce these risks, but now there’s not,' said Rose Luqiu, a well-known former journalist with state-owned Phoenix Television and an associate professor at Hong Kong Baptist University. Luqiu believes the government may be enforcing censorship thinking it will prevent copycats from imitating such crimes. 'Things will only become more and more strict,' she predicted. For the Chinese state, 'the only method to deal with it is to strengthen control.' Officials vow to ferret out hidden risks After the Zhuhai attack, Xi called on all local governments 'to strengthen prevention and control of risks at the source, strictly prevent extreme cases from occurring, and to resolve conflicts and disputes in a timely manner,' according to the official Xinhua news agency. The AP found at least a dozen local government notices, from small towns to big cities, announcing actions in response. In eastern Anhui province, a ruling Communist Party leader inspected a middle school, a local police station, and even the warehouse of a chemical factory where he urged the workers to 'ferret out any hidden risks.' He said they must 'thoroughly and meticulously investigate and resolve conflicts and disputes,' including in families, marriages and neighborhoods. Police and prosecutors issued similar statements. The Ministry of Justice promised to curtail conflicts by looking into squabbles over inheritance, housing, land and unpaid wages. However, many expressed worry over how such disputes will be detected. 'I think we’re at the beginning of a vicious cycle,' said Lynette Ong, a professor at the University of Toronto and author of 'Outsourcing Repression: Everyday State Power in Contemporary China.' 'If you nip the conflict in its bud, you’d imagine the system then would impose a lot of pressure ... on schools, enterprises and factories.' The new announcements reminded Ong of China’s strict policies during the COVID-19 pandemic. Neighborhood committees, the lowest rung of government, set up fences and barriers in front of buildings to control entry and exit and broke into homes in extreme cases to disinfect the apartments of people who had caught the virus. Eventually, people protested en masse. 'If we see non-sensible measures being introduced, you’ll be met by resistance and anger and grievances from the people, and it’s going to feed into this vicious cycle where more extreme measures are going to be brought,' she said.	https://apnews.com/article/china-mass-killings-revenge-society-security-censors-705144a770b486eb222c040cba056f41	2024-12-26T17:15:23-08:00	
Canadian ministers head to Palm Beach for talks with incoming Trump administration	TORONTO (AP) — Two top Canadian Cabinet ministers are visiting Palm Beach to talk border security and trade with the incoming Donald Trump administration as Trump threatens tariffs on all Canadian products. New Finance Minister Dominic LeBlanc and Foreign Minister Mélanie Joly will be in Palm Beach, Florida on Thursday for the talks this week, said Jean-Sébastien Comeau, a spokesman for LeBlanc. LeBlanc said last week he would meet with Tom Homan, Trump’s incoming 'border czar,' after Christmas to discuss Canada’s plan to secure the border as part of a bid to avoid the sweeping tariffs. Comeau said LeBlanc and Joly 'look forward to building on the discussions that took place when the Prime Minister met with President Trump at Mar-a-Lago last month, as well as the positive call the Ministers held with Mr. Tom Homan earlier this month.' 'The Ministers intend to focus on Canada’s efforts to combat fentanyl trafficking and illegal migration and the measures outlined in Canada’s Border Plan, as well as the negative impacts that the imposition of 25% tariffs on Canadian goods would have on both Canada and the United States,' Comeau added in a statement. The Trump transition team did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment. Trump keeps calling embattled Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau the governor of the 51st state and has threatened to impose sweeping tariffs if Canada does not stem what he calls a flow of migrants and drugs in the United States — even though far fewer of each cross into the U.S. from Canada than from Mexico, which Trump has also threatened. Canada has a billion-dollar plan to increase security at the border. LeBlanc last week he discussed parts of the plan with American officials and is optimistic, but said they have a lot of work ahead. Trump has also made an issue of the U.S. trade deficit with Canada, erroneously calling it a subsidy. Canada’s ambassador to Washington, Kirsten Hillman, has said the U.S. had a $75 billion trade deficit with Canada last year. But she noted a third of what Canada sells into the U.S. are energy exports and said there is a deficit when oil prices are high. About 60% of U.S. crude oil imports and 85% of U.S. electricity imports are from Canada. Nearly $3.6 billion Canadian dollars ($2.7 billion) worth of goods and services cross the border each day. Canada is the top export destination for 36 U.S. states. Flows of migrants and seizures of drugs are vastly different at the U.S.'s two land borders. U.S. customs agents seized 43 pounds of fentanyl at the Canadian border during the last fiscal year, compared with 21,100 pounds at the Mexican border. Most of the fentanyl reaching the U.S. — where it causes about 70,000 overdose deaths annually — is made by Mexican drug cartels using precursor chemicals smuggled from Asia. On immigration, the U.S. Border Patrol reported 1.53 million encounters with migrants at the southwest border with Mexico between October 2023 and September 2024. That compares to 23,721 encounters at the Canadian border during that time.	https://apnews.com/article/canada-trump-tariff-leblanc-joly-border-ca7f9bd358f05614d0f928f340162ef2	2024-12-26T16:29:28-08:00

An uneasy calm settles over Syrian city of Homs after outbreak of sectarian violence	HOMS, Syria (AP) — Syria's new security forces checked IDs and searched cars in the central city of Homs on Thursday, a day after protests by members of the Alawite minority erupted in gunfire and stirred fears that the country's fragile peace could break down. A tense calm prevailed after checkpoints were set up throughout the country’s third-largest city, which has a mixed population of Sunni and Shia Muslims, Alawites and Christians. The security forces are controlled by the former insurgent group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, which led the charge that unseated former President Bashar Assad. On the road from Damascus, security teams at the checkpoints waved cars through perfunctorily, but in Homs they checked IDs and opened the trunk of each car to look for weapons. Armed men blocked the road leading to the square formerly named for Assad’s father, Hafez Assad, where one foot was all that remained of a statue of him that once stood in the center of the traffic roundabout. The square has been renamed Freedom Square, although some call it 'the donkey’s square,' referring to Assad. Protests erupted there Wednesday among Alawites — the minority sect to which the Assad family belongs — after a video circulated showing an Alawite shrine in Aleppo being vandalized. Government officials later issued a statement saying that the video was old. Wednesday's protests began peacefully, said Alaa Amran, the newly installed police chief of Homs, but then 'some suspicious parties ... related to the former regime opened fire on both security forces and demonstrators, and there were some injuries.' Security forces flooded the area and imposed a curfew to restore order, he said. Mohammad Ali Hajj Younes, an electrician who has a shop next to the square, said the people who instigated the violence are 'the same shabiha who used to come into my shop and rob me, and I couldn’t say anything,' using a term referring to pro-Assad militia members. The protests were part of a larger flare-up of violence Wednesday. Pro-Assad militants attacked members of the new security forces near the coastal town of Tartous, killing 14 and wounding 10, according to the Interior Ministry in the transitional government. In response, security forces launched raids 'pursuing the remnants of Assad's militias,' state media reported. The state-run SANA news agency reported late Thursday that clashes broke out in the village of Balqasa in a rural part of Homs province. The unrest left many people fearful that the relatively peaceful conditions that have prevailed since Assad's fall could break down into sectarian fighting as the country begins to recover following nearly 14 years of civil war. Those who instigated the violence 'are supported by parties that may be external that want strife for Syria to return it to square one, the square of sectarianism,' Amran said. Ahmad al-Bayyaa, an Alawite in the al-Zahra neighborhood of Homs, said he and his wife and three daughters fled to the coastal town of Baniyas when insurgent forces first arrived, but came back a day later after hearing from neighbors that the fighters had not harmed civilians. 'We had been given the idea that there would be slaughter and killing based on our identity, and nothing like that happened,' he said. 'We came back, and nobody asked to see my ID from the coast to Homs.' Before Assad's fall, al-Bayyaa said, he spent 10 years in hiding to avoid a call-up for reserve army service and was afraid to cross a checkpoint in his own neighborhood. After the former Syrian army collapsed in the face of the HTS-led advance, residents of the neighborhood set up a fruit and vegetable stand on an abandoned tank in a gesture of mockery. In the predominantly Christian Homs suburb of Fayrouzeh, a group of teenage girls took each other’s pictures next to a giant cutout of Santa Claus with a Christmas tree in the town square. Residents of the area said their initial fears that the country's new rulers would target religious minorities were quickly laid to rest. HTS was once aligned with al-Qaida, but its leader, Ahmad al-Sharaa, formerly known as Abu Mohammed al-Golani, has cut ties with the group and since coming to power has preached religious coexistence. 'We had a very beautiful holiday even though there was some anxiety before it,' said Fayrouzeh resident Sarab Kashi. 'The guys from HTS volunteered and stood as guards on the door of the churches.' The city’s Sunni majority, meanwhile, welcomed the new administration. Many of the young men now guarding its streets were originally from Homs and were evacuated to opposition-held Idlib when Assad’s forces solidified control of their areas years ago. 'These guys were young boys when they took them in the green buses, and they were crying,' said Wardeh Mohammed, gesturing at a group of young men manning a checkpoint in front of a grocery store on one of the city's main streets. 'Thank God, they have come back as young men, as fighters who made us proud.' The country’s new rulers have scrambled to impose order after the initial anarchic days after Assad’s fall. The former police and security forces — widely known for corruption — were disbanded, and members of the police force in what was formerly a regional government headed by HTS in the opposition-held northwest were deployed to other areas. Amran, the police chief, said recruitment efforts are underway to build up the forces, but he acknowledged that the current numbers are 'not sufficient to control security 100%.' The new security forces have also struggled to stem the proliferation of weapons in the hands of civilians or non-state groups, he said. Al-Sharaa has said that the country's patchwork of former rebel groups will come together in one unified national army, but it remained unclear exactly how that would happen or whether the groups can avoid infighting. In Homs, it was clear that several different armed factions patrolled the streets, in a sometimes uneasy coordination. An HTS official hastened to explain that a handful of armed men wearing patches with an insignia sometimes associated with the Islamic State were not members of his group. Many feared another flare-up of violence. 'From what happened yesterday, it’s clear that some people want to take the country backwards' to the worst days of the country’s civil war, al-Bayya said, 'and no one wants to go back 14 years.'	https://apnews.com/article/syria-homs-alawites-hts-assad-sectarian-6c8d534d9f93da13dc8629f2f2c49aae	2024-12-26T11:22:20-08:00	
Organizers say two sailors have died in the Sydney to Hobart yacht race amid a stormy first night	Two sailors on separate boats have been killed in boom accidents two hours apart on a storm-ravaged first night of the annual Sydney to Hobart race, adding to the event's long history of deaths at sea. The Cruising Yacht Club of Australia in Sydney, which administers the yacht race, said Friday that one sailor each on entrants Flying Fish Arctos and Bowline were killed after being struck by the boom, a large horizontal pole at the bottom of the sail. Officials later said a sailor was washed overboard on another boat, but was rescued. That crew member was from Hobart yacht Porco Rosso, and he drifted a kilometer from the yacht before being rescued. The incident triggered the crew member’s emergency position-indicating radio beacon, a safety device that must be worn by all sailors in the race. 'That is one of the most terrifying experiences that you can have,' said David Jacobs, vice-commodore of the CYCA. '(And) it was at night, which makes it tenfold more scary.' The deaths come 26 years after six sailors were killed in storms during the 1998 running of the race, which triggered a state coronial inquest and mass reforms to the safety protocols — including the radio beacon on all sailors — that govern the race. There have been 13 fatalities in the 79-year history of the race, with four of those deaths resulting from sailor heart attacks. The fleet was continuing its passage to Constitution Dock in Hobart, Tasmania, with the first boats expected to arrive early Saturday morning. The race is 628 nautical miles (722 miles, 1,160 kilometers) long. Jacobs reiterated the race would 'absolutely' continue. 'The conditions are challenging, but they’re not excessive,' he said. 'So we’ve got sort of winds at about 25 knots coming from the north seas around about two meters or thereabouts, so the conditions that most of the sailors would normally easily handle.' 'The sailing community is a very close community. There’s about a thousand sailors on the water in this race, and to lose two in this fashion is just devastating.' Just over 21 hours into the race, 87 entrants were still sailing and 17 yachts had retired at sea. Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese paid tribute to the sailors who died. 'We have sadly awoken to tragedy in the Sydney to Hobart with the awful news two sailors have lost their lives,' he said. 'Our thoughts are with the crews, their families and loved ones at this deeply sad time.' The incident aboard Flying Fish Arctos occurred around 30 nautical miles east-southeast of Ulladulla on the New South Wales south coast. Crew members attempted CPR but could not revive their teammate. The crew member aboard Bowline was struck approximately 30 nautical miles east/north-east of Batemans Bay and fell unconscious, with CPR also unsuccessful. 'As these incidents are being dealt with by the Water Police and all family members are yet to be contacted, we cannot provide further details at this stage,' the CYCA said in a statement. 'Our thoughts are with the crews, family and friends of the deceased.' Flying Fish Arctos, a New South Wales-based 50-footer, has contested 17 previous Hobarts since being built in 2001. The boat was designed for round-the-world sailing and is currently used by Flying Fish, a sailing school that operates in Mosman, a suburb on Sydney’s north shore. The first all-Filipino crew of 15 sailors was entered in the 2024 race, but was among the retirements because of the weather. With veteran sailor Ernesto Echauz at the helm, Centennial 7 was one of six international entrants and includes sailors from the Philippines’ national team and the Philippines navy. Last year, LawConnect won line honors after holding off defending champion Comanche by less than a minute in an exciting finish between the super maxis. LawConnect, which was runner-up in the last three editions of the race, finished in 1 day, 19 hours, 3 minutes, 58 seconds. Comanche’s time was 1 day, 19 hours, 4 minutes, 49 seconds — a margin of just 51 seconds. Comanche, which was among the retirements in this year's race, holds the race record of 1 day, 9 hours, 15 minutes, 24 seconds, set when it won in 2017. LawConnect, which led out of Sydney Harbor on Thursday, was leading this year's race but still had 200 nautical miles before reaching Hobart. It could mean an overnight finish for the leading yachts early Saturday. Celestial V70 was in second place, about 10 nautical miles behind LawConnect. ___ AP sports: https://apnews.com/sports	https://apnews.com/article/sydney-hobart-sailing-yacht-race-ddd5a55f89a95c5fa6e8881265b182a8	2024-12-26T11:10:08-08:00	
An altercation erupts at a high-level meeting of a Russia-dominated economic union	MOSCOW (AP) — A tightly-scripted meeting of the Russia-dominated economic alliance of several ex-Soviet nations briefly went awry Thursday when two leaders engaged in bickering during a live broadcast of the event. Russian President Vladimir Putin and other heads of states attended the meeting of the Eurasian Economic Union, which includes Russia, Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan, who has increasingly sought to phase down his country's ties with Moscow and forge closer relations with the West, joined the meeting via video link after canceling his trip following a positive test for COVID-19. The carefully choreographed session at a resort near St. Petersburg veered off script when Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, whose country was taking the rotating chairmanship in the economic grouping from Armenia, urged Pashinyan to visit Belarus for the union's next meeting. Pashinyan responded that he plans to attend the Belarus meeting via video call, after which Lukashenko pressed for an explanation and even offered to send a plane to fly the Armenian delegation to the Belarusian capital. Pashinyan then pointed to his earlier decision to freeze high-level visits to Belarus over Lukashenko's support for Armenia's rival, Azerbaijan. 'I don't think this is the right format for discussing these issues,' Pashinyan added. But Lukashenko kept arguing and Pashinyan snapped back. Putin, who sat next to Lukashenko, and other leaders watched the altercation in stony silence. The Eurasian Economic Union was formed a decade ago to encourage stronger business ties and facilitate trade between its members, but it has been marred by economic and other dispoutes between members.	https://apnews.com/article/russia-economic-union-belarus-armenia-1dc20197b7c743f18f8d86b923473132	2024-12-26T08:58:58-08:00	
The US says it pushed retraction of a famine warning for north Gaza. Aid groups express concern.	WASHINGTON (AP) — A lead organization monitoring for food crises around the world withdrew a new report this week warning of imminent famine in north Gaza under what it called Israel's 'near-total blockade,' after the U.S. asked for its retraction, U.S. officials told the Associated Press. The move follows public criticism of the report from the U.S. ambassador to Israel. The rare public dispute drew accusations from prominent aid and human-rights figures that the work of the U.S.-funded Famine Early Warning System Network, meant to reflect the opinion of unbiased international experts, has been tainted by politics. A declaration of famine would be a great embarrassment for Israel, which has insisted that its 15-month war in Gaza is aimed against the Hamas militant group and not against its civilian population. U.S. ambassador to Israel Jacob Lew earlier this week called the warning by the internationally recognized group inaccurate and 'irresponsible.' Lew and the U.S. Agency for International Development, which funds the monitoring group, both said the findings failed to properly account for rapidly changing circumstances in north Gaza. Humanitarian and human rights officials expressed fear of U.S. political interference in the world's monitoring system for famines. The U.S. Embassy in Israel and the State Department declined comment. FEWS officials did not respond to questions. 'We work day and night with the U.N. and our Israeli partners to meet humanitarian needs — which are great — and relying on inaccurate data is irresponsible,' Lew said Tuesday. USAID confirmed to the AP that it had asked the famine-monitoring organization to withdraw its stepped-up warning issued in a report dated Monday. The report did not appear among the top updates on the group's website Thursday, but the link to it remained active. The dispute points in part to the difficulty of assessing the extent of starvation in largely isolated northern Gaza. Thousands in recent weeks have fled an intensified Israeli military crackdown that aid groups say has allowed delivery of only a dozen trucks of food and water since roughly October. FEWS Net said in its withdrawn report that unless Israel changes its policy, it expects the number of people dying of starvation and related ailments in north Gaza to reach between two and 15 per day sometime between January and March. The internationally recognized mortality threshold for famine is two or more deaths a day per 10,000 people. FEWS was created by the U.S. development agency in the 1980s and is still funded by it. But it is intended to provide independent, neutral and data-driven assessments of hunger crises, including in war zones. Its findings help guide decisions on aid by the U.S. and other governments and agencies around the world. A spokesman for Israel's foreign ministry, Oren Marmorstein, welcomed the U.S. ambassador's public challenge of the famine warning. 'FEWS NET - Stop spreading these lies!' Marmorstein said on X. In challenging the findings publicly, the U.S. ambassador 'leveraged his political power to undermine the work of this expert agency,' said Scott Paul, a senior manager at the Oxfam America humanitarian nonprofit. Paul stressed that he was not weighing in on the accuracy of the data or methodology of the report. 'The whole point of creating FEWS is to have a group of experts make assessments about imminent famine that are untainted by political considerations,' said Kenneth Roth, former executive director of Human Rights Watch and now a visiting professor in international affairs at Princeton University. 'It sure looks like USAID is allowing political considerations -- the Biden administration’s worry about funding Israel’s starvation strategy -- to interfere.' Israel says it has been operating in recent months against Hamas militants still active in northern Gaza. It says the vast majority of the area’s residents have fled and relocated to Gaza City, where most aid destined for the north is delivered. But some critics, including a former defense minister, have accused Israel of carrying out ethnic cleansing in Gaza’s far north, near the Israeli border. North Gaza has been one of the areas hardest-hit by fighting and Israel’s restrictions on aid throughout its war with Hamas militants. Global famine monitors and U.N. and U.S. officials have warned repeatedly of the imminent risk of malnutrition and deaths from starvation hitting famine levels. International officials say Israel last summer increased the amount of aid it was admitting there, under U.S. pressure. The U.S. and U.N. have said Gaza’s people as a whole need between 350 and 500 trucks a day of food and other vital needs. But the U.N. and aid groups say Israel recently has again blocked almost all aid to that part of Gaza. Cindy McCain, the American head of the U.N. World Food Program, previously called for political pressure to get food flowing to Palestinians there. Israel says it places no restrictions on aid entering Gaza and that hundreds of truckloads of goods are piled up at Gaza’s crossings and accused international aid agencies of failing to deliver the supplies. The U.N. and other aid groups say ongoing combat, looting and insufficient security by Israeli troops make it impossible to deliver aid effectively. Lew, the U.S. ambassador, said the famine warning was based on 'outdated and inaccurate' data. He pointed to uncertainty over how many of the 65,000-75,000 people remaining in northern Gaza had fled in recent weeks, saying that skewed the findings. FEWS said in its report that its famine assessment holds even if as few as 10,000 people remain. USAID in its statement to AP said it had reviewed the report before it became public, and noted 'discrepancies' in population estimates and some other data. The U.S. agency had asked the famine warning group to address those uncertainties and be clear in its final report to reflect how those uncertainties affected its predictions of famine, it said. 'This was relayed before Ambassador Lew’s statement,' USAID said in a statement. 'FEWS NET did not resolve any of these concerns and published in spite of these technical comments and a request for substantive engagement before publication. As such, USAID asked to retract the report.' Roth criticized the U.S. challenge of the report in light of the gravity of the crisis there. 'This quibbling over the number of people desperate for food seems a politicized diversion from the fact that the Israeli government is blocking virtually all food from getting in,' he said, adding that 'the Biden administration seems to be closing its eyes to that reality, but putting its head in the sand won’t feed anyone.' The U.S., Israel’s main backer, provided a record amount of military support in the first year of the war. At the same time, the Biden administration repeatedly urged Israel to allow more access to aid deliveries in Gaza overall, and warned that failing to do so could trigger U.S. restrictions on military support. The administration recently said Israel was making improvements and declined to carry out its threat of restrictions. Military support for Israel’s war in Gaza is politically charged in the U.S., with Republicans and some Democrats staunchly opposed any effort to limit U.S. support over the suffering of Palestinian civilians trapped in the conflict. The Biden administration’s reluctance to do more to press Israel for improved treatment of civilians undercut support for Democrats in last month’s elections. ___ Sam Mednick and Josef Federman in Jerusalem contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/gaza-israel-famine-biden-trump-fews-89b4a0d3ab684669ee4456566b406621	2024-12-26T08:34:59-08:00	
India's former prime minister Manmohan Singh, architect of economic reforms, dies aged 92	NEW DELHI (AP) — India’s former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, widely regarded as the architect of India’s economic reform program and a landmark nuclear deal with the United States, has died. He was 92. Singh was admitted to New Delhi’s All India Institute of Medical Sciences late Thursday after his health deteriorated due to a 'sudden loss of consciousness at home,' the hospital said in a statement. 'Resuscitative measures were started immediately at home. He was brought to the Medical Emergency' at 8:06 p,m., the hospital said, but 'despite all efforts, he could not be revived and was declared dead at 9:51 PM.' Singh was being treated for 'age-related medical conditions,' the statement said. A mild-mannered technocrat, Singh became one of India’s longest-serving prime ministers for 10 years and earned a reputation as a man of great personal integrity. He was chosen to fill the role in 2004 by Sonia Gandhi, the widow of assassinated Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi. But his sterling image was tainted by allegations of corruption against his ministers. Singh was elected to a second term as prime minister from 2009-2014 that was clouded by financial scandals and corruption charges over the organization of the 2010 Commonwealth Games. This led to the Congress Party’s crushing defeat in the 2014 national election by the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party under the leadership of Narendra Modi. Singh adopted a low profile after relinquishing the post of prime minister. Prime Minister Modi, who succeeded Singh in 2014, called him one of India’s 'most distinguished leaders' who rose from humble origins and left 'a strong imprint on our economic policy over the years.' 'As our Prime Minister, he made extensive efforts to improve people’s lives,' Modi said in a post on social platform X. He called Singh’s interventions in Parliament as a lawmaker 'insightful' and said 'his wisdom and humility were always visible.'	https://apnews.com/article/india-manmohan-singh-prime-minister-obituary-06cfb0b96acc00a64a280cc6da3cc968	2024-12-26T08:27:19-08:00	
Ukraine's military intelligence says North Korean troops suffer heavy battlefield losses	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — North Korean troops are suffering heavy losses in the fighting in Russia's Kursk region and are facing logistical difficulties as a result of Ukrainian attacks, Ukraine’s military intelligence said Thursday. The intelligence agency, known under its acronym GUR, said that Ukrainian strikes near Novoivanovka inflicted heavy casualties on North Korean units. It said that as a result of Ukrainian attacks along the front line North Korean troops also faced supply issues and even experienced shortages of drinking water. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said earlier this week that 3,000 North Korean troops have been killed and wounded in the fighting in the Kursk region. It marked the first significant estimate by Ukraine of North Korean casualties several weeks after Kyiv announced that North Korea had sent 10,000 to 12,000 troops to Russia to help it in the almost 3-year war. The casualty disclosure came as the Biden administration was pressing to send as much military aid as possible to Ukraine before President-elect Donald Trump takes over. Ukrainian forces launched a foray into the Kursk region in August, dealing a significant blow to Russia's prestige and forcing it to distract some of its troops from eastern Ukraine, where they were pressing a slow-moving offensive. The Russian army has been able to reclaim some of the territory in the Kursk region from Ukrainian forces, but has failed to fully dislodge them. At the same time, Russia has sought to break Ukraine's resistance with waves of strikes with cruise missiles and drones against Ukraine's power grid and other vital infrastructure. The latest massive attack on Christmas morning involving 78 missiles and 106 drones struck power facilities and prompted Ukrainians to take shelter in metro stations on Christmas morning, Ukraine’s air force said. It claimed to have intercepted 59 missiles and 54 drones and jammed 52 other drones. On Thursday, Russia again attacked Ukraine with 31 exploding drones, 20 of which were shot down and another 11 didn’t reach their target due to jamming, the Ukrainian air force said. As part of the daily barrage, Russian forces also struck a central market in Nikopol in the Dnipropetrovsk region with a drone on Thursday, wounding eight people, according to local authorities. Ukraine struck back with drone strikes of its own. Ukraine’s Center for Strategic Communications said Thursday that the country's military has struck a plant in Kamensk-Shakhtynsky in Russia’s southern Rostov region that produces propellant for ballistic missiles. 'This strike is part of a comprehensive campaign to weaken the capabilities of the Russian armed forces to carry out terrorist attacks against Ukrainian civilians,' it said in a statement.	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-north-korea-fe2506b30c4289a19a41c332f3dbe49c	2024-12-26T07:24:17-08:00	
Five facts about electric vehicles in 2024	DETROIT (AP) — Electric vehicles had another whirlwind year around the globe, driven by buyers in China, and growth in parts of Europe and the United States, despite headwinds. In a milestone for China, the world's biggest auto market, EVs hit 50% of new car sales in July. That included pure battery EVs plus plug-in hybrid electric vehicles. Chinese companies such as BYD continue to gain traction worldwide with their inexpensive EVs. Electric vehicles also made headway in Europe and the U.S. Uncertainty around purchase subsidies could complicate matters come 2025, especially under the incoming Trump administration in the U.S. But mainstream consumers remain interested in new models, longer driving ranges, better performance and lower prices. The transition to electric vehicles is an important part of the shift to clean energy. Road transport accounts for around one-sixth of all global emissions from energy, according to the International Energy Agency. Widespread EV adoption could significantly address climate change. Here are five facts about EVs this year. Most of the data comes from consultancy Rho Motion. How well did electric vehicles sell? The global EV market, including pure EVs and plug-in hybrids, grew by 25% year-over-year as of November. Rho Motion estimates 15.2 million EVs had been sold worldwide ahead of the end of the year, and the International Energy Agency expected electrified vehicle sales to reach one in five cars sold globally. Most were in China. Where did the EV share of new cars jump the most? Mexico sold roughly 5 times as many EVs this year than last, mostly from Chinese powerhouse automaker BYD, according to Rho Motion. Because China's population is so much larger, its 40% growth year-to-date translates to many more EVs than Mexico's fivefold increase. Other areas of note are the United Kingdom, which saw a roughly 17% increase year-to-date. That's interesting to compare to France and Germany, which saw sales decline. In Turkey, the EV market grew by almost 50% year-to-date, driven by Tesla entering the market last year and Togg, a Turkish auto company, ramping up its sales. In Norway, which for years has been in first place for share of vehicles that are electric, 90% of new cars were EVs. What was the best-selling electric vehicle globally? In the United States? The best-selling pure electric vehicles were the Tesla Model Y, followed by the Tesla Model 3 — both globally and in the U.S., according to Rho Motion. The Model Y SUV was released in 2020. Its base version today costs nearly $45,000. The Model 3 was released in 2017. The least expensive version sells for around $42,000. Both have been eligible for a $7,500 tax credit in the U.S. Tesla picture changing? Tesla's market share stood at 17% of all electric cars across the globe through October, according to Rho Motion. In the U.S., Tesla's market share was 49% through October. That means the company still has the biggest EV market share. But its hold is shrinking as other auto companies combined sell a growing number of electrics. For example, GM, Ford, Honda and more are offering a wider variety of EVs at lower prices and sizes and are chipping away at Tesla's longstanding lead. Tesla remains the most valuable auto company in the world, with a market value of $1.4 trillion. ___ Alexa St. John is an Associated Press climate solutions reporter. Follow her on X: @alexa_stjohn.

Middle East latest: Israel bombs Yemen's main airport and key infrastructure	Houthi rebels in Yemen say Israeli airstrikes on Thursday targeted the rebel-held capital of Sanaa and the port city of Hodeida. The Israeli military said it attacked infrastructure used by the Houthis at the international airport in Sanaa, power stations and ports. The strikes on Thursday follow several days of Houthi launches setting off sirens in Israel, and last week, Israeli jets bombed Sanaa and Hodeida, killing nine people. The Houthis have also been targeting shipping in the Red Sea corridor, calling it solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza. In the Gaza Strip, an Israeli strike killed five Palestinian journalists in a van with press markings outside a hospital in a refugee camp, the Health Ministry said Thursday. Israel's military said it targeted a group of militants allied with Hamas, which ignited the war with its Oct. 7, 2023, attack in southern Israel. Israel's bombardment and ground invasion in Gaza has killed over 45,000 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and civilians in its count. Hamas’s attack on southern Israel in October 2023 resulted in the deaths of about 1,200 people, while 250 others were taken hostage by Palestinian militants. Around 100 hostages are still being held in Gaza, although only two-thirds are believed to still be alive. Here’s the latest: Israel strikes Houthi rebels in Yemen’s capital and ports JERUSALEM — Houthi rebels in Yemen said Israeli airstrikes on Thursday targeted the rebel-held capital of Sanaa and the port city of Hodeida, following several days of Houthi launches that set off air-raid sirens in Israel. The Israeli military said it attacked infrastructure used by the Houthis at the international airport in Sanaa and ports at Hodeida, Al-Salif and Ras Qantib along with power stations. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a speech on Wednesday that 'the Houthis, too, will learn what Hamas and Hezbollah and Assad’s regime and others learned.' The Iran-backed Houthis’ media outlet reported the strikes in a Telegram post, but gave no immediate details. The U.S. military also has targeted the Houthis in Yemen in recent days. The United Nations has noted that the ports are important entryways for humanitarian aid. Over the weekend, 16 people were wounded when a Houthi missile hit a playground in Tel Aviv. Last week, Israeli jets struck Sanaa and Hodeida, killing nine people, calling it a response to previous Houthi attacks. The Houthis also have been targeting shipping on the Red Sea corridor, calling it solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza. Kurdish-led group holds funeral for 6 fighters killed in northeast Syria fighting QAMISHLI, Syria — Thousands of people in northeastern Syria attended a funeral Thursday for six fighters from a Kurdish-led, U.S.-backed force who were killed in ongoing clashes with Turkish-backed militias. The Turkish-backed groups are launching attacks to take the Arab cities west of the Euphrates River that are under the control of the Kurdish group . The Turkish-supported groups helped overthrow Bashar al-Assad’s rule of Syria, and have since kept pushing eastward against the Kurdish groups. 'We thought that Syria today has entered a new stage after the fall and escape of Assad. We thought that we got rid of all of this, but this attack on us changed everything and those who came in are taking orders from Turkey,' said Nihayet Hassan, the uncle of a killed fighter. The fighters were killed during attacks on Tishreen Dam near the strategic city of Manbij in recent days. The bodies were returned to the city of Qamishli in northeastern Syria where the U.S.-backed group, known as the Syrian Democratic Forces, has a strong presence. Ankara sees the SDF as an affiliate of its sworn enemy, the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, which Turkey classifies as a terrorist organization. Turkish-backed armed groups backed by Turkish jets have for years attacked positions where the SDF are present across northern Syria, in a bid to create a buffer zone free from the group along the Turkish border. 'It is obvious that Turkey’s issue is with the Kurds. It is not about an organization, or the PKK, no, their target are the Kurds,' said Ahmad Ammo, a Qamishli resident who attended the funeral. The U.S. has about 2,000 soldiers in eastern Syria to help fight the Islamic State group and protect critical oil fields there. Lebanese military says Israel violated ceasefire agreement by entering southern Lebanon BEIRUT — The Lebanese military said Thursday that Israeli troops encroached on areas of southern Lebanon, violating a ceasefire agreement that ended the war between Israel and the Hezbollah group. The U.S.-brokered ceasefire that went into effect a month ago called for Hezbollah militants and Israeli troops to leave southern Lebanon over a 60-day period as Lebanese army soldiers gradually deploy in the country south of the Litani River. The Israeli military did not immediately comment on the reported incident. Meanwhile, Lebanon’s state-run National News Agency said Israeli bulldozers are setting up dirt barricades that would close off the road between Wadi Slouqi and Wadi Hujeir. Lebanon’s military said it brought reinforcements into the areas entered by Israeli troops. NNA said the United Nations peacekeeping mission in Lebanon, known as UNIFIL, sent a patrol unit to an area near the southern town of Qantara where Israeli forces are present. UNIFIL in a statement expressed its 'concern at continuing destruction by the IDF (Israeli military) in residential areas, agricultural land, and road networks in south Lebanon.' Lebanese army chief Gen. Joseph Aoun traveled to Saudi Arabia earlier Thursday as part of ongoing efforts by the cash-strapped military to find financial support to deploy in larger numbers. The Lebanese military and government have complained about Israeli strikes and overflights in the country to a new monitoring committee headed by the U.S. that also includes France. Israeli strike kills five Palestinian journalists, Gaza Health Ministry says DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — An Israeli strike killed five Palestinian journalists outside a hospital in the Gaza Strip overnight, the Health Ministry said Thursday. The Israeli army said it had targeted a group of militants. The strike hit a car outside the Al-Awda Hospital in the built-up Nuseirat refugee camp in the central part of the territory. The journalists were working for the local news outlet Al-Quds Today, a television channel affiliated with the Islamic Jihad militant group. The military said it targeted a group of fighters from Islamic Jihad, a militant group allied with Hamas, whose Oct. 7, 2023, attack into southern Israel ignited the war. Associated Press video showed the incinerated shell of a van, with press markings still visible on the back doors.

China pledges 2 more shipments of aid to Gaza BEIJING — China has pledged two more shipments of humanitarian aid to Gaza, in an indication of support for the Palestinian Authority, state media reported Thursday. The agreement was overseen in Cairo by Chinese Ambassador to Egypt Liao Liqiang and Palestinian Ambassador to Egypt Diab al-Louh. 'To ease the humanitarian conditions in the Gaza Strip, the Chinese government has continued to provide assistance to Palestine,' Liao was quoted as saying. The types and quantities of aid to be delivered via Egypt were not given, but China has previously shipped food and medicine to Gaza. China has longstanding ties with the Palestinian Authority but has also sought to strengthen economic and political relations with Israel. Al-Louh 'voiced appreciation for China’s consistent and firm support for the just cause of the Palestinian people and for raising this issue on international occasions,' state media said. UN Security Council to hold emergency meeting on Houthi attacks UNITED NATIONS — The U.N. Security Council will hold an emergency meeting on Monday at Israel’s request to discuss recent attacks by Yemen’s Houthi rebels. Israel’s U.N. Mission said Wednesday the meeting will take place at 10 a.m. Monday. Israeli U.N. Ambassador Danny Danon said he expects the council will condemn the Houthi attacks. He urged the council 'to enforce international law and hold Iran, the Houthis’ patron, accountable.' Alluding to Israeli retaliation for the attacks, Danon said 'It seems that the Houthis have not yet understood what happens to those who try to harm the state of Israel.'	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-syria-lebanon-news-26-december-2024-99eeb805d4350e14cb82c6da989f912a	2024-12-26T04:27:53-08:00	
Turkey's central bank lowers key interest rate to 47.5%	ANKARA, Turkey (AP) — Turkey’s central bank lowered its key interest rate by 2.5 percentage points to 47.5% on Thursday, carrying out its first rate cut in nearly two years as it tries to control soaring inflation. Citing slowing inflation, the bank’s Monetary Policy Committee said it was reducing its one-week repo rate to 47.5% from the current 50%. The committee said in a statement that the overall inflation trend was 'flat' in November and that indicators suggest it is likely to decline in December. Demand within the country was slowing, helping to reduce inflation, it said. Inflation in Turkey surged in recent years due to declining foreign reserves and President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s unconventional economic policy of lowering rates as a way to tame inflation — which he later abandoned. Inflation stood at 47% in November, after having peaked at 85% in late 2022, although independent economists say the real rate is much higher than the official figures. Most economists argue that higher interest rates help control inflation, but the Turkish leader had fired central bank governors for failing to fall in line with his previous rate-cutting policies. Following a return to more conventional policies under a new economic team, the central bank raised interest rates from 8.5% to 50% between May 2023 and March 2024. The bank had kept rates steady at 50% until Thursday's rate cut. The high inflation has left many households struggling to afford basic goods, such as food and housing.	https://apnews.com/article/turkey-central-bank-interest-rate-cut-ca1b3732bd09724cc50ae688711f24a3	2024-12-26T03:12:19-08:00	
Finland stops Russia-linked vessel over damaged undersea power cable in Baltic Sea	FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — Finnish authorities have detained a Russia-linked ship as they investigate whether it damaged a Baltic Sea power cable and several data cables, according to police and news media reports, in the latest incident involving disruption of key infrastructure. Finnish police and border guards boarded the vessel, the Eagle S, early Thursday and took over the command bridge, Helsinki Police Chief Jari Liukku said at a news conference. The vessel was being held in Finnish territorial waters, police said. The Eagle S is flagged in the Cook Islands, but was described by Finnish customs officials as a suspected part of Russia's shadow fleet of fuel tankers, Yle television reported. Those are aging vessels with obscure ownership, acquired to evade Western sanctions amid the war in Ukraine and operating without Western-regulated insurance. The Eagle S anchor is suspected of causing damage to the cable, Yle reported, relying on police statements. The Estlink-2 power cable, which brings electricity from Finland to Estonia across the Baltic Sea, went down on Wednesday. The incident follows damage to two data cables and the Nord Stream gas pipelines, both of which have been termed sabotage. Estonia's government was holding a extraordinary meeting on the issue Thursday, Prime Minister Kristen Michal said on X. Latvian Prime Minister Evika Silina said she was in close touch with Michal and Finnish Prime Minister Petteri Orpo. 'Our armed forces have strengthened surveillance and are monitoring the situation,' she said on X. 'The Baltic states currently have sufficient energy production capacity, although we are challenged by the Baltic Sea cable incidents.' Two data cables — one running between Finland and Germany and the other between Lithuania and Sweden — were severed in November. Germany’s defense minister said that officials had to assume the incident was 'sabotage,' but he didn't provide evidence or say who might have been responsible. The remark came during a speech in which he discussed hybrid warfare threats from Russia. The Nord Stream pipelines that once brought natural gas from Russia to Germany were damaged by underwater explosions in September 2022. Authorities have said the cause was sabotage and launched criminal investigations. Estonian network operator Elering says there was enough spare capacity to meet power needs on the Estonian side, public broadcaster ERR said on its website.	https://apnews.com/article/eu-finland-estonia-baltic-sea-power-cable-6741ef1ce9130602abac6214d7297717	2024-12-26T03:01:50-08:00	
What is known about a plane crash in Kazakhstan that killed 38 of 67 people on board	An Azerbaijani airliner has crashed in Kazakhstan after being diverted, killing 38 of 67 people on board. Some experts alleged that the plane went down after being hit by Russian air defense systems. Some things to know about the crash and the speculation about a possible cause: How did the plane crash? Azerbaijan Airlines’ Embraer 190 was en route from Azerbaijani capital Baku to the Russian city of Grozny in the North Caucasus on Wednesday when it was diverted for reasons that aren't fully clear yet. It crashed while making an attempt to land in Aktau, Kazakhstan, after flying east across the Caspian Sea. The plane went down near the coast about 3 kilometers (around 2 miles) from Aktau. Cellphone footage circulating online appeared to show the aircraft making a steep descent before hitting the ground and exploding in a fireball. Rescuers have rushed 29 people who survived the crash to hospitals. How did Azerbaijan react? Azerbaijan observed a nationwide day of mourning on Thursday. National flags were lowered across the country, traffic across the country stopped at noon, and signals were sounded from ships and trains. Speaking at a news conference Wednesday, Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev said that the weather had forced the plane to change from its planned course. What do they say about a possible cause? Kazakhstani, Azerbaijani and Russian authorities say they are investigating the crash. Embraer told The Associated Press in a statement that the company is 'ready to assist all relevant authorities.' Russia’s civil aviation authority, Rosaviatsia, said that preliminary information indicated that the pilots diverted to Aktau after a bird strike led to an emergency on board. Some experts alleged that the holes seen in the plane’s tail section pictured after the crash possibly indicate that it could have come under fire from Russian air defense systems fending off a Ukrainian drone attack. Mark Zee of OPSGroup, which monitors the world’s airspace and airports for risks, said that the analysis of the fragments of the crashed plane indicate with a 90-99% probability that it was hit by a surface-to-air missile Osprey Flight Solutions, an aviation security firm based in the United Kingdom, warned its clients that the 'Azerbaijan Airlines flight was likely shot down by a Russian military air-defense system.' Osprey CEO Andrew Nicholson said that the company had issued more than 200 alerts regarding drone attacks and air defense systems in Russia during the war. In Azerbaijan, Caliber online newpspaper claimed that the airliner was fired upon by a Russian Pantsyr-S air defense system as it was approaching Grozny. It questioned why Russian authorities failed to close the airport despite the drone attack in the area on Wednesday, and why they didn’t allow the plane to land in Grozny or other Russian airports nearby after it was hit. Asked Thursday about the claims that the plane had been fired upon by air defense assets, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters that 'it would be wrong to make hypotheses before investigators make their verdict.' Officials in Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan have similarly avoided comment on a possible cause of the crash, saying it will be up to investigators to determine it.	https://apnews.com/article/things-to-know-about-azerbaijan-airlines-crash-1e3ca32f895b577755b5776806e1eda7	2024-12-26T02:35:16-08:00	
Azerbaijan mourns air crash victims as some experts say Russia air defense damaged the plane	Azerbaijan on Thursday observed a nationwide day of mourning for the victims of the plane crash that killed 38 people and left all 29 survivors injured as speculation mounted about a possible cause of the disaster, with some experts saying that the airliner was damaged by Russian air defense fire. Azerbaijan Airlines' Embraer 190 was en route from Azerbaijan's capital of Baku to the Russian city of Grozny in the North Caucasus on Wednesday when it was diverted for reasons yet unclear and crashed while making an attempt to land in Aktau in Kazakhstan after flying east across the Caspian Sea. The plane went down about 3 kilometers (around 2 miles) from Aktau. Cellphone footage circulating online appeared to show the aircraft making a steep descent before smashing into the ground in a fireball. Other footage showed part of its fuselage ripped away from the wings and the rest of the aircraft lying upside down in the grass. As the official crash investigation started, theories abounded about a possible cause, with some experts alleging that holes seen in the plane’s tail section possibly indicate that it could have come under fire from Russian air defense systems fending off a Ukrainian drone attack. Ukrainian drones had previously attacked Grozny, the provincial capital of the Russian republic of Chechnya, and other regions in the country’s North Caucasus. An official in Chechnya said another drone attack on the region was fended off on Wednesday, although federal authorities didn't report it. On Thursday, national flags were lowered across Azerbaijan, traffic across the country stopped at noon, and signals sounded from ships and trains as the country observed a nationwide moment of silence. Speaking at a news conference Wednesday, Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev said that it was too soon to speculate on the reasons behind the crash, but said that the weather had forced the plane to change from its planned course. 'The information provided to me is that the plane changed its course between Baku and Grozny due to worsening weather conditions and headed to Aktau airport, where it crashed upon landing,' he said. Russia’s civil aviation authority, Rosaviatsia, said that preliminary information indicated that the pilots diverted to Aktau after a bird strike led to an emergency on board. According to Kazakh officials, those aboard the plane included 42 Azerbaijani citizens, 16 Russian nationals, six Kazakhs and three Kyrgyzstan nationals. Russia's Emergencies Ministry on Thursday flew nine Russian survivors to Moscow for treatment. Mark Zee of OPSGroup, which monitors the world’s airspace and airports for risks, said that the analysis of the images of fragments of the crashed plane indicate that it was almost certainly hit by a surface-to-air missile, or SAM. 'Much more to investigate, but at high level we'd put the probability of it being a SAM attack on the aircraft at being well into the 90-99% bracket,' he said. Osprey Flight Solutions, an aviation security firm based in the United Kingdom, warned its clients that the 'Azerbaijan Airlines flight was likely shot down by a Russian military air-defense system.' Osprey provides analysis for carriers still flying into Russia after Western airlines halted their flights during the war. Osprey CEO Andrew Nicholson said that the company had issued more than 200 alerts regarding drone attacks and air defense systems in Russia during the war. 'This incident is a stark reminder of why we do what we do,' Nicholson wrote online. 'It is painful to know that despite our efforts, lives were lost in a way that could have been avoided.' Caliber, an Azerbaijani news website, claimed that the airliner was fired upon by a Russian Pantsyr-S air defense system as it was approaching Grozny. It questioned why Russian authorities failed to close the airport despite the apparent drone raid in the area. Khamzat Kadyrov, head of Chechnya's Security Council, said that air defenses downed drones attacking the region on Wednesday. Caliber also asked why Russian authorities didn't allow the plane to make an emergency landing in Grozny or other Russian airports nearby after it was hit. Asked about the claims that the plane had been fired upon by air defense assets, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters that 'it would be wrong to make hypotheses before investigators make their verdict.' Kazakhstan’s parliamentary Speaker Maulen Ashimbayev also warned against rushing to conclusions based on pictures of the plane’s fragments, describing the allegations of air defense fire as unfounded and 'unethical.' Other officials in Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan have similarly avoided comment on a possible cause of the crash, saying it will be up to investigators to determine it. ___ Jon Gambrell in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, and Aida Sultanova in London, contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/azerbaijan-airliner-crash-aktau-kazakstan-embraer-872800d95273ee96e0950192a32e5228	2024-12-26T00:43:12-08:00	
Pope brings Holy Year and prayers for better future to Rome prison, a 'cathedral of pain and hope'	ROME (AP) — Pope Francis inaugurated his Holy Year at Rome’s main prison on Thursday, bringing a message of hope to inmates and involving them in the Catholic Church’s once every quarter-century celebration that is expected to bring about 32 million pilgrims to Rome. Francis stood up from his wheelchair, knocked on the door to the chapel at Rebibbia prison and walked across the threshold, reenacting the gesture he performed at the Holy Door of St. Peter’s Basilica two nights earlier on Christmas Eve. The opening of the Holy Door at the basilica officially kicked off the Jubilee year, a church tradition dating to 1300 that nowadays occurs every 25 years and involves the faithful coming to Rome on pilgrimages. 'The first Holy Door I opened at Christmas in St. Peter's. I wanted the second one to be here, in a prison,' Francis told the Rebibbia inmates before he entered. 'I wanted each of us here, inside and out, to have the possibility of throwing open the door of our hearts and understanding that hope doesn't disappoint.' Francis dedicated the 2025 Jubilee to hope and made clear that prisoners would be an important part of it: The final grand event of the Jubilee is a special Mass for inmates at St. Peter's on Dec. 14, 2025. Francis has long made prison ministry an important part of his priestly vocation and has made several visits to Rebibbia since becoming pope in 2013 while also including prison visits in many of his foreign trips. His message is always one of hope, believing that people who are serving prison sentences need something to look forward to more than most. That is especially true in Italy, where prison overcrowding and inmate suicides are at record highs, according to the Antigone Association, which tracks prison conditions. According to Antigone's 2024 report, 88 prisoners killed themselves in Italian lockups this year — more than any other year — and Italy's inmate population was 132% over the system's capacity. In a statement Thursday, Antigone called on Italian authorities to hear Francis' appeal to give prisoners hope. It called for structural reforms that put into practice the constitutional principles of 'a punishment that is dignified, humane and looks to the social reintegration of those who are in prison.' In his homily, Francis suggested the prisoners think of hope as an anchor that is fixed on the ground and that they try to hold tight to the rope that is attached to it, even if it sometimes hurts their hands. 'Hold onto the rope of hope, hold onto the anchor,' Francis said. 'Never let it go.' Speaking to reporters outside, Francis recalled that whenever he speaks to prisoners, the first thing he always asks himself is 'why them and not me.' 'Because we all can fall, the important thing is to not lose hope, to hold onto that anchor of hope,' he said. Back at the Vatican for his noon blessing, Francis called prison 'a cathedral of pain and hope' as he repeated his message. He also doubled down on his 2025 wish for peace in the world and for wealthy countries to reduce or eliminate the debt owed by poorer countries. 'One of the things that characterizes Jubilees is the remission of debts,' Francis said, calling the debts owed by many poor countries simply 'unsustainable.' Francis’ outing to Rebibbia on a frigid morning was his final big event of the week after he celebrated Christmas Eve Mass on Tuesday evening at St. Peter’s Basilica and delivered his Christmas Day blessing from the loggia overlooking the square. The 88-year-old pope, who often suffers from respiratory infections in winter, has a few days to rest before gearing up for the New Year’s Eve vigil and Mass the following day. With the St. Peter’s Holy Door now open to the public, a steady stream of pilgrims was filing into the basilica, a pace that is expected to continue through next year until the door closes on Jan. 6, 2026. Francis’ 2025 involves a dizzying calendar of Jubilee events that will sorely test his stamina, with special Jubilee Masses for all the main groups of pilgrims who are being celebrated during the year: Adolescents, migrants, teachers and law enforcement, among others. So far, he has only one foreign trip under study: A May visit to Turkey to commemorate the 1,700th anniversary of the Council of Nicaea, Christianity’s first ecumenical council. ___ Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

Chinese automaker BYD slams reports of poor conditions at a factory site in Brazil	BANGKOK (AP) — A spokesperson for Chinese automaker BYD has objected to reports about poor conditions at a construction site in Brazil where it is building a factory, saying the allegations were aimed at 'smearing' China and Chinese brands. Earlier in the week, a task force led by Brazilian prosecutors said it had rescued 163 Chinese nationals it said were working in 'slavery-like' conditions at the site. A video from the Labor Prosecutor’s Office of dorms housing the workers showed beds with no mattresses and rudimentary cooking facilities. A BYD spokesperson, Li Yunfei, vehemently objected in a statement posted Thursday on his Weibo social media site. 'In the matter of smearing Chinese brands, smearing China, and attempting to undermine the friendship between China and Brazil, we have seen how relevant foreign forces maliciously associate and deliberately smear,' it said, also criticizing media reports about the situation. BYD, which stands for Build Your Dreams, is one of the world’s largest producers of electric cars. The company said on Monday night that it would 'immediately terminate the contract' with a contractor building the factory, the Jinjiang Group, and was 'studying other appropriate measures.' BYD said that the Jinjiang workers would be housed in nearby hotels for the time being, and would not suffer from the decision to stop work at the site. The company said that over the past few weeks it had been changing working conditions at the construction site and had told its contractors that 'adjustments' had to be made. Prosecutors said the sanitary situation at BYD’s site was especially bad, with only one toilet for every 31 workers, forcing them to wake up at 4 a.m. to line up to be ready to leave for work at 5:30 a.m. Under Brazilian law, slavery-like conditions are characterized by submission to forced labor or exhausting working hours, subjection to degrading working conditions and restriction of the worker’s freedom of movement. Jinjiang Construction Brazil, based in Camacari, said in a statement that it had been 'frequently and intensively inspected by the local labor department in Brazil.' It said that due to cultural differences, problems with translation and understanding, 'much of the information released by the labor department was inaccurate, especially statements saying the Jinjiang workers were ‘enslaved’ and ‘rescued,’ which is completely inconsistent with the facts.' It said its workers were willing to speak with media about the situation. Apart from living conditions for the workers, Brazilian officials said Jinjiang Construction Brazil had confiscated their passports and withheld 60% of their wages. Those who quit would be forced to pay the company for their airfare from China, and for their return ticket, the labor office said in a statement. Living conditions for migrant construction workers can be quite spartan in many parts of the developing world, and such labor often involves contracts that require workers to pay back large sums of money used to secure the jobs, despite laws prohibiting such arrangements. ___ AP researcher Yu Bing contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/china-brazil-byd-labor-autos-e45ed5a620896b321388361bf92f77c7	2024-12-25T22:46:04-08:00	
South Korean opposition submits motion to impeach the country's acting president as strife deepens	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea’s main opposition party submitted a motion on Thursday to impeach the country’s acting leader over his reluctance to fill three Constitutional Court vacancies ahead of the court’s review of rebellion charges against impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol stemming from his short-lived martial law decree on Dec. 3. The court appointments have stalled amid an intensifying dispute between the liberal opposition and Yoon’s conservative party, and the potential impeachment of Prime Minister Han Duck-soo may deepen the political paralysis that has halted high-level diplomacy and rattled financial markets. The opposition-controlled National Assembly also passed motions calling for the appointment of three Constitutional Court justices as the court prepares to start deliberations on whether to dismiss or reinstate Yoon. The vote came shortly after Han reiterated in a televised statement that he wouldn’t appoint the justices without bipartisan consent. National Assembly Speaker Woo Won Shik urged Han to swiftly appoint the justices, saying that his calls for bipartisan consent essentially amounted to a refusal and 'infringes on the National Assembly’s right to select Constitutional Court justices.' Yoon’s People Power Party, whose members mostly boycotted the National Assembly vote, argued that Han shouldn’t exercise presidential authority to appoint the proposed justices while Yoon has yet to be formally removed from office. The main opposition Democratic Party has accused the conservatives of undermining the court process to save Yoon’s presidency, and its motion to impeach Han could go to a floor vote as early as Friday. The Democrats’ floor leader, Park Chan-dae, said Han’s comments showed 'he lacks both the qualifications to serve as the acting leader and the will to uphold the Constitution.' Yoon’s presidential powers were suspended after the National Assembly voted to impeach him on Dec. 14 over an attempted power grab that lasted only hours but has triggered weeks of political turmoil that has shaken one of Asia’s most robust democracies. To formally end Yoon’s presidency, at least six justices on the nine-member Constitutional Court must vote in favor. Three seats remain vacant following retirements and a full bench could make conviction more likely. The court, which is to hold a pretrial hearing in Yoon’s case on Friday, has said it believes the acting president can exercise the right to appoint justices. Three of the court’s nine justices are directly appointed by the president. Three are nominated by the head of the Supreme Court and three by the National Assembly, and they are then formally appointed by the president in what is widely considered a procedural matter. The three seats that are currently open are to be nominated by lawmakers. South Korea’s Constitution states that the National Assembly 'selects' three spots on the court rather than recommends, suggesting that the presidential appointments for these spots are a formality rather than a substantive authority, according to some legal experts. 'The consistent spirit reflected in our Constitution and laws is that an acting president should focus on maintaining stability in governance to help the country overcome crisis while refraining from exercising significant powers exclusive to the president, including appointments to constitutional institutions,' Han said. 'I will withhold the appointment of Constitutional Court justices until the ruling and opposition parties submit an agreed-upon proposal.' Han has also clashed with the Democrats over his vetoes of bills calling for independent investigations of Yoon and corruption allegations involving his wife, Kim Keon Hee. If Han is impeached, Choi Sang-mok, the country’s deputy prime minister and finance minister, is next in line. The impeachment vote against Han could face legal ambiguities. Most South Korean officials can be impeached with a simple majority of the National Assembly, but impeaching presidents requires two-thirds. The rival parties differ on which standard should apply to an acting president. The Democratic Party controls 170 of the National Assembly’s 300 seats, so it would need support from members of other parties including Yoon’s own to get a two-thirds majority. While focusing on defending himself in the Constitutional Court, Yoon has dodged several requests by law enforcement authorities to appear for questioning over rebellion charges and also blocked searches of his office. Authorities have already arrested Yoon’s defense minister, police chief and several other military commanders involved in the attempt to implement martial law, which harkened back to the days of authoritarian leaders the country hasn’t seen since the 1980s. In a news conference in Seoul, Yoo Seung Soo, lawyer for former Defense Minister Kim Yong Hyun, repeated Yoon’s claim that his martial law decree was to 'sound alarm against ... political abuse' by an opposition that has bogged down his agenda, and did not amount to a rebellion.	https://apnews.com/article/korea-yoon-martial-law-han-constitutional-court-f473b8a613a87732ee03ac37c39c79f0	2024-12-25T21:55:02-08:00	
Israeli strike kills 5 Palestinian journalists in Gaza, officials say	DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — An Israeli strike killed five Palestinian journalists outside a hospital in the Gaza Strip overnight, the Health Ministry said early Thursday. The Israeli military said it had targeted a group of militants. The strike hit a car outside the Al-Awda Hospital in the built-up Nuseirat refugee camp in the central part of the territory. The journalists were working for the local Quds News Network, which also reported the strike. The military said it targeted a group of fighters from Islamic Jihad, a militant group allied with Hamas, whose Oct. 7, 2023 attack into southern Israel ignited the war. The Committee to Protect Journalists says over 130 Palestinian reporters have been killed since the start of the war. Israel has not allowed foreign reporters to enter Gaza except on military embeds. The war began when Hamas-led militants stormed across the border in a surprise attack on nearby army bases and farming communities. They killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted around 250. Some 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, at least a third of whom are believed to be dead. Israel's air and ground offensive has killed over 45,000 Palestinians, according to the Health Ministry. It says more than half the fatalities have been women and children but does not say how many of the dead were fighters. The offensive has caused widespread destruction and driven around 90% of the population of 2.3 million from their. homes. Hundreds of thousands are packed into squalid tent camps along the coast, with little protection from the cold, wet winter. ___ Follow AP’s war coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war	https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-lebanon-hezbollah-iran-news-12-26-2024-2e8c33648410c2da94ae7d0d73c0b1a1	2024-12-25T21:34:41-08:00	
Japan Airlines was hit by a cyberattack, delaying flights during the year-end holiday season	TOKYO (AP) — Japan Airlines said it was hit by a cyberattack Thursday, causing delays to more than 20 domestic flights but the carrier said it was able to stop the onslaught and restore its systems hours later. There was no impact on flight safety, it said. JAL said the problem started Thursday morning when the company's network connecting internal and external systems began malfunctioning. The airline said it was able to identify the cause as an attack intended to overwhelm the network system with massive transmissions of data. Such attacks flood a system or network with traffic until the target cannot respond or crashes. The attack did not involve a virus or cause any customer data leaks, JAL said. It said that as of late morning, the cyberattack had delayed 24 domestic flights for more than 30 minutes. Experts have repeatedly raised concerns about the vulnerability of Japan's cybersecurity, especially as the country steps up its defense capabilities and works more closely with the United States and other partners with much tighter cyber defenses. Japan has taken steps but experts say more work is needed. In June, Japan's space agency said it had suffered a series of cyberattacks since 2023, though sensitive information related to rockets, satellites and defense was not affected. It was investigating to take preventive measures. Last year, a cyberattack paralyzed operations at a container terminal at a port in the city of Nagoya for three days. JAL's ticket sales for both domestic and international fights scheduled for departure on Thursday were suspended temporarily but resumed several hours later. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi told a regular news conference Thursday that the transport ministry told JAL to hasten efforts to restore the system and to accommodate affected passengers. Other Japanese airlines, including ANA Holdings, Skymark and Starflyer, were not affected. Television footage showed many passengers at Tokyo's Haneda airport crowded into its terminals as the attack hit the year-end holiday travel season. Offices will close from this weekend for the New Year holidays, the biggest celebration of the year, when millions of people travel back to their hometowns from the cities.	https://apnews.com/article/japan-jal-cyberattack-flights-travel-04fbd4848f3015a77057339a5c90ca32	2024-12-25T20:17:53-08:00	
Israel's plan to double the number of settlers in the Golan Heights is met with conflicting emotions	EIN ZIVAN, Golan Heights (AP) — A dry mountain wind whipped through a cluster of Israeli flags at the entrance of a kibbutz in the Israeli-annexed Golan Heights, where the tranquility belies the tumultuous events unfolding nearby. Earlier this month, Syrian President Bashar Assad was ousted after nearly 25 years in power. Within hours, Israeli tanks rolled past a razor wire-reinforced fence into the Golan's demilitarized buffer zone in Syria, created as part of a 1974 ceasefire between the countries. Israel said it was a temporary move to secure its border. Days later, the Israeli government approved Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s $11 million plan of financial incentives to double the population of Israeli settlers in the Golan Heights, which Israel seized from Syria in the 1967 Mideast war. Israel will 'continue to hold onto it, make it flourish and settle it,' Netanyahu said. The international community, with one exception, considers the Golan to be occupied Syrian territory, while the United Nations lists Israeli settlements there as illegal. In 2019, the United States became the only country to recognize Israel’s 1981 annexation. About 50,000 people currently live there, roughly half of them Israeli settlers and the other half Arab Druze, a religious minority spread among Syria, Lebanon, Israel and the Golan Heights. In the towns and kibbutzim of the Golan, news of the plan to increase the number of settlers was met with a mixture of skepticism, excitement and shock. Too much growth, too fast? Paul Hecht, who at 42 has lived in the Golan nearly all his life, greeted the news with 'mixed emotions, to be honest, because I love the Golan Heights the way it is. I'm kind of afraid that the place will be overpopulated but at the same time, of course, I want the place to advance.' The attraction is the rural way of life, the open spaces and the mountains, he explained. Doubling the population 'sounds a bit extreme,' especially if attempted in a short time frame, he said, noting the region needs infrastructure improvements — notably to roads — for its existing population before more people are brought in. The Golan's economy relies heavily on farming and the hospitality industry. Previous government attempts to attract more settlers have had little success — in large part because of a lack of job opportunities and the long distance from major cities. A well-publicized move in 2019 to name a Golan settlement after then-U.S. President Donald Trump failed to attract a major influx of residents. But Hecht said he believed more Israelis could be tempted by a life in the Golan after Assad's fall. 'I think that will that will bring in a lot more people who want to come and live in the Golan Heights because of the sense of security that people will have here,' he said. 'And obviously the best view and the best nature in Israel.' The dream of a rural lifestyle One such new settler could be Shlomo Benhaim, 60, who has been thinking of moving to the Golan for years. 'It’s my dream. If I will fulfill it, who knows,' he said during a day trip with his wife to Ein Zivan, a kibbutz about two kilometers (1.2 miles) from the Syrian buffer zone. One of the oldest kibbutzim dating from the late 1960s, Ein Zivan has barely 500 residents today. 'I love the Golan. It’s a unique area in Israel, very unique, with a lot of history, archaeology, modern history, a lot of memories,' he said. But moving wouldn’t be easy. The area is popular with mainly Israeli tourists who come for the mountains and outdoor activities, but it's a roughly three-hour drive from urban centers with well-paying jobs like Tel Aviv. On the other hand, there’s also a good education system and no traffic jams. 'There’s a lot of benefit to (life) in the Golan, and also a lot of negative things,' he said. In nearby Kibbutz Merom Golan, hotel manager Shefi Mod said that with tax breaks and cheap land, 'I think the support of the government indeed can help people to come and live here.' Mod first came to the area as a soldier decades ago and liked it so much he moved here. But whether others will be tempted to follow suit is still unclear. Concern among the Druze Many Golan Heights Druze consider themselves Syrians under occupation. While Israeli citizenship is open to them, most have not taken it and have Israeli residency permits instead. They have a complicated relationship with Israel. 'Whatever this government wants to do, it won’t ask our permission,' said Khaled Elshaer, a restaurant owner in the Druze village of Masada. The plan to double the number of settlers left him 'numb and shocked,' he said. He considers the Golan to be Syrian. But asked if he wanted it to be a part of Syria, he said no. 'I feel Golani. Neither Israeli nor Syrian,' he said. 'We are connected to the land, not to who will be president over it.' Local surgeon Ali Abu Awad stressed that the Golan Heights are 'an essential part of Syria,' and noted most of the local population with university degrees, including himself, had studied there. He accused the Israeli government of apartheid-like discrimination against religious minorities, including his own, and said there was clear discrimination in access to higher education and preferential treatment to Jewish citizens of Israel. The country's Arab citizens often suffer from discrimination, despite official guarantees of equal civil rights. Abu Awad was dismissive of the government's plan to double the number of settlers. 'They can say what they want,' he said. 'But until now, they have said this before and they have failed.'	https://apnews.com/article/israel-syria-golan-heights-expansion-netanyahu-41341a9598e44afbdad77f1683c2407e	2024-12-25T20:05:03-08:00	
A Syrian family recounts the horrors of the 2013 chemical attack near Damascus	ZAMALKA, Syria (AP) — A Syrian family that survived a 2013 chemical weapons attack that killed hundreds of people near the country’s capital, Damascus, says the ordeal they experienced haunts them to this day. The Aug. 21, 2013 attack targeted several Damascus suburbs, including Zamalka, where the Arbeeni family lives. Government forces of then-President Bashar Assad were blamed for the attack. The Arbeenis remember how they locked themselves inside a windowless room in their home for hours, escaping the fate of dozens of their neighbors who perished in what was one of the deadliest moments of Syria’s civil war. The gas that was used — sarin, an extremely toxic nerve agent — can kill in minutes. The Syrian government denied it was behind the attack and blamed opposition fighters, an accusation the opposition rejected as Assad's forces were the only side in the brutal civil war to posses sarin. The United States subsequently threatened military retaliation, with then-President Barack Obama saying Assad’s use of chemical weapons would be Washington’s 'red line.' 'It was a horrifying night,' Hussein Arbeeni, 41, told The Associated Press on Wednesday. The surface-to-surface missiles fell close to his family’s home without exploding, instead leaking the poisonous gas. Shortly after that, he says the family members had difficulties breathing, their eyes started to ache and they hearts beat faster and faster. Arbeeni, his parents, his siblings and their families, as well as a neighbor — 23 people in all — rushed into the only room in their home without windows and closed the door. He says he taped all around the door, soaked some clothes in water and rolled them up under the door to prevent the gas from coming in. 'I even taped the key hole,' he said. A few months earlier, Arbeeni said, the local first responders of the Syrian Civil Defense, also known as White Helmets, had instructed residents in the opposition-held suburbs of Damascus what to do in case of a chemical attack. He remembers them saying they should cover their nose and mouth with a cloth soaked in water with white vinegar, and breathe through that. They huddled for three hours inside the room — time that seemed endless that night. Outside, many people were dying. 'It is all because of God and this locked room,' Arbeeni says of their survival. Around daybreak, the White Helmets members rushed into their house, found the family inside the room on the ground floor and told them to leave the area immediately. They ran into the street and saw dead bodies lying all around. A passing truck took the family on and gave them a ride. Their neighbor, who had fainted from the shock of the horrific scene, was taken away by paramedics. 'I was scared to look,' said Arbeeni’s mother, Khadija Dabbas, 66. The family stayed for a few weeks some miles away from Zamalka but then came back. Despite Obama's threat, in the end, Washington settled for a deal with Moscow for Russia-backed Assad to give up his chemical weapons’ stockpile. But Assad's government was widely believed to have kept some of the weapons and was accused of using them again — including a 2018 chlorine gas attack over Douma, another Damascus suburb, that killed 43 people. Today, Arbeeni — remembering all the neighbors, friends and townspeople who perished — says he wants the 'harshest punishment' for those behind the attack in Zamalka. 'All those children and innocent people who were killed should get justice,' he said, looking at his 12-year-old son, Laith, a baby at the time of the attack. The new authorities in Syria are led by the jihadi group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, which late last month launched a stunning offensive from its northwestern stronghold that blitzed across large swaths of Syria and toppled Assad. They have vowed to bring to justice former Syrian government officials blamed for atrocities. But times are still unsettled — a few short weeks after Assad's ouster, no one knows what Syria's future will look like. 'The overthrow of the Assad government creates the possibility of justice for thousands of victims of atrocities, including those killed by chemical and other banned weapons,' says Adam Coogle, deputy director with the Middle East and North Africa division at Human Rights Watch. 'But justice will only happen if the new authorities prioritize it and urgently act to preserve evidence,' Coogle added. He urged for immediate access for U.N. agencies and international experts who would create a comprehensive plan to ensure that Syrians can seek justice and accountability. On Wednesday, about a dozen people visited the Martyrs Cemetery in Zamalka and the graves of people from the area killed during Syria's nearly 14-year war. Arbeeni's brother, Hassan, pointed to part of the cemetery that holds a mass grave. There are no names of the dead there, only a sign in Arabic that reads: 'August 2013.' 'The martyrs of the chemical attack are here,' Hassan said, and recited a Muslim prayer for the dead.	https://apnews.com/article/syria-chemical-weapons-attack-ghouta-assad-b16e04b72adbfc86334db1e872adcf6d	2024-12-25T19:54:21-08:00	
A survivor of the worst gang attack on Haitian journalists says colleagues were cut down by bullets	PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) — A survivor of the worst gang attack on Haitian journalists in recent memory described Wednesday seeing colleagues cut down by bullets and reporters with head and chest wounds going an hour or more without help. Two reporters and one police officer died in Tuesday's attack at the reopening of Port-au-Prince's biggest public hospital. Seven journalists covering the event were wounded. 'Some were hit in the chest,' photographer Jean Fregens Regala recalled. 'Some of the journalists had part of their face destroyed, some were shot in the mouth, or the head.' Members of the Viv Ansanm coalition of street gangs, which has taken control of much of Port-au-Prince, had surrounded the hospital and opened fire through a metal gate. The gangs later said they were angry the government had announced the re-opening of the hospital without their permission. Video from inside at the time of the attack shows a metal gate outside the hospital buckling under a hail of gunfire, as reporters scrambled to try to get inside the building. 'All the journalists started moving to go inside the hospital because we heard that the gunfire was getting close to us,' recalled Regala. 'I was hiding behind by the gate to put myself somewhere safe but other journalists were rushing to go inside the hospital and there was non-stop shooting.' Regala survived only because he remained sheltered behind a concrete guardhouse next to the gate. 'If I had rushed and ran, or ran inside the hospital to hide, I am sure I would among the victims.' 'We began calling for help, for just aid, for the victims that were bleeding heavily,' he said. 'There was no doctor or nurse around.' 'While the hospital was about to reopen, it had no medical supplies available for giving first aid to the journalist victims and the other victims,' Regala said, adding that since they couldn't find any gloves they used plastic bags on their hands as substitutes. Nor did the health minister show up. The area is so dangerous that when police finally responded to the journalists' calls for help after about two hours, they had to come in with a ladder over a wall from the nearby National Police because the gangs controlled most of the streets. 'These people spent more than an hour losing blood,' Regala said. The Haitian Association of Journalists issued a statement Tuesday calling on the country's barely functioning government not to put the lives of reporters — or the public — at risk with such events. The association called for 'authorities to act prudently in their rush to make decisions, to avoid exposing to danger the journalists and others who accompany them at their events.' Regala said it was clear as soon as they arrived that the area around the hospital was unsafe. 'The fact that the minister of health invited us, you feel that preparations have been made already,' he said. 'When we made contact with a police unit, the police told us, they were not aware of the event, of the reopening of the hospital.' The government had no immediate response to the complaints. Meanwhile, the seven wounded journalists were taken to another hospital. 'I send my sympathies to the people who were victims, the national police and the journalists,' Haiti’s interim president, Leslie Voltaire, said in an address to the nation Tuesday. Street gangs have taken over an estimated 85% of Port-au-Prince and have also targeted the main international airport and Haiti’s two largest prisons. Johnson 'Izo' André, considered Haiti’s most powerful gang leader and part of the Viv Ansanm group of gangs, posted a video on social media Tuesday claiming responsibility for the attack. The video said the gang coalition had not authorized the hospital’s reopening. Haiti has seen journalists targeted before. In 2023, two local journalists were killed in the space of a couple of weeks — radio reporter Dumesky Kersaint was fatally shot in mid-April that year, while journalist Ricot Jean was found dead later that month. In July, former Prime Minister Garry Conille visited the Hospital of the State University of Haiti, more widely known as the General Hospital, after authorities regained control of it from gangs. The hospital had been left ravaged and strewn with debris. Walls and nearby buildings were riddled with bullet holes, signaling fights between police and gangs. On Tuesday, Regala said workers were only just painting and cleaning the hospital. Gang attacks have pushed Haiti’s health system to the brink of collapse, looting, setting fires and destroying medical institutions and pharmacies in the capital. The violence has created a surge in patients and a shortage of resources to treat them. Regala said he will ignore his family's pleas to get out of journalism. 'The work needs to continue, to make sure the population is kept informed,' he said. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america	https://apnews.com/article/haiti-gang-violence-capital-journalists-ab0c6a3797baa5882e04c0aea00ee74d	2024-12-25T19:53:33-08:00	
Stock market today: Asian shares are mostly higher in thin post-Christmas holiday trading	BANGKOK (AP) — Asian shares were mostly higher Thursday in thin post-Christmas holiday trading, while oil prices rose. Japan's Nikkei 225 index surged 0.8% to 39,449.55, on strong gains in retailers and tourism-related stocks after Japan agreed to ease visa conditions for Chinese tourists. Isetan Mitsukoshi Holdings, a major department store group, gained 7%. J. Front Retailing Co., owner of the Matsuzakaya and Daimaru department store groups, jumped 8.8%. Automakers also saw large gains. China and Japan also agreed Wednesday to conduct talks on contentious security issues and other sources of friction during a visit by Japanese Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya to Beijing, where he met with Chinese Premier Li Qiang and Foreign Minister Wang Yi. South Korea's Kospi slipped less than 0.1% to 2,438.85, while the Taiex in Taiwan gained 0.2%. The Shanghai Composite index edged less than 0.1% higher, to 3,395.41. Thailand's SET was up 0.1%. Markets were closed Thursday in Hong Kong, Australia, New Zealand and Indonesia. U.S. markets were closed on Wednesday and will reopen Thursday, when an update on U.S. unemployment benefits is due. Gains in Big Tech stocks contributed to a 'Santa rally' for Tuesday’s shortened holiday session. The S&amp;P 500 gained 1.1%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.9%. The Nasdaq composite climbed 1.3%. Also early Thursday, U.S. benchmark crude oil was up 27 cents at $70.37 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, picked up 24 cents to $73.31 per barrel. The dollar rose to 157.43 Japanese yen from 157.19 yen. The euro fell to $1.0401 from $1.0410. Tuesday’s U.S. market rally was in line with what's historically been a very cheerful season. The last five trading days of each year, plus the first two in the new year, have brought an average gain of 1.3% since 1950. So far this month, the U.S. stock market has lost some of its gains since President-elect Donald Trump’s win on Election Day, which raised hopes for faster economic growth and more lax regulations that would boost corporate profits. Worries have risen that Trump’s preference for tariffs and other policies could lead to higher inflation, a bigger U.S. government debt and difficulties for global trade. Even so, the U.S. market remains on pace to deliver strong returns for 2024. The benchmark S&amp;P 500 is up 26.6% so far this year and remains within roughly 1% of the all-time high it set earlier this month — its latest of 57 record highs this year.	https://apnews.com/article/stocks-markets-rates-china-24b017b95f02f3b06616a7cb30ef5a10	2024-12-25T19:50:47-08:00	
Heat wave leads to warnings of potentially devastating wildfires in southern Australia	NEWCASTLE, Australia (AP) — Communities and firefighters across Australia’s second-most populous state were preparing Thursday for potentially devastating wild fires as a heat wave fanned by erratic winds presented the worst fire conditions in several years. With temperatures in Victoria state reaching 37 degrees Celsius (99 degrees Fahrenheit) and with wind changes expected throughout the day, fire chiefs have issued stark warnings to rural communities to delay travel or leave their homes and seek safety at shelters. Several fires are currently burning out of control across the state and Victoria deputy premier Ben Carroll said the possibility for further fires in the coming days was likely. 'Dangerous fire conditions are forming today and will go right through to Saturday,' he said at a press conference in Melbourne. 'New fires can start anywhere and become dangerous very quickly. The largest uncontained fire is located in the Grampians National Park and has burnt through 55,000 hectares so far, but no homes have reported to have been lost. However, Emergency Management Commissioner Rick Nugent said there were many residential properties on the fringes of the fire that could come under threat. 'I wouldn’t be surprised at some point if we do have residential losses,' Nugent said. 'Firefighters, I can say, are doing everything possible to protect life and protect property.' An emergency warning was issued by fire authorities for the small town of Mafeking, 260 kilometers (160 miles) west of Melbourne, on Thursday. Residents there were told 'you are in danger and need to act immediately to survive. The safest option is to take shelter indoors immediately, as it is too late to leave.' The Australian Broadcasting Corporation reported around 100 personnel from other Australian states are now in Victoria to assist local firefighters battling the blazes. Firefighters are being assisted by scores of water-bombing aircraft. Parts of neighboring South Australia and New South Wales states are also on high alert due to the heat wave and elevated fire risks. The hot, dry conditions are being compared to the Black Summer fires that gripped Australia's two most populous states for months in 2019-20 and burned through 104 thousand square kilometers, an area roughly the size of Ohio, and destroyed thousands of homes and killed 33 people.	https://apnews.com/article/wild-fires-australia-victoria-d3ffa3454c942eb5d29b618e702c4373	2024-12-25T19:30:27-08:00	
This Somali migrant watched others around her die at sea. But she wants to try again for Europe	MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) — Idil Abdullahi Goley’s journey seeking a better life in Europe started in Somalia with a $6,500 payment to local smugglers. It ended a month later with fellow migrants around her dying at sea, one of them screaming and reciting the Muslim profession of faith. The deaths of 25 migrants last month in boats off the Indian Ocean island of Madagascar brought to light yet another route that some in Africa are taking in dangerous bids for Europe. Goley was one of the 48 people rescued. She spoke to The Associated Press about the journey that thousands of Somalis embark on every year as extremist attacks and climate shocks destroy hopes and livelihoods at home. Some Somalis head for the Gulf countries via the Red Sea and Yemen. Others, like Goley, gamble on a longer sea voyage south, toward the French island territory of Mayotte in the Indian Ocean, the poorest territory in the European Union. Somalis are among an estimated 100,000 migrants living in Mayotte, according to French authorities. The migrants are part of communities affected after Cyclone Chido leveled entire neighborhoods on Dec.14. The International Organization for Migration has estimated that two million people migrated from Somalia in 2021 in search of work, the latest data available. The 28-year-old Goley heard about the smugglers from friends who had traveled the route and raised the $6,500 fee from her small teashop business in the capital, Mogadishu, and from her brother and mother. She hoped to reach Europe and pay them back. She left her three small children behind. Her journey began with a flight from Mogadishu to Kenya's capital, Nairobi. Then she and others took a bus to the port city of Mombasa, where they set off in fishing boats for Mayotte, more than 620 miles (997 kilometers) away. They hoped to request asylum there. After three days at sea, the group of about 70 migrants was transferred to smaller boats whose engines started to fail. The smugglers said they would fix the engines and left with them on another boat, leaving the migrants drifting without water and food. They started catching fish and collecting rainwater to survive. It was nearly cyclone season, and waves were choppy. Goley said she tried to save the life of an infant whose mother was also on board but struggling. 'But she died right in front of me. We couldn’t hold onto her body for long and had to throw it into the sea to prevent it from decomposing, as more people perished around us,' she said. During 13 days of hunger, thirst and heat, Goley’s two friends also died. She held one in her lap as she passed. 'The other screamed for help. I couldn’t help her and she died shortly after, crying out loudly, reciting the Shahada,' Goley said. 'That is an image I will never forget, the suffering and helplessness we felt.' She said the ordeal ended when a fishing boat appeared on the horizon and the survivors waved for help. They offered the fishermen $100 for their rescue and were taken to a sports facility in Nosy Be in northern Madagascar. The migrants were repatriated in early December by chartered plane. Back home, Goley's mother had feared for the worst. Unable to eat, she had lost 20 kilograms (44 pounds). 'When I returned home, my mother couldn’t believe it until she heard my voice and saw me in person,' Goley said. As she and the other survivors arrived in Mogadishu, the Somali president’s special envoy on refugee affairs expressed hope for their future and said the government would help. 'They assured me they will never take the same risk again,' Maryan Yasin said. But Goley said she plans to attempt another journey on the same route, despite having nightmares about her ordeal. The hardships in Somalia are still the same, she said — and she did pay the smugglers' fee. 'Even if it leads me to prison, I believe I’d still find a better life than the one I have here,' she said. Her mother, meanwhile, fears this time she will never return. Other survivors are undecided as they mourn. Ahmed Hussein Mahadalle, 26, had watched helplessly as his sister Hanan, 21, died. Nothing compares to the pain of it, he said. His other sister, Haboon Hussein Mahadalle, was grateful for her brother's safe return, though he also has plans to try again. 'Hanan was courageous and vigilant. She met her fate with grace,' Haboon said, in tears. 'They say good people don’t stay long, and my sister embodied all the qualities I can’t begin to summarize.' ___ The Associated Press receives financial support for global health and development coverage in Africa from the Gates Foundation.

Prayers and tears mark 20 years since the Indian Ocean tsunami that killed some 230,000 people	BANDA ACEH, Indonesia (AP) — People gathered in prayer and visited mass graves in Indonesia’s Aceh province on Thursday to mark 20 years since the massive Indian Ocean tsunami hit the region in one of modern history’s worst natural disasters. Many wept as they placed flowers at a mass grave in Ulee Lheue village, where more than 14,000 unidentified tsunami victims are buried. It is one of several mass graves in Banda Aceh, the capital of Indonesia’s northernmost province, which was one of the areas worst hit by a magnitude 9.1 earthquake and the massive tsunami it triggered. 'We miss them and we still don’t know where they are. All we know is that every year we visit the mass grave in Ulee Lhue and Siron,' said Muhamad Amirudin, who lost two of his children 20 years ago and has never found their bodies. 'This life is only temporary, so we do our best to be useful to others,' Amirudin, visiting the grave with his wife, said. The powerful earthquake off the coast of the Indonesian island of Sumatra on Dec. 26, 2004, triggered a tsunami that killed around 230,000 people across a dozen countries, reaching as far as East Africa. Some 1.7 million people were displaced, mostly in the four worst-affected countries: Indonesia, Sri Lanka, India and Thailand. More than 170,000 people died in Indonesia alone. Even though 20 years have passed, survivors in Indonesia are still grieving the loved ones they lost to the giant wave that flattened buildings all the way to the provincial capital of Banda Aceh. Hundreds of people gathered to pray at the Baiturrahman Mosque in downtown Banda Aceh. Sirens sounded across the city for three minutes to mark the time of the earthquake. Infrastructure in Aceh has been rebuilt and is now more resilient than before the tsunami struck. Early warning systems have been installed in coastal areas to alert residents of incoming tsunamis, providing crucial time to seek safety. The rebuilding efforts were made possible by the support of international donors and organizations, which contributed significant funds to help the region recover. Schools, hospitals, and essential infrastructure destroyed by the disaster have been reconstructed. In Thailand, people gathered at a memorial ceremony in Ban Nam Khem, a small fishing village in Phang Nga province that bore the brunt of the devastating wave in the country. The tsunami claimed the lives of over 8,000 people in Thailand, including many who remain missing, leaving a deep scar in the nation’s history. Nearly 400 bodies remain unclaimed. Mourners shed tears and comforted each other as they laid flowers at the village’s tsunami memorial. Around 300 people joined a modest ceremony with Muslim, Christian and Buddhist prayers. Urai Sirisuk said she avoids the seaside memorial park the rest of the year because the loss of her 4-year-old daughter still cuts deep every time she's reminded of it. 'I have this feeling that the sea has taken my child. I’m very angry with it. I can’t even put my foot in the water,' she said. But, she said, 'I still hear her voice in my ears, that she’s calling for me. I can’t abandon her. So I have to be here, for my child.' In India, hundreds gathered at Marina beach in the southern city of Chennai in Tamil Nadu state. They poured milk into the sea to propitiate gods and offered flowers and prayers for the dead as drums beat in the background. According to official data, 10,749 people were killed in India, including nearly 7,000 people in Tamil Nadu alone. 'It has been 20 years since the tsunami,' said 69-year-old Sadayammal, who uses one name. 'We are here to pay respects to the people who lost their lives.' In Sri Lanka, survivors and relatives of tsunami victims gathered at the coastal village of Pereliya and laid flowers at a memorial that commemorates nearly 2,000 passengers who died when their train, the Queen of the Sea, was hit by the wave. Only a few dozen people are believed to have survived. Anura Ranjith joined the mourners to pay respects to his younger sister, Anula Ranjani, and her 9-year-old daughter who were passengers on the train. Ranjith never heard from them after that day. 'I looked for them everywhere for years and still, no information about them. Their loss is a great sorrow and pain for me. I am still grieving,' he said. Overall, more than 35,000 people died in Sri Lanka in the tsunami. People across the country observed two minutes of silence on Thursday in memory of those who lost their lives. ___ Tarigan reported from Jakarta, Indonesia.

Kosovo appeals body overturns ban on ethnic Serb party, allowing it to run in parliamentary election	PRISTINA, Kosovo (AP) — Kosovo’s election appeals authority on Wednesday cancelled a ban on the main party of the ethnic Serb minority, allowing it to field candidates in the upcoming parliamentary election. The Electoral Panel for Complaints and Appeals decided that the party, Srpska Lista, or Serb List, has 'fulfilled the political terms to be certified for registration.' The panel overturned a decision Monday by the Central Election Commission, which declined to certify the Srpska Lista party because of its nationalist stance and close ties to neighboring Serbia. The panel ruled that the commission's decision was 'contrary to the legal dispositions referring to the application and certification of the political subjects.' Of the 10 seats reserved for the Serb minority in the 120-member parliament, Srspka Lista holds nine. It will put up 48 candidates for the parliamentary election on Feb. 9, expected to be a key test for Prime Minister Albin Kurti, whose governing party won in a landslide in the 2021. The original decision by the election commission was also opposed by Serbian President Aleksandar Vučić, who said 'Kurti is trying to root out the Serb people from (our) southern province.' The Western powers also expressed their concern over the commission's decision, fearing it may further aggravate the already tense ties between Kosovo and Serbia, despite their efforts to normalize them. Kosovo was a Serbian province until NATO’s 78-day bombing campaign in 1999 ended a war between Serbian government forces and ethnic Albanian separatists in Kosovo, which left about 11,400 dead, mainly ethnic Albanians, and pushed Serbian forces out. Kosovo proclaimed independence in 2008, which Serbia doesn’t recognize. Belgrade still considers Kosovo as its province and has a major influence on the Serb minority there.	https://apnews.com/article/kosovo-serbs-election-srpska-lista-party-ban-kurti-5f6ca84f50fcd86980b176f2f2e34c73	2024-12-25T10:06:21-08:00	
Clashes between Islamists now in power in Syria and Assad's supporters kill 6 fighters	DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) — Clashes between Islamists who took over Syria and supporters of ousted President Bashar Assad's government killed six Islamic fighters on Wednesday and wounded others, according to a British-based war monitor. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the fighters were killed while trying to arrest a former official in Assad's government, accused of issuing execution orders and arbitrary rulings against thousands of prisoners. The fighters were from Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, which led the stunning offensive that toppled Assad earlier this month. Syria’s transition has been surprisingly smooth but it’s only been a few weeks since Assad fled the country and his administration and forces melted away. The insurgents who ousted Assad are rooted in fundamentalist Islamist ideology, and though they have vowed to create a pluralist system, it isn’t clear how or whether they plan to share power. Since Assad’s fall, dozens of Syrians have been killed in acts of revenge, according to activists and monitors, the vast majority of them from the minority Alawite community, an offshoot of Shiite Islam that Assad belongs to. In the capital, Damascus, Alawite protesters scuffled with Sunni counter-protesters and gunshots were heard. The Associated Press could not confirm details of the shooting. Alawite protests also took place along the coast of Syria, in the city of Homs and the Hama countryside. Some called for the release of soldiers from the former Syrian army now imprisoned by the HTS. At least one protestor was killed and five were wounded in Homs by HTS forces suppressing the demonstration, said the Syrian Observatory. In response to the protests, HTS imposed a curfew from 6 pm until 8am. The Alawite protests were apparently in part sparked by an online video showing the burning of an Alawite shrine. The interim authorities insisted the video was old and not a recent incident. Sectarian violence has erupted in bursts since Assad's ouster but nothing close to the level feared after nearly 14 years of civil war that killed an estimated half-million people. The war fractured Syria, creating millions of refugees and displacing tens of thousands throughout the country. This week, some Syrians who were forcibly displaced, started trickling home, trying to rebuild their lives. Shocked by the devastation, many found that little remains of their houses. In the northwestern Idlib region, residents were repairing shops and sealing damaged windows on Tuesday, trying to bring back a sense of normalcy. The city of Idlib and much of the surrounding province has for years been under control of the HTS, led by Ahmad al-Sharaa, formerly known as Abu Mohammed al-Golani, once aligned with al-Qaida, but has been the scene of relentless attacks by the government forces. Hajjah Zakia Daemessaid, who was forcibly displaced during the war, said coming back to her house in the Idlib countryside was bitter-sweet. 'My husband and I spent 43 years of hard work saving money to build our home, only to find that all of it has gone to waste,' said the 62-year-old. In the dusty neighborhoods, cars drove by with luggage strapped on top. People stood idly on the streets or sat in empty coffee shops. In Damascus, Syria's new authorities raided warehouses on Wednesday, confiscating drugs such as Captagon and cannabis, used by Assad's forces. A million Captagon pills and hundreds of kilograms (pounds) of cannabis were set ablaze, the interim authorities said. ___ Albam reported from Damascus, Syria, and Alsayed from Idlib, Syria. ___ Follow AP’s Syria coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/syria	https://apnews.com/article/syria-assad-clashes-jihadi-hts-f31b8bf1f673a4cb38ebde5dcf36deaa	2024-12-25T09:36:18-08:00	
Japan to maximize nuclear power in clean-energy push as electricity demand grows	TOKYO (AP) — A government-commissioned panel of experts on Wednesday largely supported Japan's new energy policy for the next few years that calls for bolstering renewables up to half of electricity needs by 2040 while maximizing the use of nuclear power as the country seeks to accommodate the growing power demand in the era of AI while meeting decarbonization targets. The Industry Ministry presented the draft plan for final review by the panel of 16 mostly pro-nuclear members from business, academia and civil groups. It calls for maximizing the use of nuclear energy, reversing a phaseout policy adopted after the meltdown crisis at the Fukushima Daiichi power plant in 2011 that led to extensive displacement of residents and lingering anti-nuclear sentiment. The plan is due to receive Cabinet approval by March after a period of consultation and will then replace the current energy policy, which dates from 2021. The new proposal says nuclear energy should account for 20% of Japan’s energy supply in 2040, up from just 8.5% last year, while expanding renewables to 40-50% from 22.9% and reducing coal-fired power to 30-40% from nearly 70% last year. The current plan set a 20-22% target for nuclear energy, 36-38% for renewables and 41% for fossil fuel, for 2030. Demand for low-carbon energy, such as renewables and nuclear, is growing because of the demand from data centers using AI and semiconductor factories around the country. Industry Minister Yoji Muto, who attended Wednesday’s panel meeting, said Japan must strengthen its energy security by not relying too much on a single source. 'How we can secure decarbonized energy determines Japan’s future growth,' Muto said. 'It's time to stop discussing a choice between renewable energy and nuclear power. We should maximize the use of both renewables and nuclear.' Japan has set a goal of achieving net zero emissions of climate-warming gases by 2050, and a 73% reduction by 2040 compared to 2013 levels. The draft energy plan places renewables as the main power source and calls for development of next-generation energy source, such as solar batteries and portable solar panels. It outlines a number of risk scenarios, including a possibility of less-than-expected investment and cost reduction in renewables. However, some experts said the plan lacked a feasibility outlook for 2040 or a roadmap for the phaseout of fossil fuels. The plan also calls for acceleration of the restarts of reactors that meet the post-Fukushima safety standards, and proposes construction of next-generation reactors -- at plants where existing reactors are being decommissioned. Still, to achieve the 20% target, all 33 workable reactors in Japan must be back online, with only 14 back in service after the Fukushima disaster. Given the current pace of safety checks by the nuclear regulation authority, experts say meeting the target would be difficult. Despite criticisms and skepticism about its feasibility, Japan still sticks to its pursuit of developing advanced reactors and a struggling spent fuel reprocessing program to achieve a complete nuclear fuel cycle.	https://apnews.com/article/japan-energy-nuclear-renewable-climate-fukushima-reactors-a9ce61e4a1cdef72cbf8f9e35deb4cfb	2024-12-25T07:21:40-08:00	
A baby froze to death overnight in Gaza as Israel and Hamas trade accusations of ceasefire delays	JERUSALEM (AP) — A baby girl froze to death overnight in Gaza, while Israel and Hamas accused each other of complicating ceasefire efforts that could wind down the 14-month war. The 3-week old baby was the third to die from the cold in Gaza's tent camps in recent days, doctors said, deaths that underscore the squalid conditions, with hundreds of thousands of Palestinians crammed into often ramshackle tents after fleeing Israeli offensives. Israel’s bombardment and ground invasion of Gaza has killed over 45,000 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and civilians in its count. The offensive has caused widespread destruction and displaced some 90% of Gaza’s 2.3 million people, often multiple times. Hundreds of thousands are packed into tent camps along the coast as the cold, wet winter sets in. Aid groups have struggled to deliver food and supplies and say there are shortages of blankets, warm clothing and firewood. Israel has increased the amount of aid it allows into the territory, reaching an average of 130 trucks a day so far this month, up from around 70 a day in October and November. Still, the amount remains well below than previous months and the United Nations says it is unable to distribute more than half the aid because Israeli forces deny permission to move within Gaza or because of rampant lawlessness and theft from trucks. The father of 3-week-old Sila, Mahmoud al-Faseeh, wrapped her in a blanket to try and keep her warm in their tent in the Muwasi area outside the town of Khan Younis, but it wasn't enough, he told The Associated Press. He said the tent was not sealed from the wind and the ground was cold, as temperatures on Tuesday night dropped to 9 degrees Celsius (48 degrees Fahrenheit.) Muwasi is a desolate area of dunes and farmland on Gaza’s Mediterranean coast. 'It was very cold overnight and as adults we couldn’t even take it. We couldn’t stay warm,' he said. Sila woke up crying three times overnight and in the morning they found her unresponsive, her body stiff. 'She was like wood,' said al-Faseeh. They rushed her to a field hospital where doctors tried to revive her, but her lungs had already deteriorated. Images of Sila taken by the AP showed the little girl with purple lips, her pale skin blotchy. Ahmed al-Farra, director of the children’s ward at Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis, confirmed that the baby died of hypothermia. He said two other babies — one 3 days old, the other a month old — had been brought to the hospital over the past 48 hours after dying of hypothermia. Ceasefire complications Meanwhile, hopes for a ceasefire looked complicated Wednesday, with Israel and the militant Hamas group that runs Gaza trading accusations of delaying an agreement. In recent weeks, the two sides appeared to be inching toward a deal that would bring home dozens of hostages held by the militants in Gaza, but differences have emerged. Although Israel and Hamas have expressed optimism that progress was being made toward a deal, sticking points remain over the exchange of hostages for Palestinian prisoners and the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza, people involved in the talks say. On Wednesday, Hamas accused Israel of introducing new conditions related to the withdrawal from Gaza, the prisoners and the return of displaced people, which it said was delaying the deal. Israel's government accused Hamas of reneging on understandings that have already been reached.' Still, both sides said discussions are ongoing. Israel’s negotiating team, which includes members from its intelligence agencies and the military, returned from Qatar on Tuesday evening for internal consultations, following a week of what it called 'significant negotiations.' During its Oct. 7, 2023, attack on southern Israel, Hamas and other groups took about 250 people hostages and brought them to Gaza. A previous truce in November 2023 freed more than 100 hostages, while others have been rescued or their remains have been recovered over the past year. Israel says about 100 hostages remain in Gaza — at least a third whom it believes were killed during the Oct. 7 attack or died in captivity. Sporadic talks have taken place for a year, but in recent weeks there's been a renewed push to reach a deal. President-elect Donald Trump, who takes office next month for his second term, has demanded the immediate release of Israeli hostages, saying on social media that if they're not freed before he is sworn in, there will be 'HELL TO PAY.' Families of the hostages are becoming increasingly angry, calling on the Israeli government for a ceasefire before Trump is sworn in. After Israel’s high-level negotiation team returned from Doha this week, hostage families called an emergency press conference in Tel Aviv, Israel, pleading for a ceasefire and a complete end to the war. Shir Siegel, the daughter of Israeli-American Keith Siegel, whose mother was released after more than 50 days in captivity, said every delay could endanger their lives. 'There are moments when every second is fateful, and this is one of those moments,' she said. Families of the hostages marked the first night of Hannukah with a candle lighting ceremony in Tel Aviv as well as by the Western Wall in Jerusalem. The agreement would take effect in phases and include a halt in fighting, an exchange of Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners, and a surge in aid to the besieged Gaza, according to Egyptian, Hamas and American officials. The last phase would include the release of any remaining hostages, an end to the war and talks on reconstruction. Houthi attacks Also Wednesday, a missile launched by Yemen's Iran-backed Houthi rebels triggered air raid sirens across central Israel, sending residents fleeing to shelters. The Houthis said they operations were aimed at Israeli targets in the cities of Jaffa and Ashkelon. It was the fourth time in a week that fire from the Yemeni rebels set off sirens in Israel. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel will strike anyone threatening lives in Israel and warned the Houthis that they would learn lessons that Hamas, Hezbollah and Syria's ousted President Bashar Assad have learned. Israel also requested an emergency meeting by the U.N. Security Council to address the recent attacks. The meeting is set for Monday. Israel’s U.N. Ambassador Danny Danon said he expects the council to condemn the Houthi attacks and called on it 'to enforce international law and hold Iran, the Houthis’ patron, accountable.' ___ Goldenberg reported from Tel Aviv, Israel, and Khaled from Cairo.

The organizer of a Christmas fair in southern Mexico is assassinated at his holiday event	MEXICO CITY (AP) — The organizer of a Christmas fair in southern Mexico was assassinated at his city’s holiday event, authorities said late Tuesday. The governor of the southern state of Guerrero said gunmen killed the organizer of the annual Christmas and New Year's fair in the state capital of Chilpancingo. Gov. Evelyn Salgado called the Christmas Eve killing of Martín Ramírez Ruíz 'an unacceptable act that will not go unpunished.' Salgado wrote on her social media accounts that state prosecutors were investigating the crime. There was no immediate information on the motive, but the gangs gain much of their income extorting money from local businesses and routinely kill those who refuse to pay. In a separate statement, state prosecutors said that another person was killed along with Ramírez Ruíz, and that a third person in the crowd gathered outside a church was wounded in the attack. The gunmen had apparently waded into the crowd and directly targeted Ramírez Ruíz. Ramírez Ruíz was the head of the civic group that for almost two centuries has organized an arts, food and handicrafts fair that runs from roughly Christmas to Jan. 7. The fair also honors the local patron saint, St. Matthew. Two rival drug gangs, the Tlacos and the Ardillos, are fighting for control of the city of Chilpancingo, and violence against officials and residents there has reached grisly levels. In November, a former prosecutor and local police official was arrested in connection with the grisly decapitation of the city's mayor on Oct. 6. Mayor Alejandro Arcos was killed just a week after he took office as mayor of the state capital. Officials had blamed the killing on one of the gangs. The mayor's body was found in a pickup truck, with his severed head placed on the roof of the vehicle, in an apparent message from the gang. The same gang is thought to be responsible for killing 11 market vendors, including four boys, in late October. The vendors, members of an extended family, were abducted as they traveled to sell their wares. Their bodies were found dumped in the bed of a pickup truck on an avenue in Chilpancingo. Chilpancingo, a city of about 300,000, is so completely dominated by gangs that in 2023, one of them staged a demonstration of hundreds of people, hijacked a government armored car, blocked a major highway and took police hostage to win the release of arrested suspects. Violence in Guerrero reached such unprecedented levels that earlier this year, Roman Catholic bishops announced they had helped arrange a truce in another part of the state between two warring drug cartels. ____ Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america	https://apnews.com/article/mexico-violence-christmas-fair-organizer-chilpancingo-killed-d1a281248d2adb5995c8a18de781684c	2024-12-25T05:06:25-08:00	
Desi Bouterse, a dictator convicted of murder who twice ruled Suriname, has died at 79	PARAMARIBO, Suriname (AP) — Desi Bouterse, a military strongman who led a 1980 coup in the former Dutch colony of Suriname then returned to power by election three decades later despite charges of drug smuggling and murder, has died. He was 79. Surinamese Vice President Ronnie Brunswijk wrote on Facebook Wednesday that Bouterse’s 'life had a lasting impact on our country and his efforts will not be forgotten.' The cause of death was not immediately known. Bouterse was applauded by supporters for his charisma and populist social programs. For his opponents, he was a ruthless dictator who was convicted of drug trafficking and extrajudicial killings. In December 2023, Bouterse was sentenced to 20 years in prison for the murders of 15 opponents of the then-military government i n December 1982, ending a historic 16-year legal process. He then vanished and never served time in jail despite the sentencing. 'There is nobody who has shaped the history of Suriname since its independence like Desi Bouterse,' said Dutch historian Pepijn Reeser, who wrote a biography of Bouterse in 2015. He said that Bouterse was the first to overcome the stark social class divide that once defined Suriname. 'Before the coup, it was unthinkable somebody from the lower class could become the most powerful man of the country. But he was also the first post-colonial leader to resort to political violence, and the first to use Suriname as a transshipment point for illegal narcotics,' Reeser said. Early Wednesday, dozens of supporters gathered outside Bouterse’s home where his wife lived, tears streaming down their faces. Many were dressed in purple, the color of his political party. Born Oct. 13, 1945, at a former sugar plantation near capital Paramaribo, Bouterse left for the Netherlands in 1968, as did thousands of other Surinamers in that era to seek adventure or a better life in Europe. Suriname was then still a colony, and as a Dutch citizen he was eligible for conscription, so he joined the armed forces a few months after arriving. He graduated from the Royal Military School and served at several Dutch army bases in the Netherlands and Germany. Bouterse returned to Suriname two weeks before it became an independent republic on Nov. 25, 1975, and joined its newly formed military. The initial optimism of young military men in serving their own country quickly turned into frustration over widespread favoritism and corruption in the consecutive governments of Prime Minister Henck Arron. When Arron forbade the troops from unionizing, 16 young soldiers led by Bouterse overthrew the government on Feb. 25, 1980, and made him the de facto ruler. 'We took control because we want to save this country from ruin. There needs to be a total change of mentality to transform Suriname into the paradise it used to be,' Bouterse said to a journalist a few hours after the coup. When promised democratic reforms did not materialize, opposition to Bouterse’s military regime grew rapidly. Frictions between the military and opposition groups culminated in the killing of 15 men on Dec. 8, 1982. The victims were journalists, lawyers, military and university teachers, and their slaying became known as the 'December Murders.' 'The executions were a severe blow to the rule of law in Suriname from which the country still has not fully recovered,' said Eddy Wijngaarde, a brother of journalist Frank Wijngaarde, one of the victims. 'The impact of the December Murders goes beyond the death of these 15 men. Since December 1982, Bouterse used fear for him as a means to secure his powerful positions and personal interests.' Shocked by the killings, the Netherlands suspended all development aid, disrupting life in Suriname. Ronnie Brunswijk, a former bodyguard of Bouterse, took up arms in 1986 in a bid to oust the dictator. For six years, the country’s jungles were torn by a civil war in which both sides violated human rights and hundreds died. International isolation and the lack of domestic support for his military regime led Bouterse to accept free elections in November 1987. He established his own political movement, the National Democratic Party, but won only three of 51 seats in Parliament. Nonetheless, as commander of the armed forces, Bouterse kept a tight grip on the newly elected government of President Ramsewak Shankar. Following a conflict between Bouterse and Shankar in 1990, the army seized power again, dismissing Shankar with a phone call. Civilian rule was restored the following year. Bouterse officially left Suriname’s army in 1993, and became what he described as a fulltime politician and businessman. In 1999, a Dutch court sentenced him in absentia to 11 years in prison for smuggling more than 1,000 pounds of cocaine to the Netherlands. The absence of an extradition treaty between the nations meant he never served his time in prison. In 2007, Suriname’s military court started a trial against Bouterse and 24 others for their alleged roles in the December Murders of 1982. Bouterse was painted as the chief instigator by the prosecution. He maintained he was not present during the executions, although he said he accepted 'political responsibility' as army commander. 'I want to apologize to all the relatives of the victims. But to think you can lock me up? Never, niemals, jamais, nunca,' Bouterse said during a televised speech in March 2007. While the trial dragged on for more than a decade, the former military leader reinvented himself as a politician by preaching nationalism and attracting support from many ethnic groups in Suriname, whose people have African, Asian, Amerindian, European and Middle Eastern roots. He was elected president for the first time in 2010. Instead of avoiding his past, he celebrated it. He quickly declared Feb. 25, the day of his military coup in 1980, a national holiday. He awarded other suspects in the December Murders case and coup plotters with high-ranking government jobs. 'Despite his controversial past, Bouterse was able to embody a new political dynamism, with strong leadership and a promising vision for the future,' political scientist Hans Breeveld of the Anton de Kom University in Suriname said in an interview in 2015. Inspired by the socialist politics of then Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, Bouterse continued construction of social housing, increased social welfare benefits and raised the government pension. These popular measures secured his reelection for another five-year term in 2015, but also proved to be an unpayable burden for the state. Large budget deficits and rampant inflation ensued. Consecutive devaluations of the Surinamese dollar in 2016 resulted in the currency losing more than half of its value in just a year. 'The reckless economic policies of Bouterse have put a huge burden on our future generations, who are forced to repay millions of dollars of loans to international creditors,' Surinamese economist Winston Ramautarsing told The Associated Press in 2016. With his support dwindling during his second term, Bouterse resorted to the tactics that he used during his dictatorship, including threatening the judges of his own murder trial during public events. History books for the country’s high schools that mentioned the December Murders were banned. He regularly fired Cabinet ministers while blaming them for Suriname’s problems. In 2012, the Bouterse administration proclaimed an internationally criticized amnesty law for the December Murders in an attempt to halt the murder trial. However, the law was ruled inapplicable by the military court in 2016, and in June 2017, the prosecutor recommended a 20-year prison sentence for Bouterse. 'If it was God who made me president, who is this judge to try to send me away?' Bouterse said. He tried to force out the attorney general, but the latter refused to quit. A verdict in the trial was expected in 2018. Bouterse said during a speech in August 2017 that he 'already knew' he would be reelected for a third five-year term in the 2020 election. But he had been making regular trips to Cuba that were described as routine check-ups, and after returning in September 2017 from a monthlong stay, his office admitted the president had undergone surgery, although it refused to disclose more details. Bouterse was married twice and had three children, one son and two daughters. His son, Dino Bouterse, was serving a 16-year prison sentence in the U.S. for drug trafficking.	https://apnews.com/article/suriname-bouterse-dies-dictator-fe5300461c2239c7bbdb6b5272660ed0	2024-12-25T03:41:58-08:00	
Missile fire from Yemen's Houthi rebels sets off sirens in central Israel for the second night	NAHARIYA, Israel (AP) — A missile launched from Yemen triggered air raid sirens across central Israel early Wednesday, sending millions of residents looking for cover for the second night in a row. The military said the missile was intercepted before crossing into Israeli territory, but police reported shrapnel from the interception fell in several towns. There were no reports of injuries. It was the fourth time in a week that fire from Yemen's Houthi rebels set off sirens in Israel. On Saturday, 1 6 people were injured when a missile hit a playground in Tel Aviv after Israel’s air defense system failed to intercept it. Earlier last week, Israeli jets struck Yemen’s rebel-held capital and a port city, killing nine. Israel said the strikes were in response to previous Houthi attacks.

Taliban say Pakistani airstrikes killed 46 people in eastern Afghanistan, mostly women and children	PESHAWAR, Pakistan (AP) — Pakistan’s airstrikes on eastern Afghanistan killed 46 people, mostly women and children, a Taliban government official said Wednesday, raising fears of further straining the relations between the two neighbors. Hamdullah Fitrat, the deputy spokesman for the Afghan government, said those killed in the strikes that targeted four locations in Barmal, a district in the province of Paktika, were refugees, adding that six others were also wounded. This comes a day after Pakistani security officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity in line with regulations, told The Associated Press that Tuesday’s operation was to dismantle a training facility and kill insurgents in Paktika in Afghanistan. Earlier Wednesday, Mohammad Khurasani, the spokesman for the Pakistani Taliban or Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan, claimed in a statement that 50 people, including 27 women and children, have died in the strikes. He said they were 'unarmed refugees' who fled to Afghanistan because of Pakistan’s offensive in the northwest. The TTP — a separate group but also a close ally of the Afghan Taliban — also shared photos, alleging they were of children killed during the Pakistani operation. Meanwhile, residents in the area told an AP reporter over the phone that at least 13 people were left dead, adding that the death toll could be higher. They also said the wounded were transported to a local hospital. Pakistan has not commented on the strikes. However, on Wednesday, the Pakistani military said security forces killed 13 insurgents in an intelligence-based operation in South Waziristan, a district located along eastern Afghanistan’s Paktika province. Pakistan's Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi on Wednesday praised 'Pakistan’s brave security force' in a statement for thwarting 'the nefarious designs' of 'terrorists.' He didn't mention the Pakistani air strikes inside Afghanistan The Taliban Defense Ministry denounced the attacks on Tuesday and promised retaliation. On Wednesday, the situation along the shared border seemed to be business as usual. However, security analysts say the TTP could launch retaliatory attacks in Pakistan. Pakistan has seen innumerable militant attacks in the past two decades but there has been an uptick in recent months. The latest was this weekend when at least 16 Pakistani soldiers were killed when the TTP attacked a checkpoint in the country’s northwest. Pakistani officials have accused the Taliban of not doing enough to combat militant activity across the border, a charge the Afghan Taliban government denies, saying it does not allow anyone to carry out attacks against any country. North and South Waziristan are former strongholds of Pakistani Taliban, who have fled to Afghanistan. Tensions were at an all-high in March when Pakistan said intelligence-based strikes took place in the border regions inside Afghanistan. ___ Associated Press writers Rasool Dawar in Peshawar, Pakistan, and Ishtiaq Mahsud in Dera Ismail Khan, Pakistan, contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/pakistan-afghanistan-militant-camp-air-strikes-1eb6ebd92403795d03856b1b97cac0da	2024-12-25T00:36:47-08:00	
Pilgrims traverse Vatican Holy Door as Christmas marks the start of the 2025 Holy Year	VATICAN CITY (AP) — Pilgrims lined up early Wednesday to walk through the great Holy Door at the entrance of St. Peter’s Basilica, as Christmas marked the start of the 2025 Holy Year celebration that is expected to bring some 32 million Catholic faithful to Rome. Traversing the Holy Door is one way that the faithful can obtain indulgences, or forgiveness for sins during a Jubilee, a once-every-quarter-century tradition that dates from 1300. On Christmas Eve, Pope Francis knocked on the door and was the first to walk through it, inaugurating the 2025 Jubilee that he dedicated to hope. Pilgrims submitted to security controls before entering the Holy Door, amid new security fears following a deadly Christmas market attack in Germany. Many paused to touch the door as they passed and made the sign of the cross upon entering the basilica dedicated to St. Peter, founder of the Roman Catholic Church. At noon, Francis will deliver the 'Urbi et Orbi' — 'To the City and the World' address, which serves as a summary of the woes facing the world this year. A Chrismukkah miracle as Hanukkah and Christmas coincide Hanukkah, Judaism’s eight-day Festival of Lights, begins this year on Christmas Day, which has only happened four times since 1900. The calendar confluence has inspired some religious leaders to host interfaith gatherings, such as a a Chicanukah party hosted last week by several Jewish organizations in Houston, Texas, bringing together members of the city’s Latino and Jewish communities for latkes, the traditional potato pancake eaten on Hanukkah, topped with guacamole and salsa. While Hanukkah is intended as an upbeat, celebratory holiday, rabbis note that it’s taking place this year as wars rage in the Middle East and fears rise over widespread incidents of antisemitism. The holidays overlap infrequently because the Jewish calendar is based on lunar cycles and is not in sync with the Gregorian calendar, which sets Christmas on Dec. 25. The last time Hanukkah began on Christmas Day was in 2005. German celebrations muted by market attack German celebrations were darkened by a car attack on a Christmas market in Magdeburg on Friday that left five people dead, including a 9-year-old boy, and 200 people injured. President Frank-Walter Steinmeier rewrote his recorded Christmas Day speech to address the attack, saying that 'there is grief, pain, horror and incomprehension over what took place in Magdeburg.' He urged Germans to 'stand together' and that 'hate and violence must not have the last word.' A 50-year-old Saudi doctor who had practiced medicine in Germany since 2006 was arrested on suspicion of murder, attempted murder and bodily harm. The suspect’s X account describes him as a former Muslim and is filled with anti-Islamic themes. He criticized authorities for failing to combat 'the Islamification of Germany' and voiced support for the anti-immigration Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. ____ Barry reported from Milan.

An Israeli soldier who died 417 days after his Oct. 7 wounds has become a symbol of sacrifice	MODIIN, Israel (AP) — For more than 400 days after being critically wounded during Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack on southern Israel, Yona Brief tried to recover. But after losing both legs and enduring medically induced comas, the combat medic died in late November. The dual Israeli-American citizen has come to symbolize the sacrifice by hundreds of fallen soldiers in what many in Israel see as a war for the country’s survival. 'He became a symbol of ‘Don’t quit,’' said his mother, Hazel. His father, David, compared him to the oil that lit the candelabra in the Hannukah story, miraculously burning longer than expected, according to Jewish tradition. More than 800 Israeli soldiers have been killed since Hamas’ attack, about 300 of them on the initial day and the rest in Gaza or in the war against Hezbollah in Lebanon. Thousands of others have been wounded, many of them seriously. The war in Gaza has killed nearly 45,000 Palestinians, while over 3,500 people have been killed in Lebanon, according to local health officials. Serving in Israel’s military is compulsory for most Jews. Soldiers’ service is revered, and Israelis see their sacrifice as deeply moving. Public opinion in previous wars has often been swayed by high soldier casualties. Months before Brief was called into action on Oct. 7, he had been seriously wounded, also in his legs, by a pipe bomb during a commando raid while serving in the occupied West Bank. The weekend of Oct. 7 was his first on duty after his recovery. As militants attacked from Gaza, he and his seven-soldier commando unit raced to join the Israeli army’s house-by-house war in the communal farming villages, military bases and towns along the border. His father said Brief’s unit was ordered to clear the Kibbutz Kfar Aza, where Hamas fighters ambushed them, killing two soldiers. When Brief rushed to help one of them, he was shot 13 times. Suddenly, his training as a medic was used to save himself. His father said he cinched tourniquets around his mutilated legs and dragged himself and a fellow soldier into a nearby bullet-ravaged home. There, the family of Hadas Eilon-Carmi hid in a reinforced room and later described Brief as the soldier 'full of blood.' Brief was evacuated to a hospital hours later. The other soldier, his commanding officer, died at the scene. The hospital stay was grueling, too. Brief was the most critically wounded patient from the Oct. 7 attack to be treated at Sheba Medical Center in Tel Aviv, the country's largest hospital. After his legs were amputated, he teetered between life and death. He had more than 20 surgeries. His doctors told Israeli media he received more than 200 units of blood. The hospital brought specialists and surgeons from around the world in a bid to save him. Eilon-Carmi’s family became close with his family, visiting Brief in the hospital and praying for his recovery. 'Yona represents everything I want an Israeli to be,' she said. Brief's determination to live became a source of inspiration for the doctors and medical staff, who had been overwhelmed by work and heartbreak in the early days of the war, said Steve Walz, the international spokesperson for Sheba Medical Center. Though there were periods when Brief was in a medically induced coma, he was often awake and lucid, even lively. He was grateful for what remained, his mother said. He worked out in his hospital bed, raising a barbell above his head. He sang and danced with visitors. Once, he even left the hospital to spend the night in his family home but his medical issues brought him back. Brief’s parents said there were sparks of joy in the nearly 14 months after he was wounded. Chefs cooked him special meals like sushi. Politicians and influencers visited, and Israel's top musicians played by his bedside. He turned 23. But while his parents said his spirit never wavered, his liver finally failed after months of heavy medication. Hundreds attended his funeral, and tributes poured in from all walks of Israeli life. 'With Yona, every day he had to fight for this victory and that’s why his heroism is extraordinary,' said Chili Tropper, an Israeli opposition lawmaker who became close with Brief and his family. 'For him, during 417 days, every single day was a war.' ___ Associated Press writer Melanie Lidman in Tel Aviv, Israel contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-gaza-soldiers-war-wounded-yona-brief-11f076ba459453f4ee9e4f046537873f	2024-12-24T23:49:24-08:00	
Japan's foreign minister seeks 'positive' direction in bilateral ties during his visit to China	BEIJING (AP) — Japanese Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya met with top Chinese leaders Wednesday during his visit to Beijing, the first since the heads of the two countries met at a summit in Peru last month, in an effort to make positive inroads in the bilateral relationship. The two neighbors have had a tense relationship in recent years. At the top of Iwaya's agenda is China’s ban on Japanese seafood in response to the release of treated radioactive wastewater into the sea from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, as well as China’s increasingly assertive military activity in the East and South China Seas. Iwaya met with China's premier, Li Qiang Wednesday as well as Wang Yi, his Chinese counterpart. 'Currently the China-Japan relations are at a critical period of improvement and development,' said Li, in his remarks. ' China is willing to work together with Japan to move towards the important direction proposed by the leaders of the two countries.' 'I want to build a relationship where the people of both countries feel that Japan-China relations have developed and progressed in a positive direction,' said Iwaya, ahead of his meeting with Wang. His trip comes just before U.S. President-elect Donald Trump is to take office in January. Tokyo considers the Japan-U.S. alliance the lynchpin of its diplomatic and security policies, a tone emphasized in the past four years under U.S. President Joe Biden’s direction, but it’s unclear how Trump will impact the alliance. Japan has revamped its approach to defense i n response to Chinese actions in recent years, boosting military spending and shifting away from a principle of self-defense. Earlier this year, Japan protested when a Chinese military plane flew into Japan's airspace, while in the summer, a Chinese survey ship sailed into Japanese territorial waters. While how U.S.-China relations come out under the Trump administration is unclear, Japan is seeking stability in its relationship with its neighbor and hopes to develop ties in areas of mutual interest, including the economy and the elderly care industry. Iwaya told reporters before his departure Tuesday that he will also hold bilateral high-level people and cultural exchange talks, joined by the education ministers from the two sides. 'The relationship with China, our neighboring country, is one of Japan’s most important,' Iwaya told reporters Tuesday. Though there are many issues and concerns, Japan and China share a variety of possibilities, he said. 'The two countries share important responsibilities for the peace and prosperity of the region and the international society.' Iwaya, a security expert, is also expected to reiterate his concern about Japanese nationals detained in alleged spying allegations. Japan maintains that the water discharged from the Fukushima plant is treated and diluted to levels much safer than international standards and adequately monitored, but China calls the water contaminated. Japan and China agreed in September to work toward easing the seafood ban by allowing China in multinational sampling missions under the framework of the International Atomic Energy Agency. Chinese experts joined an IAEA monitoring mission to Fukushima in October, when China took water samples from the sea just off the coast of the Fukushima plant, as well as the water discharge system on the plant, for analysis. However, no breakthrough is expected during Iwaya’s visit. —- AP writer Mari Yamaguchi contributed to this report from Tokyo.	https://apnews.com/article/japan-visit-china-foreign-minister-improve-ties-4aabd3472505cdbccc93706184436fdb	2024-12-24T23:30:27-08:00	
Russia targets Ukrainian energy infrastructure on Christmas Day	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Russia launched a massive missile and drone barrage targeting Ukraine's energy infrastructure on Wednesday, striking a thermal power plant and prompting Ukrainians to take shelter in metro stations on Christmas morning. The strikes on Ukrainian fuel and energy sources included 78 air, ground, and sea-launched missiles as well as 106 Shaheds and other types of drones, Ukraine’s air force said. It claimed to have intercepted 59 missiles and 54 drones, with 52 more drones being jammed. '(Russian President Vladimir) Putin deliberately chose Christmas for an attack. What could be more inhumane?' Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on X. 'They continue to fight for a blackout in Ukraine.' In Russia, meanwhile, one woman died and three people were wounded after falling debris from a downed drone sparked a fire in a shopping mall in the city of Vladikavkaz. The head of Russia’s republic of North Ossetia-Alania, Gov. Sergey Menyaylo, said security footage showed that the explosion took place outside the Alania Mall Wednesday morning. At least one person was killed in Russia's attack on Ukraine's Dnipro region, Vice Prime Minister Oleksii Kuleba said on Telegram, adding that heating was disrupted for 155 residential buildings. He also said 500,000 people in the Kharkiv region were without heat. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said one Russian missile passed Moldovan and Romanian airspace. Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko said Russia again 'massively attacks energy infrastructure.' Ukraine’s air force said that multiple missiles had been fired at the Kharkiv, Dnipro and Poltava regions in the east of the country. Halushchenko said the power distributor took the necessary measures to limit consumption. 'As soon as the security situation allows, energy workers will establish the damage caused,' he said. State energy operator Ukrenergo applied preemptive power outages across the country due to a 'massive missile attack,' leading to electricity going out in several districts of the capital, Kyiv. Ukraine’s biggest private energy company, DTEK, said Russia struck one of their thermal power plants Wednesday morning, making it the 13th attack on Ukraine’s power grid this year. 'Denying light and warmth to millions of peace-loving people as they celebrate Christmas is a depraved and evil act that must be answered,' Maxim Timchenko, CEO of DTEK wrote on his X account. At least seven strikes targeted Kharkiv, sparking fires across the city, regional head Oleh Syniehubov wrote on Telegram. At least three people were injured, local authorities said. 'Kharkiv is under massive missile fire. A series of explosions rang out in the city and there are still ballistic missiles flying in the direction of the city. Stay in safe places,' Kharkiv Mayor Ihor Terekhov said. Russia’s Ministry of Defense said in its morning report Wednesday that it had shot down 59 Ukrainian drones overnight, including over the Belgorod, Voronezh, Kursk, Bryansk and Tambov regions, as well as over the Azov Sea. It did not mention the incident in North Ossetia-Alania. Four people were also killed as a result of Ukrainian shelling in the town of Lgov in the Kursk region, regional head Alexander Khinshtein said. Three people died after several residential blocks and a beauty salon were hit, he said. Another person later died in a hospital. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-missile-energy-infrastructure-christmas-906dafcdbc66bc4976b0428a5cc0d263	2024-12-24T23:27:44-08:00	
Azerbaijani airliner with 67 people onboard crashes in Kazakhstan leaving 32 survivors	An Azerbaijani airliner with 67 people onboard crashed Wednesday near the Kazakhstani city of Aktau, leaving at least 32 survivors, according to officials. More than 30 people may be dead. The plane was en route from the Azerbaijani capital of Baku to the Russian city of Grozny in the North Caucasus. Kazakhstan's Emergency Ministry said in a Telegram statement that those on board included five crew. A total of 29 survivors, including two children, have been hospitalized, the ministry told Russia's state news agency, RIA Novosti. Another Russian news agency, Interfax quoted medical workers as saying that four bodies have been recovered and emergency workers at the scene as saying that both pilots, according to a preliminary assessment, died in the crash. The Embraer 190 aircraft made an emergency landing 3 km from the city, Azerbaijan Airlines said earlier. Kazakhstan’s Emergency Ministry initially said 25 people survived the crash, later revising that number to 27, 28, and then 29 as the search and rescue operation continued at the site of the crash, bringing the supposed death toll down. The Prosecutor General's Office in Azerbaijan later reported that at least 32 people survived the crash, adding that the number wasn't final. Azerbaijan's Foreign Ministry said in a statement that some of them were in critical condition. The number of survivors could mean that over 30 people may be dead. According to Kazakhstani officials, those aboard the plane included 42 Azerbaijani citizens, 16 Russian nationals, six Kazakhstani and three Kyrgyzstani citizens, it said. RIA Novosti quoted Russia’s civil aviation authority, Rosaviatsia, as saying that preliminary information showed that the pilot had chosen to divert to Kazakhstan's Aktau after a bird strike on the aircraft led to 'an emergency situation on board'. Mobile phone footage circulating online appeared to show the aircraft making a steep descent before smashing into the ground in a fireball. Other footage showed part of its fuselage ripped away from the wings and the rest of the aircraft, lying upside in the grass. The footage corresponded to the plane’s colors and its registration number. Some of the videos posted on social media showed survivors dragging fellow passengers away from the wreckage of the plane. Flight-tracking data from FlightRadar24.com showed the aircraft making what appeared to be a figure-right once nearing the airport in Aktau, its altitude moving up and down substantially over the last minutes of the flight before impacting the ground. FlightRadar24 separately said in an online post that the aircraft had faced 'strong GPS jamming' which ' made the aircraft transmit bad ADS-B data', referring to the information that allows flight-tracking websites to follow planes in flight. Russia has been blamed in the past for jamming GPS transmissions in the wider region. In a statement, Azerbaijan Airlines said it would keep members of the public updated and changed its social media banners to solid black. Azerbaijan’s state news agency, Azertac, said that an official delegation consisting of Azerbaijan’s emergency situations minister, the country’s deputy general prosecutor, and the vice president of Azerbaijan Airlines had been dispatched to Aktau to conduct an 'on-site investigation'. Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev, who had been traveling to Russia, returned to Azerbaijan on hearing news of the crash, the president’s press service said. Aliyev was due to attend an informal meeting of leaders of the Commonwealth of Independent States, a bloc of former Soviet countries founded after the collapse of the Soviet Union, in St. Petersburg. Aliyev expressed his condolences to the families of the victims in a statement on social media. 'It is with deep sadness that I express my condolences to the families of the victims and wish a speedy recovery to those injured,' he wrote. Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke to Aliyev on the phone and expressed his condolences, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters. Speaking at the CIS meeting in St. Petersburg, Putin also said that Russia's Emergency Ministry sent a plane with equipment and medical workers to Kazakhstan to assist with the aftermath of the crash. Kazakhstani, Azerbaijani and Russian authorities said they were investigating the crash. Embraer told The Associated Press in a statement that the company is 'ready to assist all relevant authorities.'	https://apnews.com/article/azerbaijan-airliner-crash-kazakhstan-aktau-a655474030a347a5a7ddda3a77bbeddc	2024-12-24T22:53:38-08:00	
Why Palestinian forces are cracking down on Palestinian militants in the occupied West Bank	JENIN REFUGEE CAMP, West Bank (AP) — Gunfire has rung out for days from the West Bank's Jenin refugee camp. But this time, it’s not Israeli forces that are facing off against armed groups. It is the forces of the Palestinian Authority clashing with Palestinian gunmen. The Palestinian Authority, which administers parts of the occupied territory, launched a rare crackdown earlier this month that has sparked one of the worst armed confrontations between Palestinians in years. The authority says it wants to bring law and order to what's long been a hotbed of militancy and a place where it has little control. Its ability to contain armed groups there will reverberate far beyond the West Bank. The Palestinian Authority wants to position itself to take over governance in Gaza once the war there ends. But confronting Palestinians at a time when many view the authority as a subcontractor for Israel could deepen divisions in Palestinian society. Here is a look at the days of fighting between Palestinians in the West Bank: Fighting rages on the streets and at least 5 are dead Earlier this month, security forces for the Western-backed Palestinian Authority stormed into Jenin refugee camp, a restive militant stronghold, and began a crackdown against armed groups. Fighting has raged in the streets of the camp, and armored cars are seen patrolling. Palestinian security forces have taken over part of a hospital, using it as a base and shooting from inside, according to the United Nations. At least one militant from the Islamic Jihad group and three security force members have been killed, including a captain in the intelligence services whose death was announced Wednesday, according to the Palestinian forces. About 50 people have been arrested. At least two uninvolved civilians have been killed and some wounded. The fighting prompted the main U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, to suspend its services, including schooling. The violence has disrupted safe access for Palestinians to other services, including water and health. It also has complicated the restoration of services destroyed in previous Israeli raids of the camp. The Jenin refugee camp explained The urban, built-up refugee camp in the northern West Bank houses Palestinians whose families were displaced in the 1948 war surrounding Israel's creation. It has long been a center for Palestinian militancy and a bastion of armed struggle against Israel. The militant groups Islamic Jihad and Hamas operate freely there, and its streets are regularly lined with posters depicting slain fighters as martyrs for the Palestinian cause. The Palestinian Authority, which administers the main Palestinian population centers of the West Bank as part of interim peace agreements with Israel from the 1990s, has little presence in Jenin. Many people view the Palestinian Authority forces with suspicion and see them as serving Israel's interests because of security coordination that has facilitated Israel's own crackdowns on Palestinians. The refugee camp and the adjacent city of Jenin have long been targets of Israel in its stated bid to stamp out militancy. Since the start of the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza, which has sparked a wave of violence in the West Bank, Israel has raided or carried out airstrikes in Jenin multiple times, killing dozens and leaving heavy destruction. Palestinian health officials say Israeli raids throughout the West Bank since Oct. 7, 2023, have killed more than 800 Palestinians. Israel says most of these are militants, but youth throwing stones and people not involved in confrontations have also been killed. The PA raid is meant to restore order but it's also linked to postwar Gaza According to Brig. Gen. Anwar Rajab, the spokesperson for the Palestinian security forces, the raid is meant to impose law and order and restore peace and security. The troops were focused on 'eradicating' Iran-backed groups that were trying to incite 'chaos and anarchy,' he added. The raid will end when those goals are reached, according to the security forces. But the raid is also shining a spotlight on the Palestinian Authority's ability to impose order and security in a restive area. With no clear vision for who will administer postwar Gaza, the raid could convince skeptics that the authority has what it takes to rule the Palestinian enclave. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas is considering an agreement with Hamas that would create a committee of politically independent technocrats to administer the Gaza Strip after the war. The committee would report to him. The Biden administration sees a rehabilitated Palestinian Authority as the best option to govern and secure postwar Gaza. The U.S. has for years invested heavily in training the Palestinian security forces, and the administration has seen its re-entry into Gaza, after being routed by Hamas in 2007, as a feasible replacement for Hamas, whose rule Israel has sought to end with the war. Israel rejects this idea, seeing the Palestinian Authority as too weak to be able to contain Hamas. It says it will maintain open-ended security control over Gaza. The incoming Trump administration has not yet laid out its vision for postwar Gaza, but Trump's first term was overwhelmingly supportive of Israel's positions. For Palestinians, the raid highlights and deepens their internal divisions Palestinians are not strangers to divisions within their society, with the most prominent the rift between Hamas and Abbas' Fatah party. The parties fought bloody street wars in Gaza before Hamas forced Fatah out of the territory, and the sides have failed to reconcile since. Since then, the Fatah-dominated Palestinian Authority has tried to diminish Hamas' influence in the West Bank, often with Israel's help. Reeling from the yearslong internal rift, Palestinians have staged general strikes and protests calling for unity. But the raid could deepen the perception of the Palestinian Authority as a facilitator of Israel's whims and potentially undermine any popular support for it to return to effectively rule Gaza. ___ Goldenberg reported from Tel Aviv, Israel.	https://apnews.com/article/palestinians-authority-jenin-raid-israel-d698557816e2b9b674c6221511a80ef6	2024-12-24T22:09:06-08:00	
Stock market today: Asian shares are mostly lower, with most world markets closed for Christmas	BANGKOK (AP) — Shares slipped in Tokyo and Shanghai on Wednesday, two of only a handful of world markets open on Christmas day. Oil prices rose. Japan's Nikkei 225 index edged 0.1% lower to 38,997.02, while the Shanghai Composite index lost 0.2% to 3,387.41. Thursday will bring a weekly update on U.S. unemployment benefits. Also early Wednesday, U.S. benchmark crude oil was up 93 cents at $70.17 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, picked up 6 cents to $73.23 per barrel. The dollar rose to 157.37 Japanese yen from 157.11 yen. The euro rose to $1.0431 from $1.0397. On Tuesday, stocks closed higher on Wall Street in a shortened holiday session. Gains in Big Tech stocks helped the S&amp;P 500 to a 1.1% gain, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.9%. The Nasdaq composite climbed 1.3%. Advancers outnumbered decliners by more than 3-to-1 on the New York Stock Exchange. Broadcom rose 3.2%, Apple gained 1.1% and Amazon closed 1.8% higher. Super Micro Computer climbed 6%. Tesla jumped 7.4% for the biggest gains among S&amp;P 500 stocks. American Airlines shook off an early loss and ended with a 0.6% gain after the airline briefly grounded flights nationwide due to a technical issue. Elsewhere in the market, U.S. Steel rose 1.9% a day after an influential government panel failed to reach consensus on the possible national security risks of the nearly $15 billion proposed sale to Nippon Steel of Japan. NeueHealth surged 74.9% after the health care company agreed to be taken private in a deal valued at roughly $1.3 billion. Tuesday’s U.S. market 'Santa rally' comes as the stock market enters what’s historically been a very cheerful season. The last five trading days of each year, plus the first two in the new year, have brought an average gain of 1.3% since 1950. So far this month, the U.S. stock market has lost some of its gains since President-elect Donald Trump’s win on Election Day, which raised hopes for faster economic growth and more lax regulations that would boost corporate profits. Worries have risen that Trump’s preference for tariffs and other policies could lead to higher inflation, a bigger U.S. government debt and difficulties for global trade. Even so, the U.S. market remains on pace to deliver strong returns for 2024. The benchmark S&amp;P 500 is up 26.6% so far this year and remains within roughly 1% of the all-time high it set earlier this month — its latest of 57 record highs this year.	https://apnews.com/article/stocks-markets-rates-2cb9d063a156e98fe701d38dc53e3449	2024-12-24T21:25:58-08:00	
Turkey's soaring costs are creating a 'lost generation' of kids forced to help their families get by	ISTANBUL (AP) — In a dim one-room apartment in one of Istanbul’s poorest neighborhoods, 11-year-old Atakan Sahin curls up on a threadbare sofa with his siblings to watch TV while their mother stirs a pot of pasta. The simple meal is all the family of six can look forward to most evenings. Atakan, his two younger brothers and 5-year-old sister are among the one-third of Turkish children living in poverty. 'Look at the state of my children,' said Rukiye Sahin, 28. 'I have four children. They don’t get to eat chicken, they don’t get to eat meat. I send them to school with torn shoes.' Persistently high inflation, triggered by currency depreciation and unconventional economic policies that President Recep Tayyip Erdogan pursued but later abandoned, has left many families struggling to pay for food and housing. Experts say it's creating a lost generation of children who have been forced to grow up too quickly to help their families eke out an existence. According to a 2023 joint report by UNICEF and the Turkish Statistical Institute, about 7 million of Turkey's roughly 22.2 million children live in poverty. That deprivation is brought into stark focus in neighborhoods such as Istanbul’s Tarlabasi, where the Sahin family lives just a few minutes’ walk from Istiklal Avenue, a tourism hot spot bristling with brightly lit shops and expensive restaurants. Meanwhile, the Sahins eat sitting on the floor of their room — the same floor Rukiye and her husband sleep on while their children occupy the room’s sofas. In the chilly early December night, a stove burns scraps of wood to keep them warm. They sometimes fall asleep to the sound of rats scuttling through the building. Atakan spends his days helping his father scour dumpsters in search of recyclable material to earn the family a meager income. Poor children in Istanbul also earn money for their families by selling small items such as pens, tissues or bracelets at the bars and cafes in the city's entertainment districts, often working late into the night. 'I can’t go to school because I have no money,' he said. 'We have nothing. Can you tell me how I can go? On sunny days, when I don’t go to school, I collect plastic and other things with my father. We sell whatever we find.' The cash helps buy basic foodstuffs and pay for his siblings to attend school. On the days Atakan can attend, he is ill-equipped to succeed, lacking proper shoes, a coat and textbooks for the English class he loves. The Sahins struggle to scrape together the money to cover the rent, utilities and other basic expenses as Turkey’s cost-of-living crisis continues to rage. Inflation stood at 47% in November, having peaked at 85% in late 2022. Prices of food and nonalcoholic drinks were 5.1% higher in November than in the previous month. Under these circumstances, a generation of children is growing up rarely enjoying a full meal of fresh meat or vegetables. Rukiye and her husband receive 6,000 lira ($173) per month in government welfare to help towards school costs, but they pay the same amount in rent for their home. 'My son says, ‘Mom, it’s raining, my shoes are soaking wet.’ But what can I do?' Rukiye said. 'The state doesn’t help me. I’m in this room alone with my children. Who do I have except them?' The picture of children rummaging through garbage to help support their families is far from the image Turkey presents to the world: that of an influential world power with a vibrant economy favorable to foreign investment. Erdogan is proud of the social programs his party has introduced since he came to power more than 20 years ago, boasting that the 'old days of prohibitions, oppression, deprivation and poverty are completely behind us.' Speaking at the G20 summit in November, Erdogan described Turkey’s social security system as 'one of the most comprehensive and inclusive' in the world. 'Our goal is to ensure that not a single poor person remains. We will continue our work until we achieve this,' he said. Finance Minister Mehmet Simsek, tasked with implementing austerity and taming inflation, said the 17,000 lira ($488) monthly minimum wage isn't low. But he has pledged to raise it as soon as possible. Although the government allocates billions of lira to struggling households, inflation, which most people agree is far above the official figure, eats into any aid the state can give. In districts such as Tarlabasi, rents have risen five-fold in recent years due to gentrification in central Istanbul that puts pressure on the housing market for low-income families. Experts say welfare payments aren't enough for the millions who rely on them, forcing many parents to make impossible choices: Should they pay the rent or buy clothing for the children? Should they send them to school or keep them home to earn a few extra lira? Volunteers are trying to ease the cycle of deprivation. Mehmet Yeralan, a 53-year-old former restaurant owner, brings essentials to Tarlabasi’s poor people that they can't afford, including coats, notebooks and the occasional bag of rice. 'Our children do not deserve this,' he said, warming himself by a barrel of burning scrap wood on the street. 'Families are in very difficult situations. They cannot buy food for their children and send them to school. Children are on the streets, selling tissues to support their families. We are seeing deep poverty here.' Hacer Foggo, a poverty researcher and activist, said Turkey is raising a lost generation who are forced to drop out of school to work or are channeled into vocational programs where they work four days and study one day per week, receiving a small fraction of the minimum wage. 'Look at the situation of children,' she said. 'Two million of them are in deep poverty. Child labor has become very common. Families choose these education-work programs because children bring in some income. It’s not a real education, just cheaper labor.' Foggo points to research showing how early childhood education can help break cycles of poverty. Without it, children remain trapped — stunted physically and educationally, and condemned to lifelong disadvantages. UNICEF placed Turkey 38th out of 39 European Union or Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries in terms of child poverty between 2019 and 2021, with a child poverty rate of 34%. The tragic consequences of this destitution occasionally burst into the public arena. The deaths of five children in a fire in the western city of Izmir in November happened while their mother was out collecting scrap to sell. The image of their sobbing father, who was escorted from prison in handcuffs to attend his children’s funeral, caused widespread outrage at the desperation and helplessness facing poor families. It is a situation Rukiye fully understands. 'Sometimes I go to bed hungry, sometimes I go to bed full,' she said. 'We can’t move forward, we always fall behind. ... When you don’t have money in your hands, you always fall behind.' Her eldest son, meanwhile, clings to his childhood dreams. 'I want my own room,' Atakan said. 'I want to go to school regularly. I want everything to be in order. … I’d like to be a football player one day, to support my family.' ___ Badendieck reported from Istanbul.

After 20 years, the post-tsunami generation stays vigilant for future disasters	LHOKNGA, Indonesia (AP) — Qurrata Ayuni, a 28-year-old survivor of the earthquake and tsunami that devastated her hometown two decades ago, has transformed her resilience into purpose. Defying Aceh's male-dominated coffee culture, she runs a café that serves as a welcoming space for everyone, especially women, by employing and empowering them in the region worst hit by the tragedy. On Dec. 26, 2004, a powerful 9.1-magnitude earthquake, off the coast of the Indonesian island of Sumatra, triggered a tsunami that killed around 230,000 people across a dozen countries, reaching as far as East Africa. Some 160,000 of those were in Aceh, at the northwestern tip of Indonesia. Ayuni survived the tsunami by chance, staying at her aunt’s house in Banda Aceh instead of her family home in Lampuuk, Aceh Besar district. However, the disaster shattered her childhood, claiming the lives of her parents and younger sister, who was only 6 when their home was hit by the giant waves. Infrastructure in Aceh has been rebuilt and is now stronger than before the tsunami. Early warning systems have been set up in areas closer to shores, to warn residents of a potential tsunami. About 14 kilometers (9 miles) from Ayuni’s coffee shop, in a public high school in Lhoknga, students regularly take part in disaster simulations, especially when there is a warning of an earthquake, and get ready to evacuate ahead of a possible tsunami. They hide under the table and chant dhikr (the Islamic prayer) 'la ilaha illallah,' which means 'there’s no God but Allah,' while waiting for the next direction to move from their classroom to the designated assembly point which is on the field at the front of the school. The school has a devastating history. Situated about one kilometer (half a mile) from the shore, it was totally destroyed and flattened to the ground like other buildings. This school was one of over 1,400 that were wrecked by the tsunami, according to a report by the Disaster Mitigation Research Center at Syiah Kuala University in Aceh, published in 2019. Some of the teachers are survivors of that disaster. They were only teenagers when they saw the giant waves, some as high as coconut trees. They are the only ones left at the school who experienced the disaster, as all the students now were born after 2004. They have only heard the story about the quake followed by three giant waves and the impact from their parents. 'We also want to educate them about the history of the tsunami. We don’t want them to remain ignorant about that history, that there was a tragedy that may be dark for some people,' said Eka Sari Dewi, the school principal. 'However, today as the younger generation, they must know what they should do after the tsunami.' That is why Dewi has followed the government policy of educating her students about tsunamis, teaching them to remain alert and be ready to evacuate to safer places when required. After about a year of disaster simulations at school on the 26th of every month, students have become very alert and are ready to act when the disaster alarm rings. 'This simulation is very useful because if a disaster happens, we will know how to do self-rescue. Then we also won’t be confused like people in the past,' Rihadatul Aisy, one of the students, said. Fazli, the head of Preparedness in Aceh Disaster Management Agency, who like many Indonesians uses a single name, said that the simulation aims to build school community capacity, raise awareness and prepare students for earthquakes by equipping them with vital earthquake and tsunami information and ensuring readiness anytime, anywhere. 'The biggest hope is that there will be minimal casualties when the (next) disaster occurs,' Fazli said. Survivors who faced disasters at a very young age like Ayuni cannot directly digest what they faced in the past. However, there is hope that younger generations can be better prepared to face such challenges in the future. 'I hope the younger generation doesn’t forget that we were once hit by a very powerful tsunami. So for now, even though our infrastructure may have turned around and is very good, our economy has come back again, don’t forget the old incident,' Ayuni said.	https://apnews.com/article/indonesia-aceh-tsunami-anniversary-6b91150437c2820ad59130c060b905ef	2024-12-24T16:59:53-08:00	
Soccer star Cristiano Ronaldo takes family to Lapland for Christmas vacation	Soccer star Cristiano Ronaldo said it was 'just a little cold' as he posed bare-chested in the snow before taking an icy dip in a pool during a Christmas vacation in Finland’s Lapland region. The 39-year-old Portuguese international traveled with partner Georgina Rodriguez and their children, who met Santa Claus in a 10-minute video posted online by Ronaldo on Tuesday. The former Real Madrid and Manchester United great appeared to decline to ski with his family. He wished his followers — including 645 million on Instagram — a 'Merry Christmas' in Spanish.

21 dead as Mozambique erupts in violence after election court ruling	MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) — Violence that engulfed Mozambique after the country's highest court confirmed ruling Frelimo party presidential candidate Daniel Chapo as the winner of disputed Oct. 9 elections killed at least 21 people, including two police officers, authorities said Tuesday. Mozambique Interior Minister Pascoal Ronda told a news conference in Maputo late Tuesday that a wave of violence and looting was sparked by the court's announcement a day earlier. He said it was led by mostly youthful supporters of losing candidate Venancio Mondlane, who received 24% of the vote, second to Chapo, who got 65%. 'From the preliminary survey, in the last 24 hours, 236 acts of violence were recorded throughout the national territory that resulted in 21 deaths, of which two members of the Police of the Republic of Mozambique also died,' Ronda said. He said 13 civilians and 12 police were injured. Ronda said 25 vehicles were set on fire, including two police vehicles. He added that 11 police subunits and a penitentiary were attacked and vandalized and 86 inmates were freed. Tensions were high in the country ahead of the The Constitutional Council ruling on Monday and violent protests started immediately after the announcement was made. Footage circulating on various social media platforms showed protesters burning and looting shops in the capital Maputo and the city of Beira, where some city officials were reported to have fled the city. Mondlane has called for a 'shutdown' starting Friday but violence in the country has already escalated and the situation remained tense in the capital on Tuesday night following a day of violence and looting by protesters. The country of 34 million people has been on edge since the Oct. 9 general elections. Mondlane’s supporters, mostly hundreds of thousands of young people, have since taken to the streets, and have been met by gunfire from security forces. This brings to more than 150 the number of people who have died from post-election violence since the initial results were announced by the country's electoral body.	https://apnews.com/article/mozambique-elections-dispute-violence-frelimo-chapo-20c3173fe8c3baf89b2f3598c37ef7c9	2024-12-24T13:30:06-08:00	
Spain's monarch pays tribute to the victims of Valencia floods in his Christmas Eve speech	MADRID (AP) — Spanish King Felipe VI used his traditional Christmas Eve speech to remember the victims of the catastrophic Valencia flash floods, and urged the country to remain calm while addressing hot-button issues such as immigration and housing affordability. In a pre-recorded speech that usually reviews the year's most relevant issues, Felipe said Spain 'must never forget the pain and sadness' the floods caused. The Oct. 29 floods killed more than 225 people in eastern Spain, damaging countless homes and leaving graveyards of cars piled on top of each other. In some towns, the heavy downpours that caused the floods dropped as much as a year's worth of rain in just eight hours. In early November, as Spaniards' shock at the wreckage turned into frustration, a political blame game began, directed especially at regional authorities who failed to send timely emergency alerts to cell phones on the day of the floods. The frustration of residents in hard-hit Paiporta near Valencia was on display when people tossed mud and shouted insults at the king and government officials in early November when they made their first visit to the town. 'We have seen — and understood — the frustration, the pain, the impatience, the demands for greater and more effective coordination,' Felipe said about how the disaster was managed. He also addressed the country's housing crunch and high rents, which have become a leading concern in the southern European country that is the eurozone's fourth-largest economy. Fast-rising rents are especially acute in cities like Barcelona and Madrid, where incomes have failed to keep up, especially for younger people in a country with chronically high unemployment. Felipe urged that 'all the actors involved reflect' and 'listen to each other' so that they facilitate bringing access to housing under 'affordable conditions.' Spain's immigration debate should keep in mind the country's European partners and immigrants' countries of origin, Felipe said, warning that 'the way in which we are able to address immigration ... will say a lot in the future about our principles and the quality of our democracy.' Felipe said Spain needed to remain calm in the public sphere, even in the face of a 'sometimes thunderous' contest in its politics.	https://apnews.com/article/spain-christmas-king-felipe-valencia-floods-33efefc986c9f40e743be44e142174de	2024-12-24T13:22:28-08:00	
Haiti gangs fire on journalists covering a planned hospital reopening, leaving casualties	PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) — Suspected gang members opened fire on journalists in Haiti's capital on Tuesday as they were covering the attempted reopening of the country's largest hospital, wounding or killing an unknown number of people. Haiti's interim president, Leslie Voltaire, said in an address to the nation that journalists and police were among the victims of the vicious Christmas Eve attack. He did not specify how many casualties there were, or give a breakdown for the dead or wounded. 'I send my sympathies to the people who were victims, the national police and the journalists,' Voltaire said, pledging 'this crime is not going to go unpunished.' There were concerns there could be fatalities — a video posted online by the reporters trapped inside the hospital showed what appeared to be two lifeless bodies of men on stretchers, their clothes bloodied. One of the men had a lanyard with a press credential around his neck. Radio Télé Métronome initially reported that seven journalists and two police officers were wounded. Police and officials did not immediately respond to calls for information on the attack. Street gangs have taken over an estimated 85% of Haiti's capital, Port-au-Prince. They forced the closure of the General Hospital early this year during violence that also targeted the main international airport and Haiti’s two largest prisons. Authorities had pledged to reopen the facility Tuesday but as journalists gathered to cover the event, suspected gang members opened fire. Video posted online earlier showed reporters inside the building and at least three lying on the floor, apparently wounded. That video could also not be immediately verified. Johnson 'Izo' André, considered Haiti’s most powerful gang leader and part of a gang coalition known as Viv Ansanm that has taken control of much of Port-au-Prince, posted a video on social media claiming responsibility for the attack. The video said the gang coalition had not authorized the hospital's reopening. Haiti has seen journalists targeted before. In 2023, two local journalists were killed in the space of a couple of weeks — radio reporter Dumesky Kersaint was fatally shot in mid-April that year, while journalist Ricot Jean was found dead later that month. In July, former Prime Minister Garry Conille visited the Hospital of the State University of Haiti, more widely known as the General Hospital, after authorities regained control of it from gangs. The hospital had been left ravaged and strewn with debris. Walls and nearby buildings were riddled with bullet holes, signaling fights between police and gangs. The hospital is across the street from the national palace, the scene of several battles in recent months. Gang attacks have pushed Haiti’s health system to the brink of collapse with looting, setting fires, and destroying medical institutions and pharmacies in the capital. The violence has created a surge in patients and a shortage of resources to treat them. Haiti’s health care system faces additional challenges during the rainy season, which is likely to increase the risk of water-borne diseases. Poor conditions in camps and makeshift settlements have heightened the risk of diseases like cholera, with over 84,000 suspected cases in the country, according to UNICEF. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america	https://apnews.com/article/haiti-gang-violence-capital-journalists-a7b6c5606f112e8098b390f3b83763ca	2024-12-24T11:01:46-08:00	
Medellin Cartel victims demand truth and justice as cartel boss Fabio Ochoa walks free in Colombia	BOGOTÁ, Colombia (AP) — The return of former drug trafficker Fabio Ochoa to Colombia following his deportation from the United States has reopened old wounds among victims of the Medellín Cartel, with some expressing dismay at the Colombian authorities' decision to let Ochoa walk free. Some of the cartel victims said Tuesday they are hoping the former drug lord will at least cooperate with ongoing efforts by human rights groups to investigate one of the most violent periods of Colombia’s history and demanded that Colombian prosecutors also take Ochoa in for questioning. In the late 80s and early 90s the Medellín Cartel killed police officers, politicians, judges, journalists and bystanders as it waged war on the Colombian state, which had stepped up its efforts to interdict drug shipments, arrest drug traffickers and seize their properties. Some historians in Colombia attribute 10,000 killings to cartel leader Pablo Escobar. Ochoa was one of the cartel's key operators at the time and lived for several years in Miami where he ran a distribution center for the cocaine cartel. He has denied being involved in the cartel killings. But many victims of the cartel and their relatives are highly skeptical of that claim. Bogotá Mayor Carlos Fernando Galán was 12 when his father, presidential candidate Luis Carlos Galán was killed by cartel hitmen in 1989. On Monday night Galán wrote in a message on X that it was 'unacceptable' for Ochoa not to be facing any charges in Colombia. Galán’s older brother, Juan Manuel Galán, went further. 'The majority of the (Medellín Cartel’s) crimes are in impunity' he wrote on X. 'Along with thousands of victims we hope to know the truth about Ochoa’s responsibility and that of his allies in kidnappings, murders and indiscriminate acts of terrorism.' Ochoa was deported to Colombia on Monday after serving more than 20 years in prison in the U.S. for a drug trafficking conviction, which was not related to any killings in Colombia. The 67-year-old had his fingerprints taken at the airport and was let go by immigration officials who ran his name through a database and confirmed he is not wanted by Colombian authorities. Speaking to journalists, who frantically swarmed around him in Bogotá’s airport, Ochoa claimed he had been 'framed' by U.S. prosecutors. He added that he had paid for his drug trafficking crimes in Colombia in the early 1990s, when he spent several years in a Colombian prison. Ochoa was released in 1996 but was once again arrested in 1999 and was extradited to the U.S. in 2001 in response to an indictment in Miami naming him and more than 40 others as part of a drug smuggling conspiracy. Gonzalo Enrique Rojas was a young boy in 1989 when his father died on a commercial plane that was blown up by the Medellín Cartel, killing all 107 people on board. Rojas, who now leads a foundation for victims of Colombia’s conflict said that Ochoa’s return to Colombia presents an opportunity for more details to be known about that incident, such as what motivated the cartel to attack a plane full of civilians, and what were its relations with members of the Colombian government. He said that Colombian prosecutors should interrogate Ochoa about this event and other crimes committed by the cartel. He added that his foundation, Colombia with Memory, will also try to seek a meeting with the former cartel boss. 'The years in prison (for cartel leaders) are not that relevant for those of us who are victims of the Medellín cartel,' Rojas said. 'What really repairs the pain is justice and truth.'	https://apnews.com/article/fabio-ochoa-medellin-cartel-pablo-escobar-justice-73714b3562bac85dafc634a7f803137a	2024-12-24T08:25:58-08:00	
The pope is kicking off a yearlong Jubilee that will test his stamina and Rome's patience	VATICAN CITY (AP) — Pope Francis on Tuesday opens the 2025 Holy Year, kicking off a celebration of the Catholic Church that is expected to draw some 32 million pilgrims to Rome and test the pope's stamina and the ability of the Eternal City to welcome them. At the start of Christmas Eve Mass, Francis pushes open the great Holy Door at the entrance of St. Peter’s Basilica. The ceremony inaugurates the once-every-25-year tradition of a Jubilee, in which the Catholic faithful make pilgrimages to Rome. Francis has dedicated the 2025 Jubilee to the theme of hope, and he will underscore that message when he opens a Holy Door on Thursday at Rome’s Rebibbia prison in a bid to give inmates hope for a better future. Francis has long incorporated prison ministry into his priestly vocation, and has made several visits to Rebibbia and other prisons during his travels. Security around the Vatican was at its highest levels following the Christmas market attack last week in Germany, the interior ministry said. Italian authorities were using extra police patrols and camera surveillance around Rome, while pilgrims faced metal detectors and other security checks to access St. Peter's Square via a reinforced police barricade passage. Francis, who turned 88 last week, went into the Christmas week and Jubilee launch with a cold that forced him to deliver his weekly Sunday blessing from indoors. His health and stamina, already compromised because of his tendency to get bronchitis, are a concern given the rigorous calendar of events during the Holy Year. One of the highlights will be the canonization of the teenage internet whiz Carlo Acutis, considered the first millennial and digital-era saint, during the Jubilee dedicated to adolescents in April. This week, Francis celebrates Christmas Eve Mass on Tuesday evening and then delivers his annual 'Urbi et Orbi' (to the city and the world) speech on Christmas Day from the loggia of St. Peter’s Basilica. In addition to the outing at Rebibbia, he will celebrate New Year’s Eve vespers and a New Year’s Day Mass. The city of Rome is going into the Jubilee with some trepidation. It has undergone two years of traffic-clogging public works upgrades of transportation, hospital emergency rooms and other vital services, testing residents' patience. But only about a third of the 323 projects have been completed, and the city is already groaning under the weight of overtourism. Visitors have returned to Italy in droves following COVID-19, and the explosion of short-term vacation rentals has exacerbated a housing crisis. Some of Rome's prized monuments have reopened recently, including the Trevi Fountain. And the main Jubilee project was finished just in time: A pedestrian piazza linking Castel St. Angelo to the Via della Conciliazione, the main boulevard leading to St. Peter’s Square, was unveiled Monday. Vatican officials insist that Rome has a tradition of welcoming pilgrims and point to how past Jubilees have left their mark on the Eternal City’s urban and spiritual landscape. The Sistine Chapel was commissioned by Pope Sixtus IV for the Jubilee of 1475, and the big Vatican garage was built for the 2000 Jubilee under St. John Paul II. Pope Boniface VII called the first Holy Year in 1300, and in recent times they are generally celebrated every 25 to 50 years. Pilgrims who participate can obtain 'indulgences' — the related to the forgiveness of sins that roughly amounts to a 'get out of Purgatory free' card. Francis declared a special Jubilee in 2015-2016 dedicated to mercy and the next one is planned for 2033 to commemorate the anniversary of the crucifixion of Christ. The last regular Jubilee was in 2000, when St. John Paul II ushered in the church’s third millennium. The one before that, in 1975, was notable because Pope Paul VI was nearly hit by falling plaster when he opened the Holy Door. The door was still behind a fake wall and Paul had used a ceremonial hammer to bang on it three times to open it. The fake wall now is removed well in advance. ___ Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

Seafarers move global trade — and Christmas gifts. These ministries bring them holiday cheer	BARCELONA, Spain (AP) — On a balmy December evening, four Indian crew members, eager to go explore this Mediterranean city where their container ship docked for a few hours, turned for help to Stella Maris. It’s the largest of the faith-based organizations that minister to seafarers in hundreds of ports around the world. 'We just call them, they help us with everything,' from connecting with far-away families on video to changing currency to delivering small Christmas gifts, said second officer Sunit Kamal. And they donate Bibles in different languages too, the 33-year-old added in the organization’s small lobby next to a statue of Mary, one of whose ancient titles is 'star of the sea,' or Stella Maris in Latin. Whether it’s offering religious services, helping address labor abuses, or something as practical as serving as a delivery spot for Amazon packages, faith leaders and volunteers don’t see their work as charity. Rather, their ministry is a way of affirming the human rights of the seafarers who keep global trade moving, often for low wages and in harsh conditions far from most people’s view — even in such popular tourist hotspots as Barcelona. 'It’s all pastoral care because it’s to help a person in what they need as a person,' said Ricard Rodríguez-Martos, the Catholic deacon and former merchant marine captain who leads Stella Maris in Barcelona, where it’s supported by the bishops’ council. 'Seafarers are used to being seen by the people on land as a piece of the ship.' Seafarers help move global trade, but their needs often go unheeded According to the United Nations, more than 80% of the volume of international trade in goods is transported on the seas, making seafarers crucial to consumer products from veggies to cars. Founded more than 100 years ago in Scotland by a group of Catholic volunteers, Stella Maris is now present in more than 50 countries and 350 ports, from Barcelona to Buenos Aires, from Manila to Miami, said Tim Hill, national director of Stella Maris UK, the biggest national entity in the network. 'Our mission is to provide practical, pastoral and spiritual support to seafarers, fishers and their families of any creed,' Hill said. 'We get presented loads of problems.' The seafarers’ top concern is isolation — especially as stays in port are getting shorter and ships are increasingly ethnically diverse, leaving mostly male crews from places as different as the Philippines and Ukraine with little that’s familiar on extended sea voyages. Volunteers visiting docked ships are most often asked for SIM cards to contact families, but they also get far graver requests — from hospital visits for injured seafarers to help with bullying, harassment, lack of shore leave, or even cases where a vessel is abandoned and its crew left without food, pay, or the means to go home, Hill said. A global network of seafarer ministries Crews often feel safer speaking confidentially with a chaplain, who then can alert law enforcement and help with legal assistance across different countries. Just last summer, a chaplain in Houston, Texas, alerted Rodríguez-Martos that a ship 'with many problems' was headed to Barcelona. The deacon reported it to port authorities, who boarded the vessel in Spain and required the shipowner to fix the issues, Rodríguez-Martos said. He also works closely with his counterparts in Marseille, France, which is often the previous port of call along the Mediterranean. Just like Barcelona, which hosted the America’s Cup regattas this fall, Marseille starred this year as the venue for Olympic sailing. But it’s a very different world on the commercial and cruise ship docks and along the dozens of kilometers (miles) that Stella Maris minivans travel daily to get to ships for visits and to bring seafarers back to their offices. In both cities, the centers include a 'club' with a little bar, some souvenirs for sale, basic entertainment like small basketball courts or tables for pool, foosball, and table tennis. Literature includes religious magazines and maps to the cities’ attractions — especially popular since seafarers 'need to see something else' after months at sea, said Gérard Pelen, one of the founders of the ministry in Marseille. Many ask to be taken to Notre Dame de la Garde, the Catholic basilica whose interior is decorated in maritime-themed votive offerings, said Marc Feuillebois, the director of the welcome center in Marseille’s cruise ship terminal. It hosts about 10,000 seafarers a year. 'It’s the first and the last thing they see,' Feuillebois said of the hilltop church that overlooks the bay of Marseille. Faith at sea, from Masses to boarding Nativity scenes for Christmas Some observant seafarers also ask to be taken to worship services or to have a faith leader hold one onboard, though interest has declined over the years. 'We only get into the subject if we see they’re interested,' Rodríguez-Martos said. He is planning Christmas Eve Mass even though last year not one seafarer showed up for it in the little Stella Maris chapel, where a figure of Christ is fixed to an old anchor as if it were a cross. On Christmas day, ships are often out at sea instead of at ports, where they would have to pay duties also on non-working days. But regardless of their own practice, seafarers remain very eager to meet with the volunteers and faith leaders for some much-needed, non-judgmental human contact. 'They know what they say, it won’t be shared. Within five minutes, we’re in confidence, without filters,' said Jean-Philippe Rigaud, a Catholic deacon who leads the ministry in Marseille. Rigaud, who’s retired from a career on container ships and then as port pilot, said seafarers share what’s troubling them, ask for prayers or simply about what’s happening in world news. His wife of nearly 50 years, Marie-Agnes Rigaud, noted the importance of ministering to the seafarers’ families too. She remembers reaching out to the family of a seafarer from the Philippines for whom she had prayed a rosary at the morgue, and she’s frequently hosted some for Christmas meals in their house in a village outside Marseille. 'They’re people who are for the most part very lonely,' said Bryan Parrish, an American Protestant pastor who plans to volunteer at the Marseille mission after starting a 'seaman’s club' in La Rochelle, on France’s Atlantic coast, more than 30 years ago. Tackling that loneliness is at the heart of the mission to seafarers, even in small gestures. On Christmas Eve, for instance, Stella Maris delivered hand-sized Nativity scenes and nougat candy to seven ships docked in Barcelona. 'It’s a way of saying, ’It’s Christmas, we’re thinking of you,' Rodríguez-Martos said. ___ Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

Global monitor says famine is weeks away in north Gaza. A US diplomat calls warning 'irresponsible'	WASHINGTON (AP) — Deaths from starvation will likely pass famine levels in northern Gaza as soon as next month owing to Israel's 'near-total blockade' of food and other aid, the U.S.-created global food-crisis monitor said on Tuesday. The finding by the Famine Early Warning System Network appeared to expose a rift within the Biden administration over the extent of starvation in northern Gaza, with the U.S. ambassador to Israel, Jacob Lew, disputing part of the data used in reaching the conclusion and calling the stepped-up famine warning 'irresponsible.' Northern Gaza has been one of the areas hardest-hit by fighting and Israel's restrictions on aid throughout its 14-month war with Hamas militants. Israel at one point increased the number of aid deliveries it permitted into northern Gaza under pressure from President Joe Biden. But the U.N. and aid groups say Israel recently has blocked almost all aid again. Only nine U.N. trucks have been able to bring in food and water over the past 2 1/2 months, Oxfam says. Israel says it has been operating in recent months against Hamas militants still active in northern Gaza. It says the vast majority of the area’s residents have fled and relocated to Gaza City, where most aid destined for the north is delivered. But some critics, including a former defense minister, have accused Israel of carrying out ethnic cleansing in Gaza’s far north, near the Israeli border. FEWS Net said unless Israel changes its policy, it expects the number of people dying of starvation and related ailments in northern Gaza to reach between two and 15 per day sometime between next month and March. The internationally recognized mortality threshold for famine is two or more deaths a day per 10,000 people. Cindy McCain, the American head of the U.N. World Food Program, in a Dec. 15 appearance on CBS' 'Face the Nation' called for political pressure to get food flowing to Palestinians trapped in north Gaza. 'We need unfettered access. We need a ceasefire and we need it now,' she said. 'We can't ... sit by and just allow these people to starve to death.' FEWS Net was created by the U.S. Agency for International Development in the mid-1980s to warn of global food crises. The United States, Israel's main backer, provided a record amount of military support in the first year of the war. At the same time, the Biden administration repeatedly urged Israel to allow more access to aid deliveries in Gaza overall, and warned that failing to do so could trigger U.S. restrictions on military support. The administration recently said Israel was making improvements and declined to carry out its threat of restrictions. Military support for Israel's war in Gaza is politically charged in the United States. Republicans and some Democrats have staunchly opposed any effort to limit U.S. support over the suffering of Palestinian civilians trapped in the conflict. The Biden administration's reluctance to do more to press Israel for improved treatment of civilians undercut support for Democrats in last month's elections. Lew, the U.S. ambassador, challenged the famine warning in a posting on social media, saying it was based on 'outdated and inaccurate' data. He pointed to uncertainty over how many of the 65,000 people remaining in northern Gaza had fled in recent weeks, saying that skewed the findings. FEWS said its famine assessment holds even if as few as 10,000 remain there. 'We work day and night with the U.N. and our Israeli partners to meet humanitarian needs — which are great — and relying on inaccurate data is irresponsible.,' Lew wrote. ___ AP writers Matthew Lee in Washington and Josef Federman in Jerusalem contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/famine-gaza-warning-israel-united-states-8333697957bed4df13f5ab0c1582d4bd	2024-12-24T06:54:27-08:00

Russian cargo ship sinks in the Mediterranean after engine room blast, leaving 2 crew missing	MADRID (AP) — A Russian cargo ship sank in the Mediterranean Sea between Spain and Algeria, leaving two crew members missing, Spain's maritime rescue agency and the Russian Foreign Ministry said Tuesday. Fourteen of the Ursa Major's crew were rescued uninjured from a lifeboat and transferred to Spain, the agency said. The Russian ministry said the ship started sinking following an explosion in the engine room. The vessel was owned by SK-Yug, a subsidiary of the Russian shipping and logistics company Oboronlogistika, which was established under Russia's defense ministry and placed under U.S. and European Union sanctions for its ties to Russia's military. Spanish authorities said there were empty containers and two cranes on board. They did not confirm the cause of the accident. In a statement on Dec. 20, Oboronlogistika said the cargo ship was headed to Russia’s far eastern city of Vladivostok carrying two cranes for the port weighing 380 tons each. Ursa Major had left St. Petersburg 12 days ago, Russian state news agency Ria Novosti said. Spanish authorities said they received an alert around 1 p.m. Monday when the vessel was roughly 57 nautical miles (106 kilometers) from Almería in southeastern Spain. The maritime rescue agency contacted a ship nearby that reported poor weather conditions, a lifeboat in the water and the Ursa Major listing. Authorities said a Russian warship arrived later Monday to oversee rescue operations, and the 142-meter (466-foot) cargo vessel sank around midnight. The Russian embassy in Spain told RIA Novosti it was investigating the accident and was in contact with local authorities. Ursa Major was in the western Mediterranean at the same time as Sparta — another Russian cargo ship under U.S. sanctions — whose destination as reported Tuesday was Port Said in Egypt, according to ship-spotting platform MarineTraffic.com. It’s not unusual for Russian ships going from St. Petersburg to Vladivostok to transit through the Mediterranean and the Suez Canal. With global warming, the Northern Sea Route via Russia’s Arctic is increasingly traversed year-round, but most ships still choose the southern route in winter. Spanish maritime rescue units remained in the area Tuesday to monitor for pollution and remove any floating objects that could be dangerous for navigation, authorities said. ___ Associated Press reporter Katie Marie Davies contributed from Manchester, England.	https://apnews.com/article/russia-cargo-ship-sink-spain-sinks-913523dbb0dc39bfd48a0382c3ad5773	2024-12-24T04:29:23-08:00	
Kurdish-led forces push back Turkish-backed Syrian rebels in a tense offensive	QAMISHLI, Syria (AP) — Kurdish-led fighters in Syria, known as the Syrian Democratic Forces, said Tuesday they have launched a counter-offensive against the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army to take back areas near Syria’s northern border with Turkey. The Kurdish-led SDF is Washington’s critical ally in Syria, targeting sleeper cells of the extremist Islamic State group scattered across the country's east. Since the fall of the totalitarian rule of Bashar Assad earlier this month, clashes have intensified between the U.S.-backed group and the SNA, which captured the key city of Manbij and the areas surrounding it. The intense weekslong clashes come at a time when Syria, battered by over a decade of war and economic misery, negotiates its political future following half a century under the Assad dynasty’s rule. Ruken Jamal, spokesperson of the Women’s Protection Unit, or YPJ, which is under the SDF, told The Associated Press that its fighters are just over 11 kilometers (7 miles) away from the center of Manbij in their ongoing counter-offensive. She accused Ankara of trying to weaken the group’s influence in negotiations over Syria’s political future through the SNA, 'Syria is now in a new phase, and discussions are underway about the future of the country,' Jamal said. 'Turkey is trying, through its attacks, to distract us with battles and exclude us from the negotiations in Damascus.' A Britain-based opposition war monitor, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, says that since the SNA’s offensive in northern Syria against the Kurds started earlier this month, dozens from both sides have been killed. U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin spoke on Tuesday with Turkish Minister of National Defense Yaşar Güler, according to Pentagon press secretary Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder. Ryder said they discussed the ongoing situation in Syria, and Austin emphasized that close and continuous coordination is crucial to a successful effort to counter IS in the country. They also discussed the importance of setting the conditions to enable a more secure and stable Syria. Ankara sees the SDF as an affiliate of its sworn enemy, the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, or PKK, which it classifies as a terrorist organization. Turkish-backed armed groups alongside Turkish jets for years have attacked positions where the SDF are largely present across northern Syria, in a bid to create a buffer zone free from the group along the large shared border. While the SNA was involved in the lightning insurgency — led by the Islamic group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham — that toppled Assad, it has continued its push against the SDF, seen as Syria’s second key actor for its political future. On Monday, the SDF spokesperson Farhad Shami said its forces pushed back the Turkish-backed rebels from areas near the Tishrin Dam on the Euphrates River, a key source of hydroelectric power. He said the SDF also destroyed a tank belonging to the rebels southeast of Manbij. The British-based war monitor said on Tuesday that the Kurdish-led group, following overnight fighting, has reclaimed four villages in the areas near the strategic dam. Turkish jets also pounded the strategic border town of Kobani in recent days. During Syria’s uprising-turned-conflict, the Kurds carved out an enclave of autonomous rule across northeastern Syria, never fully allying entirely with Assad in Damascus nor the rebels trying to overthrow him. Even with the Assad family out of the picture, it appears that Ankara’s position won’t change, with Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan’s landmark visit to Syria maintaining a strong position on the Kurdish-led group in his meeting with HTS's de facto leader Ahmad al-Sharaa. 'It has turned the region into a cauldron of terror with PKK members and far-left groups who have come from Turkey, Iraq, Iran and Europe,' Fidan said in a news conference after the meeting. 'The international community is turning a blind eye to this lawlessness because of the wardenship it provides (against IS).' With the ongoing fighting, SDF Commander Mazloum Abdi has expressed concern about a strong IS resurgence due to the power vacuum in Syria and the ongoing fighting, which has left the Kurdish-led group unable to carry out its attacks and raids on the extremists’ scattered sleeper cells. Tens of thousands of children, family members, and supporters of IS militants are still held in large detention centers in northeastern Syria, in areas under SDF control. ___ Chehayeb reported from Beirut.	https://apnews.com/article/syria-kurds-turkey-sdf-manbij-kobani-84928d1755cc09c239fe00074291ff0f	2024-12-24T04:22:36-08:00	
Amsterdam court sentences 5 men over violence linked to Ajax-Maccabi soccer game	THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — An Amsterdam District Court on Tuesday sentenced five men to up to six months in prison for violence that erupted around a UEFA Europa League football match between the Dutch club Ajax and Israel’s Maccabi Tel Aviv in November. The riots, which caused an international outcry and accusations of deliberate antisemitic attacks, left 5 people in hospital and 20 others with minor injuries. More than 60 people were detained. The court on Tuesday sentenced one man to 6 months in prison, another to 2 1/2 months and two to 1 month in jail. A fifth defendant received 100 hours of community service. A series of violent incidents took place between pro-Palestinian demonstrators and Israeli soccer fans around the soccer match. Some of the violence was condemned as antisemitic, with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu offering to evacuate Maccabi supporters. The violence, which garnered headlines worldwide, damaged Amsterdam’s reputation as a beacon of tolerance and a haven for persecuted religions, including Jews. 'It seems that the violence arose from strong pro-Palestine sentiments and dissatisfaction with the situation in Gaza, and related anger against the Israelis present,' the prosecutors’ office said in a statement at the conclusion of hearings two weeks ago. The five defendants, who are all Dutch residents and aged between 19 and 32, were accused of public violence, theft and assault. The Nov. 8 game was allowed to go ahead after the Netherlands’ counterterror watchdog found there was no 'concrete threat' to Israeli fans, and the match wasn’t considered a high risk. Even so, Amsterdam authorities banned a pro-Palestinian demonstration outside the Johan Cruyff Arena. According to an investigation, the day before the game the authorities reported several incidents, including Israeli fans tearing a Palestinian flag from an Amsterdam building and attacking a taxi. Six more suspects will have their trials at a later date, including three minors. Under Dutch rules, proceedings for juveniles are held behind closed doors. Police are continuing to investigate the violence and have released images of several suspects they want to identify. ___ Casert reported from Brussels	https://apnews.com/article/netherlands-court-soccer-game-violence-db5622fe33f430f73525bc8afe2f7bca	2024-12-24T03:45:29-08:00	
France has a new government, again. Politics and crushing debt complicate next steps	PARIS (AP) — France’s president and prime minister managed to form a new government just in time for the holidays. Now comes the hard part. Crushing debt, intensifying pressure from the nationalist far right, wars in Europe and the Mideast: Challenges abound for President Emmanuel Macron and Prime Minister Francois Bayrou after an already tumultuous 2024. What's wrong with French finances? The most urgent order of business is passing a 2025 budget. Financial markets, ratings agencies and the European Commission are pushing France to bring down its deficit, to comply with EU rules limiting debt and keep France’s borrowing costs from spiraling. That would threaten the stability and prosperity of all countries that share the euro currency. France’s debt is currently estimated at a staggering 112% of gross domestic product. It grew further after the government gave aid payments to businesses and workers during COVID-19 lockdowns even as the pandemic depressed growth, and capped household energy prices after Russia invaded Ukraine. The bill is now coming due. But France’s previous government collapsed this month because Marine Le Pen’s far-right party and left-wing lawmakers opposed 60 billion euros in spending cuts and tax hikes in the original 2025 budget plan. Bayrou and new Finance Minister Eric Lombard are expected to scale back some of those promises, but the calculations are tough. 'The political situation is difficult. The international situation is dangerous, and the economic context is fragile,' Lombard, a low-profile banker who advised a Socialist government in the 1990s, said upon taking office. 'The environmental emergency, the social emergency, developing our businesses — these innumerable challenges require us to treat our endemic illness: the deficit,' he said. 'The more we are indebted, the more the debt costs, and the more it suffocates the country.' How long will this government last? This is France’s fourth government in the past year. No party has a parliamentary majority and the new Cabinet can only survive with the support of lawmakers on the center-right and center-left. Le Pen — Macron’s fiercest rival — was instrumental in ousting the previous government by joining left-wing forces in a no-confidence vote. Bayrou consulted her when forming the new government and Le Pen remains a powerful force. That angers left-wing groups, who had expected more influence in the new Cabinet, and who say promised spending cuts will hurt working-class families and small businesses hardest. Left-wing voters, meanwhile, feel betrayed ever since a coalition from the left won the most seats in the summer's snap legislative elections but failed to secure a government. The possibility of a new no-confidence vote looms, though it's not clear how many parties would support it. What about Macron? Macron has repeatedly said he will remain president until his term expires in 2027. But France's constitution and current structure, dating from 1958 and called the Fifth Republic, were designed to ensure stability after a period of turmoil. If this new government collapses within months and the country remains in political paralysis, pressure will mount for Macron to step down and call early elections. Le Pen's ascendant National Rally is intent on bringing Macron down. But Le Pen faces her own headaches: A March court ruling over alleged illegal party financing could see her barred from running for office. What else is on the agenda? The National Rally and hard-right Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau want tougher immigration rules. But Bayrou wants to focus on making existing rules work. 'There are plenty of (immigration) laws that exist. None is being applied,' he said Monday on broadcaster BFM-TV, to criticism from conservatives. Military spending is a key issue amid fears about European security and pressure from U.S. President-elect Donald Trump for Europe to spend more on its own defense. French Defense Minister Sebastien Lecornu, who champions military aid for Ukraine and ramping up weapons production, kept his job and stressed in a statement Tuesday the need to face down ‘’accumulating threats'' against France. More immediately, Macron wants an emergency law in early January to allow sped-up reconstruction of the cyclone-ravaged French territory of Mayotte in the Indian Ocean off Africa. Thousands of people are in emergency shelters and authorities are still counting the dead more than a week after the devastation. Meanwhile the government in the restive French South Pacific territory of New Caledonia collapsed Tuesday in a wave of resignations by pro-independence figures — another challenge for the new overseas affairs minister, Manuel Valls, and the incoming Cabinet. ___ Associated Press writer David McHugh in Frankfurt contributed.	https://apnews.com/article/france-macron-bayrou-government-budget-96bb8e0e1740bdaf49d98cece0fac28a	2024-12-24T03:20:46-08:00	
Baby mammoth preserved for 50,000 years is unveiled in Russia's Siberia	MOSCOW (AP) — The 50,000-year-old remains of a baby mammoth uncovered by melting permafrost have been unveiled to the public by researchers in Russia's Siberia region who call it the best-preserved mammoth body ever found. Nicknamed Yana, the female mammoth weighs more than 100 kilograms (220 pounds) and is 120 centimeters (47 inches) tall. Scientists believe that Yana was 1 year old when she died. Her remains are one of seven mammoth carcasses recovered worldwide. Yana was found among the melting permafrost at the Batagaika crater in the far-eastern Russian area of Yakutia. Known as the 'gateway to the underworld,' the crater is 1 kilometer deep and has previously revealed the remains of other ancient animals including bison, horses and dogs. As permafrost melts, affected by climate change, more and more parts of prehistoric animals are being discovered. Yana will be studied by scientists at Russia's North-Eastern Federal University, which has a dedicated mammoth research center and museum. The university described the find as 'exceptional' and said it would give researchers new information about how mammoths lived and adapted to their surroundings.	https://apnews.com/article/yana-baby-mammoth-remains-siberia-8966c2122128512ed2ec28506eb8e962	2024-12-24T03:02:44-08:00	
Bethlehem marks a second subdued Christmas during the war in Gaza	BETHLEHEM, West Bank (AP) — Bethlehem marked another somber Christmas Eve on Tuesday in the traditional birthplace of Jesus under the shadow of war in Gaza. The excitement and cheer that typically descends on the West Bank during Christmas week were nowhere to be found. The festive lights and giant tree that normally decorate Manger Square were missing, as were the throngs of foreign tourists that usually fill the square. Palestinian scouts marched silently through the streets, a departure from their usual raucous brass marching band. Some carried a sign that read, 'We want life, not death.' Security forces, meanwhile, arranged barriers near the Church of the Nativity, built atop the spot where Jesus is believed to have been born. 'Always the message of Bethlehem is a message of peace and hope,' said Mayor Anton Salman. 'And these days, we are also sending our message to the world: peace and hope, but insisting that the world must work to end our suffering as Palestinian people.' The cancellation of Christmas festivities is a severe blow to the town's economy. Tourism accounts for an estimated 70% of Bethlehem’s income — almost all of it from the Christmas season. Salman said unemployment is hovering around 50% — higher than the 30% unemployment across the rest of the West Bank, according to the Palestinian Finance Ministry. Latin Patriarch Pierbattista Pizzaballa, the top Roman Catholic cleric in the Holy Land, noted the shuttered shops and empty streets and expressed hope that next year would be better. Pizzaballa held a special pre-Christmas Mass in Holy Family Church in Gaza City on Sunday. 'This has to be the last Christmas that is so sad,' he told hundreds of people gathered in Manger Square, where normally tens of thousands would congregate. 'I bring you the greetings, the prayers, of our brothers and sisters in Gaza.' The number of visitors to the town plunged from a pre-COVID high of around 2 million per year in 2019 to fewer than 100,000 in 2024, said Jiries Qumsiyeh, the spokesperson for the Palestinian Tourism Ministry. Bethlehem is an important center in the history of Christianity, but Christians make up only a small percentage of the roughly 14 million people spread across the Holy Land. There are about 182,000 in Israel, 50,000 in the West Bank and Jerusalem and 1,300 in Gaza, according to the U.S. State Department. After nightfall, the golden walls of the Church of the Nativity were illuminated as a few dozen people quietly milled about. A young boy stood holding a pile of balloons for sale, but gave up because there were no customers to buy them. The war in Gaza has deterred tourists and has prompted a surge of violence in the West Bank, with more than 800 Palestinians killed by Israeli fire and dozens of Israelis killed in militant attacks. Palestinian officials do not provide a breakdown of how many of the deceased are civilians and how many are fighters. Since the deadly Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack that sparked the war, access to and from Bethlehem and other towns in the West Bank has been difficult, with long lines of motorists waiting to pass through Israeli military checkpoints. The restrictions have prevented some 150,000 Palestinians from leaving the territory to work in Israel, causing the economy there to contract by 25%. In the Oct. 7 assault on southern Israel, Hamas-led militants killed about 1,200 people, most of them civilians, and took more than 250 Israeli hostages. Israeli officials believe that around 100 hostages remain in captivity in the Gaza Strip. Elsewhere, Christmas celebrations were also subdued. Syrians protest after Christmas tree burned Scores of Syrian Christians protested Tuesday in Damascus, demanding protection after the burning of a Christmas tree in Hama the day before. Videos and images shared on social media showed the large, decorated tree burning at a roundabout in Suqalabiyah, a town in the Hama countryside. It remains unclear who was responsible for setting the tree on fire. In a video that circulated on social media, a representative of Syria’s new leadership, Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham, could be seen visiting the site and addressing the community. He said: 'This act was committed by people who are not Syrian, and they will be punished beyond your expectations.' Germans mourn after Christmas market attack German celebrations were darkened by a car attack on a Christmas market on Friday that left five people dead and 200 people injured. President Frank-Walter Steinmeier rewrote his annual recorded Christmas Day speech to address the attack. He plans to acknowledge that 'there is grief, pain, horror and incomprehension over what took place in Magdeburg,' while urging Germans to 'stand together,' according to an early copy of the speech. Heavy snow hits the Balkans A snowstorm in the Balkans stranded drivers and downed power lines, but some saw the beauty in it. 'I’m actually glad its falling, especially because of Christmas,' said Mirsad Jasarevic in Zenica, Bosnia. 'We did not have snow for Christmas for 17 years here, and now is the time for wonderful white Christmas.' Planes grounded in the United States American Airlines briefly grounded flights across the U.S. on Tuesday due to a technical problem just as the Christmas travel season kicked into overdrive. Winter weather threatened more potential problems for those planning to fly or drive. Meanwhile, the flight-tracking site FlightAware reported that 1,447 flights entering or leaving the U.S., or serving domestic destinations, were delayed Tuesday, with 28 flights canceled. ___ Associated Press writers Melanie Lidman in Jerusalem and Hannah Schoenbaum in Salt Lake City contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-bethlehem-christmas-war-gaza-hamas-5b92d528fb97c59992c957f56028aadd	2024-12-24T01:33:35-08:00	
Middle East latest: Bethlehem marks a somber Christmas Eve amid war in Gaza	TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — The Palestinian city of Bethlehem is preparing for a somber Christmas Eve under the shadow of war in Gaza, with most festivities cancelled and crowds of tourists absent Tuesday in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Israel's bombardment and ground invasion in Gaza has killed over 45,000 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and civilians in its count. Winter is hitting the Gaza Strip and many of the nearly 2 million Palestinians displaced by the devastating 15-month war with Israel are struggling to protect themselves from the wind, cold and rain. The war was sparked by Hamas’s attack on southern Israel in October 2023, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 250 taken hostage by Palestinian militants. A 78-year-old Israeli woman who was among those hostages, and who was freed during a brief ceasefire last year, has died, her family said Tuesday. Here’s the latest: Syrian Christians protest to demand greater protections after a Christmas tree is burned DAMASCUS — Scores of Syrian Christians protested in the capital Damascus on Tuesday, demanding greater protections for their religious minority after a Christmas tree was set on fire in the city of Hama a day earlier. Many of the insurgents who now rule Syria are jihadis, although Ahmad al-Sharaa, the leader of the main rebel group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, has renounced longtime ties to al-Qaida and spent years depicting himself as a champion of pluralism and tolerance. It remains unclear who set the Christmas tree on fire Monday, which was condemned by a representative of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham who visited the town and addressed the community. 'This act was committed by people who are not Syrian, and they will be punished beyond your expectations,' the HTS representative said in a video widely shared on social media. 'The Christmas tree will be fully restored by this evening.' On Tuesday, protesters marched through the streets of Bab Touma in Damascus, shouting slogans against foreign fighters and carrying large wooden crosses. 'We demand that Syria be for all Syrians. We want a voice in the future of our country,' said Patriarch Ignatius Aphrem II of the Syriac Orthodox Church as he addressed the crowd in a church courtyard, assuring them of Christians’ rights in Syria. Since HTS led a swift offensive that overthrew President Bashar Assad earlier this month, Syria’s minority communities have been on edge, uncertain of how they will be treated under the emerging rebel-led government. 'We are here to demand a democratic and free government for one people and one nation,' another protester said. 'We stand united — Muslims and Christians. No to sectarianism.' Qatar says Gaza ceasefire negotiations are ongoing DOHA — Qatar’s Foreign Ministry said that ceasefire negotiations to end the war in Gaza were ongoing in Doha in cooperation with Egyptian, Qatari, and American mediators. 'We will not leave any door unopened in pursuit of reaching an agreement,' said Majid al-Ansari, Qatar’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson on Tuesday. Al Ansari added that rumors the ceasefire would be reached before Christmas are 'speculation.' The ceasefire negotiations come at a time when winter is hitting the Gaza Strip and many of the nearly 2 million Palestinians displaced by the devastating 15-month war with Israel are struggling to protect themselves from the wind, cold and rain. Families of the approximately 100 hostages who have been held for 445 days in Gaza are also worried their loved ones will not survive another winter. In a press conference, al-Ansari also called on the international community to lift sanctions on Syria as quickly as possible on Tuesday. 'The reason was the crimes of the previous regime, and that regime, with all of its authority, is no longer in place, therefor the causes for these sanctions no longer exist today,' he said. US journalist missing in Syria since 2012 is believed to be alive, says aid group DAMASCUS, Syria — American journalist Austin Tice is believed to be still alive, according to the head of an international aid group. Nizar Zakka, who runs the Hostage Aid Worldwide organization, said there has never been any proof that Tice, who has been missing since 2012, is dead. Zakka told reporters in Damascus on Tuesday that Tice was alive in January and being held by the authorities of ousted Syrian President Bashar Assad. He added that U.S. President Joe Biden said in August that Tice was alive. Zakka said he believes Tice was transferred between security agencies over the past 12 years, including in an area where Iranian-backed fighters were operating. Asked if it was possible Tice had been taken out of the country, Zakka said Assad most likely kept him in Syria as a potential bargaining chip. Biden said Dec. 8 that his administration believed Tice was alive and was committed to bringing him home, although he also acknowledged that 'we have no direct evidence' of his status. A former Israeli hostage dies TEL AVIV, Israel — Hannah Katzir, an Israeli woman who was taken hostage on Oct. 7, 2023, and freed in a brief ceasefire last year, has died. She was 78. The Hostages Families Forum, a group representing the families of people taken captive, confirmed the death Tuesday but did not disclose the cause. Her daughter, Carmit Palty Katzir, said in a statement that her mother’s 'heart could not withstand the terrible suffering since Oct. 7.' Katzir’s husband, Rami, was killed during the attack by militants who raided their home in Kibbutz Nir Oz. Her son Elad was also kidnapped and his body was recovered in April by the Israeli military, who said he had been killed in captivity. She spent 49 days in captivity and was freed in late November 2023. Shortly after Katzir was freed, her daughter told Israeli media that she had been hospitalized with heart issues attributed to 'difficult conditions and starvation' while she was held captive. Israeli air defense system intercepts projectile launched from Yemen TEL AVIV, Israel — Israel's military said the projectile was intercepted before crossing into Israeli territory, but it set off air raid sirens overnight in the country's populous central area, sending residents looking for cover. Israel’s rescue service Magen David Adom said a 60-year-old woman was seriously wounded after being hurt on her way to a protected space. There was no immediate comment from Yemen’s Iranian-backed Houthi rebels. It was the third time in a week that fire from Yemen set off sirens in Israel. On Saturday, a missile slammed into a playground in Tel Aviv, injuring 16, after Israel’s air defense system failed to intercept it. Earlier last week, Israeli jets struck Yemen’s rebel-held capital and a port city, killing nine. Israel said the strikes were in response to previous Houthi attacks.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-syria-lebanon-news-24-december-2024-0bdae4e84f41628e1f234acb02367dbf	2024-12-23T23:34:21-08:00	
US and UK criticize Pakistani military court convictions of civilian supporters of Imran Khan	ISLAMABAD (AP) — The United States and the United Kingdom have expressed deep concern over the recent handing down of convictions by Pakistani military courts to 25 civilian supporters of former Prime Minister Imran Khan over their alleged involvement in riots last year. The convictions had previously also been criticized by the European Union and domestic human rights activists. 'The United States is deeply concerned that Pakistani civilians have been sentenced by a military tribunal for their involvement in protests on May 9, 2023. These military courts lack judicial independence, transparency, and due process guarantees,' according to a statement released by State Department on Monday. It asked Pakistan to respect the right to a fair trial and due process. In London, the Foreign Office said that 'while the U.K. respects Pakistan’s sovereignty over its own legal proceedings, trying civilians in military courts lacks transparency, independent scrutiny and undermines the right to a fair trial. We call on the Government of Pakistan to uphold its obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.' The statements were referring to the violence that erupted after Khan’s arrest in Islamabad in May 2023. The former premier was ousted through a no-confidence vote in the parliament in 2022, and he was convicted of corruption and sentenced in August 2023. Since then, Khan has been behind bars. Khan’s popular opposition party is in talks with the government to secure his release. The 25 supporters on Monday received prison terms ranging from two years to 10 years, which the army in a statement warned acted as a 'stark reminder' for people to never take the law into their own hands. Khan's opposition Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party, or PTI, has rejected the convictions of civilians, demanding they should be tried in the normal courts if they were involved in the riots. There was no response from Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif's government to the criticism from the U.S. and the U.K., but state-run Pakistan Television on Tuesday showed people welcoming the convictions, saying the punishments were given to people who attacked military installations. Earlier this month, Khan and dozens of others were indicted by a civilian court on charges of inciting people on May 9, 2023, when demonstrators attacked the military’s headquarters in Rawalpindi, stormed an air base in Mianwali in the eastern Punjab province and torched a building housing state-run Radio Pakistan in the northwest.	https://apnews.com/article/pakistan-us-military-court-conviction-imran-khan-633f7ee2da6bdf0974f9ba9190f67696	2024-12-23T22:36:49-08:00	
Legendary Indian filmmaker Shyam Benegal dies at age 90	NEW DELHI (AP) — Shyam Benegal, a renowned Indian filmmaker known for pioneering a cinema movement that tackled social issues in the 1970s, has died after chronic kidney disease. He was 90. His contribution to cinema was recognized as a director, editor and screenwriter. He came into the limelight with films — Ankur (1974), Nishant (1975), Manthan (1976) and Bhumika (1977) — that challenged mainstream Bollywood by dealing with the social realities of a poor nation. Benegal died Monday at Mumbai’s Wockhardt Hospital, and his cremation will take place on Tuesday, the Press Trust of India news agency reported, citing his daughter Piya. 'Benegal had been suffering from chronic kidney disease for several years but it had gotten very bad,' Piya said. Many paid tribute to the filmmaker on social media platform X. Filmmaker Mahesh Bhatt wrote that Benegal told stories without pretense. 'They were raw and real, about the struggles of ordinary people. His films had craft and conviction.' 'Deeply saddened by the passing of Shyam Benegal, whose storytelling had a profound impact on Indian cinema. His works will continue to be admired by people from different walks of life,' Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi posted. Benegal was a mentor to top Indian actors including Shabana Azmi, Smita Patil, Naseeruddin Shah and Om Puri who made their mark in Bollywood’s popular cinema as well. 'I have lost my foster father, a man to whom I owe more than I can say,' Shah posted. 'Shyam Benegal was not just a legend; he was a visionary who redefined storytelling and inspired generations,' said actor Manoj Bajpayee. The film Ankur explored the feudal divide in India, while Manthan was based on the story of the country’s cooperative dairy milk movement. Benegal also was widely known for 'Bharat Ek Khoj,' a landmark 53-episode television series based on the book 'Discovery of India,' written by India’s first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru. It chronicled the country’s troubled passages, from ancient times to modernity. He also directed a 2023 biopic on Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, who led Bangladesh’s freedom struggle against Pakistan in the 1970s. Former Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who fled to India in August following a student movement, is the daughter of Rahman. Benegal was born in 1934 in Hyderabad in southern India. He earned an economics degree from Hyderabad’s Osmania University and established the Hyderabad Film Society. He also ventured into advertising, where he directed over 900 sponsored documentaries and advertising films. Benegal also is survived by his wife, Nira Benegal.	https://apnews.com/article/india-legendary-flimmaker-shyam-bengal-dies-944d5a1866f126364ef0fd5b22c4c149	2024-12-23T21:55:07-08:00	
Southern Africa elections brought big changes in 2024	HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) — In Southern Africa, where democracy remains relatively stable, elections held in 2024 saw long-governing liberation parties struggling to survive. Across Africa, power struggles involving military governments, coup attempts and armed conflict are common, but the southern region has largely been more stable and elections in some countries brought joy and hopes of a better future. Not so much though for some long-governing parties. The decades-old goodwill of liberating their countries from colonial rule appears to be giving way to frustration over economic problems and limited opportunities for young people in the region. As voters become younger, and without personal memories of colonialism, which ended before they were born, liberation struggle-era parties in Southern Africa lost power or were given a wake-up call in 2024. For many young voters, performance of the government matters more than historic liberation struggle era credentials that these parties have relied on to stay in power for decades, resulting in 'the shifting political tectonic plates we are seeing,' said Nic Cheeseman, a political scientist and professor at the University of Birmingham in England. 'Generational change is an important factor in the shifting political tectonic plates we are seeing. People want jobs and dignity — you can’t eat memories,' said Cheeseman, who researches African politics. Botswana, a tiny nation of about 2.5 million people with a history of democratic stability, provided the biggest shock as the economy suffered from a global downturn in demand for mined diamonds, and levels of youth unemployment rose. Opposition supporters dressed in blue and white took to the streets to celebrate, while then President Mokgweetsi Masisi conceded defeat even before the vote count was over following an election held in late October. The opposition landslide marked the end of the 58 years in power of the Botswana Democratic Party, which had governed the country since independence from the United Kingdom in 1966. Months earlier, South African voters turned against the African National Congress, the party led by anti-apartheid icon Nelson Mandela in the 1990s. In May, the ANC lost its majority, forcing it to share power with the opposition. The result put South Africa on an uncharted political path for the first time since the end of apartheid three decades ago. The ANC has been gradually losing support since the 2009 national election, also ceding political control of major cities because of widespread discontent over corruption, service delivery failures and economic struggles. However, its drop from 57.5% of support to 40% in May was its biggest loss yet. In Namibia, the candidate of the long-governing South West Africa People’s Organization, or SWAPO — 72-year-old Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah — made history by becoming the country’s first female president. However, SWAPO won 51 seats in the parliamentary vote, only just passing the 49 it needed to keep its majority and narrowly avoiding becoming another liberation struggle party to be rejected in Southern Africa this year. This marked SWAPO’s worst parliamentary result since Namibia gained independence from South Africa’s apartheid government in 1990, signaling a potential shift in the country’s political landscape. Many liberation governments have reason to be worried even though the consistency of democratic processes could be lauded, said Nicole Beardsworth, politics researcher and lecturer at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg. 'What we see in Southern Africa is a relative stability in terms of democratic standards, where citizens seem to believe that their votes matter and that they count. So this does present a concern for ruling parties,' Beardsworth said. In Mozambique, results that extended the governing Frelimo party's nearly half-century in power following an election in October ignited protests that resulted in the death of at least 100 people, according to Amnesty International. Exiled opposition leader Venancio Mondlane, capitalizing on growing youth discontent in the country of 34 million people, has challenged the election outcome in court. Also, he has continued calling for protests that range from street marches to road and border blockades and the banging of pots. A similar situation occurred in January in the Indian Ocean island nation of Comoros, where news of incumbent President Azali Assoumani winning a fourth term triggered violent unrest that left one person dead and scores others injured. Cheeseman, the political researcher, said that protests, including in countries where democracy is thwarted, reflect 'growing signs — from protests to online dissent — that public opinion is already turning.' 'Even citizens who have lost faith in democracy want responsive and accountable government, and to have their voices heard,' he said. Elections swept away ruling parties in several countries elsewhere in the region and across the economically troubled continent of more than 1.4 billion people and home to the world’s youngest population. The Indian Ocean island of Mauritius, one of Africa’s most stable democracies, saw an opposition coalition grab all contested parliamentary seats, driving out the government led by Pravind Jugnauth, who was replaced by former Prime Minister Navin Ramgoolam. In West Africa, Senegal in March elected previously little-known 44-year-old Bassirou Diomaye Faye, who became the continent’s youngest leader. Faye defeated rivals who included a former prime minister who was backed by then incumbent Macky Sall, just a few weeks after being released from prison to run in the polls. And hopes for change continue running high in a country where more than 60% of the population is under age 25 and 90% work in informal jobs, after Faye’s PASTEF party won 130 of 165 seats. Former President John Dramani Mahama returned to power in Ghana, as voters vented their anger over the policies of outgoing President Nana Akufo-Addo in early December. The 65-year-old Mahama’s National Democratic Congress also won the majority in parliament. ___ Mogomotsi Magome in Johannesburg, and Monika Pronczuk in Dakar, Senegal, contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/southern-africa-elections-2024-liberation-parties-decline-7f9c7f660d3551585a8dd625f39e0cbe	2024-12-23T19:56:42-08:00	
20 years after the Indian Ocean tsunami, a boy found in the mud embraces being known as 'Baby 81'	KURUKKAL MADAM, Sri Lanka (AP) — Pulled from the mud as an infant after the devastating Indian Ocean tsunami in 2004, and reunited with his parents following an emotional court battle, the boy once known as 'Baby 81' is now a 20-year-old dreaming of higher education. Jayarasa Abilash's story symbolized that of the families torn apart by one of the worst natural calamities in modern history, but it also offered hope. More than 35,000 people in Sri Lanka were killed, with others missing. The 2-month-old baby was washed away by the tsunami in eastern Sri Lanka and found some distance from home by rescuers. At the hospital, he was No. 81 on the admissions registry. His father, Murugupillai Jayarasa, spent three days searching for his scattered family, with little left to his name in those early hours but a pair of shorts. First he found his mother, then his wife. But their infant son was missing. A nurse had taken the baby from the hospital, but returned him after hearing that his family was alive. The ordeal, however, was far from over. Nine other families had submitted their names to the hospital, claiming 'Baby 81' as their own, so the hospital administration refused to hand over the child to Jayarasa and his wife without proof. The family went to the police. The matter went to court. The judge ordered a DNA test, a process that was still in its early stages in Sri Lanka. But none of the nine other families claimed the baby legally, and no DNA testing was done on them, Jayarasa said. 'The hospital named the child ‘Baby 81’ and listed the names of nine people who claimed the child, omitting us,' he said. 'There was a public call to all those who said the child was theirs to subject themselves for DNA testing, but none of them came forward,' he recalled. Jayarasa said his family gave DNA samples and it was proven the child was theirs. Soon, the family was reunited. Their story drew international media attention, and they even visited the United States for an interview. Today, Abilash is sitting for his final high school exam. Solid and good-natured, he hopes to attend a university to study information technology. He said he grew up hearing about his story from his parents, while classmates teased him by calling him 'Baby 81' or 'tsunami baby.' He was embarrassed, and it worsened every time the anniversary of the tsunami arrived. 'I used to think ‘Here they have come’ and run inside and hide myself,' he said as journalists returned to hear his story again. His father said the boy was so upset he wouldn’t eat at times. 'I consoled him saying, 'Son, you are unique in being the only one to have such a name in this world,' he said. Later, as a teenager, Abilash read more about the events that tore him from his family and brought him back, and he lost his fear. He knows the nickname will follow him for life. But that's all right. 'Now I only take it as my code word,' he said, joking. 'If you want to find me out, access that code word.' He continues to search online to read about himself. His father said memories of those frantic, searching days 20 years ago remain fresh, even as others fade. Over the years, the extensive publicity his family received has also affected them negatively, Jayarasa said. His family was excluded from many of the tsunami relief and reconstruction programs because government officials assumed they had received money during their visit to the U.S. The experience also led to jealousy, gossiping and ostracizing of the family in their neighborhood, forcing them to relocate. The father wants his son and other family members to remain grateful for their survival, and he wants Abilash to become someone who can help others in need. From time the boy was a toddler, his father collected small amounts of money from his work at a hairdressing shop. When Abilash turned 12, the family erected a small memorial to victims of the tsunami in their front yard. It shows four cupped hands. The father explained: 'A thought arose in my mind that since all those who have died have gone, leaving Abilash behind for us, why not a memorial site of our own to remember them every day.'	https://apnews.com/article/tsunami-sri-lanka-baby-81-jeyarasa-abilash-fe6edec6968f1b90382c1288bb5f86a3	2024-12-23T19:22:45-08:00	
Stock market today: Asian stocks mostly advance in quiet Christmas Eve trading	HONG KONG (AP) — Asian markets were mostly higher on Tuesday, with Chinese markets logging gains of more than 1% after the Chinese finance minister promised a more pro-active approach to government spending in the coming year. U.S. futures were little changed in quiet Christmas Eve trading and oil prices rose. Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 slipped 0.3% to 39,036.85. Honda’s shares surged more than 12.2% as the Japanese automaker announced an up to 1.1 trillion yen ($7 billion) share buyback after it announced Monday that it was seeking a merger with its larger but troubled rival Nissan. The two companies said they had signed a memorandum of understanding on Monday and that smaller Nissan alliance member Mitsubishi Motors Corp. also had agreed to join the talks on integrating their businesses. Nissan's shares rose 6%. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong added 1.1% to 20,098.29 and the Shanghai Composite index was up 1.3% at 3,393.53. Chinese Finance Minister Lan Fo'an told a financial work conference that Beijing will increase the fiscal deficit in 2025 and step up spending, issuing more government bonds and increasing transfers to local governments to help ensure they can deliver guarantees to the public for housing, heating and food, according to the ministry's website. The comments were the latest by top leaders aimed at assuaging concern over the slowing growth of the world's second-largest economy. South Korea’s Kospi lost 0.1% to 2,440.52 as a report said consumer sentiment dropped sharply in December after President Yoon Suk Yeol declared martial law and then was impeached by lawmakers. Elsewhere in Asia, Australia’s S&amp;P/ASX 200 advanced 0.2% to 8,220.90. Taiwan’s Taiex gained 0.1%, with shares in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the world's biggest computer chip maker, hitting a record high. On Monday, the S&amp;P 500 ended 0.7% higher at 5,974.07. The Dow Jones Industrial Average eked out a 0.2% gain to 42,906.95. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite rose 1% to 19,764.89. The Conference Board said its consumer confidence index fell to 104.7 from 112.8 in November. Wall Street had been expecting a reading of 113.8. The unexpectedly weak consumer confidence update followed several generally strong economic reports last week. One report showed the overall economy grew at a 3.1% annualized rate during the summer, faster than what was thought earlier. The latest report on unemployment benefit applications showed the job market remains solid. Inflation concerns have added to uncertainties heading into 2025, which include the jobs market and shifting economic policies under President-elect Donald Trump. Wall Street has several economic reports to look forward to this week, including a weekly update on unemployment benefits on Thursday. Markets in the U.S. will close at 1 p.m. Eastern on Tuesday for Christmas Eve and will remain closed on Wednesday for Christmas. In other dealings early Tuesday, U.S. benchmark crude oil picked up 37 cents to $69.61 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, was up 41 cents at $72.73. The dollar fell to 157.05 Japanese yen from 157.17 yen. The euro fell to $1.0394 from $1.0405.	https://apnews.com/article/stocks-markets-honda-nissan-db0d53cf8ad8ac565e899bed284f4280	2024-12-23T19:15:44-08:00	
Biden will decide on US Steel acquisition after influential panel fails to reach consensus	WASHINGTON (AP) — A powerful government panel on Monday failed to reach consensus on the possible national security risks of a nearly $15 billion proposed deal for Nippon Steel of Japan to purchase U.S. Steel, leaving the decision to President Joe Biden, who opposes the deal. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, known as CFIUS, sent its long-awaited report on the merger to Biden, who formally came out against the deal in March. He has 15 days to reach a final decision, the White House said. A U.S. official familiar with the matter, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the private report, said some federal agencies represented on the panel were skeptical that allowing a Japanese company to buy an American-owned steelmaker would create national security risks. Monday was the deadline to approve the deal, recommend that Biden block it or extend the review process. Both Biden and President-elect Donald Trump have courted unionized workers at U.S. Steel and vowed to block the acquisition amid concerns about foreign ownership of a flagship American company. The economic risk, however, is giving up Nippon Steel's potential investments in the mills and upgrades that might help preserve steel production within the United States. Under the terms of the proposed $14.9 billion all-cash deal, U.S. Steel would keep its name and its headquarters in Pittsburgh, where it was founded in 1901 by J.P. Morgan and Andrew Carnegie. It would become a subsidiary of Nippon Steel, and the combined company would be among the top three steelmakers in the world, according to 2023 figures from the World Steel Association. Biden, backed by the United Steelworkers, said earlier this year that it was 'vital for (U.S. Steel) to remain an American steel company that is domestically owned and operated.' Trump has also opposed the acquisition and vowed earlier this month on his Truth Social platform to 'block this deal from happening.' He proposed reviving U.S. Steel's flagging fortunes 'through a series of Tax Incentives and Tariffs.' The steelworkers union questions if Nippon Steel would keep jobs at unionized plants, make good on collectively bargained benefits or protect American steel production from cheap foreign imports. 'Our union has been calling for strict government scrutiny of the sale since it was announced. Now it’s up to President Biden to determine the best path forward,' David McCall, the steelworkers' president, said in a statement Monday. 'We continue to believe that means keeping U.S. Steel domestically owned and operated.' Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel have waged a public relations campaign to win over skeptics. U.S. Steel said in a statement Monday that the deal 'is the best way, by far, to ensure that U.S. Steel, including its employees, communities, and customers, will thrive well into the future.' Nippon Steel said Tuesday that it had been informed by CFIUS that it had referred the case to Biden, and urged him to 'reflect on the great lengths that we have gone to to address any national security concerns that have been raised and the significant commitments we have made to grow U. S. Steel, protect American jobs, and strengthen the entire American steel industry, which will enhance American national security.' 'We are confident that our transaction should and will be approved if it is fairly evaluated on its merits,' it said in a statement. A growing number of conservatives have publicly backed the deal, as Nippon Steel began to win over some steelworkers union members and officials in areas near its blast furnaces in Pennsylvania and Indiana. Many backers said Nippon Steel has a stronger financial balance sheet than rival Cleveland-Cliffs to invest the necessary cash to upgrade aging U.S. Steel blast furnaces. Nippon Steel pledged to invest $2.7 billion in United Steelworkers-represented facilities, including U.S. Steel’s blast furnaces, and promised not to import steel slabs that would compete with the blast furnaces. It also pledged to protect U.S. Steel in trade matters and to not lay off employees or close plants during the term of the basic labor agreement. Earlier this month, it offered $5,000 in closing bonuses to U.S. Steel employees, a nearly $100 million expense. Nippon Steel also said it was best positioned to help American steel compete in an industry dominated by the Chinese. The proposed sale came during a tide of renewed political support for rebuilding America’s manufacturing sector, a presidential campaign in which Pennsylvania was a prime battleground, and a long stretch of protectionist U.S. tariffs that analysts say has helped reinvigorate domestic steel. Chaired by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, CFIUS screens business deals between U.S. firms and foreign investors and can block sales or force parties to change the terms of an agreement to protect national security. Congress significantly expanded the committee's powers through the 2018 Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act, known as FIRRMA. In September, Biden issued an executive order broadening the factors the committee should consider when reviewing deals — such as how they impact the U.S. supply chain or if they put Americans’ personal data at risk. Nippon Steel has factories in the U.S., Mexico, China and Southeast Asia. It supplies the world’s top automakers, including Toyota Motor Corp., and makes steel for railways, pipes, appliances and skyscrapers. ___ Levy reported from Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.

An all-Filipino crew is set to make history in the Sydney to Hobart yacht race	SYDNEY (AP) — There have been plenty of 'firsts' in the history of the Sydney to Hobart yacht race which was first held in 1945. An all-Filipino crew of 15 sailors will make it another when the annual ocean classic begins in Sydney on Thursday. With veteran sailor Ernesto Echauz at the helm, Centennial 7 will embark on the 628-nautical mile (722 miles, 1,160 kilometers) race. One of six international entrants out of the more than 100-strong fleet, Centennial 7’s crew comprises sailors from the Philippines’ national team and the Philippines navy. The boat itself is no stranger to the race. Previously, the TP52 yacht was known as Celestial and claimed the Sydney to Hobart overall handicap victory in 2022 under Sam Haynes after being runner-up the year before. When shipping their own boat from the Philippines proved too difficult, Haynes helped keep the dream alive by selling Celestial to Echauz in September. Haynes will still contest the Sydney-Hobart race on board a new Celestial. 'I never knew that it was going to be this boat,' Echauz told Australian Associated Press. 'We acquired Celestial right away because we were told that it’s ready to do the Sydney to Hobart. 'We went through the paperwork, and the most important thing is to be able to get the whole crew, 15 Filipinos. They got surprised that, hey, we’re going to bring all of the Filipinos. It’s a dream come true for all of us. We never expected that we’ll be able to join.' The race takes the yachts down the New South Wales state south coast, across the often notorious Bass Strait and to the island state of Tasmania, ending in the state capital Hobart after sailing the last portion of the race on the Derwent River. :Last year, LawConnect won line honors i n the 78th edition of the Sydney to Hobart, holding off defending champion Andoo Comanche by less than a minute in an exciting finish between the super maxis. The pair of 100-foot yachts had dueled for much of the race and were well ahead of the rest of the fleet of 103 yachts that started last year’s race. LawConnect, which was runner-up in the last three editions of the race, finished in 1 day, 19 hours, 3 minutes, 58 seconds. Comanche’s time was 1 day, 19 hours, 4 minutes, 49 seconds — a margin of just 51 seconds. It was the second-closest finish in Sydney to Hobart history after Condor of Bermuda beat Apollo by seven seconds in 1982. Comanche holds the race record of 1 day, 9 hours, 15 minutes, 24 seconds, set when it won the race in 2017. Echauz’s crew in March finished second by five minutes to rivals Happy Go in a close finish to the China Sea Race, after claiming line honors on board Centennial 5 last year. 'We’ve been sailing with each other for years, for decades,' Echauz said. 'They are dinghy sailors. Eventually, when we started sailing big boats, we would sail together. We’ve been sailing in Hong Kong, which is the sailing center for Asia for big boats, but the standard here is a way, way different. It’s a completely different level.' The crew placed 12th overall in the Cabbage Tree Island Race near Sydney earlier this month, their first race in Australian waters. 'We just want to finish it. Just finish well, and hopefully nothing breaks and hopefully nobody gets hurt and we don’t make any mistakes,' Echauz said. ___ AP sports: https://apnews.com/sports	https://apnews.com/article/sydney-hobart-yacht-race-philippines-bf567e9ecb73b825696c03969d9f228e	2024-12-23T17:28:49-08:00	
UN investigative team says Syria's new authorities 'very receptive' to probe of Assad war crimes	UNITED NATIONS (AP) — The U.N. organization assisting in investigating the most serious crimes in Syria said Monday the country’s new authorities were 'very receptive' to its request for cooperation during a just-concluded visit to Damascus, and it is preparing to deploy. The visit led by Robert Petit, head of the International, Impartial and Independent Mechanism for Syria, was the first since the organization was established by the U.N. General Assembly in 2016. It was created to assist in evidence-gathering and prosecution of individuals responsible for possible war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide since Syria’s civil war began in 2011. Petit highlighted the urgency of preserving documents and other evidence before it is lost. Since the rebel overthrow of Syria’s President Bashar Assad and the rebel opening of prisons and detention facilities there have been rising demands from Syrians for the prosecution of those responsible for atrocities and killings while he was in power. 'The fall of the Assad rule is a significant opportunity for us to fulfill our mandate on the ground,' Petit said. 'Time is running out. There is a small window of opportunity to secure these sites and the material they hold.' U.N. associate spokesperson Stephane Tremblay said Monday the investigative team 'is preparing for an operational deployment as early as possible and as soon as it is authorized to conduct activities on Syrian soil.' The spokesperson for the organization, known as the IIIM, who was on the trip with Petit, went further, telling The Associated Press: 'We are preparing to deploy on the expectation that we will get authorization.' 'The representatives from the caretaker authorities were very receptive to our request for cooperation and are aware of the scale of the task ahead,' the spokesperson said, speaking on condition of not being named. 'They emphasized that they will need expertise to help safeguard the newly accessible documentation.' The IIIM did not disclose which officials in the new government it met with or the site that Petit visited afterward. 'Even at one facility,' Petit said, 'the mountains of government documentation reveal the chilling efficiency of systemizing the regime’s atrocity crimes.' He said that a collective effort by Syrians, civil society organizations and international partners will be needed, as a priority, ' to preserve evidence of the crimes committed, avoid duplication, and ensure that all victims are inclusively represented in the pursuit of justice.' In June 2023, the 193-member General Assembly also established an Independent Institution of Missing Persons in the Syrian Arab Republic to clarify the fate and whereabouts of more than 130,000 people missing as a result of the conflict.	https://apnews.com/article/un-syria-crimes-investigate-assad-rebels-evidence-e476c58e02556a547a41797e85f5c585	2024-12-23T15:26:32-08:00	
A history of the Panama Canal — and why Trump can't take it back on his own	PANAMA CITY (AP) — Teddy Roosevelt once declared the Panama Canal 'one of the feats to which the people of this republic will look back with the highest pride.' More than a century later, Donald Trump is threatening to take back the waterway for the same republic. The president-elect is decrying increased fees Panama has imposed to use the waterway linking the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. He says if things don't change after he takes office next month, 'We will demand that the Panama Canal be returned to the United States of America, in full, quickly and without question.' Trump has long threatened allies with punitive action in hopes of winning concessions. But experts in both countries are clear: Unless he goes to war with Panama, Trump can't reassert control over a canal the U.S. agreed to cede in the 1970s. Here's a look at how we got here: What is the canal? It is a man-made waterway that uses a series of locks and reservoirs over 51 miles (82 kilometers) to cut through the middle of Panama and connect the Atlantic and Pacific. It spares ships having to go an additional roughly 7,000 miles (more than 11,000 kilometers) to sail around Cape Horn at South America's southern tip. The U.S. International Trade Administration says the canal saves American business interests 'considerable time and fuel costs' and enables faster delivery of goods, which is 'particularly significant for time sensitive cargoes, perishable goods, and industries with just-in-time supply chains.' Who built it? An effort to establish a canal through Panama led by Ferdinand de Lesseps, who built Egypt's Suez Canal, began in 1880 but progressed little over nine years before going bankrupt. Malaria, yellow fever and other tropical diseases devastated a workforce already struggling with especially dangerous terrain and harsh working conditions in the jungle, eventually costing more than 20,000 lives, by some estimates. Panama was then a province of Colombia, which refused to ratify a subsequent 1901 treaty licensing U.S. interests to build the canal. Roosevelt responded by dispatching U.S. warships to Panama's Atlantic and Pacific coasts. The U.S. also prewrote a constitution that would be ready after Panamanian independence, giving American forces 'the right to intervene in any part of Panama, to re-establish public peace and constitutional order.' In part because Colombian troops were unable to traverse harsh jungles, Panama declared an effectively bloodless independence within hours in November 1903. It soon signed a treaty allowing a U.S.-led team to begin construction. Some 5,600 workers died later during the U.S.-led construction project, according to one study. Why doesn't the US control the canal anymore? The waterway opened in 1914, but almost immediately some Panamanians began questioning the validity of U.S. control, leading to what became known in the country as the 'generational struggle' to take it over. The U.S. abrogated its right to intervene in Panama in the 1930s. By the 1970s, with its administrative costs sharply increasing, Washington spent years negotiating with Panama to cede control of the waterway. The Carter administration worked with the government of Omar Torrijos. The two sides eventually decided that their best chance for ratification was to submit two treaties to the U.S. Senate, the 'Permanent Neutrality Treaty' and the 'Panama Canal Treaty.' The first, which continues in perpetuity, gives the U.S. the right to act to ensure the canal remains open and secure. The second stated that the U.S. would turn over the canal to Panama on Dec. 31, 1999, and was terminated then. Both were signed in 1977 and ratified the following year. The agreements held even after 1989, when President George H.W. Bush invaded Panama to remove Panamanian leader Manuel Noriega. In the late 1970s, as the handover treaties were being discussed and ratified, polls found that about half of Americans opposed the decision to cede canal control to Panama. However, by the time ownership actually changed in 1999, public opinion had shifted, with about half of Americans in favor. What's happened since then? Administration of the canal has been more efficient under Panama than during the U.S. era, with traffic increasing 17% between fiscal years 1999 and 2004. Panama's voters approved a 2006 referendum authorizing a major expansion of the canal to accommodate larger modern cargo ships. The expansion took until 2016 and cost more than $5.2 billion. Panamanian President José Raúl Mulino said in a video Sunday that 'every square meter of the canal belongs to Panama and will continue to.' He added that, while his country's people are divided on some key issues, 'when it comes to our canal, and our sovereignty, we will all unite under our Panamanian flag.' Shipping prices have increased because of droughts last year affecting the canal locks, forcing Panama to drastically cut shipping traffic through the canal and raise rates to use it. Though the rains have mostly returned, Panama says future fee increases might be necessary as it undertakes improvements to accommodate modern shipping needs. Mulino said fees to use the canal are 'not set on a whim.' Jorge Luis Quijano, who served as the waterway’s administrator from 2014 to 2019, said all canal users are subject to the same fees, though they vary by ship size and other factors. 'I can accept that the canal’s customers may complain about any price increase,' Quijano said. 'But that does not give them reason to consider taking it back.' Why has Trump raised this? The president-elect says the U.S. is getting 'ripped off' and 'I’m not going to stand for it.' 'It was given to Panama and to the people of Panama, but it has provisions — you’ve got to treat us fairly. And they haven’t treated us fairly,' Trump said of the 1977 treaty that he said 'foolishly' gave the canal away. The neutrality treaty does give the U.S. the right to act if the canal's operation is threatened due to military conflict — but not to reassert control. 'There's no clause of any kind in the neutrality agreement that allows for the taking back of the canal,' Quijano said. 'Legally, there's no way, under normal circumstances, to recover territory that was used previously.' Trump, meanwhile, hasn't said how he might make good on his threat. 'There’s very little wiggle room, absent a second U.S. invasion of Panama, to retake control of the Panama Canal in practical terms,' said Benjamin Gedan, director of the Latin America Program at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington. Gedan said Trump’s stance is especially baffling given that Mulino is a pro-business conservative who has 'made lots of other overtures to show that he would prefer a special relationship with the United States.' He also noted that Panama in recent years has moved closer to China, meaning the U.S. has strategic reasons to keep its relationship with the Central American nation friendly. Panama is also a U.S. partner on stopping illegal immigration from South America — perhaps Trump’s biggest policy priority. 'If you’re going to pick a fight with Panama on an issue,' Gedan said, 'you could not find a worse one than the canal.' ___ Weissert reported from West Palm Beach, Florida, and Fields from Washington.

Judge reinstates Ecuador's vice president after deeming her suspension unconstitutional	QUITO, Ecuador (AP) — An Ecuadorian judge on Monday reinstated Vice President Verónica Abad to her role and lifted the five-month suspension the Ministry of Labor had imposed on her for allegedly abandoning her duties. In response to Abad's appeal, Judge Nubia Vera deemed the sanction unconstitutional. It's the latest twist in a feud between Abad and President Daniel Noboa that began before they took office in November 2023. Abad’s fate is important for Noboa’s reelection strategy. He will have to request a leave of absence next month to be able to campaign ahead of February’s election. In his absence, Abad, as vice president, would take over his job. The origins of the dispute are unknown. Shortly after becoming president, Noboa dispatched her to serve as ambassador to Israel, effectively isolating her from his administration. She has described her monthslong posting as 'forced exile.' Abad filed a legal complaint in August accusing Noboa and other officials of gender-based violence. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs then accused her of not following an order in September to temporarily transfer to Turkey. Abad argued that she arrived eight days after the order because she was not 'properly prepared' for the trip and said Noboa’s government suggested 'that I leave my children in Israel to go to Turkey alone.' The Ministry of Labor imposed the suspension without pay in early November. Noboa has called Abad disloyal. Abad has called her posting in Israel and other measures as efforts by Noboa and his allies to pressure her to resign.	https://apnews.com/article/ecuador-president-reelection-vice-president-abad-suspension-feud-29257f04205211742cb2fa68a9219c9c	2024-12-23T10:34:31-08:00	
Hundreds march in Croatia for safer schools after a student is killed in a knife attack	ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) — Hundreds walked in silence in Croatia's capital on Monday, seeking action after a pupil was killed and three other children were wounded in a knife attack at a school in Zagreb. Organized by teachers' unions, the march asked authorities do more to ensure that schools in Croatia are safe for children. Similar events were held in other cities and towns. 'We need support from government institutions, school teams, media, civil society organizations and all the people who are involved,' about 50 teachers' groups and other organizations said in a joint statement. Croatia's ministry of education said it has held meetings of expert teams tasked with finding ways of improving school security. Minister Radovan Fuchs said measures could include locking school doors or entry control. Officials said the suspected attacker was a 19-year-old former student of the primary school in Precko and still lives in the neighborhood. The young man was cutting himself when police apprehended him. School attacks are rare in Croatia and in the Balkans as a whole. In May 2023, a teenager in neighboring Serbia opened fire at a school in the capital, Belgrade, killing nine fellow students and a school guard.	https://apnews.com/article/croatia-school-stabbing-march-safety-717b8c35e22ccb9618cbb26c7bfe2ad7	2024-12-23T10:01:38-08:00	
UN publishes new death toll for massacre of older people and Vodou religious leaders in Haiti	PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) — The United Nations raised the death toll of a recent massacre in which dozens of older people and Vodou religious leaders were killed by a gang in Haiti, and called on officials to bring the perpetrators to justice. The U.N. Integrated Office in Haiti said in a report published on Monday that between Dec. 6 and 11 more than 207 people were killed by the Wharf Jeremie gang. The gang took people from their homes and from a place of worship, interrogated them and then executed them with bullets and machetes. Earlier this month, human rights groups in Haiti had estimated that more than 100 people were killed in the massacre, but the new U.N. investigation doubles the number of victims. 'We cannot pretend that nothing happened' said María Isabel Salvador, the U.N. secretary-general’s special representative in Haiti. 'I call on the Haitian justice system to thoroughly investigate these horrific crimes and arrest and punish the perpetrators, as well as those who support them,' she said in a statement. Human rights groups in Haiti said the massacre began after the son of Micanor Altès, the leader of the Wharf Jeremie gang, died from an illness. The Cooperative for Peace and Development, a human rights group, said that according to information circulating in the community, Altès accused people in the neighborhood of causing his son’s illness. 'He decided to cruelly punish all elderly people and (Vodou) practitioners who, in his imagination, would be capable of casting a bad spell on his son,' the group said in a statement released shortly after news of the massacre emerged. In Monday's report, the United Nations said that people were tracked down in their homes and in a place of worship by Altès’ gang, where they were first interrogated and then taken to an execution site. The United Nations said that the gang tried to erase evidence of the killings by burning bodies, or by dismembering them and throwing them into the sea. The massacre is the latest humanitarian tragedy in Haiti, where gang violence has intensified since the nation’s president was killed in a 2021 coup attempt. Haiti has struggled to organize an election that will fill the power vacuum and restore democratic rule. The Caribbean nation is currently governed by a transitional council that includes representatives from the business community, civil society and political parties, but its government has no control over many areas of the capital city, and gangs are constantly fighting over ports, highways and neighborhoods. According to the United Nations, more than 5,350 people have been killed in Haiti’s gang wars this year. The Haitian government acknowledged the massacre against older people in a statement issued earlier this month, and promised to persecute those responsible for this act of 'unspeakable carnage.'	https://apnews.com/article/haiti-gang-massacre-vodou-older-people-un-a89fb762358699db4bc8b3e7946d6b36	2024-12-23T09:51:17-08:00	
France has a new government. Now it must fix the budget while avoiding collapse	PARIS (AP) — French President Emmanuel Macron’s office announced a new government Monday, after the previous Cabinet collapsed in a historic vote prompted by fighting over the country's budget. The government, put together by newly named Prime Minister Francois Bayrou, includes members of the outgoing conservative-dominated team and new figures from centrist or left-leaning backgrounds. Coming up with a 2025 budget will be the most urgent order of business. The new government enters office after months of political deadlock and crisis and pressure from financial markets to reduce France’s colossal debt. Macron has vowed to remain in office until his term ends in 2027, but has struggled to govern since snap elections in the summer left no single party with a majority in the National Assembly. Since his appointment 10 days ago, Bayrou has held talks with political leaders from various parties in search of the right balance for the new government. Some critics on Monday were angry at Bayrou for consulting with Marine Le Pen’s far-right party, and some argue the government looks too much like the old one to win lawmakers’ trust. Former Prime Minister Michel Barnier resigned this month following a no-confidence vote prompted by budget disputes in the National Assembly, leaving France without a functioning government. Le Pen played a key role in Barnier’s downfall by joining her National Rally party’s forces with the left to pass the no-confidence motion. Bayrou will need support from moderate legislators on the right and left to keep his government alive. Banker Eric Lombard will be finance minister, a crucial post when France is working to fulfill its promises to European Union partners to reduce its deficit, estimated to reach 6% of its gross domestic product this year. Lombard briefly worked as an adviser to a Socialist finance minister in the 1990s. Bayrou has said he supports tax hikes championed by his predecessor, but it’s not clear how the new government can find the right calculation for a budget that satisfies a majority of lawmakers angry over spending cuts. Hard-right Bruno Retailleau stays on as interior minister, with responsibility for France’s security and migration policy. Sebastien Lecornu, who has been at the forefront of France’s military support for Ukraine, remains defense minister, while Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot, who has traveled extensively in the Mideast in recent weeks, also retains his post. Among new faces are two former prime ministers. Manuel Valls will be minister for overseas affairs, and Elisabeth Borne takes the education ministry.	https://apnews.com/article/france-new-government-macron-ea2398230392fd433f4dd9ff11f20d83	2024-12-23T08:51:54-08:00	
NFL on Netflix: Christmas Day games are a 1st for streaming giant	Netflix will have one of its biggest days Wednesday since the site launched in 1998 when it airs two NFL games for the first time. 'NFL Christmas Gameday on Netflix' begins with a two-hour pregame show at 11 a.m., before Pittsburgh hosts Kansas City. Baltimore faces Houston in the second game. The streaming giant agreed to a three-year contract in May to carry Christmas Day games. Where will the games be available? Netflix’s 282.3 million subscribers in over 190 countries will be able to stream the games, marking the first time one outlet has distributed an NFL game globally. Netflix will have the games available in five languages — English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, and German. The games will also air on CBS affiliates in Kansas City, Pittsburgh, Baltimore and Houston. NFL policy dictates that games on cable or being exclusively streamed must also be on an over-the-air station in the competing teams’ markets. It will also be available on mobile devices in the U.S. for those who have NFL+. Why is the NFL putting Christmas Day games on a streaming platform? The biggest reason is money. The league is getting $150 million from Netflix for the two games this season. It also continues the NFL’s moves into streaming — Thursday night games are in their third season on Amazon Prime Video and the 'Sunday Ticket' package moved to YouTube TV last year. But Christmas is on a Wednesday when games usually aren’t played. That’s true, but the league wasn’t about to give up Christmas after seeing the ratings. Last year’s three games averaged 28.68 million viewers. The early afternoon contest between the Las Vegas Raiders and Chiefs led the way, averaging 29.48 million. The Chiefs, Steelers, Ravens and Texans played on Saturday, giving them the same turnaround they would have if they played on Sunday and then Thursday. What is at stake for the teams playing? All four have clinched playoff spots in the AFC, but seeding remains up for grabs. Kansas City (14-1) can clinch the top seed — which would mean a first-round bye and home field throughout the playoffs — with a win over the Steelers. Pittsburgh and Baltimore are tied atop the AFC North at 10-5, with the Steelers holding the tiebreaker due to a better conference record. Houston (9-6) has wrapped up the AFC South and holds the fourth seed. Has Netflix fixed its streaming problems from the Jake Paul-Mike Tyson fight? Netflix hopes so. Brandon Riegg, Netflix’s vice president of nonfiction series and sports, said the system was stress tested, and then some, during the Nov. 14 bout, along with internet service providers reporting they were also overwhelmed by the surge that occurred before and during the fight. The bout peaked at 65 million concurrent streams, including 38 million concurrent streams in the United States. According to the website Down Detector, nearly 85,000 viewers logged problems with outages or streaming leading up to and during the fight. Could there be the same number streaming the games that there were during the fight? Possible? Yes. Likely? No. The largest audience for a streamed-exclusive NFL game was 23 million on Peacock for last season’s AFC wild-card game between the Miami Dolphins and Chiefs. Nielsen will measure the ratings for the Christmas Day games, with early numbers expected late afternoon on Thursday. When could there be surge in demand on Wednesday? It will probably beat kickoff for both games, but especially around 5:45 p.m. EST. That would be near halftime of the Ravens-Texans game, and when Beyoncé will be performing. What other celebrities will appear? Mariah Carey will kick off the day with a taped performance of 'All I Want for Christmas is You.' There is no word if Taylor Swift will make the trip to Pittsburgh to watch her boyfriend, Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce. Swift has been spending time in Kansas City since she wrapped up her Eras Tour two weeks ago. How many Christmas games will Netflix carry in the next two seasons? The NFL will have at least two games on Dec. 25 in 2025 and ’26, with Netflix slated to have at least one each year. Amazon Prime Video will have a night game with Christmas on a Thursday next year. Does Netflix have an interest in other sports? Netflix’s worldwide partnership with World Wrestling Entertainment will begin on Jan. 6 when 'Monday Night Raw' moves to the streaming service. On Friday, Netflix secured the U.S. rights for the 2027 and 2031 FIFA Women’s World Cup. ___ AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl	https://apnews.com/article/netflix-christmas-nfl-beyonce-9b65162dbe7e3fe1a2dd13d2da89e966	2024-12-23T06:49:27-08:00	
Nigerian agency 'failed completely' to clean up oil damage despite funding, leaked files say	As it passed above the Niger Delta in 2021, a satellite took an image. It showed acres of land, scraped bare. The site, outside the city of Port Harcourt, was on a cleanup list kept by the United Nations Environment Programme, supposed to be restored to green farmland as the Delta was before thousands of oil spills turned it into a byword for pollution. Instead the land was left a sandy 'moonscape' unusable for farming, according to U.N. documents. That failed cleanup was not an exception, records obtained by The Associated Press show. Previously unreported investigations, emails, letters to Nigerian ministers and minutes from meetings make clear that senior U.N. officials were increasingly concerned that the Nigerian agency in charge of cleaning up crude oil spills has been a 'total failure.' The agency, known as Hyprep, selected cleanup contractors who had no relevant experience, according to a U.N. review. It sent soil samples to laboratories that didn't have the equipment for tests they claimed to perform. Auditors were physically blocked from making sure work had been completed. A former Nigerian minister of the environment told the AP that the majority of cleanup companies are owned by politicians, and minutes show similar views were shared by U.N. officials. It wasn’t supposed to be this way. Thousands of oil spills in Nigeria’s Niger Delta There have been thousands of crude oil spills in the tidal mangroves and farmlands of the Niger Delta since oil drilling and production began in the 1950s. Reports and studies document what is widely known here: People often wash, drink, fish and cook in contaminated water. Spills still occur frequently. The Ogboinbiri community in Bayelsa state suffered its fourth spill in three months in November, harming farm fields, streams and the fish people rely on. 'We bought the land in 2023; we have not harvested anything from the farmland; both the profit, our interest, everything is gone,' said Timipre Bridget, a farmer in the community. 'No way to survive with our children again.' Many of the spills are caused by lawbreakers illegally tapping into pipelines to siphon off crude oil they process into gasoline in makeshift refineries. After a major U.N. survey of spills more than a decade ago, oil companies agreed to create a $1 billion cleanup fund for the worst affected area, Ogoniland, and Shell, the largest private oil and gas company in the country, contributed $300 million. The Nigerian government handled the funds and the U.N. was relegated to an advisory role. To oversee the work, the government created the Hydrocarbon Pollution Remediation Project, or Hyprep. It first addressed sites that were supposed to be easy to clean, like the one outside Port Harcourt. Then it would move on to complex ones, where oil had sunk more deeply into the ground. But a confidential investigation by U.N. scientists last year found the site outside Port Harcourt was left with a 'complete absence of topsoil' and almost seven times more petroleum in the subsoil than Nigerian health limits. The company that performed that work has since had its contract revoked, Nenibarini Zabbey, the current director of Hyprep, who took over last year, told the AP. The head of operations when the contract was awarded, Philip Shekwolo, called allegations in the U.N. documents 'baseless, mischievous and cheap blackmail.' Shekwolo, who used to head up oil spill remediation for Shell, said by email he knows more about tackling pollution than any U.N. expert and insists the cleanup has been successful. But the documents show U.N. officials raising the alarm about Hyprep with Nigerian officials since 2021, when Shekwolo was acting chief. Systemic issues with contractors A January 2022 U.N. review found that of 41 contractors allowed to clean up spill sites, 21 had no relevant experience. Not one was judged competent enough to handle more polluted sites. They include Nigerian construction companies and general merchants. The websites of two construction firms, for example, Jukok International and Ministaco Nigeria, make no mention of pollution cleanups. In the minutes of a meeting with U.N. officials and Shell, Hyprep’s own chief of communications, Joseph Kpobari, is shown to have said bad cleanups happen because his agency hired incompetent companies. The U.N. delegation warned that despite their inadequate work, these companies were being rewarded with contracts for tougher sites. Zabbey denied in an email this admission took place. The cleanup of the simple sites was not a failure, he insisted, because 16 out of 20 had now been certified as clean by Nigerian regulators and many returned to communities. Hyprep always complied with guidelines when issuing contracts, Zabbey said, and their monitors were U.N.-trained. Questionable lab tests Two sources close to the cleanup efforts in the Delta, speaking anonymously for fear of loss of business or employment, said test results held up by Hyprep as proof of cleanup could not have been real because when officials visited the laboratories, they found they did not have the equipment to perform those tests. In a letter to its customers, one laboratory in the U.K. frequently used by Hyprep acknowledged its tests for most of 2022 were flawed and unreliable. The U.K. laboratory accreditation service confirmed the lab’s authorization to carry out the tests was suspended twice. Zabbey defended the cleanup agency in a statement to the AP, saying it monitors contractors more closely now. Labs adhere to Nigerian and U.N. recommendations and are frequently checked, he said, and the U.N. could have trained local lab staff if it chose to. The U.N. cited another problem — contractors were allowed to assess pollution levels at their sites. No government agency was setting a baseline for what needed to be cleaned up at oil-damaged sites. This meant companies were monitoring their own progress, effectively handed a 'blank check,' U.N. Senior Project Advisor Iyenemi Kakulu is recorded as having said in minutes of a meeting in June of last year between the U.N., Hyprep and Shell. No audits of Nigerian cleanup agency accounts The U.N. warned the Nigerian government in an assessment in 2021 that spending at the cleanup agency was not being tracked. Internal auditors were viewed as 'the enemy' and 'demonized for doing their job.' Shekwolo’s predecessor as head of Hyprep blocked new financial controls and 'physically prevented' auditors from seeing if work had been performed properly before paying contractors, according to the U.N. assessment. Zabbey said this too, has changed since that assessment: The audit team is now valued, he said, and accounts are now audited annually, although he provided only one audit cover letter. In it, the accounting firm asked what steps had been taken to 'correct the identified weaknesses.' Shekwolo referred the AP to the office of Nigeria’s president, which did not respond to a request to show how funds are being spent. Environment Minister Iziaq Salako’s office declined an interview. An environment minister tries to act Sharon Ikeazor was born in Nigeria, educated in Britain, and spent decades as a lawyer before entering politics. In 2019, she was appointed environment minister of Nigeria. She was well aware of Hyprep’s alleged failings and determined to address them. 'There wasn’t any proper remediation being done,' she told the AP in a phone interview. 'The companies had no competence whatsoever.' In February 2022, she received a letter from senior U.N. official Muralee Thummarukudy, with what experts say is unusually strong language in diplomacy. It warned of 'significant opportunities for malpractice within the contract award process,' in the Nigerian oil cleanup work. Ikeazor removed Shekwolo as acting chief of Hyprep the next month, explaining that she believed he was too close to the politicians. The 'majority' of cleanup companies were owned by politicians, she said. The few competent companies 'wouldn’t get the big jobs.' One of Shekwolo’s roles, Ikeazor said, was to deem who was competent for contract awards. Ikeazor said Shekwolo’s former employer Shell and the U.N. warned her about him, something Shekwolo says he was unaware of. When she hired a new chief of Hyprep was, she had him review every suspect contract awarded over the years and investigate the cleanup companies. 'That sent shockwaves around the political class,' said Ikeazor. 'They all had interests.' 'That was when the battle started,' she said. It was a short battle, and she lost. She was replaced as environment minister and Shekwolo was rehired. He had been gone for two months. Shekwolo says the only politicians he was close to were the two environment ministers he served under. He was never given a reason for his removal, he said, and suggested Ikeazor simply didn’t like him. U.N. breaks ties Last year, the U.N. Environment Programme broke ties with the Nigerian oil spill agency, explaining its five-year consultancy was over. The last support ended in June. Ikeazor said the real reason U.N. pulled out was frustration over corruption. The two sources close to the project concurred the U.N. left because it couldn’t continue to be associated with the Nigerian cleanup organization. Zabbey responded that he believes the U.N. merely changed its goals and moved on. ___ Associated Press reporters Taiwo Adebayo and Dan Ikpoyi contributed from Abuja and Bayelsa, Nigeria. ___ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Bridge collapse in Brazil leaves at least 2 dead and a dozen others missing	SAO PAULO (AP) — A bridge linking two northern states in Brazil collapsed, killing at least two people and leaving a dozen others missing, police said Monday. A sulphuric acid spill is complicating the rescue operation. Footage obtained by local residents showed cars and trucks were crossing the Juscelino Kubitschek de Oliveira bridge when large sections crumbled into a river on Sunday. Police operating on the border of the northern states of Maranhao and Tocantins said that eight vehicles were missing: four trucks, two cars and two motorcycles. Police and Brazil's road department said they started investigations on the case. The 533-meter-long (1,748-foot-long) bridge between the cities of Estreito and Aguiarnopolis was built in the 1960s and located 1,300 kilometers (800 miles) north of the capital, Brasilia. Magnum Coelho, a colonel at the local firefighters' office, told journalists that sending divers for rescue operations is dangerous because the Tocantins River could be contaminated by sulfuric acid from one of the missing trucks that fell from the bridge. The bridge collapse was among several tragedies in Brazil over the weekend. On Saturday, a crash involving a passenger bus and a truck killed dozens of people on a highway in Minas Gerais, a state in southeastern Brazil. On Sunday night, authorities confirmed the number of deaths had risen to 41. Local authorities said Sunday that the truck driver is on the loose and could face criminal responsibility because of allegedly overweight cargo that may have caused the crash. The Minas Gerais state's fire department said that several people were taken to hospitals near the city of Teofilo Otoni. The bus had reportedly departed from Sao Paulo and was carrying 45 passengers. Also on Sunday, at least 10 people died after a small plane crashed in Gramado, a southern town popular with tourists. More than a dozen people were injured on the ground, Brazil’s Civil Defense Agency said. The plane was piloted by Luiz Claudio Galeazzi, a Brazilian businessman who was traveling with his family to Sao Paulo State. Brazil’s Civil Defense Agency said that the plane hit the chimney of a home and then the second floor of a building before crashing into a cellphone store.	https://apnews.com/article/brazil-bridge-collapse-ce12b57b2159f3eaecdcffcd7f2ad75b	2024-12-23T05:38:55-08:00	
Bangladesh seeks extradition of ousted leader Sheikh Hasina from India	DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) — Bangladesh has sent a formal request to India to extradite ousted Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who fled to New Delhi in August amid the student-led protests that ended her 15 years in power, the country’s foreign affairs adviser said Monday. Md Touhid Hossain told reporters at his office in Dhaka that the country has sent a diplomatic note to India’s Foreign Ministry. 'We have informed India about our request to bring her back for the judicial process,' Hossain said. He didn't give details. India’s Foreign Ministry said it had received Bangladesh’s request but didn't immediately provide details. Hasina's son, in a statement posted on his Facebook page, criticized the move hours after Monday's request by the interim government, questioning the process and credibility of a tribunal that is dealing with the charges against her. 'The judges and prosecutors appointed by unelected ... regime to conduct farcical trial process through International Crimes Tribunal makes it a political witch hunt that forsakes justice and marks another ongoing onslaught to prosecute (Hasina's) Awmai League leadership,' said Sajeeb Wazed, her son. 'The Kangaroo tribunal and subsequent request for (Hasina's) extradition comes while hundreds of leaders and activists are extrajudicially killed, framing of outrageous murder charges, illegal incarceration of thousands by law enforcement and violent attacks including looting, vandalism and arson are going on with impunity everyday fueled by denial of the regime,' he said. Hasina fled to India after being ousted in a mass uprising in July and August in which authorities say hundreds of people were killed and thousands more injured. She faces many court cases over the deaths, including some on charges of crimes against humanity. The Dhaka-based International Crimes Tribunal has issued arrest warrants for Hasina and her close aides, and the government has sought help from the international police organization Interpol for her arrest. Last month, Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, the country’s interim leader, said his administration would seek Hasina's extradition. The interim government also has promised to try Hasina and others in her administration for alleged crimes involving the uprising against her and has invited the United Nations to help investigate the killings. Hasina also called for investigation, saying many deaths may have involved others beyond security agencies. New York-based Human Rights Watch said in October that with an arrest warrant out for Hasina, the Yunus-led government should amend laws to abolish capital punishment involving the tribunal to ensure a fair and impartial judicial process. The group had said that unless the government issues a moratorium on the death penalty and makes amendments to ensure a fair trial, the foreign governments sheltering Hasina and her close aides and former Cabinet ministers shouldn't extradite them to face trial. ___ Julhas Alam contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/bangladesh-sheikh-hasina-extradition-india-6effef70de22f18c502a7791360ece08	2024-12-23T04:53:22-08:00	
Rescuers reach a stranded hiker in Slovenia but another is missing during a Balkans snowstorm	SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) — A snowstorm across the Balkans brought traffic chaos, closed schools and left thousands of homes without electricity in Croatia and Bosnia on Monday, while the weather hampered efforts in Slovenia to reach two hikers stranded in the Alps. The hikers from Hungary — a man and a woman — got lost Sunday in poor weather in the mountains north of the capital, Ljubljana, the STA news agency reported. One has a broken leg, it said. The report said a rescue mission that was suspended overnight due to high winds and avalanche risk resumed Monday, but a helicopter could not take off in bad weather to reach the pair at an altitude of 1,700 meters (5,600 feet), officials and media said. Rescuers by mid-afternoon reached the woman but were unable to immediately locate the injured man, said Jernej Lanišek, who leads the rescue mission. In Bosnia, a Turkish woman and her daughter got their car stuck in snow on Prenj mountain in the south and were pulled out by a mountain rescue team. In Croatia, traffic was banned on most roads in the central Lika region and along some sections of motorways. Storms along the Adriatic Sea coastline shut down ferries to the islands and halted traffic on roads toward central areas. All bus departures from the coastal town of Split toward the capital, Zagreb, were cancelled Monday, regional N1 television reported. Authorities in Croatia and Bosnia urged citizens to avoid travel. Bosnia's government suspended classes Monday in schools in the northwest due to heavy snow. Nearly 200,000 homes faced power outages, while trucks and other heavy vehicles were banned from roads in many areas. The snowstorm is forecast to move to Serbia, where meteorologists warned people in the west to avoid travel and prepare for possible power cuts.	https://apnews.com/article/bosnia-croatia-snow-storm-traffic-schools-9d340285f01b20b14b434de79f44cc6c	2024-12-23T04:43:00-08:00	
Imran Khan's party holds talks with Pakistan's government to seek former PM's release	ISLAMABAD (AP) — The political party of Pakistan’s imprisoned former Prime Minister Imran Khan held talks on Monday with the government over the release of its leader and other political activists, officials said. Khan and his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party, or PTI, have not had talks with the government since parliamentary elections in February which saw their main political rival, Shehbaz Sharif, become prime minister. The PTI claims the vote was rigged. The two sides met in Islamabad in the presence of Ayaz Sadiq, the speaker of parliament's National Assembly, or lower house, who initiated efforts to open talks. The meeting was held in a 'conducive environment' and the two sides will meet again on Jan. 2, Sadiq said. As well as Khan's freedom, the PTI is also calling for the release of those supporters arrested during an agitation movement set up to campaign for his release. Khan was ousted in a no-confidence vote in April 2022 and he has so far been embroiled in over 180 legal cases. He was jailed last year when he was sentenced in one of the cases. His conviction were overturned on appeal, but he remained in detention due to other pending cases.	https://apnews.com/article/pakistan-opposition-imran-khan-government-talks-71bdbcbfe0c8cfc4bde1de4a732a5acc	2024-12-23T02:28:20-08:00	
Chinese court issues suspended death sentence to man who drove car into a crowd of schoolchildren	BANGKOK (AP) — A Chinese court issued a suspended death sentence Monday to a man for driving his car into a crowd of elementary school students and parents in southern Hunan province last month. Huang Wen was arrested on site after wounding about 30, 18 of them children, according to the Changde Intermediate People’s Court's statement, which marks the first time authorities have revealed official figures. Censors had taken down videos of the attack on social media and only terse statements from state outlets were used to report updates. He was given a death sentence with a two-year reprieve, usually commuted to life in prison if the convicted commits no further crimes during the suspension period. The court said he rammed his car into the crowd on Nov. 19 after losing invested money, taking out his frustration on bystanders. He was arrested on-site after trying to attack people with a weapon. 'Huang Wen chose an unspecified number of innocent primary school students as his main targets. His criminal motives were despicable and his malice is objectively deep,' said the court statement. Huang's attack happened just a week after a man drove into people exercising at a sports complex in the city of Zhuhai to the south, killing the man killed 35 people and wounding dozens.	https://apnews.com/article/hunan-elementary-school-attack-death-penalty-7d0db0f2d663224ee72ec52a4597ad3b	2024-12-23T01:46:13-08:00	
China says Philippine plan to deploy midrange missiles would be 'extremely irresponsible'	BEIJING (AP) — China said a plan by the Philippines to deploy midrange missiles would be a provocative move that stokes regional tensions. The Philippines top army official told reporters in Manila earlier on Monday that the military plans to acquire a midrange system to defend the country’s territory amid tensions with China in the South China Sea. 'Yes, there are plans, there are negotiations, because we see its feasibility and adaptability,' Lt. Gen. Roy Galido said. The U.S. deployed its Typhon midrange missile system in the northern Philippines in April and troops from both countries have been training jointly for the potential use of the heavy weaponry. China opposes U.S. military assistance to the Philippines and has been particularly alarmed by the deployment of the Typhon system. Under President Joe Biden, the U.S. has strengthened an arc of military alliances in the Indo-Pacific to counter China, including in any confrontation over Taiwan. China's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said that deployment of the weapon by the Philippines would intensify geopolitical confrontation and an arms race. 'It is an extremely irresponsible choice for the history and people of itself and the whole of Southeast Asia, as well as for the security of the region,' she told a daily briefing. The Philippines would not necessarily buy the Typhon system, Galido said. The army is working not only with the United States but with other friendly countries on a long list of weapons platforms that it plans to acquire, he said. The Philippines defense plan includes protecting its exclusive economic zone, which reaches 200 nautical miles (370 kilometers). 'It is paramount for the army to be able to project its force up to that extent, in coordination, of course, with the Philippine navy and the Philippine air force,' Galido said.	https://apnews.com/article/china-philippines-deploy-missile-system-95a5d4b923b262f400c540e1b6926b0e	2024-12-23T01:30:25-08:00	
Magdeburg mourns Christmas market attack victims as fears swirl of deeper social divisions	MAGDEBURG, Germany (AP) — Mourners laid flowers near the scene of the deadly Christmas market attack on Monday as investigators puzzled over the motive of the suspect and fears swirled that the rampage could deepen divisions in German society. The Johanniskirche, a church a short walk from the scene of the attack, has become a central place of mourning since the suspect drove a car into the busy market on Friday evening, killing five people and injuring 200. A carpet of flowers now covers the broad sidewalk in front of the church. Authorities have identified the suspect as a Saudi doctor who arrived in Germany in 2006 and had received permanent residency. They say he does not fit the usual profile of perpetrators of extremist attacks. The man described himself as an ex-Muslim who was highly critical of Islam and in many posts on social media expressed support for the far-right. A picture has emerged of someone who had come to authorities' attention in the past for threatening behavior and been the subject of tipoffs, but was not known to have committed any violence. German Interior Minister Nancy Faeser said Sunday that 'the views and statements that the perpetrator expressed are being investigated, as are the tipoffs and proceedings with various authorities and the justice system.' She said 'the right conclusions' will then have to be drawn. The country's vice chancellor voiced fears that the attack will fuel online misinformation ahead of a national election expected in late February. He urged people to 'take time for the truth' and said: 'Don't let yourselves be infected by hatred.' 'There is still a lot we don't know and a lot is unexplained, including the exact motive,' Robert Habeck said in a video posted Sunday. 'All the same, I fear that the distrust that was immediately propagated on the net against Muslims, foreigners and people with a history of immigration will entrench itself deeper in society' On Sunday night, police in the port city of Bremerhaven said they detained a man who threatened crimes at a Christmas market there in a TikTok video. German news agency dpa reported that he had said he would stab any people of Arabic appearance there on Christmas Day.	https://apnews.com/article/germany-magdeburg-christmas-market-attack-9ae2b2ca5cea3cef79fe502ab3f27b63	2024-12-23T01:12:07-08:00	
Romanian lawmakers narrowly approve new pro-European coalition during period of political turmoil	BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) — Romanian lawmakers on Monday voted narrowly in favor of a new pro-European coalition government led by incumbent Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu. The move could usher in an end to a protracted political crisis in the European Union country following the annulment of a presidential election by a top court. Parliament approved the new administration in a 240-143 vote in Romania's 466-seat legislature. The new coalition is made up of the leftist Social Democratic Party, or PSD, the center-right National Liberal Party, PNL, the small ethnic Hungarian UDMR party and national minorities. It caps a month-long period of turmoil in which far-right nationalists made significant gains in a Dec. 1 parliamentary election, a week after a first-round presidential race saw the far-right outsider Calin Georgescu emerge as the front-runner. 'It will not be an easy mandate for the future government,' Ciolacu, whose PSD party topped the polls in the parliamentary election, said in a statement Monday. 'We are aware that we are in the midst of a deep political crisis,' he said. 'It is also a crisis of trust, and this coalition aims to regain the trust of citizens, the trust of the people.' Romani's 16 ministerial positions will be shared among the parties, which will hold a slim majority in the legislature. It's widely seen as a tactical partnership to shut out far-right nationalists whose voices found fertile ground amid high living costs and a sluggish economy. Ciolacu, who came third in the first-round presidential ballot despite polls indicating he would win the most votes, has served as prime minister since June 2023. After parliament’s approval, President Klaus Iohannis swore in the new government and warned the new Cabinet that it's entering a 'difficult new period' in which 'for many Romanians, there are major concerns.' Romania was plunged into turmoil after Georgescu’s surprise success in the presidential race, after allegations of electoral violations and Russian interference emerged. Days before the Dec. 8 runoff, the Constitutional Court made the unprecedented move to annul the presidential race. 'We go through complicated times, but I think we all learned from mistakes of the past,' Ciolacu said. 'I hope that together with my colleagues in the coalition, we’ll find the best solutions to get past the challenges we have in front of us.' Ciolacu said that the new government would aim to quickly organize the rerun of the presidential election in which the new coalition has agreed to put forward an agreed common pro-European candidate. Cristian Andrei, a political consultant based in Bucharest, said that the new government made up of the same political parties will likely embrace 'soft populist' rhetoric such as economic patriotism, anti-austerity, and a peace solution in neighboring Ukraine to counter the rise of far-right populism. 'This will be a way to answer the concerns of many Romanians who voted for populists … but will not solve the fundamental problem of trust,' he said. 'The only decisive factor now will be who and how convincing the pro-European candidates will be against this popular revolt.' George Simion, the leader of the far-right Alliance for the Unity of Romanians, which came second in the parliamentary election, said that all lawmakers from his party on Monday would vote against the Ciolacu government. In 2021, the PSD and the PNL also formed an unlikely but increasingly strained coalition together with UDMR, which exited the Cabinet last year after a power-sharing dispute. ___ Stephen McGrath reported from Warwick, England.	https://apnews.com/article/romania-government-ciolacu-eu-23f5ddc68c50ec3f5634edfabb1e5dbf	2024-12-23T00:47:02-08:00	
Middle East latest: Israeli airstrikes on Gaza kill at least 20 people, Palestinian medics say	Israeli airstrikes on the Gaza Strip overnight killed at least 20 people, Palestinian medics said Monday. One of the strikes hit a tent camp in the Muwasi area, an Israel-declared humanitarian zone, killing eight people, including two children, according to Nasser Hospital in the southern city of Khan Younis, which received the bodies. The Israeli military says it only strikes militants, accusing them of hiding among civilians. It said late Sunday that it had targeted a Hamas militant in the humanitarian zone. The war began when Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking around 250 hostage. Around 100 captives are still inside Gaza, at least a third of whom are believed to be dead. Israel’s air and ground offensive has killed over 45,200 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry. The ministry says women and children make up more than half the dead but does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in its tally. The military says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence. ___ Here’s the latest: Palestinians in Jenin observe a general strike JENIN, West Bank — Palestinians in the volatile northern West Bank town of Jenin are observing a general strike called by militant groups to protest a rare crackdown by Palestinian security forces. An Associated Press reporter in Jenin heard gunfire and explosions, apparently from clashes between militants and Palestinian security forces. It was not immediately clear if anyone was killed or wounded. There was no sign of Israeli troops in the area. Shops were closed in the city on Monday, the day after militants killed a member of the Palestinian security forces and wounded two others. Militant groups called for a general strike across the territory, accusing the security forces of trying to disarm them in support of Israel’s half-century occupation of the territory. The Western-backed Palestinian Authority is internationally recognized but deeply unpopular among Palestinians, in part because it cooperates with Israel on security matters. Israel accuses the authority of incitement and of failing to act against armed groups. The Palestinian Authority blamed Sunday’s attack on 'outlaws.' It says it is committed to maintaining law and order but will not police the occupation. The Palestinian Authority exercises limited authority in population centers in the West Bank. Israel captured the territory in the 1967 Mideast War, and the Palestinians want it to form the main part of their future state. Israel’s current government is opposed to Palestinian statehood and says it will maintain open-ended security control over the territory. Violence has soared in the West Bank following Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023 attack out of Gaza, which ignited the war there. Lebanon's caretaker prime minister visits military positions in the country's south BEIRUT — Lebanon’s caretaker prime minister has begun a tour of military positions in the country’s south, almost a month after a ceasefire deal that ended the war between Israel and the Hezbollah group that battered the country. Najib Mikati on Monday was on his first visit to the southern frontlines, where Lebanese soldiers under the U.S.-brokered deal are expected to gradually deploy, with Hezbollah militants and Israeli troops both expected to withdraw by the end of next month. Mikati’s tour comes after the Lebanese government expressed its frustration over ongoing Israeli strikes and overflights in the country. 'We have many tasks ahead of us, the most important being the enemy's (Israel's) withdrawal from all the lands it encroached on during its recent aggression,' he said after meeting with army chief Joseph Aoun in a Lebanese military barracks in the southeastern town of Marjayoun. 'Then the army can carry out its tasks in full.' The Lebanese military for years has relied on financial aid to stay functional, primarily from the United States and other Western countries. Lebanon’s cash-strapped government is hoping that the war’s end and ceasefire deal will bring about more funding to increase the military’s capacity to deploy in the south, where Hezbollah’s armed units were notably present. Though they were not active combatants, the Lebanese military said that dozens of its soldiers were killed in Israeli strikes on their premises or patrolling convoys in the south. The Israeli army acknowledged some of these attacks.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-syria-lebanon-news-23-december-2024-d7d28b67bb47c390a7be0ddd925f1c46	2024-12-22T23:35:17-08:00	
Nissan and Honda to attempt a merger that would create the world's No. 3 automaker	TOKYO (AP) — Japanese automakers Honda and Nissan have announced plans to work toward a merger that would form the world’s third-largest automaker by sales, as the industry undergoes dramatic changes in its transition away from fossil fuels. The two companies said they had signed a memorandum of understanding on Monday and that smaller Nissan alliance member Mitsubishi Motors Corp. also had agreed to join the talks on integrating their businesses. Automakers in Japan have lagged behind their big rivals in electric vehicles and are trying to cut costs and make up for lost time as newcomers like China's BYD and EV market leader Tesla devour market share. Honda's president, Toshihiro Mibe, said Honda and Nissan will attempt to unify their operations under a joint holding company. Honda will lead the new management, retaining the principles and brands of each company. They aim to have a formal merger agreement by June and to complete the deal and list the holding company on the Tokyo Stock Exchange by August 2026, he said. No dollar value was given and the formal talks are just starting, Mibe said. There are 'points that need to be studied and discussed,' he said. 'Frankly speaking, the possibility of this not being implemented is not zero.' A merger could result in a behemoth worth more than $50 billion based on the market capitalization of all three automakers. Together, Honda, Nissan and Mitsubishi would gain scale to compete with Toyota Motor Corp. and with Germany’s Volkswagen AG. Toyota has technology partnerships with Japan’s Mazda Motor Corp. and Subaru Corp. News of a possible merger surfaced earlier this month, with unconfirmed reports saying Taiwan iPhone maker Foxconn was seeking to tie up with Nissan by buying shares from the Japan's company's other alliance partner, Renault SA of France. Nissan's CEO Makoto Uchida said Foxconn had not directly approach his company. He also acknowledged that Nissan's situation was 'severe.' Even after a merger Toyota, which rolled out 11.5 million vehicles in 2023, would remain the leading Japanese automaker. If they join, the three smaller companies would make about 8 million vehicles. In 2023, Honda made 4 million and Nissan produced 3.4 million. Mitsubishi Motors made just over 1 million. 'We have come to the realization that in order for both parties to be leaders in this mobility transformation, it is necessary to make a more bold change than a collaboration in specific areas,' Mibe said. Nissan, Honda and Mitsubishi earlier agreed to share components for electric vehicles like batteries and to jointly research software for autonomous driving to adapt better to electrification. Nissan has struggled following a scandal that began with the arrest of its former chairman Carlos Ghosn in late 2018 on charges of fraud and misuse of company assets, allegations that he denies. He eventually was released on bail and fled to Lebanon. Speaking Monday to reporters in Tokyo via a video link, Ghosn derided the planned merger as a 'desperate move.' From Nissan, Honda could get truck-based body-on-frame large SUVs such as the Armada and Infiniti QX80 that Honda doesn’t have, with large towing capacities and good off-road performance, Sam Fiorani, vice president of AutoForecast Solutions, told The Associated Press. Nissan also has years of experience building batteries and electric vehicles, and gas-electric hybrid powertrains that could help Honda in developing its own EVs and next generation of hybrids, he said. But the company said in November that it was slashing 9,000 jobs, or about 6% of its global work force, and reducing its global production capacity by 20% after reporting a quarterly loss of 9.3 billion yen ($61 million). It recently reshuffled its management and Uchida, its chief executive, took a 50% pay cut while acknowledging responsibility for the financial woes, saying Nissan needed to become more efficient and respond better to market tastes, rising costs and other global changes. 'We anticipate that if this integration comes to fruition, we will be able to deliver even greater value to a wider customer base,' Uchida said. Fitch Ratings recently downgraded Nissan’s credit outlook to 'negative,' citing worsening profitability, partly due to price cuts in the North American market. But it noted that it has a strong financial structure and solid cash reserves that amounted to 1.44 trillion yen ($9.4 billion). Nissan’s share price also had fallen to the point where it is considered something of a bargain. On Monday, its Tokyo-traded shares gained 1.6%. They jumped more than 20% after news of the possible merger broke last week. Honda's shares surged 3.8%. Honda's net profit slipped nearly 20% in the first half of the April-March fiscal year from a year earlier, as its sales suffered in China. The merger reflects an industry-wide trend toward consolidation. At a routine briefing Monday, Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi said he would not comment on details of the automakers' plans, but said Japanese companies need to stay competitive in the fast changing market. 'As the business environment surrounding the automobile industry largely changes, with competitiveness in storage batteries and software is increasingly important, we expect measures needed to survive international competition will be taken,' Hayashi said. ___ Kurtenbach reported from Bangkok.	https://apnews.com/article/japan-nissan-honda-evs-foxconn-782913451d6487ed177a3517a9ba5be5	2024-12-22T22:32:06-08:00	
Japan's former Emperor Akihito marks his 91st birthday	TOKYO (AP) — Japan's beloved former Emperor Akihito marked his 91st birthday on Monday, as he continues to pursue his lifetime research into goby fish, care for his wife and pray for peace. Akihito, who abdicated in 2019 and handed over the Chrysanthemum throne to his son, Emperor Naruhito, now holds the title of Emperor Emeritus. Akihito has since receded from official duties and enjoys his time quietly while caring for his 90-year-old wife, former Empress Michiko, who broke her leg bone in October and is still recovering, according to the Imperial Household Agency. Akihito's daily routine includes reading newspapers in the morning and evening, and watching the news with Michiko over meals, the IHA said. The former Emperor was to celebrate his birthday on Monday with his relatives and other guests. This year, Akihito has been particularly concerned about people who were affected by a fatal New Year earthquake and heavy rains in autumn in Japan's northcentral region of Noto, the IHA said. Akihito continues to actively research the classification of Japanese freshwater goby fish at a palace laboratory and his residence, officials said. Under Japan’s Constitution, the emperor is a symbol without political power. Wartime militarist governments worshipped the emperor as a living god and fought the war in his name until Akihito's father renounced that status after the country’s 1945 war defeat. Akihito during his three-decade reign embraced an identity as peacemaker and often made reconciliatory missions and carefully scripted expressions of regret on the war. Palace officials said Akihito continues to observe a moment of silence on days marking key events of the war, including the end of the Battle of Okinawa, the anniversaries of the U.S. atomic bombings on Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the day Japan surrendered. The former emperor’s daily life is 'still deeply connected with his wartime memories,' the palace said. Akihito and Michiko are currently rehearsing passages from a book on the Battle of Okinawa as part of their daily routine, the IHA said.	https://apnews.com/article/japan-akihito-emperor-empress-birthday-abdication-monarchy-58cca340fee8f2353e826620f5a8ee66	2024-12-22T22:08:00-08:00	
Australia approves extradition of former US Marine over alleged training of Chinese military pilots	NEWCASTLE, Australia (AP) — Former U.S. Marine Corps pilot Daniel Duggan will be extradited from Australia to the United States over allegations that he illegally trained Chinese aviators. Australia’s Attorney General Mark Dreyfus approved the extradition on Monday, ending the Boston-born 55-year-old's nearly two-year attempt to avoid being returned to the U.S. Duggan, who served in the Marines for 12 years before immigrating to Australia and giving up his U.S. citizenship, has been in a maximum-security prison since he was arrested in 2022 at his family home in the state of New South Wales. He is the father of six children. Dreyfus confirmed in a statement on Monday he had approved the extradition but did not say when Duggan would be transferred to the U.S. 'Duggan was given the opportunity to provide representations as to why he should not be surrendered to the United States. In arriving at my decision, I took into consideration all material in front of me,' Dreyfus said in the statement. In May, a Sydney judge ruled Duggan could be extradited to the U.S., leaving an appeal to the attorney general as Duggan’s last hope of remaining in Australia. In a 2016 indictment from the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., unsealed in late 2022, prosecutors said Duggan conspired with others to provide training to Chinese military pilots in 2010 and 2012, and possibly at other times, without applying for an appropriate license. Prosecutors say he received payments totaling around 88,000 Australian dollars ($61,000) and international travel from another conspirator for what was sometimes described as 'personal development training.' If convicted, Duggan faces up to 60 years in prison. He denies the allegations. 'We feel abandoned by the Australian government and deeply disappointed that they have completely failed in their duty to protect an Australian family,' his wife, Saffrine Duggan, said in a statement on Monday. 'We are now considering our options.'	https://apnews.com/article/australia-extradition-marine-pilot-duggan-chinese-military-91c0fc14dc296a3a60894bfe8306d7c3	2024-12-22T20:39:16-08:00	
Many Americans have come to rely on Chinese-made drones. Now lawmakers want to ban them	WASHINGTON (AP) — Russell Hedrick, a North Carolina farmer, flies drones to spray fertilizers on his corn, soybean and wheat fields at a fraction of what it would cost him to use a conventional ground spreader. As a volunteer rescuer, Hedrick uses thermal drones to search for people trapped by mudslides and cargo drones to send water and baby formula to those who are stranded — something he did after Hurricane Helene. Now he is fretting that one day he will have to ground his drone fleet. Most commercial drones sold in the United States, including those used by Hedrick, are made in China. They have become a target of U.S. lawmakers, who see the dominance of Chinese drones not only as an espionage threat but as a commercial threat because they make it nearly impossible for American manufacturers to compete. It’s another front in the U.S.-China economic and technological competition that’s likely to intensify with the return to the White House in January of Republican Donald Trump, who has promised to get tough on China. Washington has already placed restrictions on Chinese telecommunications companies and imposed high tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles as the U.S. competes with China in semiconductors, artificial intelligence and other areas. A defense bill that Congress passed on Dec. 18 includes a clause to stop two Chinese companies from selling new drones in the U.S. if a review finds they pose 'an unacceptable risk' to American national security. Congress has banned federal agencies from acquiring Chinese drones, with some exceptions, and several states have barred publicly funded programs from using or procuring Chinese drones. A broader ban is worrisome for Americans for whom drones have become a part of their lives and work. It could disrupt wide-ranging operations, from law enforcement to mapping and filmmaking that drone operators say are viable because of the low cost and high performance of the Chinese drones. American-made drones just aren’t comparable, they say. American reliance on Chinese-made drones In Hickory, North Carolina, Hedrick began flying Chinese-made drones in 2019 to fertilize crops and monitor crop health. A drone spreader costs $35,000, while a conventional ground sprayer would set him back $250,000, he said. 'With the drone efficiency, we are able to do things we were never able to do before: to apply fertilizer but use less, which is good for American consumers,' Hedrick said. But it’s precisely that reliance on Chinese drones that worries U.S. lawmakers. 'It is strategically irresponsible to allow Communist China to be our drone factory,' argued Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., who has been tapped by Trump to be the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. She led earlier House efforts to ban new Chinese drones. It was the role of drones in everyday life that drove Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., to get Congress to restrict the purchase of Chinese drones by federal agencies. Those restrictions were included in a defense bill that Democratic President Joe Biden signed last year. Scott has compared Chinese drones to spy balloons that could 'gather data or carry harmful payloads' across America, posing risks to military bases, critical infrastructure and natural resources. Michael Robbins, president and chief executive officer of AUVSI, an advocacy group for unmanned vehicles such as drones, opposes an immediate ban. Instead, his group has urged the government to support the U.S. drone-making industry through investment so it can catch up with its Chinese competitors in both capability and cost. He applauds Congress for addressing some of the issues in the 2025 defense budget, including promoting investment in autonomous technology and working to develop a secure supply chain for U.S. drone manufacturing. That vulnerability was clear earlier this year when Beijing sanctioned the U.S. drone maker Skydio, forcing it to ration its batteries sourced from China. 'This is an attempt to eliminate the leading American drone company and deepen the world’s dependence on Chinese drone suppliers,' wrote Adam Bry, chief executive officer of Skydio. Citing security interests, China has restricted exports to the U.S. of drone parts, including motors, flight controllers and imaging equipment. John Goodson, CEO of Darkhive, a San Antonio-based drone maker, said a ban would not stop Chinese drone makers from selling their products elsewhere in the world but could hurt U.S. drone companies that rely on China for parts. For now, it remains unrealistic to ban Chinese drones when there are few comparable products, said Faine Greenwood, a drone enthusiast who writes extensively about drones. 'If we ban the Chinese drones, we knock out many amazing things we do.' The dominant Chinese player The best-known Chinese drones are those by DJI Technology Co., a company founded in 2006 and based in the southern city of Shenzhen. It's named in the defense spending bill, along with another Chinese company, Autel Robotics. DJI has the lion's share of the global drone market and is the dominant player in the U.S. market. Its devices are known for their affordability and high performance. They are even used on the battlefield in Ukraine by both sides, even though DJI does not make military drones. DJI's drones have been used by first responders to locate disaster victims, mappers to survey roads and utility lines, mosquito control officers to reach swarms of larvae, and filmmakers to capture aerial footage. Police use them to help prevent crime and find missing people. Hedrick, the North Carolina farmer, mobilized drone search efforts as a volunteer after Helene hit. On the first night, he and his teammates located 150 stranded people. When they could not be immediately rescued, Hedrick said his team used DJI cargo drones to send in supplies. 'I am not going to say I won’t love to have U.S. drones, but I don’t see the American drones as anywhere close to the DJI drones in terms of reliability, ease of use, and just the user-friendly software,' Hedrick said. 'The U.S. drones are not as good as the DJI ones but cost twice as much.' But as U.S.-China relations have soured, DJI drones have come under scrutiny. The U.S. government has put the company on several blacklists, saying it violates human rights by supplying drones to Chinese police to surveil members of the ethnic Uyghur minority, and alleging links to the Chinese military. DJI has denied wrongdoing and is suing the Pentagon over the designation that it is a Chinese military company. U.S. customs officials also have blocked some DJI shipments over concerns that the products might have been made with forced labor. DJI has called it 'a customs-related misunderstanding.' As for the defense bill, DIJ said it contains no provision that would allow the company to defend itself. 'We call on a relevant technical intelligence agency to undertake an audit of our products, and we ask for a fair right of reply to any findings,' DJI said. The Chinese Embassy in Washington said China opposes what it calls the politicization of trade. 'The Chinese government firmly supports Chinese companies in carrying out international trade and cooperation in drones for civilian use, and opposes certain countries’ frequent illegal sanctions on Chinese companies and individuals on the grounds of so-called national security,' Liu Pengyu, the embassy spokesman, said in a statement. A lack of alternatives Several states have already restricted the use of Chinese drones. In Tennessee, public agencies, including police and fire departments, are no longer allowed to purchase DJI drones. That caused a headache for Capt. Chris Lowe of the Kingsport Fire Department. After his department lost a DJI Mavic Pro drone, he was quoted $5,000 for a replacement from an approved list of drones, when another DJI Mavic Pro would cost $1,000 to $1,500. 'Basically it would be a DJI clone but doesn’t have all the capabilities,' Lowe said of the alternative. Without any state assistance, he said he would either forgo a new drone or tighten the belt in equipment maintenance elsewhere. He said the department has used drones to scope out wildfires, chemical leaks and disaster scenes and to search for missing people. 'It's about life and death,' he said. In Wimberley, Texas, Gene Robinson has used high-resolution drone images to analyze differences in vegetation to discover buried bodies. He said he helped police find a victim's buried arm, making prosecution possible. Robinson doesn’t think there’s a viable alternative to the DJI drone he uses. He said his project at Texas State University's Forensic Anthropology Center would be 'deader than a doornail' if there's a national ban on Chinese-made drones. At the Interior Department, the policy against foreign-made drones has hamstrung its drone operations, resulting in the 'loss of opportunities to collect data on landscape, natural and cultural resources, wildlife and infrastructure,' according to a September report by the U.S. Government Accountability Office. Florida's state ban In Florida, law enforcement officers last year complained to the state senate that a ban on state-funded agencies operating Chinese-made drones left them with costlier aircraft that didn't perform as well. That prompted state lawmakers to appropriate $25 million to help government-run drone programs acquire compliant models. Christopher Todd, executive director of the not-for-profit group Airborne International Response Team, described the ban and the subsequent switch as 'an absolute mess.' 'Lawmakers failed to understand that this issue is far more complicated than simply changing from one drone to another,' he said. 'You need to learn a new user interface with new shortcuts and new protocols, and then you need to change all of the software and accessories and re-examine all of your network configurations to accommodate the technology change.' But the financial assistance as well as training programs, such as the one provided by his group, made the transition possible, he said. More than 90% of law enforcement agencies in Florida used DJI drones in 2022, and the share plummeted to about 14% after the ban, according to Todd's group. In Orange County, where Orlando is located, the sheriff's office said it spent nearly $580,000 to replace 18 noncompliant drones last year and received nearly $400,000 in reimbursements from the state. 'The transition has gone well and has simultaneously increased our drone fleet with better capabilities and technology,' the sheriff's office said.	https://apnews.com/article/china-drones-congress-ban-f69836c63b6e90956464f68c429f2724	2024-12-22T20:12:06-08:00	
Bethlehem plans another somber Christmas under the shadow of war in Gaza	BETHLEHEM, West Bank (AP) — The Nativity Store in Manger Square has sold handmade olive wood carvings and religious items to people visiting the traditional birthplace of Jesus since 1927. But as Bethlehem prepares to mark its second Christmas under the shadow of the war in Gaza, there are almost no tourists, leaving the Nativity Store and other businesses unsure of how much longer they can hold on. For the second straight year, Bethlehem’s Christmas celebrations will be somber and muted, in deference to ongoing war in Gaza. There will be no giant Christmas tree in Manger Square, no raucous scout marching bands, no public lights twinkling and very few public decorations or displays. 'Last year before Christmas, we had more hope, but now again we are close to Christmas and we don’t have anything,' said Rony Tabash, the third-generation owner of Nativity Store. Israel's war against Hamas has been raging for nearly 15 months, and there still is no end in sight. Repeated ceasefire efforts have stalled. Since the war began, tourism to Israel and the Israeli-occupied West Bank has plummeted. And after Israel barred entry to most of the 150,000 Palestinians in the West Bank who had jobs in Israel, the Palestinian economy contracted by 25% in the past year. The yearly Christmas celebrations in Bethlehem — shared among Armenian, Catholic and Orthodox denominations — are usually major boons for the city, where tourism accounts for 70% of its yearly income. But the streets are empty this season. Tabash said he continues to open the store every day, but often an entire week will go by without a sale. Tabash works with more than 25 local families who create hand-carved religious items out of the region’s storied olive wood. But with no buyers, work has dried up for these families. Lots of room at the inn The number of visitors to the city plunged from a pre-COVID high of around 2 million visitors per year in 2019 to fewer than 100,000 visitors in 2024, said Jiries Qumsiyeh, the spokesperson for the Palestinian tourism ministry. According to the Christmas story, Mary was forced to give birth to Jesus in a stable because there was no room at the inn. Today, nearly all of Bethlehem’s 5,500 hotel rooms are empty. The city’s hotel occupancy rate plunged from around 80% in early 2023 to around 3% today, said Elias Al Arja, the head of Bethlehem Hoteliers Association. At his own hotel, the Bethlehem Hotel, he said he has laid off a staff of more than 120 people and retains just five employees. The city hosts more than 100 stores and 450 workshops dealing with traditional Palestinian handicraft, Qumsiyeh said. But just a week before Christmas, when the city should be bursting with visitors, Manger Square was mostly empty save for a few locals selling coffee and tea. Only two of the eight stores in the main drag of the square were open for business. Qumsiyeh worries that when the war ends and tourism eventually rebounds, many of the families that have handed down traditional skills for generations will no longer be making the items that reflect Palestinian heritage and culture. Many are leaving the region entirely. 'We have witnessed a very high rate of emigration since the beginning of the aggression, especially among those working in the tourism sector,' said Qumsiyeh. A Christmas without joy Almost 500 families have left Bethlehem in the past year, said Mayor Anton Salman. And those are just the families who moved abroad with official residency visas. Many others have moved abroad on temporary tourist visas and are working illegally, and it's unclear if they will return, Salman said. Around half of the population in the Bethlehem area, including nearby villages, works in either tourism or in jobs in Israel. The unemployment rate in Bethlehem is roughly 50%, said Salman. Unemployment across the West Bank is around 30%, according to the Palestinian Economy Ministry. Canceling Christmas festivities is one way to draw attention to the difficult situation in Bethlehem and across the Palestinian territories, said Salman. 'This year we want to show the world that the Palestinian people are still suffering and they haven’t the joy that everybody else in the world having,' said Salman. It is another blow to the Holy Land's dwindling population over the decade due to emigration and a low birthrate. Christians are a small percentage of the population. There are about 182,000 in Israel, 50,000 in the West Bank and Jerusalem and 1,300 in Gaza, according to the U.S. State Department. Finding the light in the night Father Issa Thaljieh, the parish priest of the Greek Orthodox Church in the Church of the Nativity, said many families are struggling financially, leaving them unable to pay rent or school fees, much less buy Christmas presents or celebrate the holiday in other ways. The church’s social services have tried to help, but the needs are great, he said. Thaljieh said his Christmas message this year focused on encouraging Palestinians in Bethlehem to stay despite the challenges. 'A church without Christians is not a church,' he said, as workers hand-polished the ornate brass candelabras in the cavernous, empty church a week before the holiday. 'The light that was born when Jesus Christ was born here is the light that moves beyond darkness, so we have to wait, we have to be patient, we have to pray a lot, and we have to stay with our roots because our roots are in Bethlehem,' he said. Some families are finding ways to bring back pockets of joy. Bethlehem resident Nihal Bandak, 39, gave into her three children’s requests to have a Christmas tree this year, after not having one last year. Decorating the tree is the favorite part of Christmas of her youngest daughter, 8-year-old Stephanie. Mathew Bandak, 11 was thrilled his family brought back some of their traditions, but also torn. 'I was happy because we get to decorate and celebrate, but people are in Gaza who don’t have anything to celebrate,' he said. Rony Tabash, the third-generation owner of Nativity Store, said he will continue to open the store, because it’s part of his family’s history. 'We are not feeling Christmas, but in the end, Christmas is in our hearts,' he said, adding that the entire city was praying for a ceasefire and peace. 'We have a big faith that always, when we see Christmas, it will give us the light in the night.'	https://apnews.com/article/christmas-israel-palestinians-bethlehem-jesus-gaza-war-b508f651811c710e6d2f1994a3dcf131	2024-12-22T20:09:03-08:00	
Stock market today: World shares are mixed after rally on Wall St caps a dismal week	BANGKOK (AP) — World shares were mixed on Monday after U.S. stocks capped a mostly dismal week with a broad rally that still left the benchmark S&amp;P 500 down 2% for the week. One shadow over markets was cleared when U.S. lawmakers passed a budget deal in the early hours of Saturday, narrowly averting a pre-Christmas government shutdown. Germany's DAX fell 0.3% to 19,830.42. The CAC 40 in Paris slid 0.3% to 7,251.05, while Britain's FTSE shed 0.2% to 8,068.17. The future for the S&amp;P 500 gained 0.3% while that for the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.1%. In Asian trading, Tokyo's Nikkei 225 index jumped 1.2% to 39,161.34, while the dollar was trading at 156.50 Japanese yen, up from 156.48 yen. Japanese automakers Honda Motor Co. and Nissan Motor Corp. announced Monday they had agreed to work toward a possible merger that might also include Nissan's smaller alliance partner Mitsubishi Motors Corp. Honda's shares, which fell after news of the talks on a deal surfaced last week, jumped 3.8%. Nissan's, which had soared, rose1.6%. Elsewhere in Asia, Hong Kong's Hang Seng gained 0.8% to 19,883.13, while the Shanghai Composite index slipped 0.5% to 3,351.26. Australia's S&amp;P/ASX 500 jumped 1.7% to 8,201.60. South Korea's Kospi added 1.6% to 2,442.01 and Taiwan's Taiex jumped 2.6%, with TSMC, the world's biggest computer chip maker, gaining 4.4%. Hon Hai Precision Industry, which reportedly had been maneuvering to buy a big stake in Nissan, jumped 3.8%. In Bangkok, the SET advanced 1.4%. On Friday, the S&amp;P 500 rallied 1.1% and the Dow jumped 1.2%. The Nasdaq composite gained 1%. Roughly nine of every 10 stocks in the S&amp;P 500 rose. Superstar stock Nvidia and other Big Tech companies led the market, which got a lift after a report said a measure of inflation the Federal Reserve likes to use was slightly lower last month than economists expected. It’s an encouraging signal following recent reports suggesting inflation may be tough to get all the way down to the Fed’s 2% goal from its peak above 9%. The threat of higher inflation was one of the reasons Fed Chair Jerome Powell gave last week when the central bank hinted it may deliver fewer cuts to interest rates next year than it earlier expected. That warning sent a shock through the stock market, which had run to 57 all-time highs this year amid the widespread assumption the Fed would deliver a string of cuts to rates into 2025. Now traders are largely betting on one, two or perhaps even zero next year, according to data from CME Group. Critics had been warning stock prices were vulnerable to drops after running so high and that the market likely needed everything to go correctly to justify its stellar gains for the year. Besides the diminished hopes for several rate cuts next year, Wall Street got another reminder late Thursday that everything may not go as expected. The U.S. stock market has lost a chunk of its gain since Trump’s win on Election Day, which raised hopes for faster economic growth and more lax regulations that would boost corporate profits. Worries have risen that Trump’s preference for tariffs and other policies could lead to higher inflation, a bigger U.S. government debt and difficulties for global trade. In other dealings early Monday, U.S. benchmark crude oil picked up 24 cents to $69.70 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, was up 24 cents at $73.18. The euro fell to $1.0415 from $1.0433.	https://apnews.com/article/stocks-markets-rates-japan-nissan-1df537e3e89f06bf5e7777ea2480cf16	2024-12-22T19:26:34-08:00	
Former Israeli spies describe attack using exploding electronic devices against Hezbollah	WASHINGTON (AP) — Two recently retired senior Israeli intelligence agents shared new details about a deadly clandestine operation years in the making that targeted Hezbollah militants in Lebanon and Syria using exploding pagers and walkie talkies three months ago. Hezbollah began striking Israel almost immediately after Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack that sparked the Israel-Hamas war. The agents spoke with CBS '60 Minutes' in a segment aired Sunday night. They wore masks and spoke with altered voices to hide their identities. One agent said the operation started 10 years ago using walkie-talkies laden with hidden explosives, which Hezbollah didn't realize it was buying from Israel, its enemy. The walkie-talkies were not detonated until September, a day after booby-trapped pagers were set off. 'We created a pretend world,' said the officer, who went by the name 'Michael.' Phase two of the plan, using the booby-trapped pagers, kicked in in 2022 after Israel's Mossad intelligence agency learned Hezbollah had been buying pagers from a Taiwan-based company, the second officer said. The pagers had to be made slightly larger to accommodate the explosives hidden inside. They were tested on dummies multiple times to find the right amount of explosive that would hurt only the Hezbollah fighter and not anyone else in close proximity. Mossad also tested numerous ring tones to find one that sounded urgent enough to make someone pull the pager out of their pocket. The second agent, who went by the name 'Gabriel,' said it took two weeks to convince Hezbollah to switch to the heftier pager, in part by using false ads on YouTube promoting the devices as dustproof, waterproof, providing a long battery life and more. He described the use of shell companies, including one based in Hungary, to dupe the Taiwanese firm, Gold Apollo, into unknowingly partnering with the Mossad. Hezbollah also was unaware it was working with Israel. Gabriel compared the ruse to a 1998 psychological film about a man who has no clue that he is living in a false world and his family and friends are actors paid to keep up the illusion. 'When they are buying from us, they have zero clue that they are buying from the Mossad,' Gabriel said. 'We make like ‘Truman Show,’ everything is controlled by us behind the scene. In their experience, everything is normal. Everything was 100% kosher including businessman, marketing, engineers, showroom, everything.' By September, Hezbollah militants had 5,000 pagers in their pockets. Israel triggered the attack on Sept. 17, when pagers all over Lebanon started beeping. The devices would explode even if the person failed to push the buttons to read an incoming encrypted message. The next day, Mossad activated the walkie-talkies, some of which exploded at funerals for some of the approximately 30 people who were killed in the pager attacks. Gabriel said the goal was more about sending a message than actually killing Hezbollah fighters. 'If he just dead, so he’s dead. But if he’s wounded, you have to take him to the hospital, take care of him. You need to invest money and efforts,' he said. 'And those people without hands and eyes are living proof, walking in Lebanon, of ‘don’t mess with us.’ They are walking proof of our superiority all around the Middle East.' In the days after the attack, Israel's air force hit targets across Lebanon, killing thousands. Hezbollah's leader, Hassan Nasrallah, was assassinated when Israel dropped bombs on his bunker. By November, the war between Israel and Hezbollah, a byproduct of the deadly attack by Hamas militants in southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, ended with a ceasefire. More than 45,000 Palestinians have been killed in the war in Gaza between Israel and Hamas militants, health officials have said. The agent using the name 'Michael' said that the day after the pager explosions, people in Lebanon were afraid to turn on their air conditioners out of fear that they would explode, too. 'There is real fear,' he said. Asked if that was intentional, he said, 'We want them to feel vulnerable, which they are. We can’t use the pagers again because we already did that. We’ve already moved on to the next thing. And they’ll have to keep on trying to guess what the next thing is.'	https://apnews.com/article/lebanon-israel-devices-exploding-mossad-cbs-hezbollah-b008d92e6c9f0747f23def9bf3a5e3df	2024-12-22T18:48:34-08:00	
A Holy Year is about to start in Rome. Here's what you need to know	VATICAN CITY (AP) — Pope Francis on Tuesday formally inaugurates the 2025 Holy Year, reviving an ancient church tradition encouraging the faithful to make pilgrimages to Rome, amid new security fears following a Christmas market attack in Germany. At the start of Christmas Eve Mass, Francis will push open the Holy Door on St. Peter’s Basilica, which will stay open throughout the year to allow the estimated 32 million pilgrims projected to visit Rome to pass through. The first Holy Year was called in 1300 and in recent times they are generally celebrated every 25 to 50 years. Pilgrims who participate can obtain 'indulgences' — the centuries-old feature of the Catholic Church related to the forgiveness of sins that roughly amounts to a 'get out of Purgatory free' card. The last regular Jubilee was in 2000, when St. John Paul II ushered in the church’s third millennium. Francis declared a special Jubilee in 2015-2016 dedicated to mercy and the next one planned is in 2033, to commemorate the anniversary of the crucifixion of Christ. What are indulgences? According to church teaching, Catholics who confess their sins are forgiven and therefore released from the eternal or spiritual punishment of damnation. An indulgence is designed to remove the 'temporal' punishment of sin that may remain — the consequence of the wrongdoing that might disrupt the sinner’s relationships with others. Martin Luther’s opposition to the church’s practice of selling indulgences inspired him to launch the Protestant Reformation in the 1500s. He was excommunicated, and the practice of buying and selling indulgences has been illegal since the 1562 Council of Trent. But the granting of them has continued and is an important element in Holy Year pilgrimages. According to the norms issued for the 2025 Jubilee, Catholics can obtain an indulgence if they: — Undertake a pious pilgrimage, participating in Masses and other sacraments, at any of the four papal basilicas in Rome or the Holy Land, or other sacred Jubilee sites 'so as to manifest the great need for conversion and reconciliation.' — Participate in works of charity, mercy or penance, such as visiting prisoners, sick people or elderly people or undertaking corporal works of mercy 'to feed the hungry, give drink to the thirsty, clothe the naked, welcome the stranger, heal the sick, visit the imprisoned, and bury the dead.' — Abstain, in a spirit of penance, for at least one day of the week from 'futile distractions,' such as social media, or from 'superfluous consumption,' such as fasting; or donating the proportionate sum to the poor or to help migrants. Why the focus on prisoners? Francis has long made ministry to prisoners a hallmark of his priestly vocation, and a Holy Year dedicated to a message of hope is no exception. In fact, the only other Holy Door that Francis will personally open this year is located at the chapel of Rome’s Rebibbia prison, to draw attention to the need to give prisoners in particular hope of a better future. The final big event of the Holy Year before it closes on Jan. 6, 2026, is the Jubilee of Prisoners on Dec. 14, 2025. What’s on the calendar? The Jubilee calendar is a dizzying compilation of official and unofficial Holy Year events that will sorely test the stamina of Francis, who just turned 88 and went into the Christmas season with a cold that made it hard for him to catch his breath. Every month has two, three or four official Jubilee events that Francis is expected to attend which are designated for particular categories of people: the armed forces, artists, priests, poor people, volunteers and teachers. Then there are the unofficial Jubilee events, in which individual dioceses and other groups have organized their own pilgrimages to Rome. One item on the Jubilee’s unofficial calendar, Sept. 6, has made news because it has been organized by an Italian association, 'La Tenda di Gionata' or 'Jonathan’s Tent,' which is dedicated to making LGBTQ+ Catholics feel more welcome in the Catholic Church. What about security for so many people? Rome Mayor Roberto Gualtieri has said the security plans call for a mix of traditional policing — a reported 700 extra officers — plus high-tech surveillance using drones and closed-circuit cameras that, thanks to algorithms informed by artificial intelligence, can keep track in real time of crowd sizes and congestion points. 'There will be more vehicles, more men, and very, very shall we say robust and important security devices,' Gualtieri told reporters last week. As it is, the Vatican has tried to reduce congestion as much as possible for pilgrims by allowing them to reserve their visits to St. Peter’s Basilica in advance. After a driver plowed into a Christmas market in Magdeburg, Germany, killing five people, Italian authorities last week sent a circular to police stations around the country recommending 'maximum' investigative efforts and to immediately boost surveillance and police patrols around Christmas markets and displays and tourist attractions. The Vatican, with its life-sized creche and giant Christmas tree in St. Peter’s Square and outdoor exhibit of nativity scenes in the Bernini colonnade ringing it, certainly qualifies as an at-risk target. How else is Rome preparing? Rome has been groaning under two years of intense preparations for the Holy Year that involved major public works projects and artistic renovations that have coincided with separate initiatives paid for by the European Union’s COVID-19 recovery funds. Fewer than a third of the 323 Jubilee projects have been finished or are wrapping up, meaning the traffic headaches and eyesores will continue well into 2025 and even 2026. But Romans and visitors are at least beginning to see some of the finished products. Bernini’s fountains in Piazza Navona are glistening white again after a monthslong cleaning. Just this weekend, a spiffed-up Trevi Fountain reopened, and on Monday the main Jubilee project was being unveiled: A pedestrian piazza linking Castel St. Angelo to the Via della Conciliazione, the main boulevard leading to St. Peter’s Square. ___ Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

Trauma lingers on for survivors of the deadly tsunami that hit Thailand 20 years ago	BAN NAM KHEM, Thailand (AP) — The 20-year-old freshman student was still asleep that Sunday morning at the family's house on the Andaman Sea coast of southern Thailand when her mom, sensing something wasn't right, woke her up saying they needed to leave right away. The day is forever seared in Neungduangjai Sritrakarn's memory: Dec. 26, 2004, the day the deadly Indian Ocean tsunami struck across South and Southeast Asia, after a 9.1 magnitude earthquake off the west coast of Indonesia’s Sumatra island. It was one of modern history’s worst natural disasters. Neungduangjai's mom had noticed a strange pattern of whitecaps on the sea, just as a relative who returned from a fishing trip came by to warn them. They grabbed all the family members' essential documents and hopped on motorbikes. Within minutes, Neungduangjai, her mother, father, brother and sister were speeding away, trying to get as far as they could from their village of Ban Nam Khem. Looking back, Neungduangjai saw a surging wall of water, taller than her home, moving toward shore from far away. She had never seen anything like it. They got about 3 kilometers (1.8 miles) away when the wall of water crashed into the shore of Phang Nga province and caught up with them, knocking them off their bikes. The water was dark, sweeping all kinds of objects, man-made and natural. Nuengduangjai pulled herself to her feet but could barely stand in the moving mass — the water was almost up to her knees. She didn't know at the time that the tsunami had hit a dozen countries, leaving about 230,000 dead, around a third of them in Indonesia. Some 1.7 million people were displaced, mostly in the four worst-affected countries: Indonesia, Sri Lanka, India and Thailand. Along Thailand’s Andaman coast, at least 5,400 people were killed and some 3,000 remain missing to this day, according to the Thai government. The shrimp farm where Neungduangjai’s family worked and lived was wiped out. In its place today is a thriving bar and restaurant — the fruits of Neungduangjai’s rebuilding efforts — with a porch looking out to a beautiful sea view. A view she said wouldn’t be there if not for the tsunami that destroyed parts of the coast. In Phang Nga, life has been rebuilt and the tourists are back — on the surface, all is fine. Neungduangjai, who was home from her studies in Bangkok for the New Year break when the tsunami hit, said her immediate family survived but they lost five relatives, including her grandparents. One of her uncles was never found. After a week of staying with relatives in nearby Ranong province, she went back. She remembers the stench of death and how she thought everything had been moved from its original place. 'There were bodies everywhere,' she said. 'When I returned to the village, I couldn’t recognize a single thing. ... Everything was different.' Though tourists have little reason to notice them, reminders of the tragedy abound today in Phang Nga — signs showing an evacuation route, tsunami shelters near beach areas, several memorials and museums displaying wreckage and photos that tell the story of that day. Sanya Kongma, the assistant to Ban Nam Khem's village chief, said development has come a long way, and that the quality of life in the village is good compared to 20 years ago. But the haunting memories and the trauma of what they lived through are very much present and fear is never far away, he said. 'Even now ... if there’s an announcement from the government on TV, or whatever, that there’s an earthquake in Sumatra, everyone will be spooked,' he said. About once a year, a siren blares off in a tsunami evacuation drill. But what is meant to reassure residents of their safety can cause some survivors to relive their pain. Somneuk Chuaykerd lost one of her young sons to the tsunami while she was out at sea, fishing with her husband. The 50-year-old still lives in the same spot, the sea right at her backyard. In evacuation drills, she has learned to keep an emergency tote bag with all important documents. The bag is in her bedroom, along with a photo of the little boy she lost. But the siren freezes her up every time and sends her heartbeat racing. 'I don’t know what to do. I don’t know what to grab,' she says. 'It's so scary.' But she has made peace with the tragedy and has no plans to move away. 'I live by the sea. This is my living. I don’t have anywhere else to go,' she said. As for Nuengduangjai, for years after the tsunami, every time she looked at the sea she would get a panic attack. A roaring sound of waves haunted her in her sleep. She chose to move back home after college and make a living right next to the sea. She is proud of her bar and restaurant. 'I’m still scared, but I have to live with it, because it’s my home,' she said. 'Some people moved away, but I did not. I’m still here.'	https://apnews.com/article/thailand-tsunami-anniversary-phang-nga-d65d7ad67550a623524fc037a7628452	2024-12-22T17:09:15-08:00	
Trump threatens to try to take back the Panama Canal. Panama's president balks at the suggestion	PHOENIX (AP) — Donald Trump suggested Sunday that his new administration could try to regain control of the Panama Canal that the United States 'foolishly' ceded to its Central American ally, contending that shippers are charged 'ridiculous' fees to pass through the vital transportation channel linking the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Panama's conservative president José Raúl Mulino, who was elected in May on a pro-business platform, roundly rejected that notion as an affront to his country's sovereignty. The Republican president-elect's comment came during his first major rally since winning the White House on Nov. 5. He also basked in his return to power as a large audience of conservatives cheered along. It was a display of party unity at odds with a just-concluded budget fight on Capitol Hill, where some GOP lawmakers openly defied their leader's demands. Addressing supporters at Turning Point USA’s AmericaFest in Arizona, Trump pledged that his 'dream team Cabinet' would deliver a booming economy, seal U.S. borders and quickly settle wars in the Middle East and Ukraine. 'I can proudly proclaim that the Golden Age of America is upon us,' Trump said. 'There’s a spirit that we have now that we didn’t have just a short while ago.' His appearance capped a four-day pep rally that drew more than 20,000 activists and projected an image of Republican cohesion despite the past week's turbulence in Washington with Trump pulling strings from his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida as Congress worked to avoid a government shutdown heading into the holidays. House Republicans spiked a bipartisan deal after Trump and Elon Musk, his billionaire ally, expressed their opposition on social media. Budget hawks flouted Trump's demand that they raise the nation’s debt ceiling, which would have spared some new rounds of the same fight after he takes office on Jan. 20, with Republicans holding narrow control of the House and Senate. The final agreement did not address the issue and there was no shutdown. Trump, in his remarks in Phoenix, did not mention the congressional drama, though he did reference Musk's growing power. To suggestions that 'President Trump has ceded the presidency to Elon,' Trump made clear, 'No, no. That’s not happening.' 'He’s not gonna be president,' Trump said. The president-elect opened the speech by saying that 'we want to try to bring everybody together. We’re going to try. We’re going to really give it a shot.' Then he suggested Democrats have 'lost their confidence' and are 'befuddled' after the election but eventually will 'come over to our side because we want to have them.' Atop a list of grievances — some old, some new — was the Panama Canal. 'We’re being ripped off at the Panama Canal,' he said, bemoaning that his country 'foolishly gave it away.' The United States built the canal in the early 1900s as it looked for ways to facilitate the transit of commercial and military vessels between its coasts. Washington relinquished control of the waterway to Panama on Dec. 31, 1999, under a treaty signed in 1977 by President Jimmy Carter. The canal depends on reservoirs to operate its locks and was heavily affected by 2023 Central American droughts that forced it to substantially reduce the number of daily slots for crossing ships. With fewer ships using the canal each day, administrators also increased the fees that are charged all shippers for reserving a slot. With weather returning to normal in the later months of this year, transit on the canal has normalized. But price increases are still expected for next year. Mulino, Panama's president, has been described as a conservative populist who aligns with Trump on many issues. Panama is a strong U.S. ally and the canal is crucial for its economy, generating about one-fifth of that government’s annual revenue. Still, Trump said, that, once his second term is underway, 'If the principles, both moral and legal, of this magnanimous gesture of giving are not followed, then we will demand that the Panama Canal be returned to the United States of America, in full, quickly and without question.' 'I’m not going to stand for it,' Trump said. 'So to the officials of Panama, please be guided accordingly.' He did not explain how that would be possible. Shortly after Trump's speech, Mulino released a video declaring that 'every square meter of the canal belongs to Panama and will continue to belong' to his country. Without mentioning Trump by name, Mulino addressed Trump's complaints over rising fees for ships crossing the canal, saying they are set by experts who take into account operational costs, and supply and demand factors. 'The tariffs are not set on a whim' Mulino said. He noted that Panama has expanded the canal over the years to increase ship traffic 'on its own initiative,' and added that shipping fee increases help pay for improvements. 'Panamanians may have different views on many issues' Mulino said. 'But when it comes to our canal, and our sovereignty, we will all unite under our Panamanian flag.' The canal aside, Trump’s appearance at Turning Point’s annual gathering affirmed the growing influence the group and its founder, Charlie Kirk, have had in the conservative movement. Kirk’s group hired thousands of field organizers across presidential battlegrounds, helping Trump make key gains among infrequent voters and other groups of people that have trended more Democratic in recent decades, including younger voters, Black men and Latino men. 'You had Turning Point’s grassroots armies,' Trump said. 'It’s not my victory, it’s your victory.' Trump on Sunday also announced several new members of his incoming administration, most notably: -Stephen Miran, who worked at the Treasury Department in Trump's first term, to lead the Council of Economic Advisers, an executive branch agency charged with providing objective economic advice to the president. —Callista Gingrich to be the U.S. ambassador to Switzerland. Gingrich was U.S. ambassador to the Holy See in Trump's first term. She is married to former House Speaker Newt Gingrich. Separately, Australian billionaire Anthony Pratt announced he was donating $1.1 million to Trump’s inaugural fund to complement the $14 million that he said he already had given to the Make America Great Again Inc. super political action committee — making him one of the president-elect’s top donors. Pratt is chairman of Pratt Industries, which uses recycled paper and boxes as a raw material in a process that produces new cardboard. ___ This story has been corrected to reflect that Panama's president Mulino was elected in May, not April. ___ Weissert reported from West Palm Beach, Florida.

Albanian prime minister says TikTok ban was not a 'rushed reaction to a single incident'	TIRANA, Albania (AP) — Albania’s prime minister said Sunday the ban on TikTok his government announced a day earlier was 'not a rushed reaction to a single incident.' Prime Minister Edi Rama said Saturday the government will shut down TikTok for one year, accusing the popular video service of inciting violence and bullying, especially among children. Authorities have held 1,300 meetings with teachers and parents since the November stabbing death of a teenager by another teen after a quarrel that started on social media apps. Ninety percent of them approve of the ban on TikTok. 'The ban on TikTok for one year in Albania is not a rushed reaction to a single incident, but a carefully considered decision made in consultation with parent communities in schools across the country,' said Rama. Following Tirana's decision, TikTok asked for 'urgent clarity from the Albanian government' in the case of the stabbed teenager. The company said it had 'found no evidence that the perpetrator or victim had TikTok accounts, and multiple reports have in fact confirmed videos leading up to this incident were being posted on another platform, not TikTok.' 'To claim that the killing of the teenage boy has no connection to TikTok because the conflict didn’t originate on the platform demonstrates a failure to grasp both the seriousness of the threat TikTok poses to children and youth today and the rationale behind our decision to take responsibility for addressing this threat,' said Rama. 'Albania may be too small to demand that TikTok protect children and youth from the frightening pitfalls of its algorithm,' he said, blaming TikTok for 'the reproduction of the unending hell of the language of hatred, violence, bullying and so on.' Albanian children comprise the largest group of TikTok users in the country, according to domestic researchers. Many youngsters in Albania did not approve of the ban. 'We disclose our daily life and entertain ourselves, that is, we exploit it during our free time,' said Samuel Sulmani, an 18-year-old in the town of Rreshen, 75 kilometers (47 miles) north of the capital Tirana, on Sunday. 'We do not agree with that because that’s a deprivation for us.' But Albanian parents have been increasingly concerned following reports of children taking knives and other objects to school to use in quarrels or cases of bullying promoted by stories they see on TikTok. 'Our decision couldn’t be clearer: Either TikTok protects the children of Albania, or Albania will protect its children from TikTok,' said Rama. ___ Follow Llazar Semini at https://x.com/lsemini	https://apnews.com/article/albania-tiktok-ban-children-violence-bullying-c6dd46c1de5cc2996b4004bcb2a76a66	2024-12-22T10:08:54-08:00	
At least 10 are killed as a small plane crashes into a Brazilian town popular with tourists	A small plane crashed into a Brazilian town that's popular with tourists on Sunday, killing all 10 passengers on board and injuring more than a dozen people on the ground, Brazil's Civil Defense Agency said. The agency in a post on X said the plane hit the chimney of a home and then the second floor of a building before crashing into a mobile phone shop in a largely residential neighborhood of Gramado. More than a dozen people who were on the ground were taken to hospitals with injuries including smoke inhalation, with two said to be in critical condition. It is not immediately clear what caused the crash. Local media reported that the plane was piloted by Luiz Claudio Galeazzi, a Brazilian businessman who was travelling with his family to Sao Paulo State. In a statement published on LinkedIn, Galeazzi's company, Galeazzi &amp; Associados, confirmed that the 61-year-old was on the plane, adding that he was traveling with his wife, their three daughters, several other family members and another company employee, who perished in the crash. 'In this moment of intense pain we are deeply thankful with the manifestations of solidarity and love that we have received from friends, colleagues and the community' the statement reads. 'We also express our solidairity with those who have been affected by this accident in the region.' Security cameras filmed the small Piper plane departing from Canela airport in Rio Grande do Sul State, minutes before it crashed in Gramado, which is about 10km from the airport. Gramado is in the Serra Gaucha mountains and popular with Brazilian tourists who enjoy the cool weather, hiking spots and traditional architecture. The town was settled by large numbers of German and Italian immigrants in the 19th century and is a popular spot for Christmas vacations.	https://apnews.com/article/brazil-plane-crash-gramado-tourists-5751a0dc6b966167f675b3c449d7587b	2024-12-22T08:15:51-08:00	
Russia's Putin holds talks with Slovakian PM Fico, in a rare visit to Moscow by an EU leader	Russian President Vladimir Putin on Sunday hosted Slovakia’s prime minister, Robert Fico, in a rare visit to the Kremlin by an EU leader since Moscow's all-out invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Fico arrived in Russia on a 'working visit' and met with Putin one-on-one on Sunday evening, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told Russia’s RIA news agency. According to Peskov, the talks were expected to focus on 'the international situation' and Russian natural gas deliveries. Russian natural gas still flows to some European countries, including Slovakia, through Ukraine under a five-year agreement signed before the war that is due to expire at the end of this year. At a summit in Brussels on Thursday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told EU leaders that Kyiv has no intention of renewing the deal, something Fico insisted will harm his country's interests. Fico said on Facebook after meeting with Putin that he informed European Union leaders about his trip on Friday. He said the talks in Moscow were a reaction to what Zelenskyy told him on Thursday in Brussels, that he is against any gas transit to Slovakia through Ukraine. Fico also said that Zelenskyy is in favor of sanctions against Russia’s nuclear program, which he said was unacceptable and against the interest of his country that relies on nuclear energy. Fico said Putin confirmed to him that Russia is still ready to deliver gas to the West. He said the two also discussed the military situation in Ukraine, chances for a peaceful solution to the war and the bilateral relations between their two countries which Fico said they will seek to 'standardize.' His trip was condemned by the major Slovak opposition parties. Slovakia last month signed a short-term pilot contract to buy natural gas from Azerbaijan, as it prepares for a possible halt to Russian supplies through Ukraine. Earlier this year, it struck a deal to import U.S. liquefied natural gas through a pipeline from Poland. The country can also receive gas through Austrian, Hungarian and Czech networks, enabling imports from Germany among other potential suppliers. Visits and phone calls from European leaders to Putin have been rare since Moscow sent troops into Ukraine, although Hungary’s Prime Minister Viktor Orbán visited Russia in July, and Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer met with the Russian leader just weeks into the full-scale war. Both trips drew condemnation from Kyiv and European leaders. Orbán, widely seen as having the warmest relations with Putin among EU leaders, has routinely blocked, delayed or watered down EU efforts to assist Kyiv and impose sanctions on Moscow for its actions in Ukraine. He has long argued for a cessation of hostilities in Ukraine but without outlining what that might mean for the country’s territorial integrity or future security. Fico’s views on Russia’s war on Ukraine differ sharply from most other European leaders. The Slovakian PM returned to power last year after his leftist party Smer (Direction) won parliamentary elections on a pro-Russia and anti-American platform. Since then, he has ended his country’s military aid for Ukraine, lashed out at EU sanctions on Russia, and vowed to block Ukraine from joining NATO. Fico has also been a rare senior EU politician to appear on Russian state TV following Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine. In an interview with the Rossiya-1 channel in October, he contended the West has 'prolonged the war' by supporting Ukraine, adding that sanctions against Russia were ineffective. He declared that he was ready to negotiate with Putin. Fico also vowed to attend a military parade in Moscow next May that will mark the 80th anniversary of Nazi Germany’s defeat in World War II. The Kremlin has used the annual 'Victory Day' celebrations to tout its battlefield prowess, and Putin hailed Russian troops fighting in Ukraine as 'heroes' at this year’s event.	https://apnews.com/article/russia-putin-slovakia-fico-talks-45e08385f245bff9df02d6b533561598	2024-12-22T07:56:49-08:00	
Secret passage that Florence's Medici used to move safely reopens to public after 8-year renovation	FLORENCE, Italy (AP) — For centuries, Florence’s 16th-century Vasari Corridor was only accessible to dukes and lords. Now, the raised passageway that connects the city's Uffizi Galleries to the former residence of the powerful Medici family, has reopened to the public after an eight-year restoration project. The corridor, named after the Renaissance architect and biographer Giorgio Vasari, who designed it, is some 750 meters (820 yards) long. It stretches from the Uffizi Museums to the imposing Palazzo Pitti, passing over Ponte Vecchio above the tiny historic jewelry boutiques that cross the Arno river. The corridor was built by Florence’s powerful Medici family to allow them to move secretly and safely from one part of the historic Italian city to another. 'It’s a reopening that allows us to connect the two fundamental poles of the (art) collections from one side of the Arno river to the other, the Uffizi Palace with the Pitti Palace and Boboli Gardens, and to make it accessible to all visitors,' said Simone Verde, director of the Uffizi Gallery, famous for its collections of ancient sculptures and paintings. The corridor was closed in 2016 to allow restoration work to bring it up to safety standards. Starting Dec. 21, visitors are able to enter the Uffizi Museum’s Gallery of Statues and Paintings and walk through the bowels of Ponte Vecchio before exiting through the Tuscan city’s lush Boboli gardens. Through the corridor, they will be allowed to go around the Torre dé Mannelli and peer from above into the Church of Santa Felicita, enjoying unprecedented views of the city. The renovation, which cost about 10 million euros, ensures complete accessibility for disabled people through ramps, footbridges and lifts, a new energy-efficient LED lighting system, and is fully video-monitored. The aim is to make the corridor a valid alternative route for tourists. 'The corridor allows us to turn overtourism from a problem into an opportunity, a way for visitors to see the connection between these two poles of the Medici and then Lorena collections,' Verde said. Every year, millions of tourists flock to the Tuscan city to admire its stunning Renaissance art and architecture, an ever-increasing flow of people that is becoming unsustainable, as it is in other popular Italian cities.	https://apnews.com/article/italy-florence-overtourism-vasari-corridor-renovation-medici-d0547c747732384cca7fdc9d7f7d78a3	2024-12-22T07:56:27-08:00	
Colombia's ELN rebels announce Christmas truce	BOGOTÁ, Colombia (AP) — Colombia’s largest remaining rebel group announced a unilateral truce on Sunday, to last until Jan. 3, the first since the previous ceasefire broke down in August. In a statement posted on X, the National Liberation Army said that it will halt attacks on the military as the nation celebrates Christmas and New Year’s. Colombian President Gustavo Petro shared the truce announcement on his X account, with a message saying that 'the end of war, is the nation’s goal for 2025.' The group, known in Spanish as the ELN, was founded in the 1960s by university students, priests and union leaders inspired by the Cuban revolution. It currently has 6,000 fighters in Colombia and Venezuela according to Ministry of Defense estimates, and finances itself through illegal mining, extortion rackets and the drug trade. The ELN has increased its influence in some rural areas of Colombia by stepping into a power vacuum left by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia after that group signed a peace deal with the Colombian government in 2016. Two years ago, the ELN began to stage peace talks of its own with the Petro administration, which resulted in a ceasefire that began in August of last year. But peace talks stalled due to disagreements over when the ELN would stop kidnapping and taxing civilians. ELN commanders were also angered by the government’s move to set up separate negotiations with an ELN offshoot in the southwest of the country. The ceasefire broke down four months ago, and since then the ELN has stepped up its attacks on military targets and oil infrastructure along Colombia’s border with Venezuela. The Petro administration has attempted to stage peace talks with several armed groups in rural pockets of the country, under a strategy known as total peace. ELN commanders have criticized the Petro administration for trying to cut deals with some of these groups, instead of persecuting them.	https://apnews.com/article/colombia-eln-peace-talks-christmas-cease-fire-927f09dc5980d505ebb03b9ee4453cd8	2024-12-22T07:39:22-08:00	
Why did at least 67 people die in Christmas charity stampedes in struggling Nigeria?	ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) — Stampedes during three Christmas charity events across Nigeria have left at least 67 people dead in the past week, many of them children. Families are struggling during the country's worst cost-of-living crisis in a generation. At least 35 children were killed in southwestern Oyo state on Wednesday. And on Saturday, 22 people died in southeastern Anambra state while 10 died in the capital, Abuja, where more than 1,000 people had gathered at a church to receive clothes and food. Here's why people in Africa's most populous country are risking their lives for holiday donations. Inflation at a 28-year high 'There is hunger in this Nigeria. Every Nigerian needs food,' one woman, in tears, told the local Arise television after the stampede in Abuja. The economic crisis is blamed on the government’s policies to save money and attract investors, which have contributed to pushing the inflation rate to a 28-year high of 34.6%. Meanwhile the naira currency languishes at record lows against the dollar. At least 63% of Nigeria's more than 210 million people population is poor, according to the government's statistics office. The government has struggled to create jobs. And when people gather to protest hardship, security forces are quick to clamp down. In August, more than 20 people were shot dead by security forces during nationwide protests. 'The average Nigerian has seen food go out of their reach,' said Cheta Nwanze, managing partner at the Lagos-based SBM Intelligence research firm. In 2022, the firm found that about 97% of Nigerians spend up to 63% of their income on food, but that share must have grown since then, he said. Some of those who died in Abuja had waited overnight outside the church in cold weather for the chance to enter early, according to Loveth Inyang, a witness who rescued a baby from the crush. Security is costly, too Deadly stampedes are not new in Nigeria and are often caused by lack of adherence to public safety measures. But analysts say people's desperation to survive is making crowd control more difficult. Accounts from witnesses and police in Abuja and Anambra showed that the stampedes occurred before the events started as people tried to secure prime positions. In Abuja, the church was forced to cancel the event, leaving bags of rice and clothing items inside. Organizers of such charity events often do not consider security a priority, said Ademola Adetuberu, who runs the Abuja-based Barricade Executive Protection security firm. Meanwhile, the number of events is increasing as philanthropists and organizations try to meet the growing demand for food. 'If organizers of such events brainstorm more, get professionals to advise them and have a budget for security, this can be prevented,' Adetuberu said. How authorities are responding Nigeria’s President Bola Tinubu has asked authorities to no longer tolerate 'operational lapses' by organizers of such events, while police have made it mandatory for organizers to get prior permission before hosting them. But such commitments are not new and usually difficult to enforce, analysts said. 'People’s incomes have been squeezed through the entire year. When they hear somewhere that food is being distributed, their natural instinct is to go,' Nwanze said. 'Add this to our notoriously poor queue culture and you have the perfect storm that will lead to such a stampede.'	https://apnews.com/article/nigeria-christmas-stampede-poverty-explainer-economy-ca6fc452dfb187fd5a325f7d20205226	2024-12-22T07:17:38-08:00	
El Gordo' lottery in Spain spreads Christmas riches worth $2.8 billion	MADRID (AP) — For weeks, Spaniards had anticipated the arrival of 'El Gordo' or 'The Fat One.' But unlike Santa Claus, El Gordo arrived three days before Christmas, before noon on Sunday. El Gordo is the first prize of Spain’s hugely popular national Christmas lottery, which is said to be the world’s largest based on the total prize money involved, even though other lotteries have larger single prizes. This year's draw will spread riches totaling 2.7 billion euros (around $2.8 billion), much of it in small winnings. Several ticket holders with the number 72480 won the top prize, worth 400,000 euros (roughly $417,000) before taxes. The winning tickets were sold in Logroño, a city in northern Spain's La Rioja region that is known for its wines. Multiple tickets with the same number can be sold to different groups and full tickets are divisible into 10 parts. Buying and sharing these fractions, known in Spanish as 'décimos' or tenths, is a popular tradition in the run-up to Christmas. Families, friends, and co-workers often take part, usually spending 20 euros (about $21) each. On Sunday, young students from Madrid's San Ildefonso school selected the numbers from two revolving orbs in the capital's Teatro Real opera house and sang them out in turn for nearly five hours in a cadence familiar to Spaniards. After 'El Gordo' was announced, audience members — some dressed in costume as Don Quijote, Christmas elves, Biblical wise men and the lottery itself — began streaming out of the venue, from which the event was televised nationally. María Ángeles, a teacher from the southwestern province of Badajoz, said she waited for hours in line to get a seat inside the opera house to watch the event with a group of 14 friends and family members that she traveled with to Madrid. 'The point of coming to see the lottery is the hope,' Ángeles said. She reckoned no one in her group won more than 140 euros ($146). The lottery works on the premise of distributing the most winning numbers to the largest number of people possible. There are hundreds of small prizes and 13 major ones, including the 'El Gordo' winner. In the weeks leading up to the draw, lines form outside lottery offices, especially those with a history of selling prize-winning tickets in previous years. Spain’s Dec. 22 Christmas lottery began during the Napoleonic wars in 1812 and has continued largely without interruption since then, even during the Spanish Civil War. Students from the San Ildefonso school have been singing the prizes since the start. Spain’s national lottery was first established as a charity in 1763 by the Bourbon monarch King Carlos III. It was later used to shore up state coffers. Today, it supports various charities.	https://apnews.com/article/christmas-spain-lottery-holidays-el-gordo-winner-prize-euro-valencia-europe-ead7ed835e75bb241ad23454a451d8a9	2024-12-22T04:41:32-08:00	
Destructive Cyclone Chido unearths a rift between locals and migrants in France's Mayotte	MAMOUDZOU, Mayotte (AP) — When Cyclone Chido ravaged Mayotte’s fragile infrastructure, it also exposed deep-seated tensions between the island’s residents and its large migrant population. Thousands of people who have entered the island illegally bore the brunt of the storm that tore through the Indian Ocean archipelago — France's poorest territory. Authorities in Mayotte said many migrants avoided emergency shelters out of fear of deportation, leaving themselves and the precarious shantytowns they inhabit even more vulnerable to the devastation. Meanwhile, anger simmered among residents who accused the government of diverting the island’s already scarce resources to migrants at their expense. 'We are the legitimate population of this island,' said Amada Salime. Standing in the rubble of his home on Saturday, he added, 'If there is help from the government — water or something to eat or money to make houses — Mahorais people will not have it. Immigrants are more numerous than us, and we will be left behind.' Mayotte, a French department located between Madagascar and mainland Africa, has a population of 320,000. French authorities have estimated another 100,000 migrants also live there, most of whom have arrived from the nearby Comoros Islands, just 70 kilometers (43 miles) away. The island’s fragile public services, designed for a much smaller population, are buckling under the strain. According to the French statistics agency INSEE, around three-quarters of Mayotte’s population live in poverty, with a median annual disposable income just one-eighth that of the Paris metropolitan area. 'The problems of Mayotte cannot be solved without addressing illegal immigration,' French President Emmanuel Macron said during his testy visit this week, acknowledging the challenges posed by the island’s rapid population growth. 'Despite the state’s investments, migratory pressure has made everything explode,' he added. People living in Mayotte for decades worry about a crackdown The cyclone further exacerbated the island’s issues after destroying homes, schools and infrastructure. Though the official death toll remains 35, authorities say that any estimates are likely major undercounts, with hundreds feared dead. The migrants’ shantytowns, known as 'bangas,' have long been an issue in Mayotte. 'Can we solve the issue of shantytowns today? The answer is no. We will address it during the stabilization and rebuilding phase,' Macron said. For many migrants, like Nazca Antoiy, a Comorian who has lived in Mayotte for a decade, the cyclone has heightened fears of displacement. 'I heard that people were told not to reconstruct new houses. So we need to worry about that,' she said, reflecting a widespread concern that authorities may use the disaster to expedite demolitions of informal settlements. Such concerns are not unfounded. Last year, France launched Operation Wuambushu, a controversial campaign to demolish shantytowns and deport migrants who entered illegally. Macron hinted that similar policies could resume but stressed reconstruction efforts would take precedence. The storm has left many residents struggling to meet basic needs. A hotspot for migrants 'I can’t take it anymore. Just to have water is complicated,' said Fatima, a 46-year-old mother of five whose family has been without clean water since the storm ravaged Mayotte last weekend. Fatima, who only gave her first name because her family is known locally, also said she felt the island could not support the current population, let alone more. Most migrants have family links in Mayotte and speak the same language. They seek a better life on the island rather than aiming to reach the European continent. Mayotte’s geopolitical position has long made it a hotspot for migration. While the island voted to remain French in referendums held in 1974 and 1976, neighboring Comoros has never recognized its sovereignty and continues to claim the archipelago as its own. This unresolved dispute has fueled waves of migration, with thousands risking perilous sea crossings each year. Outgoing French Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau recently reignited the debate, describing the situation in Mayotte as a 'war,' earlier this week. Retailleau proposed stricter measures, including using drones and naval patrols to block further arrivals. 'We must be much tougher on the Comoros,' he said, accusing the neighboring government of allowing migrants to leave its shores unchecked. Retailleau’s calls to 'change the rules' include proposals to restrict birthright citizenship in Mayotte, a policy already tightened in 2018 to require proof that at least one parent had been a legal resident for more than three months. Critics argue that these measures only deepen Mayotte’s divisions without addressing the root causes of migration. A 2023 parliamentary report cited in French media warned that the island was a 'ticking time bomb,' while suggesting redistributing part of Mayotte’s migrant population to mainland France — a proposal unlikely to gain widespread support. ___ Adamson reported from Paris.	https://apnews.com/article/mayotte-migration-cyclone-france-macron-tensions-c30253c3672e8719a1ba9135485b2495	2024-12-22T03:48:46-08:00	
Ukrainian drones hit a Russian fuel depot for the second time this month	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukrainian drones struck a major Russian fuel depot for the second time in just over a week on Sunday, according to a senior Russian regional official, as part of a 'massive' cross-border attack on fuel and energy facilities that Kyiv says supply Moscow's military. The strikes came days after Russia launched sweeping attacks on Ukraine’s already battered energy grid, threatening to plunge thousands of homes into darkness as winter tightens its grip over the region, and as Russia’s all-out invasion of its neighbor nears the three-year mark. A fire broke out at the Stalnoy Kon oil terminal in Russia’s southern Oryol region, local Gov. Andrey Klychkov said in a post on the Telegram messaging app, adding Russian forces downed 20 drones targeting 'fuel and energy infrastructure' in the province. Russian independent news outlet Astra shared video of what it said was an explosion at the site, showing a massive orange blaze lighting up the night sky. While the clip could not be independently verified, it was later shared by a Ukrainian security official who described it as footage from Oryol. The official, Andriy Kovalenko of the Council of National Security and Defense, claimed the Oryol fuel depot supplies Russian forces fighting in Ukraine and southern Russia, including the Kursk province where Ukrainian troops have dug in following a lightning incursion in August. According to Klychkov, the Russian local governor, the fire was extinguished hours later and did not cause casualties or 'significant' damage. Ukraine's military previously claimed to have struck the Stalnoy Kon terminal with drones on Dec. 14, causing a 'powerful' blaze. Other key war-related developments from Ukraine and Russia: — Russian President Vladimir Putin on Sunday vowed retaliation after Ukrainian drones the day before struck residential buildings in the city of Kazan, in the Tatarstan region over 600 miles (1,000 kilometers) from the front line. Speaking to Tatarstan's regional governor, Rustam Minnikhanov, Putin asserted that anyone attacking Russia has to reckon with Moscow inflicting 'many times greater damage' in return, but did not elaborate. His remarks were carried by Russian state news agencies. Minnikhanov's press service on Saturday said that eight drones attacked Kazan. Local authorities said there were no casualties. — A 30-year-old man died on the spot Sunday in Ukraine's southern Kherson region after a Russian drone dropped explosives nearby, local Gov. Oleksandr Prokudin reported. Hours earlier, Prokudin said that two other civilians died as a result of Russian drone strikes on the province late on Saturday. A man in his late 40s suffered fatal injuries from a drone blast, and a woman was found dead under rubble after another drone slammed into her house. — In the Kharkiv region in the northeast, a Russian drone strike Sunday severely injured a 56-year-old man as he walked down a road in the city of Kupiansk, local Gov. Oleh Syniehubov reported. He said the man would need to have at least one limb amputated as a result, but gave no further detail. — In the Kyiv suburb of Brovary, debris from a Russian drone sparked a fire late on Saturday on the roof of a 25-story tower block, according to regional Gov. Ruslan Kravchenko. There were no immediate reports of any casualties. — According to Ukraine’s Air Force, Russia launched 103 Iranian-made Shahed drones at its neighbor overnight into Sunday. Ukrainian air defense shot down 52 of the drones while another 44 failed to reach their targets, the force said in a statement, in a likely reference to electronic jamming. — Meanwhile, Russia’s Defense Ministry said Sunday that its forces had intercepted 42 Ukrainian drones launched overnight at Russian territory. According to the ministry, 20 of those were over the Oryol region, where the local governor said a blaze tore through the oil terminal. — Separately, Russian forces have continued grinding forward in Ukraine’s northeast, in addition to eking out gains near the eastern town of Kurakhove. On Sunday, Russia’s Defense Ministry reported that its troops had captured two northeastern settlements: Lozova in the Kharkiv region and Krasne in the Luhansk province. There was no immediate confirmation from Kyiv.	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-drones-depot-7153abcbd0d8e2c6e33dba89f7d2e0ef	2024-12-22T03:45:04-08:00	
Bluesky finds with growth comes growing pains — and bots	Bluesky has seen its user base soar since the U.S. presidential election, boosted by people seeking refuge from Elon Musk's X, which they view as increasingly leaning too far to the right given its owner's support of President-elect Donald Trump, or wanting an alternative to Meta's Threads and its algorithms. The platform grew out of the company then known as Twitter, championed by its former CEO Jack Dorsey. Its decentralized approach to social networking was eventually intended to replace Twitter's core mechanic. That's unlikely now that the two companies have parted ways. But Bluesky's growth trajectory — with a user base that has more than doubled since October — could make it a serious competitor to other social platforms. But with growth comes growing pains. It's not just human users who've been flocking to Bluesky but also bots, including those designed to create partisan division or direct users to junk websites. The skyrocketing user base — now surpassing 25 million — is the biggest test yet for a relatively young platform that has branded itself as a social media alternative free of the problems plaguing its competitors. According to research firm Similarweb, Bluesky added 7.6 million monthly active app users on iOS and Android in November, an increase of 295.4% since October. It also saw 56.2 million desktop and mobile web visits, in the same period, up 189% from October. Besides the U.S. elections, Bluesky also got a boost when X was briefly banned in Brazil. 'They got this spike in attention, they’ve crossed the threshold where it is now worth it for people to flood the platform with spam,' said Laura Edelson, an assistant professor of computer science at Northeastern University and a member of Issue One’s Council for Responsible Social Media. 'But they don’t have the cash flow, they don’t have the established team that a larger platform would, so they have to do it all very, very quickly.' To manage growth for its tiny staff, Bluesky started as an invitation-only space until it opened to the public in February. That period gave the site time to build out moderation tools and other distinctive features to attract new users, such as 'starter packs' that provide lists of topically curated feeds. Meta recently announced that it is testing a similar feature. Compared to the bigger players like Meta's platforms or X, Bluesky has a 'quite different' value system, said Claire Wardle, a professor at Cornell University and an expert in misinformation. This includes giving users more control over their experience. 'The first generation of social media platforms connected the world, but ended up consolidating power in the hands of a few corporations and their leaders,' Bluesky said on its blog in March. 'Our online experience doesn’t have to depend on billionaires unilaterally making decisions over what we see. On an open social network like Bluesky, you can shape your experience for yourself.' Because of this mindset, Bluesky has achieved a scrappy underdog status that has attracted users who've grown tired of the big players. 'People had this idea that it was going to be a different type of social network,' Wardle said. 'But the truth is, when you get lots of people in a place and there are eyeballs, it means that it’s in other people’s interests to use bots to create, you know, information that aligns with their perspective.' Little data has emerged to help quantify the rise in impersonator accounts, artificial intelligence-fueled networks and other potentially harmful content on Bluesky. But in recent weeks, users have begun reporting large numbers of apparent AI bots following them, posting plagiarized articles or making seemingly automated divisive comments in replies. Lion Cassens, a Bluesky user and doctoral candidate in the Netherlands, found one such network by accident — a group of German-language accounts with similar bios and AI-generated profile pictures posting in replies to three German newspapers. 'I noticed some weird replies under a news post by the German newspaper ‘Die Ziet,’' he said in an email to The Associated Press. 'I have a lot of trust in the moderation mechanism on Bluesky, especially compared to Twitter since the layoffs and due to Musk’s more radical stance on freedom of speech. But AI bots are a big challenge, as they will only improve. I hope social media can keep up with that.' Cassens said the bots' messages have been relatively innocuous so far, but he was concerned about how they could be repurposed in the future to mislead. There are also signs that foreign disinformation narratives have made their way to Bluesky. The disinformation research group Alethea pointed to one low-traction post sharing a false claim about ABC News that had circulated on Russian Telegram channels. Copycat accounts are another challenge. In late November, Alexios Mantzarlis, director of the Security, Trust and Safety Initiative at Cornell Tech, found that of the top 100 most followed named individuals on Bluesky, 44% had at least one duplicate account posing as them. Two weeks later, Mantzarlis said Bluesky had removed around two-thirds of the duplicate accounts he’d initially detected — a sign the site was aware of the issue and attempting to address it. Bluesky posted earlier this month that it had quadrupled its moderation team to keep up with its growing user base. The company also announced it had introduced a new system to detect impersonation and was working to improve its Community Guidelines to provide more detail on what’s allowed. Because of the way the site is built, users also have the option to subscribe to third-party 'Labelers' that outsource content moderation by tagging accounts with warnings and context. The company didn't respond to multiple requests for comment for this story. Even as its challenges aren’t yet at the scale other platforms face, Bluesky is at a 'crossroads,' said Edward Perez, a board member at the nonpartisan nonprofit OSET Institute, who previously led Twitter’s civic integrity team. 'Whether BlueSky likes it or not, it is being pulled into the real world,' Perez said, noting that it needs to quickly prioritize threats and work to mitigate them if it hopes to continue to grow. That said, disinformation and bots won't be Bluesky's only challenges in the months and years to come. As a text-based social network, its entire premise is falling out of favor with younger generations. A recent Pew Research Center poll found that only 17% of American teenagers used X, for instance, down from 23% in 2022. For teens and young adults, TikTok, Instagram and other visual-focused platforms are the places to be. Political polarization is also going against Bluesky ever reaching the size of TikTok, Instagram or even X. 'Bluesky is not trying to be all things to all people,' Wardle said, adding that, likely, the days of a Facebook or Instagram emerging where they're 'trying to keep everybody happy' are over. Social platforms are increasingly splintered along political lines and when they aren't — see Meta's platforms — the companies behind them are actively working to de-emphasize political content and news. ___ The Associated Press receives support from several private foundations to enhance its explanatory coverage of elections and democracy.

Prominent Lebanese figure meets Syrian insurgent who led Assad's ouster, seeking better relations	BEIRUT (AP) — A prominent Lebanese politician held talks on Sunday with the insurgent who led the overthrow of Syria's President Bashar Assad, with both expressing hope for a new era in relations between their countries. Druze leader Walid Jumblatt is the most prominent Lebanese politician to visit Syria since the Assad family’s 54-year rule ended two weeks ago. Jumblatt was a longtime critic of Syria's involvement in Lebanon and blamed Assad's father, former leader Hafez Assad, for the assassination of his own father. He held talks with Ahmad al-Sharaa, who led the Sunni Islamist rebels who swept into Damascus earlier this month and forced the younger Assad from power. Now wearing a suit and tie, al-Sharaa has been meeting with diplomats and others from around the region and beyond as Assad's fall reshapes alliances and gives many long-stifled Syrians hope after more than 13 years of civil war and international sanctions. 'We salute the Syrian people for their great victories and we salute you for your battle that you waged to get rid of oppression and tyranny that lasted over 50 years,' said Jumblatt, a key figure in Lebanon’s Druze minority. He expressed hope that Lebanese-Syrian relations 'will return to normal.' Jumblatt's father, Kamal, was killed in 1977 in an ambush near a Syrian roadblock during Syria's military intervention in Lebanon's civil war. 'Syria was a source of concern and disturbance, and its interference in Lebanese affairs was negative,' al-Sharaa said, referring to the Assad government. 'Syria will no longer be a case of negative interference in Lebanon,' he added. Al-Sharaa also repeated longstanding allegations that Assad's government was behind the 2005 assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, which was followed by other killings of prominent Lebanese critics of Assad. Last year, the United Nations closed an international tribunal investigating that assassination after it convicted three members of Lebanon's Hezbollah — an ally of Assad — in absentia. Hezbollah denied involvement in the bombing that killed Hariri and 21 others. 'We hope that all those who committed crimes against the Lebanese will be held accountable, and that fair trials will be held for those who committed crimes against the Syrian people,' Jumblatt said. Iran's leader predicts trouble for new Syrian rulers Separately, Iran's supreme leader asserted that young Syrians will resist the new government emerging after Assad's ouster, as he again accused the United States and Israel of sowing chaos in the country. Iran provided crucial support to Assad throughout Syria's civil war, which erupted after he launched a violent crackdown on a popular uprising. Syria had long served as a key conduit for Iranian aid to Hezbollah. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said in an address on Sunday that the 'young Syrian has nothing to lose' and suffers from insecurity following Assad's fall. 'What can he do? He should stand with strong will against those who designed and those who implemented the insecurity,' Khamenei said. He also accused the United States and Israel of plotting against Assad's government in order to seize resources. Iran and its militant allies in the region have suffered major setbacks over the past year, with Israel battering Hamas in Gaza and landing heavy blows on Hezbollah before they agreed to a ceasefire in Lebanon last month. Khamenei denied that such groups were proxies of Iran, saying they fought because of their beliefs. 'If one day we plan to take action, we do not need proxy force,' he said. Preserving evidence of crimes The head of a U.N.-backed team investigating crimes committed during the civil war said they are working with the country’s new authorities in hopes of preserving evidence uncovered after Assad’s ouster. 'We welcome the fact that we were invited to come and to engage with the authorities,' Robert Petit said Sunday, describing the meeting as 'constructive.' As journalists, researchers and the public stream into former detention centers and mass grave sites, many express fears that evidence is taken or destroyed. Wafa Mustafa, a Syrian activist whose father, Ali, disappeared in 2013 in Damascus, said that 'no one gets to tell the families what happened without evidence, without search, without work, without effort.' Returning Syrians search for shattered homes Syria's civil war created millions of refugees, and thousands have begun returning. In a gray field of rubble outside Damascus, returnee Alaa Badawi worked with a shovel, looking for traces of his home. His community, Qaboun, was an anti-government center and many of its buildings were flattened under Assad's administration. 'Which is our house? Which is our alley? There is nothing visible,' Badawi said. He and others decided to dig a little here and there to look for the house's distinctive tiles. 'We finally discovered that this is our house,' he said. 'I do not know by then if I was happy to have located the house amid the rubble or upset because the house did not exist.' Ziad Al-Hilli, one of the many people freed from prison as Assad fled to Russia, could not find his house, or his family. ___ Associated Press writer Nasser Karimi in Tehran, Iran, contributed to this report. ___ Follow AP’s Syria coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/syria	https://apnews.com/article/syria-iran-khamenei-assad-29c9df300bbacc00247832bcd19929c6	2024-12-22T02:04:03-08:00	
4 dead in Turkish ambulance helicopter crash	MUGLA, Turkey (AP) — An ambulance helicopter crashed on Sunday morning in southwestern Turkey, killing all four people on board. Two pilots, one doctor and one health care worker were taking off from the city of Mugla on their way to pick up a patient in the neighboring province of Antalya. The helicopter hit the hospital building from where it was taking off and crashed into a nearby field. Mugla Gov. Idris Akbiyik noted that there was heavy fog at the time of takeoff and that authorities were investigating the incident.	https://apnews.com/article/turkey-helicopter-ambulance-crash-mugla-7ed8d2248eec850cf905d5f11397017d	2024-12-22T00:59:40-08:00	
Stampedes in Nigeria leave at least 32 dead during Christmas food distribution	ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) — The death toll from stampedes during two Christmas charity events in Nigeria has increased from 13 to 32, police said Sunday. The victims, including at least four children, collapsed during crowd surges as people grew desperate for food items while the country grapples with the worst cost-of-living crisis in a generation. The dead included 22 people in southeastern Anambra state’s Okija town, where a philanthropist on Saturday organized a food distribution, local police spokesman Tochukwu Ikenga said. Ten others died in the capital, Abuja, during a church-organized similar charity event. Police said they were investigating the two incidents, only days after another stampede in which 35 children were killed. Africa’s most populous country is seeing a growing trend by local organizations, churches and individuals to organize charity events ahead of Christmas to ease economic hardship caused by a cost-of-living crisis. Witnesses of the Abuja stampede told The Associated Press there was a crowd surge at one of the church gates, as dozens tried to enter the premises at around 4 a.m., hours before gift items were to be shared. Some of them, including older people, waited overnight to get food, said Loveth Inyang, who rescued one baby from the crush. The stampedes prompted growing calls for authorities to enforce safety measures at such events. Nigerian police also mandated that organizers obtain prior permission.	https://apnews.com/article/nigeria-christmas-stampedes-eaf1e6d852a7014f24166c948d7e906a	2024-12-22T00:49:14-08:00	
German authorities received tipoffs last year about the suspect in Christmas market attack	MAGDEBURG, Germany (AP) — German authorities said they received tipoffs last year about the suspect in a car attack at a Christmas market in Magdeburg as more details emerged on Sunday about the five people killed. Authorities have identified the suspect as a Saudi doctor who arrived in Germany in 2006 and had received permanent residency. Police haven’t publicly named the suspect, in line with privacy rules, but some German news outlets have identified him as Taleb A. and reported that he was a specialist in psychiatry and psychotherapy. Authorities say he does not fit the usual profile of perpetrators of extremist attacks. The man described himself as an ex-Muslim who was highly critical of Islam and in many posts on social media expressed support for the far-right anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. He is being held in custody as authorities investigate him. 'This perpetrator acted in an unbelievably cruel and brutal manner — like an Islamist terrorist, although he was obviously ideologically an Islamophobe,' Interior Minister Nancy Faeser said Sunday. The suspect originally lived in the state of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, where he completed his specialist training in Stralsund and also came to the attention of authorities due to threatening criminal acts, the state interior minister, Christian Pegel, said Sunday. In a dispute over the recognition of examination results, he threatened members of the state medical association with an act that would attract international attention, triggering an investigation and a search of his home, the dpa news agency reported, citing Pegel. No evidence was found of real preparations for an attack but a court found him guilty in 2013 of threatening an attack. That was followed by other threats he made, Pegel said. The head of the Federal Criminal Police Office, Holger Münch, said in an interview on the German broadcaster ZDF on Saturday that his office received a tipoff from Saudi Arabia in November 2023, which led authorities to launch 'appropriate investigative measures.' 'The man also published a huge number of posts on the internet. He also had contact with various authorities, made insults and even threats. However, he was not known to have committed acts of violence,' said Münch, whose office is the German equivalent of the FBI. He said that the warnings, however, proved to be very unspecific. The Federal Office for Migration and Refugees also said it received a tipoff about the suspect in the late summer of last year. 'This was taken seriously, like every other of the numerous tips,' the office said on X on Saturday. But it also noted that it is not an investigative authority and that it referred the information to the responsible authorities. It gave no other details. The Central Council of Ex-Muslims said in a statement that the suspect had 'terrorized' them for years as it expressed shock at the attack. 'He apparently shared beliefs from the far-right spectrum of the AfD and believed in a large-scale conspiracy aimed at Islamizing Germany. His delusional ideas went so far that he assumed that even organizations critical of Islamism were part of the Islamist conspiracy,' said the statement. The group's chairwoman, Mina Ahadi, said in the same statement: 'At first we suspected that he might be a mole in the Islamist movement. But now I think he is a psychopath who adheres to ultra-right conspiracy ideologies.' Police in Magdeburg, the capital of the state of Saxony-Anhalt, said Sunday that those who died were four women aged 45, 52, 67 and 75, as well as a 9-year-old boy. Authorities said 200 people were injured, including 41 in serious condition. They were being treated in multiple hospitals in Magdeburg, which is about 130 kilometers (80 miles) west of Berlin, and beyond. The suspect was on Saturday evening brought before a judge, who behind closed doors ordered him to be kept in custody on allegations of murder and attempted murder. He is facing a possible indictment. The horror triggered by yet another act of mass violence in Germany makes it likely that migration will remain a key issue as the country heads toward an early election on Feb. 23. A deadly knife attack by a suspected Islamic extremist from Syria in Solingen in August pushed the issue to the top of the agenda, and led the government of Chancellor Olaf Scholz to tighten border security measures. Right-wing figures from across Europe have criticized German authorities for having allowed high levels of migration in the past and for what they see as security failures now. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, who is known for a strong anti-migration position going back years, used the attack in Germany to lash out at the European Union’s migration policies and described it as a 'terrorist act.' At an annual press conference in Budapest on Saturday, Orbán insisted that 'there is no doubt that there is a link between the changed world in Western Europe, the migration that flows there, especially illegal migration and terrorist acts.' ___ Gera reported from Warsaw, Poland.

Israeli strikes in Gaza kill at least 22 as Vatican envoy visits Christians for pre-Christmas Mass	DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Israeli strikes across the Gaza Strip overnight and into Sunday killed at least 22 people, including five children, Palestinian medical officials said, while Gaza's small Christian community celebrated a pre-Christmas Mass. Israeli authorities allowed a rare Gaza visit by the leader of the Catholic Church in the Holy Land, Cardinal Pierbattista Pizzaballa, for the Mass while the ever-present buzz of Israeli drones was heard outside. One of the latest Israeli strikes hit a school housing displaced people in Gaza City and killed at least eight, including three children, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. Israel's military said it struck Hamas militants sheltering there. A strike on a home in the central city of Deir al-Balah late Saturday killed at least eight, including three women and two children, according to Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital, which received the bodies. Another six people were killed in separate strikes on Sunday, according to local hospitals. 'The children are still inside the house. We are looking for them. They were sleeping in the living room, five of them together,' said a relative of a victim, Noman Abu Samra, as people searched rubble in Deir al-Balah. A window full of children looked on. Israel has carried out daily strikes in Gaza more than 14 months into the war with Hamas. It says it only targets militants, accusing them of hiding among civilians, but the bombings frequently kill women and children. Israel and Hamas recently appeared to draw closer to a ceasefire agreement that would include the release of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners, but several obstacles remain, and the indirect talks have repeatedly stalled. Vatican envoy celebrates Mass with Gaza's Christians Dozens of worshipers gathered in the Holy Family Church in Gaza City as Pizzaballa and other clergy celebrated Mass. A twinkling Christmas tree was decorated with golden ornaments. 'I want to say, to tell you, that all the world, not only the Christian world, all the world is with you, So the war will finish and we will rebuild,' the cardinal said, urging Gazans to never be afraid. His visit came as Pope Francis again criticized Israel's actions in Gaza. Francis said Saturday that his envoy had been unable to enter the territory because of Israeli bombing. 'Yesterday children have been bombed. This is cruelty, this is not war,' Francis said during his annual Christmas greetings at the Vatican. On Sunday, he called for a ceasefire. The pope recently called for an investigation to determine if Israel's actions in Gaza constitute genocide, a conclusion later reached by Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch. The International Court of Justice is investigating genocide allegations brought against Israel by South Africa. Israel, which was founded as a refuge for Jews after the Nazi Holocaust, rejects such allegations. It says it is only at war with Hamas, which it accuses of genocidal violence in the attack that ignited the war. Now winter sets in In that Oct. 7, 2023, attack, Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel and killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted around 250. Around 100 hostages are still in Gaza, at least a third believed to be dead. Israel’s subsequent bombardment and ground invasion have killed over 45,000 Palestinians in Gaza, more than half of them women and children, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and civilians in its count. The offensive has caused widespread destruction and displaced some 90% of Gaza’s 2.3 million people, often multiple times. Hundreds of thousands are packed into squalid tent camps along the coast as the cold, wet winter sets in. Israel has been carrying out a major operation in northern Gaza since early October, battling Hamas in the most isolated and heavily damaged part of the territory. Tens of thousands have fled as the military has ordered a complete evacuation and allowed almost no humanitarian aid to enter. The Israeli military body overseeing civilian affairs in Gaza, known as COGAT, said on Friday it facilitated the evacuation of over 100 patients, caregivers and others from Kamal Adwan Hospital and Al-Awda Hospital in the north. They have struggled to function. COGAT said it also facilitated the delivery of 5,000 liters of fuel and food packages to the hospitals. Kamal Adwan's director on Saturday asserted that Israel's military had ordered an evacuation and said shelling was occurring. Israel's military on Sunday said there was no evacuation order and it was unaware of any strikes there. Palestinian security force member killed in West Bank In the volatile West Bank town of Jenin, militants shot and killed a member of the Palestinian security forces and wounded two others. The Western-backed Palestinian Authority launched a rare crackdown there this month. A statement from the security forces blamed the shooting on 'outlaws,' without elaborating. The PA is internationally recognized but deeply unpopular among Palestinians, in part because it cooperates with Israel on security matters. The PA exercises limited authority in population centers in the West Bank. Israel captured the territory in the 1967 Mideast War, and the Palestinians want it to form the main part of their future state. ___ Goldenberg reported from Tel Aviv, Israel. ___ Follow AP’s war coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war	https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-news-12-22-2024-6638c448bcc5780d98c3e8284ce58fe1	2024-12-21T23:38:02-08:00	
China says US is 'playing with fire' after latest military aid for Taiwan	BEIJING (AP) — The Chinese government protested Sunday the latest American announcements of military sales and assistance to Taiwan, warning the United States that it is 'playing with fire.' U.S. President Joe Biden authorized Saturday the provision of up to $571 million in Defense Department material and services and in military education and training for Taiwan. Separately, the Defense Department said Friday that $295 million in military sales had been approved. A Chinese Foreign Ministry statement urged the U.S. to stop arming Taiwan and stop what it called 'dangerous moves that undermine peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait.' Taiwan is a democratic island of 23 million people that the Chinese government claims as its territory and says must come under its control. U.S. military sales and assistance aim to help Taiwan defend itself and deter China from launching an attack. The $571 million in military assistance comes on top of Biden's authorization of $567 million for the same purposes in late September. The military sales include $265 million for about 300 tactical radio systems and $30 million for 16 gun mounts. Taiwan's Foreign Ministry welcomed the approval of the two sales, saying in a social media post on X that it reaffirmed the U.S. government's 'commitment to our defense.'	https://apnews.com/article/china-taiwan-us-military-arms-sales-89a657717d0ef2d0565726d141a530a3	2024-12-21T20:36:27-08:00	
In Assad's hometown, few shared in his family's fortune. They hope they won't share in his downfall	QARDAHA, Syria (AP) — On the walls of the palatial mausoleum built to house the remains of former Syrian President Hafez Assad, vandals have sprayed variations of the phrase, 'Damn your soul, Hafez.' Nearly two weeks after the ouster of his son, Bashar Assad, people streamed in to take photos next to the burned-out hollow where the elder Assad’s grave used to be. It was torched by rebel fighters after a lightning offensive overthrew Assad's government, bringing more than a half-century rule by the Assad dynasty to an end. The mausoleum's sprawling grounds — and the surrounding area, where the ousted president and other relatives had villas — were until recently off limits to residents of Qardaha, the former presidential dynasty's hometown in the mountains overlooking the coastal city of Latakia. Nearby, Bashar Assad’s house was emptied by looters, who left the water taps running to flood it. At a villa belonging to three of his cousins, a father and his two young sons were removing pipes to sell the scrap metal. A gutted piano was tipped over on the floor. While the Assads lived in luxury, most Qardaha residents — many, like Assad, members of the Alawite minority sect — survived on manual labor, low-level civil service jobs and farming to eke out a living. Many sent their sons to serve in the army, not out of loyalty to the government but because they had no other option. 'The situation was not what the rest of the Syrian society thought,' said Deeb Dayoub, an Alawite sheikh. 'Everyone thought Qardaha was a city built on a marble rock and a square of aquamarine in every house,' he said, referring to the trappings of wealth enjoyed by Assad's family. In the city’s main street, a modest strip of small grocery stores and clothing shops, Ali Youssef, stood next to a coffee cart, gesturing with disdain. 'This street is the best market and the best street in Qardaha and it’s full of potholes.' Families resorted to eating bread dipped in oil and salt because they could not afford meat or vegetables, he said. Youssef said he dodged mandatory military service for two years, but eventually was forced to go. 'Our salary was 300,000 Syrian pounds,' a month, he said — just over $20. 'We used to send it to our families to pay the rent or live and eat with it' while working jobs on the side to cover their own expenses. 'Very few people benefited from the former deposed regime,' Youssef said. So far, residents said, the security forces made up of fighters from Hayat Tahrir al-Sham — the main group in the coalition that unseated Assad, and which is now ruling the country — have been respectful toward them. 'The security situation is fine so far, it’s acceptable, no major issues,' said Mariam al-Ali, who was in the market with her daughter. 'There were a few abuses … but it was fixed.' She did not elaborate, but others said there had been scattered incidents of robberies and looting or threats and insults. Al-Ali called Assad a 'traitor,' but she remained circumspect about her Alawite community's position in the new Syria. 'The most important thing is that there should be no sectarianism, so there will be no more blood spilled,' she said. Dayoub, the Alawite sheikh, described 'a state of anticipation and caution among all citizens in this area, and in general among Alawites,' although he said fears have started to ease. At the town’s municipal building, dozens of notables sat on bleachers discussing the country' s new reality and what they hoped to convey to the new leadership. Much was centered around economic woes — retired public servants' salaries had not been paid, the price of fuel had risen, there was no public transportation in the area. But others had larger concerns. 'We hope that in the next government or the new Syria, we will have rights and duties like any Syrian citizen — we are not asking for any more or less,' said Jaafar Ahmed, a doctoral student and community activist. 'We don’t accept the curtailment of our rights because the regime was part of this component.' Questions also loomed about the fate of the area's sons who had served in Assad's army. Since the army's collapse in the face of the rebel advance, residents said several thousand young army recruits from Qardaha have gone missing. Some later turned up on lists of former soldiers being held at a detention center in Hama. 'These are young guys who are 22 or 23 and they never took part' in active combat, said Qais Ibrahim, whose nephews were among the missing. Over the past few years, active combat was largely frozen in the country's civil war. 'We send our children to the army because we don’t have any other source of income.' Um Jaafar, who gave only her nickname out of fear of reprisals, said the family had no information about the fate of her two sons, stationed with the army in Raqqa and Deir Ezzour, though one son's name later turned up on the list of those imprisoned in Hama. 'My children got the best grades in school, but I didn’t have the ability to send them to the university,' she said. 'They went to the army just for a salary that was barely enough to cover their transportation costs.' Syria's new authorities have set up 'reconciliation centers' around the country where former soldiers can register, hand over their weapons and receive a 'reconciliation ID' allowing them to move freely and safely in Syria for three months. But Ahmed, the doctoral student, said he wants more. As the country attempts to unify and move on after nearly 14 years of civil war, he said, 'We want either forgiveness for all or accountability for all.' Ahmed acknowledged that during the war, 'rural Latakia was responsible for some radical groups,' referring to pro-Assad militias accused of widespread abuses against civilians. But, he said, opposition groups also committed abuses. Rebels often indiscriminately targeted Alawites because they were seen as the firmest pillar of Assad’s rule — and some Islamist extremists among the rebels consider them heretics. 'We hope that there will be either an open process of reconciliation ... or transitional justice in which all will be held accountable for their mistakes, from all parties,' he said. 'We can’t talk about holding accountable one ... group but not another.'	https://apnews.com/article/syria-bashar-assad-hometown-qardaha-alawites-cbeb4ab8d5bf4bacc75fb9792bb4cd14	2024-12-21T20:04:54-08:00	
Winter is hitting Gaza and many Palestinians have little protection from the cold	KHAN YOUNIS, Gaza Strip (AP) — Winter is hitting the Gaza Strip and many of the nearly 2 million Palestinians displaced by the devastating 14-month war with Israel are struggling to protect themselves from the wind, cold and rain. There is a shortage of blankets and warm clothing, little wood for fires, and the tents and patched-together tarps families are living in have grown increasingly threadbare after months of heavy use, according to aid workers and residents. Shadia Aiyada, who was displaced from the southern city of Rafah to the coastal area of Muwasi, has only one blanket and a hot water bottle to keep her eight children from shivering inside their fragile tent. 'We get scared every time we learn from the weather forecast that rainy and windy days are coming up because our tents are lifted with the wind. We fear that strong windy weather would knock out our tents one day while we’re inside,' she said. With nighttime temperatures that can drop into the 40s (the mid-to-high single digits Celsius), Aiyada fears that her kids will get sick without warm clothing. When they fled their home, her children only had their summer clothes, she said. They have been forced to borrow some from relatives and friends to keep warm. The United Nations warns of people living in precarious makeshift shelters that might not survive the winter. At least 945,000 people need winterization supplies, which have become prohibitively expensive in Gaza, the U.N. said in an update Tuesday. The U.N. also fears infectious disease, which spiked last winter, will climb again amid rising malnutrition. The U.N. Agency for Palestinian Refugees, known as UNRWA, has been planning all year for winter in Gaza, but the aid it was able to get into the territory is 'not even close to being enough for people,' said Louise Wateridge, an agency spokeswoman. UNRWA distributed 6,000 tents over the past four weeks in northern Gaza but was unable to get them to other parts of the Strip, including areas where there has been fighting. About 22,000 tents have been stuck in Jordan and 600,000 blankets and 33 truckloads of mattresses have been sitting in Egypt since the summer because the agency doesn’t have Israeli approval or a safe route to bring them into Gaza and because it had to prioritize desperately needed food aid, Wateridge said. Many of the mattresses and blankets have since been looted or destroyed by the weather and rodents, she said. The International Rescue Committee is struggling to bring in children’s winter clothing because there 'are a lot of approvals to get from relevant authorities,' said Dionne Wong, the organization’s deputy director of programs for the occupied Palestinian territories. 'The ability for Palestinians to prepare for winter is essentially very limited,' Wong said. The Israeli government agency responsible for coordinating aid shipments into Gaza said in a statement that Israel has worked for months with international organizations to prepare Gaza for the winter, including facilitating the shipment of heaters, warm clothing, tents and blankets into the territory. More than 45,000 Palestinians have been killed in the war in Gaza, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. The ministry's count doesn't distinguish between civilians and combatants, but it has said more than half of the fatalities are women and children. The Israeli military says it has killed more than 17,000 militants, without providing evidence. The war was sparked by Hamas’ October 2023 attack on southern Israel, where the militant group killed 1,200 people and took 250 hostages in Gaza. Negotiators say Israel and Hamas are inching toward a ceasefire deal, which would include a surge in aid into the territory. For now, the winter clothing for sale in Gaza's markets is far too expensive for most people to afford, residents and aid workers said. Reda Abu Zarada, 50, who was displaced from northern Gaza with her family, said the adults sleep with the children in their arms to keep them warm inside their tent. 'Rats walk on us at night because we don’t have doors and tents are torn. The blankets don’t keep us warm. We feel frost coming out from the ground. We wake up freezing in the morning,' she said. 'I’m scared of waking up one day to find one of the children frozen to death.' On Thursday night, she fought through knee pain exacerbated by cold weather to fry zucchini over a fire made of paper and cardboard scraps outside their tent. She hoped the small meal would warm the children before bed. Omar Shabet, who is displaced from Gaza City and staying with his three children, feared that lighting a fire outside his tent would make his family a target for Israeli warplanes. 'We go inside our tents after sunset and don’t go out because it is very cold and it gets colder by midnight,' he said. 'My 7-year-old daughter almost cries at night because of how cold she is.'	https://apnews.com/article/gaza-winter-palestinians-aid-israel-24fe23c8ae2743294c169cff4a1431d3	2024-12-21T20:03:45-08:00	
Two US Navy pilots shot down over Red Sea in apparent 'friendly fire' incident, US military says	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Two U.S. Navy pilots were shot down Sunday over the Red Sea in an apparent 'friendly fire' incident, the U.S military said, marking the most serious incident to threaten troops in over a year of America targeting Yemen's Houthi rebels. Both pilots were recovered alive after ejecting from their stricken aircraft, with one suffering minor injuries. But the shootdown underlines just how dangerous the Red Sea corridor has become over the ongoing attacks on shipping by the Iranian-backed Houthis despite U.S. and European military coalitions patrolling the area. The U.S. military had conducted airstrikes targeting Yemen’s Houthi rebels at the time, though the U.S. military’s Central Command did not elaborate on what their mission was and did not immediately respond to questions from The Associated Press. The F/A-18 shot down had just flown off the deck of the USS Harry S. Truman aircraft carrier, Central Command said. On Dec. 15, Central Command acknowledged the Truman had entered the Mideast, but hadn't specified that the carrier and its battle group was in the Red Sea. 'The guided missile cruiser USS Gettysburg, which is part of the USS Harry S. Truman Carrier Strike Group, mistakenly fired on and hit the F/A-18,' Central Command said in a statement. From the military's description, the aircraft shot down was a two-seat F/A-18 Super Hornet fighter jet assigned to the 'Red Rippers' of Strike Fighter Squadron 11 out of Naval Air Station Oceana, Virginia. It wasn't immediately clear how the Gettysburg could mistake an F/A-18 for an enemy aircraft or missile, particularly as ships in a battle group remain linked by both radar and radio communication. However, Central Command said that warships and aircraft earlier shot down multiple Houthi drones and an anti-ship cruise missile launched by the rebels. Incoming hostile fire from the Houthis has given sailors just seconds to make decisions in the past. Since the Truman's arrival, the U.S. has stepped up its airstrikes targeting the Houthis and their missile fire into the Red Sea and the surrounding area. However, the presence of an American warship group may spark renewed attacks from the rebels, like what the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower saw earlier this year. That deployment marked what the Navy described as its most intense combat since World War II. On Saturday night and early Sunday, U.S. warplanes conducted airstrikes that shook Sanaa, the capital of Yemen that the Houthis have held since 2014. Central Command described the strikes as targeting a 'missile storage facility' and a 'command-and-control facility,' without elaborating. Houthi-controlled media reported strikes in both Sanaa and around the port city of Hodeida, without offering any casualty or damage information. In Sanaa, strikes appeared particularly targeted at a mountainside known to be home to military installations. The Houthis later acknowledged the aircraft being shot down in the Red Sea. The Houthis have targeted about 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones since the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip started in October 2023 after Hamas’ surprise attack on Israel that killed 1,200 people and saw 250 others taken hostage. Israel’s grinding offensive in Gaza has killed more than 45,000 Palestinians, local health officials say. The tally doesn’t distinguish between combatants and civilians. The Houthis have seized one vessel and sunk two in a campaign that has also killed four sailors. Other missiles and drones have either been intercepted by separate U.S.- and European-led coalitions in the Red Sea or failed to reach their targets, which have also included Western military vessels. The rebels maintain that they target ships linked to Israel, the U.S. or the United Kingdom to force an end to Israel’s campaign against Hamas in Gaza. However, many of the ships attacked have little or no connection to the conflict, including some bound for Iran. The Houthis also have increasingly targeted Israel itself with drones and missiles, resulting in retaliatory Israeli airstrikes.	https://apnews.com/article/mideast-wars-yemen-us-navy-pilots-houthi-95a792daae3b0120186bfc6c66e1b6fe	2024-12-21T17:57:03-08:00	
The water was their livelihood. Now Thailand's sea nomads work to preserve a vanishing way of life	SURIN ISLANDS, Thailand (AP) — When Hook was a child, he started his days by jumping off the boat that his family lived on and into the ocean. By age 3, he could already swim and dive in shallow waters. His home was a kabang, a boat, that his family sailed in Thailand’s southern waters. The ocean was his backyard. Now Hook, whose full name is Suriyan Klathale, lives on land like the rest of his community, a people known as the Moken. The recollections of his childhood, which many Moken of his generation still have, are mostly just memories. The community, a group of indigenous people from Thailand and Myanmar, came to worldwide attention for its members' understanding of waves when the Indian Ocean Tsunami struck in December 2004 and killed more than 200,000 people. The few tourists who happened to be on the islands inhabited by the Moken survived because locals knew when they saw the water recede that people needed to get to higher ground. Today, things are different and changing fast. This once free-sailing people have been grounded by powerful forces of change. How do you hold onto tradition when everything is working against it? The Moken are one of the various tribal groups and indigenous communities not formally recognized by the Thai government. For years, activists from these communities have tried to push for formal recognition with a bill that would help them hold on to traditions. But as recently as October, the latest draft of this proposed bill, called the Protection and Promotion of Ethnic Groups’ Way of Life, was tabled by Parliament. The bill would legally guarantee these communities' basic rights, such as health care, education and land, as well as provide government support to preserve their ethnic identities. For the Moken, the kabang and their way of living on the ocean are something they hope the law could help preserve. The wooden boat, with a distinctive curve that juts out from its bow and a pavilion set in the middle, is central to the Moken’s identity. 'It’s like a lifetime of a person, of a family,' Hook said. 'In the past, we lived and died on that boat.' Multiple generations could live on a kabang, which were much bigger in the past. The parents would stay in the middle of the boat; their married children lived at the front until they built their own boat. Tat, an elder in the Moken community who uses only one name, said that a Moken became an adult when he could build a boat. It meant he was capable of starting a family. Today, though, almost no one lives on a boat. Narumon Arunotai, an associate professor at Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok who has worked with the Moken and other indigenous communities for decades, said the shift toward permanent dwelling on land had already started more than 40 years ago. It was a gradual shift, driven both by stricter border controls as well as the inability to get the wood necessary to build the kabangs. Further, the Indian Ocean tsunami in 2004 destroyed many of the traditional boats. The change to dwelling on land has happened with other communities known colloquially as sea nomads in Thailand as well. The Moken are scattered across an archipelago of some 800 islands on the coast of Myanmar and Thailand. In the days when they lived on boats, Moken stayed on land only during the monsoon season, which started around May. They’d stay on land until the winds shifted, usually around December, and then abandon their temporary homes for the sea. For food, they fished and foraged. Many of the older generation were born on boats and sailed regularly amongst the islands. 'We could move freely without having to worry about the Myanmar government or the Thai government,' said Tawan Klathale, Hook’s older brother, who was born on a boat. All Moken in Thailand use the surname Klathale, given to the community by one of Thailand’s former queens. 'Back then,' said the brother, who is known as Ngui, 'there was no clear line to where is Myanmar and where is Thailand.' Freedoms began to constrict, and making boats became harder But by the time Ngui and Hook were teenagers, they could no longer travel as freely between those islands. Many Moken started settling more permanently in the Surin Islands, off the Thai coast. Some came from Myanmar to Thailand, looking for jobs and safety from pirates. Hook’s family stayed ashore. The parts of the community that stayed in Thailand found that the land they had always visited each season had become a national park by 1981. As a result, they could no longer cut down the large trees they needed to build their boats. To make a kabang, one needs a good strong tree, at least 1 meter wide and 10 meters tall. The trunk needs to be straight and be free of defects. Over the course of months, men of the community would dig out the trunk and carve it into a boat’s hull, while also using fire to make the wood pliable and stretch it out. It was a communal thing, involving up to 10 people. Now, it’s difficult to gather enough people. Other men of the village would often be out working during the day. They did not have time to join and work together on a boat. Ngui and other members of an informal group called Moken Pa Ti’ao, concerned they were losing the knowledge of boat-building, said they approached the park now and then across the years get a tree to make the boat. They were refused years ago by the chief of Mu Ko Surin National Park. The group hasn’t asked since. The park allows them to cut down only small trees, said Ngui, who is also assistant to the village chief in Surin Island. 'The restrictions has been like this as far as we can remember.' Today, the village in Surin only has one kabang, built by Tat and used mostly to ferry tourists and take children out on day trips. Hook, who lives on the mainland in Thailand, also has a kabang built with the funding of a private donor from Norway after a filmmaker made a documentary about his journey to make one such boat in 2014. But his kabang is built with planks of wood, rather than a single hollowed out tree. They are among the few keen to remember the boats and other traditions. Tat says he has made sure to pass down what he knew to his children, from songs to boat building. 'If my generation is gone, there would be just very few people left who know how to do these things,' Tat said. Learning about the ocean remains a priority Together, Tat and Wilasinee Klathale, a teacher at the school on the island, also try to take village children out on the boats to teach them about the ocean as well as about music and dance. 'It’s not in the curriculum, but I added them myself, because I could see that these things are going to be lost,' Wilasinee said. Today, young Moken are more worried about their livelihoods and finding jobs than how to build a boat. Most only make money during Thailand’s peak tourist season when the national park is open to tourists, from November to April, and have to live on that money for the rest of the year. Boyen Klathale, a young Moken man, said it’s difficult to find a job. On Surin, the opportunities are either with the national park or operating boats to take tourists out. Though it’s peak season, he wasn’t able to find a job this year, and he didn’t want to leave behind his family to find work on the mainland. The Moken have asked for more fishing rights in the past, but were denied a further quota beyond the subsistence amount they’re allowed from the park. Ngui, the village chief’s assistant, said he hopes the Moken can sell the souvenirs they make to tourists all year around with help from the government. The future holds some hope. In 2024, the Surin Islands National Park appointed a new chief, Kriengkrai Pohcharoen. In a shift, he said he was open to collaborating with the Moken on a kabang — as long as it was a tree that fell over on its own. 'I think about how to improve their quality of life, and how they can sustainably live in nature,' he said. 'I want them to have a good quality of life.' The Moken are realistic about their permanent switch to land. These days, most prefer it. But some still remember the old ways — and an aquamarine bay filled with handmade kabangs. 'The world is changing and that’s the way it is, if you ask me,' Ngui said. 'I think everything is bound to be lost at some point, but I just want it to stay as long as possible.'	https://apnews.com/article/thailand-sea-nomads-tsunami-moken-01bbf0c099652e6bd7f67ef191b73e8a	2024-12-21T17:41:06-08:00

Trump taps 'Apprentice' producer, Mark Burnett, as special envoy to the United Kingdom	WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) — Mark Burnett, the power producer who helped reintroduce Donald Trump to a national television audience with 'The Apprentice,' is being tapped by the president-elect as special envoy to the United Kingdom in his upcoming administration. 'With a distinguished career in television production and business, Mark brings a unique blend of diplomatic acumen and international recognition to this important role,' Trump announced Saturday. Burnett, who was born in London, helped produce hits like 'Survivor' and 'The Voice,' but is perhaps best known for teaming up with Trump for 'The Apprentice,' which first aired on NBC in 2004. Trump had been well-known in real estate and pop culture circles for decades. But the show helped again make him a household name — though Trump severed ties with NBC in 2015, the same year he launched his first White House run. The selection of Burnett continues Trump's trend of filling out his incoming administration with people who have high-profile backgrounds in television or politics, or both — including his choice to be defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, a former co-host of 'Fox &amp; Friends Weekend,' and ex-television doctor and unsuccessful Senate candidate in Pennsylvania, Mehmet Oz. Trump’s first campaign in 2016 was rocked by allegations about his conduct on 'The Apprentice' and other appearances during his association with NBC, notably in footage in which he said he could sexually assault women and get away with it because he was a 'star.' Almost a decade after he left his reality TV role, Trump’s television career remains central to his biography and political rise. The show presented Trump Tower to tens of millions of people as a symbol of power and success before Trump launched his first campaign from the building’s lobby. 'Mark is known for creating and producing some of the biggest shows in Television History,' Trump wrote in his statement on Burnett, listing many of his biggest hits before adding, 'most notably, ‘The Apprentice’' and noting that Burnett 'has won 13 Emmy Awards!' Special envoys are usually picked by presidents for the world's traditional hotspots, including the Middle East — where Trump has already said he'd like Steven Witkoff to fill the role. The United Kingdom, which has long enjoyed a 'special relationship' with the U.S. that makes it one of Washington's strongest global allies, is not typically a candidate for such posts. But Trump has announced a series of special envoy positions to several top loyalists ahead of Inauguration Day on Jan. 20, including his former ambassador to Germany Richard Grenell who he chose as envoy for special missions. That announcement joined previous ones including Adam Boehler as special presidential envoy for hostage affairs, and Keith Kellogg to serve as special envoy for Ukraine and Russia. The president-elect said Burnett 'will work to enhance diplomatic relations, focusing on areas of mutual interest, including trade, investment opportunities, and cultural exchanges.'	https://apnews.com/article/trump-apprentice-producer-burnett-envoy-united-kingdom-add9ff1ff9f72ddba482410f46070977	2024-12-21T12:43:39-08:00	
38 people are dead and over 100 remain missing in Congo after a ferry capsizes in the river Busira	KINSHASA, Congo (AP) — Thirty-eight people are confirmed dead, and over 100 remain missing after an overloaded ferry in the Congo capsized late Friday night, according to local officials and eyewitnesses. Twenty people are confirmed to have been rescued so far. The boat was traveling on the Burisa River in the northeast of the Congo as part of a convoy of other vessels, and the passengers were primarily merchants returning home for Christmas, said Joseph Joseph Kangolingoli, the mayor of Ingende, the last town before the site of the accident.	https://apnews.com/article/congo-boat-capsizes-busira-river-ac222ab809e107b119a8e86f1d5aa3f2	2024-12-21T11:08:16-08:00	
Ex-OpenAI engineer who raised legal concerns about the technology he helped build has died	Suchir Balaji, a former OpenAI engineer and whistleblower who helped train the artificial intelligence systems behind ChatGPT and later said he believed those practices violated copyright law, has died, according to his parents and San Francisco officials. He was 26. Balaji worked at OpenAI for nearly four years before quitting in August. He was well-regarded by colleagues at the San Francisco company, where a co-founder this week called him one of OpenAI's strongest contributors who was essential to developing some of its products. 'We are devastated to learn of this incredibly sad news and our hearts go out to Suchir’s loved ones during this difficult time,' said a statement from OpenAI. Balaji was found dead in his San Francisco apartment on Nov. 26 in what police said 'appeared to be a suicide. No evidence of foul play was found during the initial investigation.' The city's chief medical examiner's office confirmed the manner of death to be suicide. His parents Poornima Ramarao and Balaji Ramamurthy said they are still seeking answers, describing their son as a 'happy, smart and brave young man' who loved to hike and recently returned from a trip with friends. Balaji grew up in the San Francisco Bay Area and first arrived at the fledgling AI research lab for a 2018 summer internship while studying computer science at the University of California, Berkeley. He returned a few years later to work at OpenAI, where one of his first projects, called WebGPT, helped pave the way for ChatGPT. 'Suchir’s contributions to this project were essential, and it wouldn’t have succeeded without him,' said OpenAI co-founder John Schulman in a social media post memorializing Balaji. Schulman, who recruited Balaji to his team, said what made him such an exceptional engineer and scientist was his attention to detail and ability to notice subtle bugs or logical errors. 'He had a knack for finding simple solutions and writing elegant code that worked,' Schulman wrote. 'He’d think through the details of things carefully and rigorously.' Balaji later shifted to organizing the huge datasets of online writings and other media used to train GPT-4, the fourth generation of OpenAI's flagship large language model and a basis for the company's famous chatbot. It was that work that eventually caused Balaji to question the technology he helped build, especially after newspapers, novelists and others began suing OpenAI and other AI companies for copyright infringement. He first raised his concerns with The New York Times, which reported them in an October profile of Balaji. He later told The Associated Press he would 'try to testify' in the strongest copyright infringement cases and considered a lawsuit brought by The New York Times last year to be the 'most serious.' Times lawyers named him in a Nov. 18 court filing as someone who might have 'unique and relevant documents' supporting allegations of OpenAI's willful copyright infringement. His records were also sought by lawyers in a separate case brought by book authors including the comedian Sarah Silverman, according to a court filing. 'It doesn’t feel right to be training on people’s data and then competing with them in the marketplace,' Balaji told the AP in late October. 'I don’t think you should be able to do that. I don’t think you are able to do that legally.' He told the AP that he gradually grew more disillusioned with OpenAI, especially after the internal turmoil that led its board of directors to fire and then rehire CEO Sam Altman last year. Balaji said he was broadly concerned about how its commercial products were rolling out, including their propensity for spouting false information known as hallucinations. But of the 'bag of issues' he was concerned about, he said he was focusing on copyright as the one it was 'actually possible to do something about.' He acknowledged that it was an unpopular opinion within the AI research community, which is accustomed to pulling data from the internet, but said 'they will have to change and it’s a matter of time.' He had not been deposed and it’s unclear to what extent his revelations will be admitted as evidence in any legal cases after his death. He also published a personal blog post with his opinions about the topic. Schulman, who resigned from OpenAI in August, said he and Balaji coincidentally left on the same day and celebrated with fellow colleagues that night with dinner and drinks at a San Francisco bar. Another of Balaji’s mentors, co-founder and chief scientist Ilya Sutskever, had left OpenAI several months earlier, which Balaji saw as another impetus to leave. Schulman said Balaji had told him earlier this year of his plans to leave OpenAI and that Balaji didn't think that better-than-human AI known as artificial general intelligence 'was right around the corner, like the rest of the company seemed to believe.' The younger engineer expressed interest in getting a doctorate and exploring 'some more off-the-beaten path ideas about how to build intelligence,' Schulman said. Balaji's family said a memorial is being planned for later this month at the India Community Center in Milpitas, California, not far from his hometown of Cupertino. —————- EDITOR’S NOTE — This story includes discussion of suicide.

Tensions over Essequibo region resurface as Venezuela completes a bridge to a disputed border base	GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) — Guyana’s government Saturday formally protested to Venezuela following the completion by Venezuela's armed forces of a bridge built on a remote river island shared by both countries. Work on the bridge, which links Venezuela’s mainland to a military base, has caused a decades-old row over border lines in the Essequibo region to flare up again. Guyana Foreign Minister Hugh Todd said in a statement that he was forced to summon Venezuelan Ambassador Amador Perez Silva to his office Thursday to condemn the move by Venezuela to build the bridge. The bridge links Venezuela's mainland to the eastern side of Ankoko island. The ministry claims the bridge connects the Venezuelan mainland to a small military base that Venezuela built illegally on Guyana's side of Ankoko, a small island that is mostly inhabited by gold miners and military personnel. The two neighboring states have feuded over land and maritime borders for decades as Venezuela claims that an 1890s boundaries commission cheated it out of the oil rich Essequibo region. The region currently makes up two-thirds of Guyana's territory. The area was administered by Britain for more than a century, and it has been under Guyanese control since 1966, when the nation gained its independence from the United Kingdom. Last year, Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro threatened to annex the region by force, following a referendum in which Venezuelan voters were asked if the Essequibo should be turned into a Venezuelan state. But Caribbean leaders, Brazil and the U.N. organized an emergency summit between the presidents of both nations on the Caribbean island of St. Vincent, where they agreed to resolve the dispute though peaceful means, and to avoid taking actions that would raise tensions. On Thursday, Todd said that Venezuela's decision to build the Ankoko island bridge violated the St Vincent agreement. 'Venezuela’s activities, including its military activities east of the boundary line, violate Guyana’s sovereignty, and international law requires that they be halted and that all personnel, facilities or equipment built or brought there by Venezuela be removed,' the ministry said. Guyana has argued the case in the World Court in The Netherlands for a final settlement and recently submitted its last piece of evidence to the court. Venezuela has until August to reply.	https://apnews.com/article/guyana-venezuela-border-essequibo-military-ankoko-mining-072e3f69997521fb178091362ba27ccf	2024-12-21T09:47:32-08:00	
What we know about the deadly Christmas market attack in Germany	MAGDEBURG, Germany (AP) — Five people were killed, including a 9-year-old, after a Saudi doctor drove into a Christmas market teeming with holiday shoppers in the German city of Magdeburg, officials said Saturday, as people mourned the victims and their shaken sense of security. City official Ronni Krug didn't provide further information on the adults killed in the attack on Friday night. He said 200 people were injured, of whom 41 were in serious or very serious condition. How did the attack unfold? Thi Linh Chi Nguyen, a 34-year-old manicurist from Vietnam — whose salon is located in a mall across the Christmas market — was on the phone during a break when she heard loud bangs and thought at first they were fireworks. She then saw a car drive through the market at high speed. People screamed and a child was thrown into the air by the car. The woman recalled seeing the car bursting out of the market and turning right onto Ernst-Reuter-Allee street and then coming to a standstill at the tram stop where the suspect was arrested. The market itself was still cordoned off Saturday with red-and-white tape and police vans every 50 meters (yards). Police with machine pistols guarded every entry to the market. Some thermal security blankets still lay on the street. Who’s the man behind the attack? Prosecutors said the suspect, a 50-year-old Saudi doctor, is under investigation on suspicion of murder, attempted murder and bodily harm. Several German media outlets identified the suspect as Taleb A., withholding his last name in line with privacy laws, and reported that he was a specialist in psychiatry and psychotherapy. He has lived in Germany since 2006, practicing medicine in Bernburg, about 40 kilometers (25 miles) south of Magdeburg. officials said. Taleb’s X account describes him as a former Muslim. It is filled with tweets and retweets focusing on anti-Islam themes and criticism of the religion, while sharing congratulatory notes to Muslims who left the faith. He was critical of German authorities, saying they had failed to do enough to combat the 'Islamism of Europe.' He has also voiced support for the far-right and anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. Some described Taleb as an activist who helped Saudi women flee their homeland. Recently, he seemed focused on his theory that German authorities have been targeting Saudi asylum-seekers. The motives behind the attack There were still no answers Saturday as to what motivated the man to drive his black BMW into a crowd in the eastern German city. Prosecutors said the motive may have been 'dissatisfaction with the treatment of Saudi refugees in Germany,' but investigators are still trying to get to the bottom of what was behind the attack. Investigators have to analyze computers, mobile devices and other evidence, 'and at the end of the day we will know, or at least hope to know, what drove him to this act.' A string of violence The violence shocked Germany and the city, prompting several other German towns to cancel their weekend Christmas markets as a precaution, and out of solidarity with Magdeburg’s loss. Berlin kept its markets open but has increased its police presence at them. Germany has suffered a string of extremist attacks in recent years, including a knife attack that killed three people and wounded eight at a festival in the western city of Solingen in August. Those attacks have led cities to beef up security at Christmas markets and other events. Friday’s attack came eight years after an Islamic extremist drove a truck into a crowded Christmas market in Berlin, killing 13 people and injuring many others. The attacker was killed days later in a shootout in Italy.	https://apnews.com/article/germany-christmas-market-attack-magdeburg-c28c6ed42c7d1692798a28d2aba47514	2024-12-21T09:00:47-08:00	
Pakistani Taliban claims responsibility for a deadly military checkpoint attack in the northwest	PESHAWAR, Pakistan (AP) — The Pakistani Taliban on Saturday claimed responsibility for a deadly military checkpoint attack in the country’s northwest. The militant group said it killed 35 soldiers and injured 15 others in an early morning raid. It also claimed seizing equipment including a night vision device and weapons. It’s Pakistan Taliban's latest assault on troops in the restive province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, which borders Afghanistan. They made the claims in one of their WhatsApp chat groups. The army has yet to officially comment on the incident in South Waziristan, but a security official said militants used light and heavy weapons. He said they killed 16 soldiers and injured eight others. The official spoke anonymously because he was not authorized to talk to the media. The Pakistani Taliban have stepped up their offensive against the military and police since November 2022, when they unilaterally ended a ceasefire with the government after the failure of months of talks, hosted by Afghanistan’s Taliban rulers in Kabul. Also Saturday, Pakistan’s army said a military court had handed down prison sentences to 25 people it alleged were involved in riots last year following the arrest of former premier Imran Khan. Thousands of demonstrators attacked the military’s headquarters in the garrison city of Rawalpindi, stormed an air base in Mianwali in eastern Punjab province and torched a building housing state-run Radio Pakistan in the northwest. The prison terms ranged from two years to 10 which, the army warned, acted as a 'stark reminder' for people to never take the law into their own hands.	https://apnews.com/article/pakistan-taliban-checkpoint-attack-waziristan-fff19247b8a3f72b10b12554527ea039	2024-12-21T06:33:22-08:00	
Vatican advances beatification process for Belgium's king who abdicated rather than approve abortion	ROME (AP) — The Vatican has taken the first main step to implement Pope Francis’ wish that Belgium’s late king be beatified for having abdicated for a day rather than approve legislation to legalize abortion. The Holy See’s saint-making office on Dec. 17 established a historical commission, made up of experts in Belgian history and archives, to begin investigating the life and virtues of King Baudouin, the Vatican said in a communique Saturday. Francis surprised and even enraged some Belgians when, during his September visit to Brussels, he prayed at Baudouin’s tomb, denounced Belgium’s abortion laws as 'homicidal' and announced he wanted to beatify the late king. Doubling down on the issue during his in-flight press conference en route home, Francis called doctors who perform abortions 'hitmen.' In the days after, Prime Minister Alexander De Croo called Francis’ comments 'totally unacceptable,' and summoned the Vatican’s ambassador to Belgium to complain. 'That a foreign head of state makes such a statement about democratic decision-making in our country is absolutely unacceptable,' De Croo said during question time in Parliament, according to Belgian media. 'We have no lessons to learn about how our parliamentarians democratically approve laws. Fortunately, the time when the church dictated the law in our country is long behind us.' Francis has strongly backed the Catholic Church’s opposition to abortion and long equated it to murder or 'hiring a hitman to solve a problem.' But his strong comments about abortion in Belgium only served to inflame an already troubled visit, given the Belgian church's wretched legacy of clergy sexual abuse. Baudouin became king after the abdication of his father, King Leopold. He abdicated for a day in 1990 rather than give his assent to a parliament-approved bill legalizing abortion. He died in 1993. While praying at his tomb alongside Belgium's current monarchs, Francis praised Baudouin’s courage and urged Belgians today to look to his example in rejecting a new legislative proposal to extend the legal limit for an abortion from 12 weeks to 18 weeks after conception. The Vatican’s saint-making process usually takes years, decades or even centuries and typically begins when the local church ascertains an enduring reputation for sanctity among the faithful by a particular candidate. An investigation into the life and virtues of the candidate follows, during which historians collect documentation and interview acquaintances and experts. If historians determine the candidate has lived a heroic life of Christian virtue, he or she can be declared venerable. The Vatican must then ascertain a miracle attributed to the candidate’s intercession for beatification, and a second miracle for the person to be declared a saint. Martyrs are exempt from the miracle for beatification, and popes can bypass the process altogether and declare saints, as Francis has done on several occasions. The convening of a historical commission suggests that church historians at the very least will conduct the research into Baudouin's life. But the Vatican communique noted that the cause wasn't originating as it normally would with the local Belgian church. Rather, the Holy See's secretariat of state directed the Vatican's saint-making office to open the process, suggesting Francis may be seeking to keep close tabs on the process and see it through quickly. ___ Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

AP PHOTOS: Holiday lights illuminate the world	Holiday lights are everywhere – and everywhere they look a little different. In recent weeks, Associated Press photographers have captured glistening scenes around the globe. In Jemez Springs, New Mexico, traditional luminarias, also known as farolitos, flickered through the Jemez Historic Site during last week’s annual Lights of Gisewa event. On the same day across the globe in Moscow, you could peer through a window of the Hotel Baltschug Kempinski out at St. Basil’s Cathedral and the GUM department store, bathed in lights for holiday festivities. And at the Johannesburg, South Africa zoo, actors in glowing, winged costumes welcomed visitors for the Christmas festival of lights. Few avenues anywhere in the world as as grand during the holidays as the Champs-Élysées in Paris, where hundreds of trees were recently lit up to resemble bubbly wine glasses — and will remain sparkling through the season. And in New York, the famed Christmas tree at Rockefeller Center stands majestic — a Norway spruce from small-town Massachusetts, adorned with 50,000 multi-colored lights. The giant tree is also topped with a Swarovski star crown featuring 3 million crystals. In Germany, a 42-meter-high bright red candle — actually an illuminated medieval tower – shone in the historic city center of Schlitz in late November. In Milan, Italy, it was a symphony in gold as people stood on a bridge and Christmas lights illuminated the Darsena dei Navigli, the neighborhood named for canals that run through the area. Reindeer figures sparkled in Hong Kong, part of waterfront Christmas decorations. And in Tokyo, people walked through a forest’s worth of glistening trees in Roppongi district, decorated with hundreds of thousands of blue LED lights. At Space Center Houston, a child hopped among colored circles, part of space-themed holiday lights, near a replica of the shuttle Independence. Illuminated angels spread their wings over Regent Street in London, thanks to hundreds of thousands of LED lights on the busy shopping street. And sometimes, nature does the trick herself. That’s what happened when a supermoon rose last month in Santiago, Chile, framed perfectly by star-shaped holiday street lights.	https://apnews.com/article/holiday-lights-world-photo-gallery-f3bab9c5c7b9cfeb43a126a6d84d7cc3	2024-12-21T05:07:52-08:00	
38 people die in a crash between a passenger bus and a truck in Brazil	SAO PAULO (AP) — A crash between a passenger bus and a truck early Saturday killed 38 people on a highway in Minas Gerais, a state in southeastern Brazil, officials said. The Minas Gerais fire department, which responded to the scene, said 13 others were taken to hospitals near the city of Teofilo Otoni. The bus had reportedly departed from Sao Paulo and was carrying 45 passengers. Authorities said Saturday afternoon that all victims had been removed from the site and an investigation would determine the cause of the accident. Witnesses told rescue teams that the bus blew a tire, causing the driver to lose control and collide with a truck. Others said that a granite block hit the bus, the fire department added. A car with three passengers also collided with the bus, but all three survived. Gov. Romeu Zema wrote on X that he ordered 'full mobilization' of the Minas Gerais government to assist the victims. 'We are working to ensure that families of the victims are supported to face this tragedy in the most humane way possible, especially as it comes just before Christmas,' Zema said. Brazil's President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva said in a statement Saturday that federal officials were at Minas Gerais state disposal. 'I deeply regret and send my prayers to the families of the more than 30 fatalities from the accident in Teófilo Otoni, Minas Gerais. I pray for the recovery of the survivors of this terrible tragedy,' Lula said. In 2024, more than 10,000 people died in traffic accidents in Brazil, according to the Ministry of Transportation. In September, a bus carrying a football team flipped on a road and killed three people. The Coritiba Crocodiles, a team from the southern Brazilian city of Curitiba, was headed to a game in Rio de Janeiro, where they were set to play in the country’s American football championship. The game was canceled following the deadly accident. ____ Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america	https://apnews.com/article/brazil-minas-gerais-bus-crash-b521a7fc2626f6b1faaa177d8b8c0fdd	2024-12-21T04:55:30-08:00	
German Christmas market ramming is the latest attack to use vehicles as deadly weapons	LONDON (AP) — A car-ramming at a Christmas market in Germany, which police are treating as an attack, is the latest in a grim series of events in which vehicles have been used as deadly weapons. There have been a spate of such attacks over the past decade, some committed by groups but most by individuals. The motives – where they could be established – have varied widely. Some were inspired by Islamic militant groups such as al-Qaida and ISIS, which encouraged followers to carry out low-cost, low-tech attacks with cars and trucks. Others have been linked to mental illness, far-right extremism and online misogyny. What law-enforcement authorities term 'vehicle as a weapon attacks' have reshaped cities around the world, as planners erect concrete barriers around public spaces and build anti-vehicle obstacles into new developments. Here are some major vehicle attacks: MAGDEBURG, Germany, Dec. 20. 2024 — At least five people are killed and more than 200 injured when a car slams into a Christmas market in eastern Germany.

In a calendar rarity, Hanukkah starts this year on Christmas Day	Hanukkah, Judaism’s eight-day Festival of Lights, begins this year on Christmas Day, which has only happened four times since 1900. For some rabbis, the intersection of the two religious holidays provides an auspicious occasion for interfaith engagement. 'This can be a profound opportunity for learning and collaboration and togetherness,' said Rabbi Josh Stanton, a vice president of the Jewish Federations of North America. He oversees interfaith initiatives involving the 146 local and regional Jewish federations that his organization represents. 'The goal is not proselytizing; it's learning deeply from each other,' he said. 'It’s others seeing you as you see yourself.' One example of togetherness: a Chicanukah party hosted Thursday evening by several Jewish organizations in Houston, bringing together members of the city’s Latino and Jewish communities for a 'cross cultural holiday celebration.' The venue: Houston’s Holocaust museum. The food on offer was a blend of the two cultures — for example a latke bar featuring guacamole, chili con queso and pico de gallo, as well as applesauce and sour cream. The doughnut-like pastries were sufganiyot — a Hanukkah specialty — and buñuelos, And the mariachi band took a crack at playing the Jewish folk song 'Hava Nagila.' 'What really brings us together is our shared values — our faith, our families, our heritage,' said Erica Winsor, public affairs officer for the Jewish Federation of Greater Houston. Rabbi Peter Tarlow, executive director of the Houston-based Center for Latino-Jewish Relations, said the first Chicanukah event 12 years ago drew 20 people, while this year the crowd numbered about 300, and could have been larger had not attendance been capped. He said the party-goers were a roughly even mix of Latinos — some of them Jews with Latin American origins — and 'Anglo' Jews. 'There’s too much hate, too much separation against both Jews and Latinos,' Tarlow said. 'This is a way we can come together and show we support each other.' While Hanukkah is intended as an upbeat, celebratory holiday, rabbis note that it’s taking place this year amid continuing conflicts involving Israeli forces in the Middle East, and apprehension over widespread incidents of antisemitism. Rabbi Moshe Hauer, executive vice president of the Orthodox Union, acknowledged that many Jews may be feeling anxious heading into Hanukkah this year. But he voiced confidence that most would maintain the key tradition: the lighting of candles on menorah candelabras and displaying where they’re visible through household windows and in public spaces. 'The posture of our community — without stridency, just with determination — is that the menorah should be in our windows, in a place where the public sees it,' Hauer said. 'It is less for us, the Jewish community, than for the world,' he added. 'We have to share that light. Putting the menorah in the window is our expression of working to be a light among the nations.' Hauer concurred with Stanton that this year’s overlap of Hanukkah and Christmas is 'an exceptional opportunity to see and experience the diversity of America and the diversity of its communities of faith.' Rabbi Motti Seligson, public relations director for the Hasidic movement Chabad-Lubavitch, noted that this year marks the 50th anniversary of a milestone in the public lightings of menorahs. It was on Dec. 8, 1974 — as part of an initiative launched by the Lubavitcher leader, Rabbi Menachem M. Schneerson — that a menorah was lit outside Philadelphia’s Independence Hall, where the Liberty Bell was housed at the time. 'Hanukkah is a celebration of religious liberty, so that it’s not taken for granted,' Seligson said. 'One of the ways of doing that is by celebrating it publicly.' He said Chabad was organizing about 15,000 public menorah lightings this year through its numerous branches around the world. 'There certainly is some apprehension,' Seligson said, referring to concerns about antisemitism and political friction. 'Some people question whether Jews will be celebrating as openly as in the past.' 'What I’m hearing is there’s no way that we can’t,' he added. 'The only way through these difficult times is by standing stronger and prouder and shining brighter than ever.' Stanton concurred. 'Through our history, we’ve been through moments that are easy and moments that are hard,' he said. 'Safety for us does not come from hiding. It comes from reaching out.' Why is Hanukkah so late this year? The simple answer is that the Jewish calendar is based on lunar cycles, and is not in sync with the Gregorian calendar which sets Christmas on Dec. 25. Hanukkah always begins on the 25th day of the Jewish month of Kislev, a date which occurs between late November and late December on the Gregorian calendar. The last time Hanukkah began on Christmas Day was in 2005. But the term 'Chrismukkah' — signifying the overlap of the two holidays — had become a popular term before then. The term gained extra currency in 2003, when the character Seth Cohen on the TV drama 'The O.C.' embraced the fusion holiday as a tribute to his Jewish father and Protestant mother. This season, the Hallmark Channel introduced a new Christmas movie called 'Leah’s Perfect Gift,' depicting a young Jewish woman who had admired Christmas from a distance, and gets a chance to experience it up close when her boyfriend invites her to spend the holidays with his family. Spoiler alert: All does not go smoothly. Despite such storylines suggesting a fascination with Christmas among some Jews, Stanton says research by the Jewish Federations reveals a surge in Jews seeking deeper connections to their own traditions and community, as well as a surge in Jews volunteering for charitable activities during the holidays. 'The opportunity is to share with others how we celebrate Hanukkah,' he said. 'It’s a holiday of freedom, hope, showing proudly you are Jewish.' ___ Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

13 people including children die in stampedes in Nigeria at Christmas charity events	ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) — At least 13 people, including four children, were killed in two separate stampedes in Nigeria as large crowds gathered to collect food and clothing items distributed at annual Christmas events, the police said Saturday. The two accidents came days after another such stampede in Africa’s most populous country, amid a growing trend by local organizations, churches and individuals to organize charity events ahead of Christmas, as the country struggles with the worst cost-of-living crisis in a generation. Ten people were killed in the first stampede in the early hours at the Holy Trinity Catholic Church in Maitama, an upmarket part of the capital, Abuja, police spokesman Josephine Adeh said in a statement, adding that more than 1,000 people have been evacuated from the church. There was a crowd surge at one of the church gates, as dozens tried to enter the premises at around 4 a.m., hours before the gift items were to be shared, witnesses said, pointing out that some had been waiting since the previous night. 'The way they were rushing to enter, some people were falling and some of them were old,' Loveth Inyang, a witness. Inyang said he managed to rescue one baby as his mother struggled in the surge. Three people died in a similar crush later in the southeastern Anambra state's Okija town at a charity event organized by a philanthropist, the state police said. 'The event had not even started when the rush began,' police spokesman Tochukwu Ikenga said. There could be more deaths recorded as officers investigate the incident, he said. Viral footage that appeared to be from the Abuja scene showed lifeless bodies lying on the ground as people shouted for help. Some of the injured have been treated and discharged while others continue to receive medical care, police said. The church canceled the charity event with bags of rice and clothing items still arranged within the premises. As the church held a marriage ceremony after the crowd was evacuated, the agony and sadness remained palpable even as families and friends gathered for wedding pictures. Nigeria's President Bola Tinubu expressed his sympathy with the victims' families and asked states and relevant authorities to enforce strict crowd control measures. The recent stampedes in Nigeria have raised questions about safety measures in such events. Several children were killed on Wednesday this week when a local foundation organized a well-attended funfair to distribute gift items and food to kids in southwestern Oyo state. After the latest disaster, the police in Abuja announced that prior permission must be obtained before such charity events are organized. The current economic hardship under Nigerian President Bola Tinubu, who promised 'renewed hope' when he was sworn into office in May 2023, is blamed on surging inflation that is at a 28-year high and the government’s economic policies that have pushed the local currency to record low against the dollar. Frustration over the cost-of-living crisis has led to mass protests in recent months. In August, at least 20 people were shot dead and hundreds of others were arrested at protests demanding better opportunities and jobs for young people.	https://apnews.com/article/nigeria-stampede-christmas-406a2e4839c579ed07462a7780de9c42	2024-12-21T04:36:40-08:00	
What to know about Hanukkah and how it's celebrated around the world	Hanukkah — also spelled Chanukah or other transliterations from Hebrew — is Judaism’s 'festival of lights.' On eight consecutive nightfalls, Jews gather with family and friends to light one additional candle in the menorah — a multibranched candelabra. In Hebrew, Hanukkah means 'dedication,' and the holiday marks the rededication of the Temple in Jerusalem in the 2nd century BC, after a small group of Jewish fighters liberated it from occupying foreign forces. With the tiny supply of ritually pure oil that they found in the temple, they lit the menorah — and it stayed lit for eight days. The ritual of lighting a nightly candle, as well as the emphasis on cooking foods in oil such as potato pancakes called latkes, memorialize this miraculously long-lasting oil. When is Hanukkah 2024? The dates of the holiday are based on Hebrew month of Kislev, which usually coincides with November-December in the Gregorian calendar. This year, Hanukkah will be celebrated from Dec. 25, 2024, through Jan. 2, 2025. It's only the fifth time since 1900 that Hanukkah has fallen on Christmas Day. Why is Hanukkah so late this year? The simple answer is that the Jewish calendar is based on lunar cycles, and is not in sync with the Gregorian calendar which sets Christmas on Dec. 25. Hanukkah always begins on the 25th day of the Jewish month of Kislev, a date which occurs between late November and late December on the Gregorian calendar. Does Hanukkah observance vary? Jews across the religious observance spectrum — from Reform to Conservative to Orthodox — focus on the same theme of bringing light into the darkness and emphasizing that even a small, against-the-odds effort can have a transforming effect. For this reason, even though the Talmud reflects a dispute over the order of lighting, most start with one candle and increase the lighting by one more candle each night while reciting or chanting special blessings. The candles are added from right to left, but lit from left to right on the menorah, thus always starting with the newest light. The special menorah used for Hanukkah has eight branches, with a ninth place for the candle called shamash from which all others are lit. The tradition calls for candles with a real flame, though some also use electric ones in public displays, such as in hospitals, for safety reasons. How is Hanukkah celebrated? A menorah is lit in each household and traditionally is placed where it can be seen from the outside, such as a doorway or windowsill, to symbolize the spreading of God’s light to all nations. The lighting of menorahs in city streets and parks has become more prominent in recent years in countries around the world, including in front of public landmarks. In addition to menorah lightings, giving to charity and social works are also part of the celebration for many, reflecting the belief that the Jewish people are called by God to help make the world better for all. ___ Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

France's Mayotte struggles to recover as cyclone overwhelms hospitals	MAMOUDZOU, Mayotte (AP) — A week after its worst cyclone in nearly a century, France’s impoverished Indian Ocean territory of Mayotte is still grappling to count the dead, restore essential services and aid a beleaguered population. Already stretched thin, hospitals are overwhelmed with patients suffering not only from cyclone-related injuries but dehydration, malnutrition and disease. At Mayotte’s main hospital in the capital, Mamoudzou, doctors face a cascade of crises. 'We lost 40% of patient rooms, about 50 to 60 beds,' said Dr. Roger Serhal, chief of the obstetrics and gynecology department. 'There are so many patients coming to the hospital, and we don’t have space to admit them.' As Cyclone Chido battered the archipelago last weekend and 220 kph (136 mph) winds howled around the hospital, Serhal and his team delivered three babies, including by cesarean section. The hospital’s structural damage has forced staff to triage patients, prioritizing the most severe cases. Thirty-five people have been confirmed dead as of Friday in Mayotte but French Health Minister Geneviève Darrieussecq has warned that any estimates were likely major undercounts 'compared to the scale of the disaster.' The storm has devastated entire neighborhoods and many people had ignored warnings, thinking the storm wouldn’t be so extreme. Even worse, many migrants avoided shelters out of fear of deportation, authorities said, adding there could be hundreds or possibly thousands of fatalities. Doctors fear that the lack of clean water and electricity — compounded by overcrowded living conditions — is setting the stage for a health crisis. 'Patients are coming because their illnesses are untreated, there’s no water, and no electricity. We’re concerned about epidemics, like the cholera outbreak we stopped just months ago,' said Dr. Vincent Gilles, the hospital’s emergency medical director. The hospital staff continues to work tirelessly, but resources are running dangerously low. 'If we have rain,' Serhal added, 'it will be catastrophic.' Among the patients struggling to recover was Saindou Mohamadi, 54, who fractured his arm and sprained his ankle during the storm that left his home completely destroyed. Speaking from his hospital bed, Mohamadi expressed despair for his family. 'My mother is sick, I’m sick, and my child is sick,' he said. 'They need to eat, but I’m the one who takes care of the food, and now we have nothing.' With six children to support, Mohamadi is among countless residents left homeless and destitute. 'I’m not alone,' he said. 'There are many of us who have lost everything — our houses, our food. I want the government to care about us, to give us food and a place to sleep.' Mayotte is a densely populated archipelago between Madagascar and the African continent of more than 320,000 people, but authorities have estimated another 100,000 migrants live there from as far away as Somalia. France’s poorest overseas territory long struggled with systemic neglect and underinvestment. Around 75% of its population lives in poverty, and the archipelago’s infrastructure was ill-equipped to withstand a disaster of this magnitude. Chido’s destruction has compounded these challenges, leaving many residents with little faith in the government’s ability to provide timely and adequate relief. Efforts to deliver emergency aid, including airlifts of water and food, are underway but the scale of the need is staggering. Mayotte’s airport remains closed to civilian flights due to damage, further complicating logistics. French President Emmanuel Macron, during his visit on Friday, acknowledged the gravity of the situation and pledged to rebuild but faced criticism from residents frustrated by the slow pace of aid. France's Interior Ministry estimated that 70% of the population has been gravely affected, with many left homeless and vulnerable. ___ Adamson reported from Paris.	https://apnews.com/article/france-mayotte-cyclone-hospitals-284271ed0dcf66626533df49e9dfb23f	2024-12-21T02:25:11-08:00	
Cyprus can help rid Syria of chemical weapons and search for its missing, Cypriot top diplomat says	NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) — Cyprus stands ready to help eliminate Syria’s remaining chemical weapons stockpiles and to support a search for people whose fate remains unknown after more than a decade of war, the top Cypriot diplomat said Saturday. Foreign Minister Constantinos Kombos said Cyprus’ offer is grounded on its own past experience both with helping rid Syria of chemical weapons 11 years ago and its own ongoing, decades-old search for hundreds of people who disappeared amid fighting between Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriots in the 1960s and a 1974 Turkish invasion. Cyprus in 2013 hosted the support base of a mission jointly run by the United Nations and the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) to remove and dispose of Syria's chemical weapons. 'As a neighboring country located just 65 miles from Syria, Cyprus has a vested interest in Syria’s future. Developments there will directly impact Cyprus, particularly in terms of potential new migratory flows and the risks of terrorism and extremism,' Kombos told The Associated Press in written replies to questions. Kombos said there are 'profound concerns' among his counterparts across the region over Syria’s future security, especially regarding a possible resurgence of extremist groups like Islamic State in a fragmented and polarized society. Other challenges include new migratory flows from the country as well as ensuring the safety and rights of women and minorities including Druze, Christians, Jews and Kurds, so that the 'rich mosaic of Syria is preserved.' 'This is particularly critical in light of potential social and demographic engineering disguised as 'security' arrangements, which could further destabilize the country,' Kombos said. The diplomat also pointed to the recent proliferation of narcotics production like the stimulant Captagon that is interconnected with smuggling networks involved in people and arms trafficking. Kombos said ongoing attacks against Syria’s Kurds must stop immediately, given the role that Kurdish forces have played in combating extremist forces like the IS group in the past decade. A Syrian-led process transitioning the country to an inclusive democracy should integrate the Kurds’ 'legitimate asks' while safeguarding the country’s unity and territorial integrity. Saleh Muslim, a member of the Kurdish Presidential Council, said in an interview that the Kurds primarily seek 'equality' enshrined in rights accorded to all in any democracy. He said a future form of governance could accord autonomy to the Kurds under some kind of federal structure. 'But the important thing is to have democratic rights for all the Syrians and including the Kurdish people,' he said. Muslim warned that the Kurdish-majority city of Kobani, near Syria’s border with Turkey, is in 'very big danger' of falling into the hands of Turkish-backed forces, and accused Turkey of trying to occupy it. Kombos said the international community needs to ensure that the influence Turkey is trying to exert in Syria is 'not going to create an even worse situation than there already is.' 'Whatever the future landscape in Syria, it will have a direct and far-reaching impact on the region, the European Union and the broader international community,' Kombos said.	https://apnews.com/article/cyprus-syria-chemical-weapons-missing-35f2f3eee23785b25d01bb016ed2720d	2024-12-21T01:24:59-08:00	
Ukrainian drones strike deep into Russian territory, hundreds of miles from the front line	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukraine brought the war into the heart of Russia Saturday morning with drone attacks that local authorities said damaged residential buildings in the city of Kazan in the Tatarstan region, over 600 miles (1,000 kilometers) from the front line. The press service of Tatarstan's governor, Rustam Minnikhanov, said that eight drones attacked the city. Six hit residential buildings, one hit an industrial facility and one was shot down over a river, the statement said. A video posted on local Telegram news channel Astra, verified by The Associated Press, shows a drone flying into the upper floors of a high-rise building. Local authorities said there were no casualties. Flights were halted at Kazan’s airport and all mass gatherings canceled on Saturday and Sunday. The attacks, which Ukraine didn’t acknowledge in keeping with its security policy, comes after a Ukrainian attack Friday on a town in Russia’s Kursk border region using U.S.-supplied missiles killed six people, including a child. Moscow sent 113 drones into Ukraine overnight into Saturday, Ukrainian officials said. According to Ukraine’s Air Force, 57 drones were shot down during the attacks. A further 56 drones were 'lost,' likely having been electronically jammed. The governor of Ukraine's Kharkiv region, Oleh Syniehubov, said eight people were wounded Friday night in drone attacks on the regional capital, also called Kharkiv.	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-drones-kazan-d235822b758fd4f3540270bc324a7b77	2024-12-20T23:30:09-08:00	
A rocket fired from Yemen strikes an area of Tel Aviv overnight, lightly injuring 16 people	TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — A rocket fired from Yemen hit an area of Tel Aviv overnight, leaving 16 people slightly injured by shattered glass from nearby windows, the Israeli military said Saturday. A further 14 people sustained minor injuries as they rushed to shelters when air raid sirens sounded before the projectile hit just before 4 a.m. Saturday, the military said. The Houthis later issued a statement on their Telegram channel saying they had aimed at a military target, which they did not identify, with a hypersonic ballistic missile. The attack comes less than two days after a series of Israeli airstrikes on Yemen’s Houthi rebel-held capital, Sanaa, and port city of Hodeida killed at least nine people. The Israeli strikes were in response to a Houthi attack in which a long-range missile hit an Israeli school building. The Houthis also claimed a drone strike targeting an unspecified military target in central Israel on Thursday. The Israeli military says the Iran-backed Houthis have launched more than 200 missiles and drones during the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza. The Houthis have also been attacking shipping in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden — attacks they say won’t stop until there is a ceasefire in Gaza. The Israeli strikes Thursday caused 'considerable damage' to the Houthi-controlled Red Sea ports 'that will lead to the immediate and significant reduction in port capacity,' United Nations spokesman Stephane Dujarric said. The port at Hodeida has been key for food shipments into Yemen in its decade-long civil war. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said both sides’ attacks risk further escalation in the region and undermine U.N. mediation efforts. Israeli strikes in Gaza claim more lives In the Gaza Strip on Saturday, mourners held the funerals of 19 people — 12 of them children — killed in Israeli strikes on Friday and overnight. One strike Friday afternoon hit a residential building in the built-up Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza, killing at least seven Palestinians, including five children and one woman, and injuring 16 others, health officials said. In Gaza City, an Israeli strike on a house overnight killed 12 people, including seven children and two women, according to Ahli hospital where the bodies were taken. Mourners gathered at the hospital in Gaza City Saturday morning. Women comforted each other as they wept over the bodies before they were carried out of the hospital. One man, stony-faced, cradled a tiny shroud-wrapped body in his arms as he carried it along the funeral procession. In the Aqsa hospital of Deir al Balah, white body bags containing those killed in Nuseirat were taken from the hospital morgue and loaded onto the back of an open truck to be taken for burial. Israel faces heavy international criticism over the unprecedented levels of civilian casualties in Gaza and questions about whether it has done enough to prevent them. Israel says it only strikes militants, and blames the Hamas militant group for civilian deaths because its fighters operate in residential areas. More than 45,200 people have been killed in the Gaza Strip since October 2023, when a Hamas attack in Israel killed about 1,200 people and triggered the devastating 14-month war in Gaza. Local health officials do not distinguish between civilians and combatants, but have said more than half of the fatalities are women and children.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-yemen-mideast-bffc2f7ae556942e2e6760720d63038c	2024-12-20T22:39:32-08:00	
Germans mourn attack on Christmas market with no answers about why	MAGDEBURG, Germany (AP) — Germans on Saturday mourned a violent attack and their shaken sense of security after a Saudi doctor intentionally drove a black BMW into a Christmas market teeming with holiday shoppers, killing at least two people, including a small child, and injuring at least 60 others. Authorities arrested a 50-year-old man at the site of the attack Friday evening and took him into custody for questioning. He has lived in Germany for nearly two decades, practicing medicine in Bernburg, about 40 kilometers (25 miles) south of Magdeburg. officials said. Several German media outlets identified the man as Taleb A., withholding his last name in line with privacy laws, and reported that he was a specialist in psychiatry and psychotherapy. Mourners lit candles and placed flowers outside a church near the market on the cold and gloomy day. Several people stopped and cried. A Berlin church choir whose members witnessed the 2016 Christmas market attack sang Amazing Grace, a hymn about God's mercy, offering their prayers and solidarity with the victims. The man behind the attack There were still no answers Saturday as to what caused him to drive into a crowd in the eastern German city of Magdeburg. Describing himself as a former Muslim, the suspect shared dozens of tweets and retweets daily focusing on anti-Islam themes, criticizing the religion and congratulating Muslims who left the faith. He also accused German authorities of failing to do enough to combat what he said was the 'Islamism of Europe.' Some described him as an activist who helped Saudi women flee their homeland. He has also voiced support for the far-right and anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. Recently, he seemed focused on his theory that German authorities have been targeting Saudi asylum seekers. Prominent German terrorism expert Peter Neumann said he had yet to come across a suspect in an act of mass violence with that profile. 'After 25 years in this ‘business’ you think nothing could surprise you anymore. But a 50-year-old Saudi ex-Muslim who lives in East Germany, loves the AfD and wants to punish Germany for its tolerance towards Islamists — that really wasn’t on my radar, ' Neumann, the director of the International Centre for the Study of Radicalization and Political Violence at King’s College London, wrote on X. The two people confirmed dead were an adult and a toddler, but officials said additional deaths couldn’t be ruled out because 15 people had been seriously injured. 'As things stand, he is a lone perpetrator, so that as far as we know there is no further danger to the city,' Saxony-Anhalt’s governor, Reiner Haseloff, told reporters. 'Every human life that has fallen victim to this attack is a terrible tragedy and one human life too many.' Magdeburg is still shaken The violence shocked Germany and the city, bringing its mayor to the verge of tears and marring a festive event that’s part of a centuries-old German tradition. It prompted several other German towns to cancel their weekend Christmas markets as a precaution and out of solidarity with Magdeburg’s loss. Berlin kept its markets open but has increased its police presence at them. Germany has suffered a string of extremist attacks in recent years, including a knife attack that killed three people and wounded eight at a festival in the western city of Solingen in August. Magdeburg is a city of about 240,000 people, west of Berlin, that serves as Saxony-Anhalt’s capital. Friday’s attack came eight years after an Islamic extremist drove a truck into a crowded Christmas market in Berlin, killing 13 people and injuring many others. The attacker was killed days later in a shootout in Italy. Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Interior Minister Nancy Faeser traveled to Magdeburg on Saturday, and a memorial service is to take place in the city cathedral in the evening. A recount of the horrifying attack Verified bystander footage distributed by the German news agency dpa showed the suspect’s arrest at a tram stop in the middle of the road. A nearby police officer pointing a handgun at the man shouted at him as he lay prone, his head arched up slightly. Other officers swarmed around the suspect and took him into custody. Thi Linh Chi Nguyen, a 34-year-old manicurist from Vietnam whose salon is located in a mall across from the Christmas market, was on the phone during a break when she heard loud bangs and thought at first they were fireworks. She then saw a car drive through the market at high speed. People screamed and a child was thrown into the air by the car. Shaking as she described the horror of what she witnessed, she recalled seeing the car bursting out of the market and turning right onto Ernst-Reuter-Allee street and then coming to a standstill at the tram stop where the suspect was arrested. The number of injured people was overwhelming. 'My husband and I helped them for two hours. He ran back home and grabbed as many blankets as he could find because they didn’t have enough to cover the injured people. And it was so cold,' she said. The market itself was still cordoned off Saturday with red-and-white tape and police vans every 50 meters (about 54 yards). Police with machine pistols guarded every entry to the market. Some thermal security blankets still lay on the street. Christmas markets are a German holiday tradition cherished since the Middle Ages, now successfully exported to much of the Western world. Saudi Arabia’s foreign ministry condemned the attack on X. ___ Aboubakr reported from Cairo and Gera from Warsaw, Poland.	https://apnews.com/article/germany-christmas-market-attack-magdeburg-32ec923f21cccb2a34e287da42ced921	2024-12-20T22:18:27-08:00	
AP PHOTOS: Scenes of devastation from the aftermath of the Indian Ocean tsunami	On Dec. 26, 2004, a 9.1 magnitude earthquake struck off the west coast of Sumatra, causing a massive wave that devastated Asian coastal communities across thousands of miles. Some 230,000 people died as the tsunami leveled remote villages, ports and tourist resorts in Indonesia, Thailand, India and Sri Lanka, among other countries. Ahead of the 20th anniversary of a disaster that's still vividly remembered in the region, here's a look back at the aftermath. In these photos, a resident of a fishing village in India's Tamil Nadu state contemplates the remains of her house as fires continue to burn in her village. In Thailand, dozens of bodies are lined up at a Buddhist temple, and a young Swedish boy carries a sign listing family members he hasn't seen since they were swept out to sea from their beachfront hotel. In Sri Lanka, villagers search for the dead among derailed train cars, lighting fires to cremate those they find. And in Aceh, Indonesia, the worst-hit area nearest the quake's epicenter, people search for survivors and food in towns that have been largely reduced to rubble. Today, many coastal communities have rebuilt, and new early warning systems are in place that could give people time to get to shelter. But the true toll of these events will never be known for certain.	https://apnews.com/article/indian-ocean-tsunami-anniversary-photo-gallery-65a5fdaeed08d68336523e7e4a4835a2	2024-12-20T20:01:20-08:00	
Sectarian violence in Syria has been less intense than feared since Assad's ouster	DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) — The toppling of Bashar Assad has raised tentative hopes that Syrians might live peacefully and as equals after a half century of authoritarian rule. While there have been bursts of deadly sectarian violence in the days since Assad was ousted, it’s nothing close to what was feared after nearly 14 years of civil war. Much credit for the relative calm so far is being given to the Islamic militant group that led the insurgency against Assad and is helping to rebuild the country and unite its many factions. The group — Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS — had ties to al-Qaida, but it has vowed not to discriminate against any religion or ethnicity, and it has denounced revenge killings. In the days since Assad’s fall, dozens of Syrians have been killed in acts of revenge, according to activists and experts who monitor Syria. The vast majority have been from the minority Alawite community, an offshoot of Shia Islam that the Assad family adheres to. Given the key role Alawites played in Assad's brutally repressive government, experts had expected sectarian violence to be more widespread. But HTS has worked to reduce tensions in villages where revenge killings — as well as looting and harassment — have taken place, according to local activists. Whether peace and pluralism will prevail longer-term remains to be seen, experts caution. 'The extent of the reprisals has been quite limited,' said Hilal Khashan, a political science professor at the American University of Beirut. 'We hope this violence will not escalate, leading to an outburst of civil strife.' During the Assad family’s 50 years of iron-fisted rule, Alawites held many top positions in the military and in the intelligence and security services, which ran prisons where thousands of people accused of anti-government activities were tortured and killed, according to human rights groups. The interim government led by HTS has vowed to gather evidence and hold trials in a special court against former officials who oversaw, or worked in, Assad's notorious prisons. It has also promised amnesty for other government workers and former members of the military, some of whom have started handing in their weapons. 'If we want to establish social peace there must be justice, and there is no justice without accountability,' said Obeida Arnaout, a spokesman for the interim government. 'Those who have blood on their hands will get no amnesty.' The interim government has urged reconciliation among the country’s different ethnic factions — mainly Arabs and Kurds — and mutual respect among its religious groups. Three-quarters of Syria's 23 million citizens are Sunnis, one-tenth are Alawites, and the rest are a mix of Christians, Ismaili Shiites and Druze. Under Assad, Syrians enjoyed religious and other freedoms. Men and women mingled freely at beaches and other public places; restaurants served alcoholic beverages; and women held senior posts in government. Now that power resides in the hands of HTS, many Syrians — as well as Western governments and human rights groups — are concerned the country could be transformed into a theocracy. So far, the HTS-led coalition has not imposed any strict religious rules, such as forcing women to wear veils, and it has allowed journalists from around the world to report freely. Over years of control in the northwest Syrian province of Idlib, HTS allowed Christians and Druze to practice without interference. HTS is led by a former al-Qaida member who has renounced extremism and spent years working to remake his public image, depicting himself as a champion of pluralism and tolerance. Still, the United States, other Western countries and the U.N. still consider HTS a terrorist organization — a branch of al-Qaida in Syria, but with a different name. One of the top priorities of HTS and its leader – Ahmad al-Sharaa -- is to get the terror designation removed, which could then lead to economic sanctions against Syria being lifted. U.S. officials say al-Sharaa’s public statements about protecting minority and women’s rights are welcomed. But they are skeptical he will follow through on them in the long run. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said last weekend that the U.S. is in contact with HTS and that its 'message to the Syrian people is this: We want them to succeed and we’re prepared to help them do so.' Since Assad fled the country, at least 72 men and women have been killed in sectarian violence, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a war monitor based in Britain. It says the killings occurred in four religiously mixed provinces — Hama and Homs in central Syria, and Tartus and Latakia along its eastern coast. Gunmen stormed the village of Bahra in Hama province on Dec. 9, and killed a dozen Alawites over three days — eight of whom were from the same family, according to a resident of the village who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity out of fear of reprisals. In nearby Mouaa, six men were killed, and in Um al-Amad, a man and his son were shot dead, the resident of Bahra said. The three villages are now almost empty after the most residents fled to the Alawite heartland, in the coastal province of Tartus, the Bahra resident said. 'The reason why I am speaking is to try stop the killings,' he said. In the Assad stronghold of Masyaf, gunmen last week kidnapped Muhieddine al-Haybe, the brother of a Shiite cleric who fled the town in Hama province shortly after the fall of Assad’s government, according to an anti-Assad activist who would only provide his first name, Hussein, out of concern for his safety. He said al-Haybe's body and three other unidentified dead bodies were later found near a military post. A third person from the area said the situation was tense for days until HTS hosted a meeting over the weekend that brought together Sunni and Alawite dignitaries from nearby villages, including Rabia, Tizin, Metnine and Mouaa. By the end of the meeting, the participants reconciled and agreed to end any acts of violence, according to this person, who is Alawite and insisted on anonymity out of fear. 'We were also the victims of the regime,' the person said, adding that the Assad government did not offer civilian jobs to Alawites, which put pressure on them to join the military and security services. The man said his house was looted and his six cows were stolen. There have been reports of al-Sharaa himself trying to keep the peace among Syria’s many factions. Syrian media reported that he met in Damascus on Monday with a delegation from the Druze community and told them that his goal was to unite Syria and create a free society. Some Syrians say there might have been more sectarian violence in the aftermath of Assad's ouster had his forces mounted a serious fight against HTS and other militants behind the insurgency. Instead, Assad's army essentially melted away and chose not to defend his government. 'We are witnessing some sectarian incidents, but they are all individuals acts,' said Rayan Maarouf, an anti-Assad activist who is a member of Syria's Druze minority in the southern city of Sweida. ___ Associated Press writer Sarah El Deeb contributed from Damascus.	https://apnews.com/article/syria-religion-revenge-killings-peace-alawites-6fef01639ed9833f9421c1a88abc61cf	2024-12-20T20:00:05-08:00	
Indonesians mark 2 decades since the tragic tsunami that killed hundreds of thousands	BANDA ACEH, Indonesia (AP) — Two decades after a catastrophic tsunami destroyed her village, Tria Asnani still cries when she recalls how she lost her mother while trying to escape the giant waves. Asnani, now a school teacher, was only 17 at the time. Her father, who was a fisherman, never returned home from sea. She doesn't know how she survived. 'I cannot swim. I could only rely on dhikr (Islamic prayer).' On Dec. 26, 2004, a powerful 9.1-magnitude earthquake off the coast of the Indonesian island of Sumatra triggered a tsunami that killed around 230,000 people across a dozen countries, reaching as far as East Africa. But Indonesia’s Aceh province, located closest to the earthquake’s epicenter and with 18 of 23 districts and cities located in the coastal line in the Northern side of Sumatra, bore the brunt of the disaster with more than half of the total death toll reported. The worst-hit areas were in Aceh Besar and Banda Aceh, according to the Aceh Disaster Management Agency. Asnani's Lampuuk village lies in a fishermen’s community in Aceh Besar, known for its white sandy beaches and turquoise waters. However, on that day, it was among the hardest hit, with waves more than 30 meters (98 feet) high which changed the coastline in Aceh and led to land subsidence after the earthquake. Buildings by the coast were flattened to the ground except for Rahmatullah Mosque, 500 meters (1,600 feet) from the shore, and about 1 kilometer (0.6 miles) from Asnani’s house. The photo of the place of worship, left pretty much unscathed, later became iconic. After the disastrous event, thousands, including Asnani, had to relocate to start afresh. She moved with her uncle to another region in Aceh to continue her studies. After she got married, she returned in 2007 to her parents' house which was rebuilt with assistance from the Turkish government and lived there for 10 years. Many international donors and organizations poured in money to help rebuild the affected areas that lost schools, hospitals and basic infrastructure, made stronger than before the tsunami hit. Tsunami and Disaster Mitigation Research Center at Syiah Kuala University in Aceh recorded more than 1,400 wrecked schools and about 150,000 students had their education process disrupted by the destructive waves in a report published in 2019. Three 'escape buildings' were also constructed in a relatively safer area to accommodate thousands of people if an earthquake and tsunami strike. Across the province, memories of the tsunami can be felt almost everywhere. The Aceh Tsunami Museum in Banda Aceh houses photos of the aftermath and vehicle debris, serving as a constant reminder of what was lost that day. Local authorities have also turned a former floating diesel-powered power plant barge that washed about 6 kilometers (about 4 miles) inland by the tsunami into another memorial place. Both places have become the most popular tourist destinations in the area. But development never stops and 20 years after the tsunami the Aceh coast is brimming with residential housing, cafes and restaurants, as well as tourism support facilities, while the hills in some areas from which people are currently being mined for sand and stone. Fazli, the head of Preparedness in Aceh Disaster Management Agency, said that the government initially stipulated that there should be no activity up to 1 kilometer (0.6 miles) from the coast. Over time, many displaced fishermen returned to their original coastal homes, drawn by their livelihoods and ties to the sea, despite having received housing elsewhere. He also said the agency has 'provided the Acehnese people with information ' to deal with a potential tsunami. 'People already know what to do,' said Fazli, who, like other Indonesians, uses a single name. Siti Ikramatoun, a sociologist in Banda Aceh, said that despite years of recovery and rebuilding, the people of Aceh must stay vigilant. 'If people experienced (the tsunami), they may have an instinct to anticipate it. But those who do not have the experience, they won’t get what to do,' Ikramatoun said. Various communities in Aceh commemorate the tsunami yearly along with the government and local authorities. In Banda Aceh, art communities in early December spread disaster awareness through theatrical or musical performances that can be easier for people to follow and target all groups, including those born after the tsunami. Muslina, 43, a civil servant, took her youngest son to the Aceh Tsunami Museum to watch one of the shows. She lost relatives and loved ones 20 years ago and she wants to make sure she always remembers them. 'Earlier my son asked me if there might be another tsunami when he grows up,' she said. 'I told him I do not know. Only God knows, but if there is a strong earthquake and the seawater recedes, we run, run, run to find higher ground.'	https://apnews.com/article/indonesia-aceh-indian-ocean-tsunami-earthquake-2004-d62f2c5590fb8427e97ffa1b81dc09d5	2024-12-20T17:07:53-08:00	
Guatemala authorities raid ultra-orthodox Jewish sect's compound after report of abuse	GUATEMALA CITY (AP) — Guatemalan authorities searched the compound of an extremist ultra-orthodox Jewish sect Friday, taking at least 160 minors and 40 women into protective custody after reports of abuse. Interior Minister Francisco Jiménez said the National Civil Police and members of military participated in the raid on the Lev Tahor group’s community about 55 miles (90 kilometers) southeast of the capital. 'The protection of boys and girls is an absolute priority,' Jiménez said. Guatemala’s Attorney General’s Office said in a statement on the social platform X that suspected bones of one child were found. The office said a complaint was made in November of possible crimes including forced pregnancies, mistreatment of minors and rape. The sect has run into legal problems in various countries. In 2022, Mexican authorities arrested a leader of the sect near the Guatemalan border and removed a number of women and children from their compound. In 2021, two leaders of the group were convicted of kidnapping and child sexual exploitation crimes in New York. They allegedly kidnapped two children from their mother to return a 14-year-old girl to an illegal sexual relationship with an adult male. The sect is known to have members in Canada, the United States, Mexico, Guatemala and Israel.	https://apnews.com/article/guatemala-lev-tahor-mexico-abuse-a9cf9d57fab3c71831efec23c9139a99	2024-12-20T15:02:00-08:00	
AP PHOTOS: Cyclone Chido's devastation of Mayotte was immediate and decades coming	The devastation from Cyclone Chido that shattered corrugated metal shacks and thousands of lives on the island of Mayotte was both immediate and long coming. Residents of Mayotte, one of 12 tiny overseas territories remaining from one of the great global empires, have complained for decades of neglect by bureaucrats in France. Authorities have confirmed 35 deaths from Cyclone Chido’s landfall Sunday, but fear hundreds or thousands may be dead. The shacks of corrugated metal stood no chance in the Kaweni slum on the outskirts of the capital, Mamoudzou, where residents are still taking stock of their shattered lives. Mayotte, the poorest place in the European Union, has struggled to care for migrants from the nearby independent Comoros islands. They have been moving to Mayotte — the only part of the Comoros that voted to remain part of France in a 1974 referendum — and last year, the government mobilized 2,000 troops and police to carry out mass expulsions, destroy slums and eradicate gangs. This week, survivors lined up to collect water. Once among the island’s rare riches — with rivers and springs nestled between mountains and forests — water has grown scare as mismanagement and climate change have taken their toll. Mayotte has had its driest year since 1997, according to the national weather service. Even before Chico, indoor plumbing only worked from 4 p.m. to 10 a.m. once every three days on an island territory of about 350,000 people. Women rested Thursday on a footbridge over a stream filled with debris in the Kaweni slum after families rushed to prepare food, wash dishes, clean their homes and anything else involving water. Those living in neighborhoods without plumbing lined up at public taps with buckets, plastic jerrycans, reused bottles — anything to collect water. Then for 48 hours, they were dry again.	https://apnews.com/article/mayotte-cyclone-photos-dad1e05aea1ec1de518fec9b2b0fbef1	2024-12-20T13:40:15-08:00	
Oregon sheriff concerned about letters asking people to track possible immigrants	LINCOLN CITY, Ore. (AP) — A sheriff in Oregon says he has contacted the FBI and is increasingly concerned about a letter circulating in his rural, coastal community asking people to write down the license plate numbers of possible immigrants. The Lincoln County Sheriff’s Office issued a news release on Thursday condemning the letters that have appeared across the county, describing them as divisive. Sheriff Curtis Landers told KPTV that he contacted federal authorities after receiving such a letter himself. The FBI said Friday it was aware of the mailings. In a statement, it encouraged community members who feel physically threatened to report their concerns to law enforcement. The letter tells the recipient to be on alert while sitting in their church parking lot or waiting in line to pick up their children at school, so as to write down the license plate numbers of cars believed to belong to immigrants who might lack permanent legal status. The sheriff's office said it was committed to upholding Oregon’s sanctuary law, which prohibits local police in most cases from inquiring about an individual’s immigration or citizenship status and sharing that information with federal authorities. 'We are encouraging our community members to do the right thing and use compassion as we encounter these types of messages,' the sheriff’s office said in its news release. 'We strongly advise against engaging in activities such as those outlined in this letter, including collecting or sharing information about individuals based on their demographic or perceived immigration status.' Oregon Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum similarly condemned the letters. 'Attempts to intimidate our communities and their leaders through racist letter writing campaigns has no place in Oregon, and we will continue to stand together in opposition to those who seek to divide us,' she said in a statement Friday. The Associated Press emailed the sheriff’s office on Friday, requesting comment and asking about the number and distribution method of the letters. When reached by phone, the sheriff’s office said Landers and its spokesperson were both out of the office and unable to respond to calls or emails that day. Landers received a copy of the letter in his mailbox, according to KPTV. Elsewhere in the county, the mayor and city councilors of the small town of Toledo and the mayor of Lincoln City also received copies in the mail, KGW reported. In response to Trump’s vows to conduct mass deportations during his second term, advocacy groups across the country have hosted know-your-rights trainings to teach immigrants how to protect themselves and their loved ones. The trainings are underway in immigrant-friendly states including California and Illinois — which both enacted protections for immigrants in response to Trump’s focus on enforcement during his first administration — and those with more stringent laws affecting immigrants such as Florida. Meanwhile, officials in a growing number of Republican-led states are proposing to give local law officers the power to arrest people who entered the country illegally, mirroring recent laws in Texas and elsewhere that have been placed on hold while courts weigh whether they unconstitutionally usurp federal authority. Oregon became the first sanctuary state in 1987. Its law bars local and state police from participating in federal immigration enforcement without a judicial warrant, and also prohibits private immigration detention facilities from operating in the state. Oregon's sanctuary law has been updated and strengthened over the years, including in 2021, when the Legislature passed a measure creating a hotline for reporting violations of the law.	https://apnews.com/article/immigration-undocumented-letters-lincoln-city-oregon-01d1f737e8e47f56014f25d6bfaf3a4c	2024-12-20T13:13:48-08:00	
Regional court faults El Salvador for denying a mother's access to abortion, violating her rights	SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) — The Inter-American Court of Human Rights on Friday found El Salvador’s government responsible for violating the rights of a young Salvadoran woman who was denied an abortion of her anencephalic fetus in a country with a total ban on abortions. The Costa Rica-based regional court said the government was responsible for obstetric violence, health violations and violating the physical integrity of the woman who had other health issues. The court faulted a lack of protocols for high-risk pregnancies that led to her care being 'bureaucratized and judicialized' in 2013. The woman, identified only as Beatriz, had requested and was denied an abortion early in her pregnancy. The fetus died hours after delivery. The case had been brought by various organizations that demanded reparations for the woman’s family. She died after a traffic accident in 2017. El Salvador’s government had argued that the medical team had autonomy to decide the best course of treatment and to preserve the life of the fetus. The court ordered El Salvador to pay damages amounting to $75,000 to be divided among some of Beatriz’s relatives, including her surviving son. The 2013 pregnancy was Beatriz’s second. She had already been diagnosed with lupus, an autoimmune disease, and rheumatoid arthritis among other illnesses. Her first pregnancy had been complicated as well, requiring two hospitalizations for herself and a 38-day hospital stay for her baby after birth. During her second pregnancy, after the fetus was diagnosed as anencephalic — a congenital defect characterized by an underdeveloped brain and skull — a 15-person medical committee recommended her pregnancy be terminated at 14 weeks to avoid undue risks to the mother’s health, according to testimony before the court. The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, which sent the case to the court, said the response was that 'legally it (abortion) is not permitted in the country.' Morena Herrera, president of the Citizen Group for the Decriminalization of Abortion, said shortly before the decision was announced that a finding in favor of Beatriz would be 'very important for women's human rights and especially their right to health.' On the other side of the issue, Julia Regina de Cardenal, president of the Yes to Life Foundation, said she feared the decision would have a ripple effect in the region. 'What we're afraid of is that this is going to pressure not just our country to legalize abortion, but that it is going to pressure other Latin American countries too,' she said. ____ Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america	https://apnews.com/article/abortion-el-salvador-human-rights-beatriz-98cafc34eb5187c39648d49e5fe38259	2024-12-20T12:57:08-08:00	
Zambian police arrest 2 over alleged plot to bewitch President Hichilema	LUSAKA, Zambia. (AP) — Two people have been arrested for allegedly plotting to harm Zambia’s President Hakainde Hichilema using witchcraft, police said Friday. Police spokesperson Rae Hamoonga said in a statement that the two suspects, Jasten Mabulesse Candunde, 42, and Leonard Phiri, 43, were allegedly hired by Nelson Banda, the younger brother of fugitive lawmaker Jay Banda, to bewitch the president. Jay Banda escaped from police custody in August 2024 while facing charges of aggravated robbery. His whereabouts are unknown. The two suspects face charges of practicing witchcraft, possession of charms and cruelty to animals. 'The suspects were found in possession of assorted charms, including a live chameleon, and are alleged to be practicing witchdoctors,' Hamoonga said, adding that their purported mission 'was to use charms to harm the Head of State, His Excellency President Hakainde Hichilema.' The police spokesperson said the suspects disclosed that they had agreed to receive a full payment of $7,400.	https://apnews.com/article/zambia-president-arrest-witchcraft-33d02420755f02c931d7908fb6f9a282	2024-12-20T12:22:56-08:00	
Amazon Indigenous community wins latest stage of court battle for lost territory	An Indigenous community in the Peruvian Amazon is celebrating a legal victory in the latest stage of its attempt to take back claimed ancestral rainforests. The Puerto Franco community of the Kichwa tribe say their territory was stolen to form the Cordillera Azul National Park in 2001. Companies such as Shell and TotalEnergies spent tens of millions of dollars on carbon credits in the park to counter emissions from their fossil fuel operations. The Kichwas got next to nothing and were left in hunger, despite a 2022 Associated Press investigation finding that it was almost certainly their ancestral territory, by the terms of a convention Peru signed decades ago. The community celebrated a dramatic legal victory last year, when provincial Judge Simona del Socorro Torres Sánchez ruled that creating the park without their consent had violated their rights. Authorities were ordered to grant them legal ownership and proceeds from the carbon credit sales. But that was quickly overturned by an appeals court in a move that some legal experts called questionable. Judge Sánchez has now ruled once again in the Kichwas’ favor, however, making a new order that the Kichwas should get their land back and benefit from the carbon credit sales. She found the Kichwas were Indigenous, and their territorial rights counted for more than the amount of time that’s passed. The Peruvian government and a nonprofit which runs the park, CIMA, have argued that too much time has passed for the Kichwas to make a claim, and that they are not truly Indigenous people. Peruvian authorities have also argued in legal filings that the community didn’t object to the park’s creation in 2001. Kichwa leader Inocente Sangama said he was 'outraged' at the claim they were not Indigenous people. 'Who said an Indigenous person cannot wear clothes?' 'The justice system has proved us right,' he said. 'We feel pride and happiness.' The AP emailed the Peruvian government but did not immediately receive a reply. Jorge Aliaga Arauco, a director at CIMA, said by email that they would appeal the decision and were on solid evidential ground. The nonprofit says proceeds from the carbon credit project help protect the ancient rainforest, one of Peru’s most pristine and biodiverse environments. The case may be moving towards a conclusion. Juan Carlos Díaz, a constitutional lawyer at Pontifical Catholic University of Peru, told the AP that the ruling could be appealed before a superior court. If the Kichwas win there, the decision would be final, he said. Should the Kichwas lose, they would have one last right of appeal, to a Constitutional Court in Lima, but the government doesn't have that last recourse. ———- The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Gravy Day' is an Australian tradition inspired by an unlikely Christmas song by Paul Kelly	NEW YORK (AP) — To many Australians, Saturday is more than just Dec. 21. It's 'Gravy Day,' all because of a lyric in one of the most unlikely Christmas songs ever written. 'How to Make Gravy,' written by singer Paul Kelly, has become a holiday classic in Australia over the past few decades. It was cited this week by the nation's prime minister, Anthony Albanese, as he announced a decision to release five drug smugglers from prison, and is the subject of a new movie that creates a story behind the song. 'It has become our most-loved Christmas song,' Jeff Jenkins, of the Australian publication The Music, wrote this week. The story is set in a prison, the lyrics coming from a letter an inmate writes to his brother to pass along a recipe for the family's Christmas dinner. The song is about much more, though, as 'Joe' expresses regret, longing, fear, paranoia, some humor and the near-universal holiday emotion of someone who wishes to be somewhere else. The prisoner is writing, as the song says in its second line, on the 21st of December, 'and now they're ringing the last bells.' The inspiration behind ‘Gravy Day’ Kelly wrote 'How to Make Gravy' in 1996 after being asked to contribute to a holiday album being put together for charity. He wanted to record a cover of the Band's 'Christmas Must Be Tonight,' but someone else had already claimed it. So Kelly tried putting words to a melody he had kicking around. Inspiration came from one of his favorite holiday albums, 'A Christmas Gift for You from Phil Spector,' and Darlene Love's recording of the classic 'White Christmas.' Love includes writer Irving Berlin's often-bypassed first verse, where the singer talks of being in Los Angeles while wishing to be somewhere snowy and cold. 'There's a clue,' Kelly said in a TED talk explaining the song's origins, and off he went. The story of ‘Gravy Day’ In the song, 'Joe' imagines the family gathering without him. 'Who's going to make the gravy now?' he said. 'I bet it won't taste the same.' He passes along a recipe, one Kelly got in real life from a former father-in-law. The narrator asks his brother to kiss the sleeping children, and to 'give my love to Angus, and to Frank and Dolly. Tell ‘em all I’m sorry I screwed up this time.' He gossips about Mary and her new boyfriend. 'Do you remember the last one? What was his name again? What was his problem? He never did get Nina Simone.' In performance, Kelly has occasionally replaced Simone with Joey Ramone or 'a little too much cologne.' He asks Dan to look after his wife Rita, and pictures the dancing after dinner. 'Just don't hold her too close, oh brother please don't stab me in the back,' he sings, quickly catching himself to note the idle time in prison that 'turns imagination into fact.' The conclusion is a promise: 'I'm gonna pay 'em all back.' An unusual holiday song with lasting resonance Kelly's love for Shakespeare, the bard's mix of comedy and drama, is also evident in the composition. One of Kelly's first clues that he had tapped into something was a call from his real-life brother. He'd been driving and heard the song for the first time over the radio, and had to pull to the side of the road in tears. It's a holiday song without mistletoe or holly. Structurally, it doesn't have a catchy chorus, or any chorus at all. Yet as years went by, his fans would request the song in concert all year, not just the holidays. Some of them began marking Dec. 21 by leaving a can of gravy on their front porches. 'I can't predict what songs will become popular or speak to my audience,' Kelly said this fall in an interview with The Associated Press, and 'Gravy' is a prime example. The evocation of family is the song's most important ingredient. Kelly's own large family gathers each Christmas Eve to sing carols. Bella O'Grady, a 27-year-old woman who moved to New York and attended a Kelly concert in New York this fall for a taste of home, said 'How to Make Gravy' always evokes warm feelings of holiday celebrations. Sometimes very warm. While many of the song's emotions are universal, a reference in the lyrics to expected heat on Christmas Day — 'I hear it's going to be 100 degrees' — places the setting clearly in Australia. Down under, the holiday is at the beginning of summer. Gravy Day in Australia this year Prime Minister Albanese alluded to 'Gravy Day' in his decision this week to release the five men who were convicted in 2005 of smuggling heroin from Indonesia to Australia. 'Australians speak about what it's like to have someone who's a loved one — they sing the great Paul Kelly song — in jail over Christmas,' Albanese said, according to The Nightly. 'Who's going to make the gravy? Well, these families had their loved ones in jail for 20 Christmases, and that was enough.' Using the characters in Kelly's song and building a story around it, filmmaker Nick Waterman made a movie of 'How to Make Gravy' this year that is airing on the Australian streaming service Binge. It is being shown in some movie theaters free on 'Gravy Day' weekend. So what's in that gravy recipe, anyway? 'Just add flour, salt, a little red wine and don't forget a dollop of tomato sauce for sweetness and that extra tang.' It's all in the song. ____ David Bauder writes about the intersection of media and entertainment for the AP.

At least 2 dead and 60 hurt after a car drives into a German Christmas market in a suspected attack	MAGDEBURG, Germany (AP) — A car plowed into a busy outdoor Christmas market in the eastern German city of Magdeburg on Friday, killing at least two people and injuring at least 60 others in what authorities called a deliberate attack. The driver was arrested at the scene shortly after the car barreled into the market at around 7 p.m., when it was teeming with holiday shoppers looking forward to the weekend. Verified bystander footage distributed by the German news agency dpa showed the suspect’s arrest on a walkway in the middle of the road. A nearby police officer pointing a handgun at the man shouted at him as he lay prone. Other officers soon arrived to take the man into custody. The two people confirmed dead were an adult and a toddler, but officials said additional deaths couldn't be ruled out because 15 people had been seriously injured. The violence shocked the city, bringing its mayor to the verge of tears and marring a festive event that's part of a centuries-old German tradition. It also prompted several other German towns to cancel their weekend Christmas markets as a precaution. The suspect is a 50-year-old Saudi doctor who moved to Germany in 2006, Tamara Zieschang, the interior minister for the state of Saxony-Anhalt, said at a news conference. He has been practicing medicine in Bernburg, about 40 kilometers (25 miles) south of Magdeburg, she said. 'As things stand, he is a lone perpetrator, so that as far as we know there is no further danger to the city,' Saxony-Anhalt's governor, Reiner Haseloff, told reporters. 'Every human life that has fallen victim to this attack is a terrible tragedy and one human life too many.' The violence occurred in Magdeburg, a city of about 240,000 people west of Berlin that serves as Saxony-Anhalt’s capital. Friday's attack came eight years after an Islamic extremist drove a truck into crowded Christmas market in Berlin, killing 13 people and injuring many others. The attacker was killed days later in a shootout in Italy. Christmas markets are a huge part of German culture as an annual holiday tradition cherished since the Middle Ages and successfully exported to much of the Western world. In Berlin alone, more than 100 markets opened late last month and brought the smells of mulled wine, roasted almonds and bratwurst to the capital. Other markets abound across the country. German Interior Minister Nancy Faeser said late last month that there were no concrete indications of a danger to Christmas markets this year, but that it was wise to be vigilant. Hours after Friday's tragedy, the wail of sirens clashed with the market’s festive ornaments, stars and leafy garlands. Magdeburg resident Dorin Steffen told dpa that she was at a concert in a nearby church when she heard the sirens. The cacophony was so loud 'you had to assume that something terrible had happened.' She called the attack 'a dark day' for the city. 'We are shaking,' Steffen said. 'Full of sympathy for the relatives, also in the hope that nothing has happened to our relatives, friends and acquaintances.' The attack reverberated far beyond Magdeburg, with Haseloff calling it a catastrophe for the city, state and country. He said flags would be lowered to half-staff in Saxony-Anhalt and that the federal government planned to do the same. 'It is really one of the worst things one can imagine, particularly in connection with what a Christmas market should bring,' the governor said. Chancellor OIaf Scholz posted on X: 'My thoughts are with the victims and their relatives. We stand beside them and beside the people of Magdeburg.' NATO’s secretary-general and the European Commission’s president also expressed their condolences on X. Magdeburg Mayor Simone Borris, who was on the verge of tears, said officials plan to arrange a memorial at the city’s cathedral on Saturday. After a soccer match Friday evening between Bayern Munich and Leipzig, Bayern CEO Jan-Christian Dreesen asked fans at the club’s stadium to observe a minute of silence. ___ Moulson reported from Berlin.	https://apnews.com/article/germany-magdeburg-christmas-market-6b2bcf305eb9f60f8d7273949dbba4c8	2024-12-20T10:02:06-08:00	
Italian court clears Vice Premier Salvini of illegally detaining migrants on a rescue ship in 2019	ROME (AP) — A court in Sicily Friday found Italian Vice Premier Matteo Salvini not guilty of illegally detaining 100 migrants aboard a humanitarian rescue ship in 2019, when he was interior minister. The court in the city of Palermo dropped all the charges against Salvini in relation an incident in 2019, when he refused to allow the migrants to leave the Open Arms rescue ship at Italy’s southernmost island of Lampedusa. Verdicts in Italy are only considered final once all appeals are exhausted, a process that can take years. Now transport minister in Premier Giorgia Meloni’s far-right-led government, Salvini has always defended himself, saying he acted to protect Italy’s borders. 'Protecting our country's borders from smugglers is not a crime,' the leader of the right-wing League party said shortly after the verdict. 'This is a victory for the League and for Italy.' Premier Meloni also expressed her 'great satisfaction,' saying in a statement that the verdict 'shows how the accusations against Salvini were baseless and surreal.' Salvini had always stated he didn't plan to step down in case of a guilty verdict, but such an outcome would have dealt a big blow to Meloni's government. He has the strong support of the premier, other government ministers and anti-migrant European lawmakers, as well as Elon Musk, who expressed his sympathy for the Italian leader in a message on the social media platform X. During the 2019 standoff, some of the migrants threw themselves overboard in desperation as the captain pleaded for a safe port nearby. The remaining 89 people onboard were eventually allowed to disembark on Lampedusa by a court order. Salvini took a hard line against migration as interior minister from 2018-2019 in the first government of former Premier Giuseppe Conte. He refused permission for humanitarian rescue ships to dock and accused the groups that rescued migrants at sea of effectively encouraging smugglers.	https://apnews.com/article/matteo-salvini-italy-migration-trial-rescue-ship-237adf612c6a16e9ed3d3d65a0995b6a	2024-12-20T09:50:48-08:00	
Trump adds Europe to the list of US trade partners he's threatening with tariffs	WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) — President-elect Donald Trump on Friday added the 27 countries that make up the European Union to the list of trade partners he's threatening with tariffs — unless the group takes steps to import more U.S. goods. 'I told the European Union that they must make up their tremendous deficit with the United States by the large scale purchase of our oil and gas,' Trump posted shortly after 1 a.m. on social media. 'Otherwise, it is TARIFFS all the way!!!' In 2023, the United States’ trade imbalance with the EU on goods was $209 billion, according to the Census Bureau. There were $576 billion in imports from Europe and $367 billion in exports from the United States. Trump's transition team did not respond to questions seeking greater clarity on the message, which for all its bluntness was unclear on next steps. When Trump threatened Canada and Mexico with 25% tariffs in November, the leaders of both countries spoke with him to try and resolve any tensions. But the European Union lacks a single figure who can make the purchase commitments of natural gas and oil on behalf of its 27 member states that Trump is seeking. EU Commission spokesman Olof Gill said in reaction to Trump's post that 'we are ready to discuss with President-elect Trump how we can further strengthen an already strong relationship, including by discussing our common interests in the energy sector.' Gill noted that the EU is already 'committed to phasing out energy imports from Russia and diversifying our sources of supply. We’re not going to go into any details about what that might entail in the future, given that the new administration isn’t even in place yet.' Scott Lincicome, a vice president at the libertarian Cato Institute, said it was difficult to parse what Trump was trying to say relative to European trade, given that natural gas exports to the continent are already up after Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine. 'What we really need to chalk all of this up to is Trump laying the groundwork for future negotiations,' Lincicome said. 'This is for better or worse a lot of what we’re going to see for the next four years.' While there is a $209 billion trade imbalance, a more complicated relationship lies beneath those numbers. A company such as German automaker BMW can import parts needed to assemble vehicles at its factory in South Carolina, such that the trade totals also reflect the flow of goods within European companies that employ U.S. workers. More than half of the liquified natural gas imported by the EU and the United Kingdom in 2023 came from the United States, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The volume of LNG going to the EU and UK has tripled since 2021. On Tuesday, Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm issued a statement based off a new study that unfettered exports of LNG could increase prices domestically and increase carbon emissions. Trump ran for president on the idea that increased oil and natural gas production would reduce costs for U.S. voters who were left frustrated by a 2022 inflationary spike that still lingers. Trump's demands on Europe to buy more oil and natural gas were not especially new. He also made them during his initial term as president and in 2018 reached a deal with Jean-Claude Juncker, then-president of the European Commission, to sell more LNG to Europe. The problem with that agreement, as noted by the University of Pennsylvania's Kleinman Center for Energy Policy, is that the U.S. 'cannot force companies to send products to a specific region or country' and the EU cannot force its members to buy American fossil fuels. ___ Casert contributed to this report from Brussels.	https://apnews.com/article/trump-europe-trade-tariffs-natural-gas-oil-08d762fdf17a0737aa6add3c9382c4bd	2024-12-20T09:25:56-08:00	
What will Syria's future look like? The answer could lie in other Arab countries' recent pasts	CAIRO (AP) — Even with hopes running high, so much can go wrong when a country ousts a longtime dictator and tries to start anew. The Middle Eastern and North African nations that attempted to transition to democracy in recent years can attest to that. Now it's Syria's turn to try to get it right. It’s hard to draw lessons from the experiences of Tunisia, Egypt, Libya, Yemen and Sudan since the wave of Arab Spring uprisings that began in 2011, as each country’s dynamics are different, But there are common themes. In some cases, 'the Revolution' was lost when armed factions battled it out for power or an ambitious would-be strongman emerged. In others, the miliary refused to cede control to civilians or foreign countries fueled conflicts by backing one side or another with money and weapons. Questions must be asked before major decisions are made that can spark a destabilizing backlash: How do you deal with the old police state — purge or compromise? What do you do first, hold elections or write a constitution? And how do you fix a crippled economy riddled with corruption? So far, Syria’s transition has been surprisingly smooth. But it's only been two weeks since President Bashar Assad was toppled, and many of those same dangers lurk in the background. The insurgents who ousted Assad are rooted in extremist Islamist ideology, and though they have vowed to create a pluralist system, it isn't clear how or whether they plan to share power. Other armed factions — or even remnants of Assad's feared security forces — could lash out. And it remains to be seen whether the Kurds, who hold autonomous rule in the east, will be brought back into the fold, especially when Turkey fiercely opposes the main Kurdish faction. Groups such as the Alawites, to whom Assad's family belongs, fear being squeezed out of any role, or worse, being targeted for revenge. Here's a look at the power dynamics in some of these other countries: Yemen Protests forced Yemen’s Ali Abdullah Saleh to resign in November 2011, ending his 33-year rule. Under a deal brokered by Gulf countries, Saleh received immunity and handed his powers to his vice president, Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi. Hadi was to serve as caretaker president for two years, during which a new constitution would be written, leading eventually to elections. But Saleh, who remained in the capital, Sanaa, allied himself with Houthi rebels based in the north — his longtime enemy -- in a bid to regain power. Backed by Saleh’s loyalists, the Houthis seized Sanaa and much of the populated center of the country. Hadi and his government fled south, where they are based in the city of Aden and control southern and much of eastern Yemen. A Saudi-led coalition of Arab countries launched a bombardment campaign aimed at restoring Hadi’s government. Since then, Yemen has been torn by civil war that has killed more than 150,000 people and caused one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises. The war became a proxy conflict between Saudi Arabia and Iran. Yemen has remained split between the Houthis, who later broke with Saleh’s camp and killed Saleh, and Hadi’s government. Various militias nominally back Hadi but also have their own interests and are funded by the United Arab Emirates. Libya Libya’s Moammar Gadhafi met the most violent end of any of the region’s strongmen. An uprising turned into a civil war, and then with NATO backing, the rebels seized the capital, Tripoli, and killed a fleeing Gadhafi in October 2011. The oil-rich nation quickly splintered into regions controlled by a dizzying array of militias, including local and tribal groups, nationalists and mainstream Islamist factions, and diehard jihadis such as al-Qaida and the Islamic State group. Attempts to stitch it back together with elections or agreements have failed. A disputed parliamentary election in 2014 led to two rival administrations: one in the east backed by powerful military commander Khalifa Hifter, and the other in the west based in Tripoli that is backed by militias and recognized by the United Nations. Hifter tried to seize the west in 2019, triggering a 14-month war. Then, an attempt at a unity government and new elections fell apart, and once again Libya was left split between east-west governments. Foreign powers, including Russia, Turkey and the UAE, backed various sides. European countries have funneled money to the Tripoli government trying to stem the flow of migrants from Africa through Libya toward Europe, but the money has largely helped fund militias. Efforts to end the conflict remain deadlocked. Sudan In Sudan, the powerful military has thwarted attempts to transition to an elected civilian government. Pro-democracy protests prompted the military to remove strongman Omar al-Bashir in April 2019, and the generals took power for themselves. The protesters stayed in the streets, demanding a handover of power to civilians, despite a crackdown that killed hundreds. Finally, the generals agreed to a power-sharing deal with the pro-democracy alliance that led the protests. A civilian prime minister led a Cabinet backed by a council headed by two powerful generals, including one notorious for atrocities committed in Darfur and during the 2019 crackdown on protesters. But just before the military was supposed to hand over the council's leadership to civilians, the generals orchestrated a coup. A few months later, in April 2023, the generals turned on each other, triggering a war in which their forces have battled throughout the country, including in the capital, Khartoum. The war has been marked by atrocities, caused widespread hunger and driven millions from their homes, becoming the world’s worst displacement crisis. Tunisia The Arab Spring started in Tunisia more than 13 years ago. Until recently, the country was hailed as a role model in the transition to democracy. It held free elections and drafted a constitution lauded by Western rights groups. But since being elected in 2019, President Kais Saied has increased his powers in what activists call a backslide from democracy. Saied temporarily suspended the parliament, redrafted the constitution and launched a crackdown on his opponents, imprisoning hundreds allegedly for undermining state security — a claim autocrats have long used to stamp out dissent. Egypt The military has been the main power player in Egypt. It seized direct control after 18 days of protests forced longtime autocrat Hosni Mubarak to resign on Feb. 11, 2011. Within 15 months, parliamentary and presidential elections were held. The Muslim Brotherhood, the most powerful opposition force during Mubarak’s era, swept both votes. Despite repeatedly insisting it wouldn't seek to dominate politics, it formed a majority in parliament and created a Brotherhood-led government. Over the next year, turmoil increased over accusations by opponents that the Brotherhood was unfairly imposing its will on the country, including writing an Islamist-leaning constitution. Many, including the large Coptic Christian minority, feared Islamist rule. Amid anti-Brotherhood protests, the military stepped in and removed President Mohammed Morsi in July 2013, a move supported by many secular parties and activists. It launched a ferocious crackdown on the Brotherhood, killing hundreds. Militant violence swelled with attacks on security forces and Christians. Military chief Abdel Fattah el-Sissi was elected president in 2014 and has since increased the influence of the army on the government and economy. The government has gone further than Mubarak did in stifling dissent, arresting Islamists and secular activists, and silencing media criticism.	https://apnews.com/article/syria-future-assad-arab-spring-lessons-51635b7aabc0760bb7841829586ede7c	2024-12-20T08:29:10-08:00	
At one of Rio de Janeiro's hardest trails, one paraplegic athlete climbed into the clouds	RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) — It’s perhaps Rio de Janeiro’s hardest trail, featuring one particularly daunting section requiring a perilous scramble that can cause hikers to freeze up with fright. But this week, paraplegic athlete Ezequiel da Luz, 40, traversed jungle and surmounted rocks to reach Pedra da Gavea’s peak that towers over the Atlantic Ocean. Da Luz had been waiting since 2021, and traveled more than 1,000 kilometers (621 miles) by bus from southern Brazil when his chance arrived to ascend with the assistance of an organization called the Inclusion Collective. Its volunteers on Dec. 18 surrounded and shouldered the weight of a specialized wheelchair, set inside a metal frame as they helped da Luz upward. 'What logistics!' da Luz exclaimed as their tightly packed throng helped him weave through one narrow stretch at the start of the trail. Inclusion Collective started three years ago and has completed more than 50 hikes, 12 of which to Pedra da Gavea, plus others on less challenging trails, according to Bruna Souza, the group’s administrator. 'We can show that if we have the will, inclusion can happen anywhere, not just where there’s a ramp,' she told The Associated Press along the trail. 'It’s not just shopping centers you can go to; you can go to other places. It can be fun for everyone.' Volunteers on Wednesday were mostly trail and climbing guides already familiar with the route. They were joined by hikers who encouraged da Luz during his eight-hour ascent, with 800 meters (2,600 feet) of elevation gain. At the infamously hair-raising section, called Carrasqueira, volunteers used a system of ropes to hoist his chair. 'I’ve never seen anything like this in terms of accessibility, people helping,' said Adriele Neves, a 29-year-old hiker. 'It’s beautiful work.' With Carrasqueira conquered, it was straight on to the summit. As da Luz wheeled himself forward, waving a Brazilian flag in the air, volunteers and other hikers already atop the mountain erupted in applause. 'I didn’t know it had so many challenges, and so many obstacles,' he told the AP atop the mountain. 'Today, to be up here on Pedra da Gavea, together with this group that promotes inclusion, is the fulfilment of a dream.' Alas, the peak was shrouded in clouds, leaving Rio de Janeiro’s Ipanema beach and iconic Two Brothers Hill hidden away. It seemed da Luz wouldn’t get to enjoy Pedra da Gavea’s majestic view. But within mere minutes, the clouds parted and some sunlight filtered down from the heavens, maybe just for him. 'Even in this, God was generous,' da Luz said. 'Look there, what an incredible view. What a marvelous vision!'	https://apnews.com/article/brazil-rio-accessibility-disability-parathlete-pedra-gavea-36523779270b201c0e0b0a59c4d2b5e0	2024-12-20T06:49:31-08:00	
Italy's privacy watchdog fines OpenAI for ChatGPT's violations in collecting users personal data	ROME (AP) — Italy’s data protection watchdog said Friday it has fined OpenAI 15 million euros ($15.6 million) after wrapping up a probe into the collection of personal data by the U.S. artificial intelligence company's popular chatbot ChatGPT. The country’s privacy watchdog, known as Garante, said its investigation showed that OpenAI processed users’ personal data to train ChatGPT 'without having an adequate legal basis and violated the principle of transparency and the related information obligations towards users'. OpenAI dubbed the decision 'disproportionate' and said it will appeal. 'When the Garante ordered us to stop offering ChatGPT in Italy in 2023, we worked with them to reinstate it a month later,' an OpenAI spokesperson said Friday in an emailed statement. 'They’ve since recognized our industry-leading approach to protecting privacy in AI, yet this fine is nearly 20 times the revenue we made in Italy during the relevant period.' OpenAI added, however, it remained 'committed to working with privacy authorities worldwide to offer beneficial AI that respects privacy rights.' The investigation, launched last year, also found that OpenAI didn’t provide an 'adequate age verification system' to prevent users under 13 years of age from being exposed to inappropriate AI-generated content, the watchdog said. The Italian authority also ordered OpenAI to launch a six-month campaign on different Italian media to raise public awareness about ChatGPT, specifically in regard to data collection. The booming popularity of generative artificial intelligence systems like ChatGPT has drawn scrutiny from regulators on both sides of the Atlantic. Regulators in the U.S. and Europe have been examining OpenAI and other companies that have played a key part in the AI boom, while governments around the world have been drawing up rules to protect against risks posed by AI systems, led by the European Union's AI Act, a comprehensive rulebook for artificial intelligence. ___ AP Business Writer Kelvin Chan in London contributed to this report	https://apnews.com/article/italy-privacy-authority-openai-chatgpt-fine-6760575ae7a29a1dd22cc666f49e605f	2024-12-20T06:35:03-08:00	
Warring tribes in Pakistan’s northwest ordered to hand over weapons after weeks of deadly clashes	PESHAWAR, Pakistan (AP) — Warring tribes in Pakistan’s northwest were ordered to hand over their weapons after weeks of deadly violence, authorities said Friday. Clashes in the Kurram district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province have killed at least 130 people in recent weeks, triggering road closures and other measures that have disrupted people’s access to medicine, food, fuel, education and work. The violence flared on Nov. 21 when gunmen ambushed a vehicle convoy and killed 52 people, mostly Shiite Muslims. Nobody claimed responsibility for the assault, which triggered retaliatory gunfire and arson by rival groups in several areas. On Friday, authorities in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa ordered tribes to hand over their weapons and sign an agreement through government mediation to ensure compliance. 'A 15-day framework will be provided for voluntary weapon collection. All weapons must be handed over to the administration by February,' provincial government spokesman Mohammed Ali Saif said. Authorities also ordered the dismantling of bunkers and the temporary reopening of roads on humanitarian grounds on an intermittent basis. Security personnel will guard convoys to ensure safe passage and there will be helicopters to address transport issues. 'Both parties will refrain from any violent actions to keep the ground routes open. Otherwise, the administration will be compelled to close the routes again,' the spokesman added. But a group of Shiite scholars said the confiscation of weapons could put the community at risk, and they expressed their disappointment with the order. 'This approach will result in further harm,' they said at a news conference in the city of Parachinar city. 'Without weapons, residents will be at the mercy of terrorists who could easily capture and kill them.' Shiite Muslims dominate parts of Kurram, although they are a minority in the rest of the country. The area has a history of sectarian conflict, with militant groups previously targeting the minority group. But they generally live peacefully alongside Sunni Muslims, who are the majority in Pakistan.	https://apnews.com/article/pakistan-kurram-sectarian-violence-6add22531d526301e135c9b3f473650d	2024-12-20T06:08:02-08:00	
Canada's Trudeau reshuffles his Cabinet as resignation calls mount and new election threat looms	TORONTO (AP) — Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's chances of staying on in power have become more tenuous after the opposition party that backed his government for years announced it will vote no confidence in the government when Parliament resumes. An embattled Trudeau reshuffled his Cabinet on Friday — but whether he will step aside in the coming days or weeks remains an open question. Trudeau participated in the swearing-in ceremony and will chair a meeting with his new Cabinet later Friday. He is not expected to speak publicly Friday as he mulls his future. 'The prime minister has simply asked for some time to reflect on his own future,' said David McGuinty, the new Public Safety Minister. 'He deserves to have that time to think about what he wants to do.' Rachel Bendayan, the official languages minister, said Trudeau 'told us he had a difficult choice to make.' Trudeau is facing rising discontent over his leadership, and the abrupt departure of his finance minister on Monday could be something he can’t recover from. Parliament is now shut for the holidays until late next month, but the leftist New Democratic Party said Friday it would trigger a vote of no confidence in Trudeau after lawmakers reconvene on Jan. 27. Because Trudeau’s Liberals do not hold an outright majority in Parliament, they have for years depended on the support of the NDP to pass legislation and stay in power. But that support has vanished — NDP leader Jagmeet Singh has called on Trudeau to resign — and he made clear Friday the NDP will vote to bring down the government. 'No matter who is leading the Liberal Party, this government’s time is up. We will put forward a clear motion of non-confidence in the next sitting of the House of Commons,' Singh said in letter released just before the Cabinet shuffle. The Liberals could delay Parliament’s return. Trudeau could decide not to run in the next year’s election and allow for a party leadership race. New Finance Minister Dominic LeBlanc said Thursday that Trudeau has the 'full support of his Cabinet' but acknowledged a rising number of Liberal members of Parliament want Trudeau to leave. Liberal Rob Oliphant became the latest lawmaker to call for the prime minister to step aside, saying there should be a 'robust, open leadership contest.' Trudeau, who has led the country for nearly a decade, has become widely unpopular in recent years over a wide range of issues, including the high cost of living and rising inflation. The political upheaval comes at a difficult moment for Canada. President-elect Donald Trump has threatened to impose 25% tariffs on all Canadian goods if the government does not stem what he calls a flow of migrants and drugs in the United States — even though far fewer of each cross into the U.S. from Canada than from Mexico, which Trump has also threatened. Canada’s Transport Minister Anita Anand, who on Friday added the role of minister of internal trade to her portfolio, said it won't be good if the Liberal government is not united as it deals with Trump's threats. There is no mechanism for Trudeau’s party to force him out in the short term. He could say he will step aside when a new party leader is chosen, or his Liberal party could be forced from power by a 'no confidence' vote in Parliament that would trigger an election that would very likely favor the opposing Conservative Party. 'It's clear the prime minister has lost control,' Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre said. Poilievre said Canada needs an immediate election and requires a prime minister who can face Trump from a position of strength. 'This cannot go on with a U.S. president coming in threatening tariffs early next year. We cannot have a chaotic clown show running our government into the ground,' he said. 'The only way for me to have the moral authority to get a deal with incoming President Trump is to have the strength that comes with winning an election and having a four year mandate.' Concerns about Trudeau’s leadership were exacerbated Monday when Chrystia Freeland, Trudeau’s finance minister and deputy prime minister, resigned from the Cabinet. Freeland was highly critical of Trudeau’s handling of the economy in the face of steep tariffs threatened by Trump. Shortly before Freeland announced her decision, the housing minister also quit. Daniel Béland, a political science professor at McGill University in Montreal, said Friday's Cabinet reshuffle was necessary because of recent departures but said for many Canadians 'it might simply appear as rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic.'	https://apnews.com/article/trudeau-canada-cabinet-1f222c037bbe7d1e8d68845f91d76417	2024-12-20T05:49:03-08:00	
In Florida, the Miccosukee fight to protect the Everglades in the face of climate change	EVERGLADES, Fla. (AP) — As a boy, when the water was low Talbert Cypress from the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida rummaged through the Everglades’ forests, swam in its swampy ponds and fished in its canals. But the vast wetlands near Miami have radically changed since Cypress was younger. Now 42 and tribal council chairman, Cypress said water levels are among the biggest changes. Droughts are drier and longer. Prolonged floods are drowning tree islands sacred to them. Native wildlife have dwindled. 'It’s basically extremes now,' he said. Tribal elder Michael John Frank put it this way: 'The Everglades is beautiful, but it’s just a skeleton of the way it used to be.' ______ EDITOR’S NOTE: This is part of a series of on how tribes and Indigenous communities are coping with and combating climate change. ______ For centuries, the Everglades has been the tribe's home. But decades of massive engineering projects for development and agriculture severed the wetlands to about half its original size, devastating an ecosystem that’s sustained them. Tribe members say water mismanagement has contributed to fires, floods and water pollution in their communities and cultural sites. Climate change, and the fossil fuel activities that caused it, are ongoing threats. The Miccosukee people have long fought to heal and protect what remains. They were historically reluctant to engage with the outside world due to America’s violent legacy against Indigenous people. But with a new tribal administration, the tribe has played an increasingly collaborative and leadership role in healing the Everglades. They’re working to stop oil exploration and successfully fought a wilderness designation that would have cut their access to ancestral lands. They’ve pushed for a project to reconnect the western Everglades with the larger ecosystem while helping to control invasive species and reintroducing racoons, hawks and other native animals. In August they signed a co-stewardship agreement for some of South Florida's natural landscapes. They've held prayer walks, launched campaigns to raise awareness of important issues and used airboat tours as public classrooms. Even so, a new report on the progress of Everglades work acknowledges a lack of meaningful and consistent engagement with the Miccosukee and Seminole tribes. It calls for applying Indigenous knowledge to restoration efforts and a steady partnership with tribes, whose longstanding, intimate and reciprocal relationship with the environment can help with understanding historical and present ecological conditions. The Miccosukee's past fuels their activism today For generations, the Miccosukee people would make pilgrimages from northern Florida to the Everglades to fish, hunt and hold religious ceremonies. When the Seminole Wars broke out in 1817, the tribe navigated the vast terrain better than the U.S. Army. By the late 1850s, Col. Gustavus Loomis had seared every tribal village and field in a region known as the Big Cypress, forcing the Miccosukee and Seminole people to seek refuge on tree islands deep in the Everglades. 'That’s the reason we’re here today. We often look at the Everglades as our protector during that time. And so now, it’s our turn to protect the Everglades,' said Cypress. Many of the Everglades’ modern problems began in the 1940s when the region was drained to build cities and plant crops. Over time, the ecosystems where the Miccosukee people hunted, fished and gathered plants, held sacred rituals and put their deceased to rest, have been destroyed. A state-federal project to clean the water and rehydrate the landscape aims to undo much of the damage. But water management decisions and restoration efforts have flooded or parched lands where tribe members live and hold ceremonies. That’s a reason the tribe has pushed for decades for a comprehensive response with the Western Everglades Restoration Project. Members have spoken at public meetings, written letters to federal agencies, lobbied with state and federal leaders while gathering with stakeholders to hear their concerns. If all goes right, the project will clean polluted water, improve hydrology, provide flood protection and reduce the likelihood and severity of wildfires. Groundbreaking for the project began in July there . Still, there are concerns about community flood risks and whether the project will do enough to improve water quality and quantity after a part of the plan was removed. A second engineered wetland that would have cleaned water was removed from the project proposal after landowners wouldn't give up their lands. The area's geology was also deemed too porous to sustain it. In the absence of an alternative, some people worry water will not meet standards. Even so, Curtis Osceola, chief of staff for the Miccosukee Tribe, said of the project: 'If we get this done, we will have forever changed the future for the Miccosukee and Seminole.' Victory in fight over wilderness designation In a region of the Everglades now known as the Big Cypress National Preserve, environmental activist and Miccosukee tribe member Betty Osceola learned as a child to spear hunt and subsist off the land like her ancestors did. It's where she still lives, in one of 15 traditional villages that a few hundred Miccosukee and Seminole people also call home. In its cypress swamps and sawgrass prairies, they hunt, gather medicinal plants and hold important events. It’s home to ceremonial and burial grounds, and to the endangered Florida panther. The National Park Service wanted to designate the preserve as wilderness to protect it from human impacts. The tribe pushed back, saying it would have significantly affected their traditional ways of life, limited access to their homelands and ignored the critical stewardship they've provided for centuries. Allowing Indigenous people to remain caretakers of their lands and waters, numerous studies have shown, are critical to protecting biodiversity, forests and fighting climate change. After a stern fight involving campaigns, a petition, testimonials and support from numerous government officials, the tribe succeeded. The National Park Service listened to the tribe's concerns about the legal conflicts the designation would have on their tribal rights, said Osceola, the Miccosukee's chief of staff. Although they continue objecting to the agency's advancing proposal to expand trail systems in the preserve, which the tribe said are near or past culturally significant sites, 'they did listen to us on the wilderness designation and at least they’re not, at this time, proceeding with any such designation,' he added. The Miccosukee continue pushing to phase out oil drilling in Big Cypress, writing op-eds and working with local, state and federal governments to stop more oil exploration by acquiring mineral rights in the preserve. Elders look to the next generation to protect the Everglades On a windy afternoon, Frank, the tribal elder, and Hector Tigertail, 18, sat under a chickee, or stilt house, on the tribe’s reservation. A wooden swing swayed near garden beds where flowers, chilies and other plants sprung from the soil. A plastic deer with antlers lay on the grass nearby, used to teach Indigenous youth how to hunt. Frank, 67, shared stories of growing up on tree islands. He remembered when the water was so clean he could drink it, and the deer that emerged to play when a softball game was underway. He spoke of the tribe’s history and a time when wildlife in the Everglades was abundant. Of his distrust of government agencies and the tribe's connection to the land. And he spoke often of his grandfather's words, uttered to him decades ago that still resound. 'We were told to never, ever leave the Everglades,' said Frank. 'The only way to prolong your life, your culture, your identity is to stay here in the Everglades... as long as you're here, your maker's hand is upon you.' Tigertail heard similar stories from his uncles and grandfather growing up. They helped him feel connected to the Everglades and to his culture. Their stories remind him of the importance of being stewards of the lands that have cared for him and his ancestors. Tribal elders are teaching youth what Cypress called 'the modern' way to protect the Everglades – with policy, understanding government practices and integrating traditional and Western science. As a tribal youth member, Tigertail is doing what he can to preserve the Everglades for his generation and ones to come. He works with the Miccosukee Tribe's Fish and Wildlife Department to remove invasive species like pythons and fish like peacock bass. And he tries to be a voice for his people. 'To hear that we’re losing it slowly and slowly saddens me,' said Tigertail. 'But also gives me hope that maybe there is a chance to save it.' ___ The Associated Press receives support from the Walton Family Foundation for coverage of water and environmental policy.

Zimbabwe launches new land policy to empower Black farmers with direct farm ownership	HARARE (AP) — Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwa on Friday launched a new policy that will allow beneficiaries of land taken from white people under contentious land reforms to sell it and to be able to borrow from banks using it as collateral. This marks a major shift in Zimbabwe's land policy. Previously, the resettled farmers couldn't transfer ownership of land. However, ownership of the land can only be transferred between 'Indigenous Zimbabweans,' a reference to Black Zimbabweans, and will need government approval under the new policy. Tens of thousands of Black people took over white-owned farms after then President Robert Mugabe initiated the land reforms in 2000. Mugabe, who died in 2019, justified the reforms as being necessary to redress some of the wrongs of colonialism that put most of Zimbabwe's fertile land in the hands of a few white people. But the new Black farmers weren't allowed to sell or transfer ownership of the land, which was deemed to belong to the state. As a result, banks were reluctant to advance loans to the resettled farmers, who couldn't use their land as collateral. On Friday, a handful of farmers, including Mnangagwa, received title deeds to the farms they are occupying. Mnangagwa also announced a technical committee to spearhead the process for other resettled Black farmers. Speaking at an event held at his farm near Kwekwe city in central Zimbabwe, Mnangagwa said the policy would help 'unlock the value' of the land and make it 'bankable and transferable.' About 4,500 white farmers who owned the majority of prime farmland were removed from their farms, often forcibly by violent mobs led by veterans of the country’s 1970s independence war more than 20 years ago. Some farmers and their workers died or were seriously injured in the violence, which included beatings and rape, according to Human Rights Watch. The land seizures badly impacted commercial farming, forcing a country that was a key regional food producer and exporter to rely on assistance from donors. Zimbabwe’s agriculture sector has rebounded in recent years, but droughts are now the main challenge. Securing finance has been another problem that Mnangagwa hopes could be solved by the new policy of issuing title deeds to Black farmers. Secure land tenure means 'our farmers can access credit facilities' and it 'lifts many out of poverty into prosperity,' Mnangagwa said. In October, Finance Minister Mthuli Ncube said that Zimbabwe would compensate local and foreign white farmers who lost land and property in the farm seizures.	https://apnews.com/article/zimbabwe-land-policy-black-farmers-reform-ownership-87e4cfaf7b6ad1f43f4ca886f20546d5	2024-12-20T05:11:31-08:00	
Hungary’s Orbán says European leaders must change strategy on Ukraine	BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) — Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán said Friday that European leaders must acknowledge the need to change their strategy regarding Ukraine. In comments to Hungary’s state broadcaster on Friday, Orbán argued that the current strategy was not working and Russia was advancing on the frontlines. He added that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s victory 'has changed the state of the war.' The nationalist Hungarian leader is a vocal supporter of Trump and has long sought to undermine EU support for Ukraine. He has routinely blocked, delayed or watered down the bloc’s efforts to provide weapons and funding and to sanction Moscow for its invasion. Orbán did not specify what actions he believed Europe should take regarding Ukraine, but reiterated his call for a Christmas truce in the Ukraine war. He suggested the exchange of up to 1,000 prisoners of war between Moscow and Kyiv. He said such a ceasefire should start on the Orthodox Christmas, Jan. 7. That could be seen as another insult against the Ukrainians, who split from the Orthodox calendar last year and are celebrating Christmas on Dec. 25. Orbán had repeatedly maintained previously that Russian President Vladimir Putin had accepted his ceasefire proposal. But on Friday he took a step back, saying that he got Putin 'to consider it.' He did not provide more details.	https://apnews.com/article/hungary-ukraine-orban-trump-war-truce-aedac0e0a73a602083d76ef9f7beaeb8	2024-12-20T05:11:26-08:00	
Two AP journalists in Ukraine and the Mideast break down the wars they covered in 2024	For the world, 2024 was riven by — and in some ways defined by — conflict on two fronts. The ripples after the previous year's Hamas attacks in Israel left Gaza a shambles and tens of thousands dead, and an adjacent conflict between Israel and Hezbollah is playing out across the Lebanon landscape as the year ends. A continent away, the Russia-Ukraine war, which began with Russia's invasion in early 2022, rages on and evolves, claiming more casualties as it goes. Associated Press journalists have been covering these conflicts since they began. Now, as 2024 ends and a new year begins, we asked two veteran AP reporters — Josef Federman in Jerusalem and Samya Kullab in Kyiv — to talk about what they saw the past year and what struck them. Here are their accounts: JOSEF FEDERMAN, news director, Israel/Palestinian territories/Jordan ON REGIONAL IMPLICATIONS: There's a shift going on. There are these two blocs in the Middle East. You have Iran and its allies, and then you have the pro-western Arab countries and Israel. The Iranians' allies include Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis in Yemen, Assad's government in Syria. Now you see all of this falling apart. Oct. 7 triggered this chain reaction across the region. And what we’ve seen is that the Iran bloc as a whole is collapsing before our eyes. So what Hamas had hoped to do, if you go back and you look at what they said on Oct. 7th, they were expecting the entire Middle East to kind of rise up against Israel with them. And the only one that really did it was Hezbollah in Lebanon. Some of these other Iranian-backed groups kind of joined in. But what you’ve seen over this past year is that Israel has been dismantling Hamas. Hamas still exists at a very low level, but it is nothing close to what it was, and it probably never will be again. So it has dismantled Hamas in Gaza. And it struck a very tough blow to Hezbollah as well. IMPACT ON HEZBOLLAH: For years, the Israelis built up Hezbollah as like the boogeyman. They said, 'Oh, Hamas is a walk in the park compared to what we’re going to deal with Hezbollah.' And people were really dreading that second front opening up. And then it really boiled over into a full-fledged war over the summer. And then Israel moved in and sent ground troops into Lebanon. And it delivered, not as hard hit as what it did to Hamas, but a body blow to Hezbollah as well. Israel assassinated Hassan Nasrallah. who was this very charismatic figure who led the group for 30 years. It killed nearly all of the group's top leaders. And the exploding pager incident was more psychological than anything — hundreds of Hezbollah members suddenly are afraid to look at their phones and use their devices after these mysterious explosions. It just shows how far Israel infiltrated this group. HOW SYRIA FITS IN: There’s a clear connection here. Israel struck a blow to Iran’s allies, and then these rebels in Syria saw weakness. Once Hezbollah caved, within days they were moving across Syria. And within a week or two, Assad had been toppled — after his family was in power for half a century. And the reason Syria was so important was it was the main route for Hezbollah to rearm. The arms would be transferred through Syria across the Lebanese border. That option doesn’t exist anymore. So what was already fragmentation has become even more fragmented. And now Syria is no longer an arms smuggling route to Hezbollah, so Hezbollah is also not going to be the same threat. Israel’s not out of the woods, though, because you don’t know what’s going to emerge in Syria. WHAT 2025 MIGHT HOLD FOR GAZA: There are signs the war is in its final stages. But even if it ends, I don’t see how anybody would want to invest into rebuilding Gaza again, given the history where every three or four years there is another war where all your work gets destroyed. So for them to get investment this time on that the scale that’s needed, there are going to have to be some big changes in the way people think. They're not going to just go back to Oct. 6. That's where diplomacy comes in — who’s going to run it? It has to be somebody that’s trusted by all of the sides. It has to be somebody that’s confident they can do things differently. And you’re going to have that constant threat of Hamas undermining the work if they’re not part of this anymore. ON TRAUMA: When this is over one thing that seems safe to say is there’s not going to be a happy ending here. Nobody’s going to come out of this war smiling. Many of the hostages aren't coming back alive. Even if Israel succeeds in dismantling Hamas, if all of these hostages that are alive get out, who knows what sort of trauma they are facing and future they’re going to have? There are the Oct. 7 victims, and hundreds of Israeli soldiers have been killed since then. Their friends and families are all grieving. And the future of Gaza, it has been bombed really into oblivion. I mean, the amount of damage that we can see from satellite photos and from our people on the ground, it will probably take decades to rebuild. No one knows who’s going to govern Gaza. Nobody knows who’s going to pay for this reconstruction. And then just think about all the trauma, what everybody’s been through. Tens of thousands of people killed — lots of militants but also lots of civilians. We have 90% of the territory that has been displaced. Many, if not most, are living in tents in squalid conditions. About half of Gaza's population is below the age of 18. It’s a young society. You have an entire generation of children who have missed two full years of school. Who knows what type of education they will get? How do you make up that time? And what future do they have? SAMYA KULLAB, correspondent, Ukraine ON THE STATUS OF THE WAR: Ukraine is not winnable in the way maybe Ukrainians had hoped back in 2022, when there were real victories the the failure of the battle for Kyiv the winning back territory and the counter-offensive. The jubilation and the joy from those initial moments has kind of turned into this incredible feeling of gloom and coming to terms with what we’ve always known — that Ukraine is at a terrible disadvantage. I would describe it as being bled out slowly. ON OUTSIDE BACKING: A lot hangs on what kind of support Ukraine will get from allies. And that’s also been wanting. One of the reasons Ukrainian military leaders can’t execute battle plans is because the military support they expected coming from Western allies did not arrive. It did not come on time. But at the same time, those decisions, those battle plans, we have to also look at them and question whether they are, in fact, effective on the battlefield. ON MORALE: The men are just holding onto these defensive lines with everything they have. A year ago, even, I would never hear soldiers say anything negative on record about their leaders. Now people are not only saying it to me on record, they are going online on their social media, with their names, their rank, their units, and telling everyone they know about what is not working. And that, I think, says a lot about where we are. And Ukraine can’t afford to fire anyone. They need as much manpower as possible. There have been tens of thousands of cases of desertion — 100,000 since the beginning of the full-scale invasion. And more than half of that figure is from just the last year. Many of them go back and then leave again, but Ukraine doesn’t have the ability to prosecute 100,000 men. So they much prefer to try to convince them to come back. ON LIFE FOR NONCOMBATANTS: The war is all-encompassing, so you can’t escape that it’s happening. You walk down the street, you look at some lovely little things on sale, and you see a little sign that says, 'Please buy these handmade things. I’m trying to raise money for my husband’s military unit.' There are donation boxes everywhere. The number of amputees I see walking on the street — I see them every single day. And now it’s being more normalized. There is a version of 'The Bachelor' here in Ukraine where the main guy is a double amputee, so it’s becoming more normalized in that way. For people who are not fighting, Kiev feels a bit like a bubble in the sense that there are cafes, there are lovely restaurants, there are bars, people are out. But there’s curfew so by midnight everything is closed and there’s air raid alerts all the time all the time. Today we had almost 200 drones, 90 missiles and one of the largest attacks in at least in a few weeks. So this is all happening around you. ON THE NEAR FUTURE: Two years ago, Zelenskyy would never have said anything about a ceasefire or any kind of agreement that would not include the return of the occupied territories, and now Zelenskyy has said, 'Well, we may not be able to get them back military by military force alone it might be a mix of military and diplomacy. That was a signal to all of us that things have changed. My sense from talking to people in Kyiv is everyone is waiting for Donald Trump and what he will decide. And then the other kind of elephant in the room is, does Russia even want to engage in any kind of negotiation? Why would they? They have the advantage. Another question is, how long can they go? A MEMORABLE MOMENT IN 2024: We found this one woman, and she told us that she had to leave with her children because her daughter was injured. She needed a proper doctor. She couldn’t leave with her husband because her husband had served with Ukraine and the Russians knew that. And so he was basically under house arrest and he had been tortured. So she left and we asked her, were you there during the floods? And she said, yeah, I dragged bodies and I buried them with my own hands. And she described this experience she had of picking up bodies in boats, taking them to the shore and then burying them in the cemetery. And one thing I’ll never forget of what she said was, 'The dead don’t scare me. The living frighten me far more.' We don’t communicate with her anymore, and I still think about where she is, what she’s what she’s going through and the bravery it takes to leave your home and then the bravery it takes to go back to a place that’s not safe. ___ Follow AP's yearend coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/year-in-review.	https://apnews.com/article/wars-ukraine-gaza-israel-lebanon-2024-8e21353182a8543b712cdff8823d1c4a	2024-12-20T04:26:07-08:00	
Crowds in Mayotte vent frustration with cyclone response as Macron tours devastation	MIRERENI, Mayotte (AP) — Crowds in Mayotte vented their frustration at French President Emmanuel Macron, with some booing, as he toured destruction wrought by the strongest cyclone to hit the French territory in nearly a century. Particularly tense scenes on Thursday underscored the discontent that many residents of the archipelago in the Indian Ocean feel toward their government, based about 8,000 kilometers (5,000 miles) away in Paris. The people of Mayotte, the poorest department in France, have previously said they suffer from underinvestment and neglect by the government. Now, they are expressing disappointment with the response to Cyclone Chido, which hit Saturday. The storm has devastated entire neighborhoods and caused an unknown number of deaths, as many people ignored warnings, thinking the storm wouldn’t be so extreme. Authorities have said hundreds or possibly thousands may be dead, but the official toll rose to 35 on Friday. In the morning, Macron visited a neighborhood in Tsingoni on Mayotte’s main island, where people remain without access to drinking water or phone service nearly a week after the storm. As he walked through the area, some shouted: 'We want water, we want water.' Others, however, offered him a warmer welcome, posing for selfies with the French leader and showing him their children. But the night before, Macron was met with boos from dozens of residents in Pamandzi on another nearby island. As people expressed frustration at the slow pace of aid efforts, Macron grabbed a microphone and became angry. Moving towards the crowd, he said: 'I have nothing to do with the cyclone, you can blame me, it wasn’t me!' Macron, who is known for his appetite for debate and for confronting people who are angry at him, vacillated between acknowledging the hardship and pushing back against criticism. 'You’ve been through something terrible, everyone’s struggling, regardless of skin color,' he said. Visibly losing patience, Macron then shouted: 'If it wasn’t France, you’d be 10,000 times more screwed!' The French president added: 'There’s no place in the Indian Ocean where people get so much help!' A woman could be heard saying 'we disagree.' In a reflection of further frustration, a woman working with local authorities in Mayotte’s capital told The Associated Press on Friday that many deaths recorded by officials on the ground have not yet been published in official tallies. The woman, who spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the situation, said most of the people who died were migrants, living in the hills in flimsy houses. Mayotte is home to 320,000 residents and an estimated 100,000 additional migrants. The woman was not able to give her own estimate. The reported death toll has only slowly ticked up in the week since the cyclone hit and stood at 35 on Friday, even though authorities have said they know that is a dramatic undercount. Many in Mayotte have expressed disbelief that the toll hasn’t been updated more quickly. The Interior Ministry said Friday that in addition to the deaths, 67 people were seriously injured and more than 2,400 slightly injured. 'The number of deaths does not reflect the reality of the 100,000 people living in precarious housing,' the statement said. 'The prefect has therefore ordered the deputy prefect to set up a mission to search for the dead.' It said 70% of residents were 'seriously affected.' The government said it has created a way to count the dead by ordering a census of the population district by district, with the help of mayors and local associations. In just one example of how the toll might grow, French Health Minister Geneviève Darrieussecq said Friday that about 17% of hospital staff and 40% of all regional health staff on the archipelago are still unaccounted for. 'That’s around 60 to 70 people,' she said on news broadcaster FranceInfo, stressing a large part of the population still has no access to phone service. Meanwhile, French military and local authorities scrambled to repair busted water pipes across the islands and get water to villages who haven’t had any. In the village of Mirereni, about 35 kilometers (20 miles) outside Mayotte’s capital, Civil Security officers were trying to remove a large, felled mango tree that busted a water pipe. The pipe provides water to around 10,000 people in three nearby villages. But officials said repairing it might take longer than usual because of the heat, which impacts equipment. Locals said they’re worried the lack of water would cause disease. Earlier this year, there was a cholera outbreak on the island, with at least 200 cases. Mayotte is part an archipelago located between Africa’s east coast and Madagascar that had been a French colony. Its residents voted to remain part of France in a 1974 referendum while the rest of the islands became the independent nation of Comoros. In recent decades, the French territory has seen massive migration from Comoros, one of the world’s poorest countries, most of whom entered and live illegally in Mayotte. Macron said Friday fighting illegal immigration was key to state efforts to get Mayotte back on track. 'When you have schools where the population has multiplied by five in two years, when you have hospitals that are exploding under migration pressure, they feel they are being abandoned even if the state is doing a lot,' he said. 'We won’t be able to solve Mayotte’s fundamental problems unless we solve the problem of illegal immigration.' He has proposed rules that would apply to the territory in order to reduce the numbers of people coming in illegally. On Thursday, he also announced a special law that would help rebuild Mayotte more quickly and would seek to destroy slums and replace tin shacks with more solid buildings. ___ Corbet reported from Paris.

7 inmates are dead after a prison riot in southern Mexico	MEXICO CITY (AP) — Seven inmates were killed in a prison riot in southern Mexico, when inmates resisting transfers to other jails fought police with guns and knives, authorities said. Four police officers and six other inmates were injured in the riot in the city of Villahermosa, the capital of the Gulf coast state of Tabasco. State police chief Víctor Hugo Chávez said late Thursday that officers were met by gunfire early in the day when they entered the prison to transfer two dangerous inmates to a federal penitentiary. One of the inmates with a gun held out for about three hours, protected by 20 fellow prisoners. Chávez did not specify if police opened fire on the group, but said: 'Authorities have to act to defend their own lives, too.' Fires also broke out in the prison during the riot, and crowds of angry, desperate relatives gathered outside the prison, demanding information about family members locked up inside. After regaining control of the facility several hours later, authorities found an assault rifle, five pistols, a hand grenade, 23 machetes, 14 knives and 23 homemade shivs. They did not explain how the firearms got into the prison. Jails in Mexico are known for notoriously loose controls and corruption, to the extent that gangs at some penitentiaries control their own cell blocks and extort other prisoners for protection money. President Claudia Sheinbaum said Friday the riot would be investigated to see 'if there was any collusion' and 'to see if the (police) operation was correct and why they found weapons inside the prison.' ____ Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america	https://apnews.com/article/mexico-prison-riot-seven-inmates-killed-877490356e06f155c650d1ff602e06c6	2024-12-20T03:10:22-08:00	
Diplomatic spat erupts after Hungary gives asylum to Polish politician suspected of corruption	WARSAW, Poland (AP) — Hungary has given political asylum to a Polish opposition politician who is wanted on suspicions of corruption, triggering a diplomatic spat that worsened on Friday. Poland's government decried Hungary's decision as a 'hostile act,' and Prime Minister Donald Tusk said that he was dismayed by Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán's decision to shelter a man being sought on suspicions of defrauding the state of millions of zlotys. The Polish Foreign Ministry said Friday morning that it has summoned its ambassador to Hungary back home for 'indefinite consultations.' It also summoned the Hungarian ambassador in Warsaw to give him a protest note. The matter centers on the case of a former deputy justice minister, Marcin Romanowski, but also reveals a clash over rule of law and democracy. Tusk took office last year vowing to restore democratic norms and fight corruption that has prevailed under the national conservative government of Law and Justice. As part of that effort, his government has been seeking to bring to justice some former government officials who allegedly broke the law during the eight-year rule of Law and Justice. 'I did not expect corrupt politicians escaping justice would be able to choose between (Belarusian President Alexander) Lukashenko and Orbán,' Tusk said on Friday. Hungary on Thursday offered political asylum to Romanowski, who is wanted under a European arrest warrant. Romanowski through his lawyer argues that he is the victim of political retribution by Tusk's government. Gergely Gulyás, Orbán’s chief of staff. said that Budapest believed that Romanowski wouldn’t receive a fair trial in Poland. Both Poland and Hungary are members of the 27-member European Union, and Poland believes Budapest's move is 'an action contrary to the fundamental principle of loyal cooperation' as laid out in the EU treaties. 'We consider the decision of Prime Minister Viktor Orbán’s government to grant political asylum to Marcin Romanowski, wanted under the European Arrest Warrant, to be an act hostile towards the Republic of Poland and contrary to the elementary principles binding on the member states of the European Union,' the ministry said. The Polish prosecutor's office has accused Romanowski of committing 11 crimes, including criminal group and rigging tenders, and the misappropriation of millions.	https://apnews.com/article/poland-hungary-asylum-politician-dispute-6c528154f2ca2a67ef45fad333aa1984	2024-12-20T02:40:48-08:00	
The Latest: 2 journalists working for Kurdish media killed in clashes in northern Syria	A journalists’ association says two reporters working for Kurdish media outlets have been killed in clashes between Syrian Kurdish militia and Turkish-backed fighters in northern Syria. Fighting in parts of Syria continues despite the fall of President Bashar Assad. Elsewhere in Syria, the transition following the government’s fall has been smooth so far, although it’s been less than two weeks since Assad was ousted by a lightning rebel advance on the capital Damascus. The country is home to diverse sects, and there is ongoing fear and uncertainty among minority groups, including Christians, regarding their rights and safety under the main rebel group, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, once an affiliate of al-Qaida. ___ Here’s the latest: KURDISH JOURNALISTS KILLED IN NORTHERN SYRIA ANKARA, Turkey - A journalists' association says two journalists working for Kurdish media outlets were killed in northern Syria while covering fighting between Turkish-backed fighters and Syrian Kurdish militia. Turkey-based Dicle-Firat Journalists Association said Friday Nazim Dastan and Cihan Bilgin were killed Thursday after their vehicle was reportedly targeted by a Turkish drone on a road near the Tishrin Dam. Tishrin Dam, located some 90 kilometers east of Aleppo, has been the scene of clashes between the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces, SDF, and the Turkey-backed opposition forces. There was no immediate comment from Turkish officials. Bianet, a news website dedicated to human rights issues, said Bilgin was a reporter for the Kurdish Hawar News Agency, while Dastan worked as a freelance journalist for the Firat News Agency, which is associated with the militant group, the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK). Turkey considers the SDF as a terrorist organization because its main component is a group aligned to the PKK. The group has been engaged in an armed struggle against the Turkish state since the 1980s in pursuit of its objective to secure autonomy for Kurds in the country. IOM head: Large-scale return of Syrians would ‘overwhelm’ Syria GENEVA – The head of the U.N. migration agency says that large-scale returns of Syrians to their homeland at this stage would 'overwhelm' the country. Syria’s civil war has displaced millions of people since 2011. The fall of Bashar Assad’s government earlier this month has fueled talk in some of the countries where they went of the refugees’ return. Amy Pope, the director-general of the International Organization for Migration, told reporters Friday after returning from a visit to Syria that her agency’s message to countries in Europe and elsewhere is that 'this is not the moment to talk about large-scale returns.' Pope said that communities 'are just not ready to absorb the people who are displaced and would come back.' She argued that if 'overwhelming numbers' of people return, 'it will overwhelm the country and it could risk more disruptive impact on a very fragile peace process.' Pope said it’s right to support individuals on a case-by-case basis who want to go home or know that their place of origin is safe, but that efforts now need to focus on the humanitarian situation, recovery and rebuilding. Swedish government ending ‘core support’ for the UN relief agency for Palestinians STOCKHOLM - The Swedish government says it is ending its 'core support' for the United Nations relief agency for Palestinians. The government said Friday that 800 million kronor ($72.4 million) being allocated for the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and the region next year will go through the channels of the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency and the government’s support for other agencies such as the World Food Program, the U.N. Children’s Fund, the U.N. Population Fund and the International Committee of the Red Cross. In October, Israel’s parliament approved legislation banning UNRWA’s activities in the Palestinian territories, a measure that was to take effect in 90 days. Sweden’s minister for international development cooperation and foreign trade, Benjamin Dousa, posted on X that the Israeli decision will make much of UNRWA’s work difficult or impossible. He said that Swedish aid must arrive and not get stuck in a bank account en route, and that the Israeli parliament’s decision forces it to pass on support to other organizations. Dousa added that UNRWA is undergoing a crisis of confidence. Sweden provided 451 million kronor to UNRWA this year.	https://apnews.com/article/syria-assad-turkey-kurds-unwra-refugees-f640c60934d865775f8fc7fd64422a2b	2024-12-20T01:24:55-08:00	
A teenager stabs a 7-year-old to death and wounds a teacher and 3 more children in a Croatian school	ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) — A knife-wielding teenager walked into a school in Croatia’s capital on Friday, stabbed a 7-year-old girl to death and wounded three more children and their teacher, authorities said. The attack took place around 9:50 a.m. on the last day of school before Christmas at the Precko Elementary School in the Zagreb neighborhood of the same name. It caters for children between the ages of 7 and 15. 'The attacker is a 19-year-old who is a former student of that school and still lives nearby,' said Interior Minister Davor Bozinovic. 'Eventually he started injuring himself. Police prevented him from committing suicide.' Bozinovic said the attacker had mental health problems and had made a previous attempt to kill himself. 'It is hard to say this person was mentally balanced.' School attacks are rare in Croatia and in the Balkans as a whole, although in May 2023, a teenager in neighboring Serbia opened fire at a school in the capital, Belgrade, killing nine fellow students and a school guard. Video footage broadcast by Croatian media on Friday showed children running away from the school building and a medical helicopter landing in the schoolyard. Authorities in Croatia declared Saturday a day or mourning and canceled some of the Christmas festivities. Candidates for the upcoming presidential election said they were temporarily suspending their campaigns because of the tragedy. President Zoran Milanovic said 'there are no words to describe the grief over the horrible and unthinkable tragedy that shocked us all today.' Milanovic called for unity and an effort to ensure that schools are a safe and carefree place for children. Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic said at a government session that he was 'appalled' by the attack and that authorities are still working to determine exactly what happened.. —— Associated Press writers Jovana Gec and Dusan Stojanovic in Belgrade, Serbia, contributed to this story. —— This story has been corrected to make clear that the attack in Serbia was in May 2023.	https://apnews.com/article/croatia-zagreb-school-attack-1fe667b5f8322b89c3352b8a498d3498	2024-12-20T01:13:19-08:00	
France's anti-terrorism court convicts 8 people of involvement in the 2020 beheading of a teacher	PARIS (AP) — France’s anti-terrorism court on Friday convicted eight people of involvement in the beheading of teacher Samuel Paty outside his school near Paris four years ago, a horrific death that shocked the country. Paty, 47, was killed outside his school on Oct. 16, 2020, days after showing his class cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad during a debate on free expression. The assailant, an 18-year-old Russian of Chechen origin, was shot to death by police. Those who have been on trial on terrorism charges at a special court in Paris since the end of November were accused, in some cases, of providing assistance to the perpetrator and, in others, of organizing a hate campaign online before the murder took place. The 540-seat courtroom in central Paris was packed for the verdict, which marked the final chapter of the Paty trial. The atmosphere became charged as the lead judge delivered the sentences. Families of the accused, seated on the benches, reacted strongly — there were gasps, cries, shouts, and even ironic clapping erupted, prompting the judge to pause several times and call for silence. 'They lied about my brother,' shouted one relative. Another woman, crying on the shoulder of a family member, exclaimed, 'They took my baby from me,' before being escorted out by police officers. Heavy surveillance, with over 50 police officers, kept order during the tense session. Prosecutors had requested sentences ranging from 18 months suspended imprisonment to 16 years in prison against the defendants. They include friends of assailant Abdoullakh Anzorov, who allegedly helped purchase weapons for the attack and the father of a schoolgirl whose lies started the fatal spiral of events. The national anti-terrorism prosecutor had asked the court to downgrade the offenses of four of the eight defendants, prompting ire from Paty's family. 'It's more than a disappointment,' Paty's sister Mickaëlle earlier told broadcaster TF1. 'In a moment like this, it feels like one is fighting for nothing.' Also, the public prosecutor dropped the charge of complicity in favor of a lower charge of association with a terrorist enterprise against the two young men accused of providing the logistical support to the killer. He asked for 14 years in prison for Naïm Boudaoud and 16 years for Azim Epsirkhanov. The attack occurred against a backdrop of protests in many Muslim countries and calls online for violence targeting France and the satirical French newspaper Charlie Hebdo. The newspaper had republished its caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad a few weeks before Paty’s death to mark the opening of the trial over deadly 2015 attacks on its newsroom by Islamic extremists. The cartoon images deeply offended many Muslims, who saw them as sacrilegious. But the fallout from Paty’s killing reinforced the French state’s commitment to freedom of expression and its firm attachment to secularism in public life. His death left an imprint on the nation, and several schools in France are now named after Paty. Much attention at the trial focused on Brahim Chnina, the Muslim father of a teenager who was 13 at the time and claimed that she had been excluded from Paty’s class when he showed the caricatures on Oct. 5, 2020. Chnina, 52, sent a series of messages to his contacts denouncing Paty, saying that 'this sick man' needed to be fired, along with the address of the school in the Paris suburb of Conflans Saint-Honorine. In reality, Chnina’s daughter had lied to him and had never attended the lesson in question. Paty was giving a lesson mandated by the National Education Ministry on freedom of expression. He discussed the caricatures in this context, saying students who did not wish to see them could temporarily leave the classroom. An online campaign against Paty snowballed, and 11 days after the lesson, Anzorov attacked the teacher with a knife as he walked home, and displayed the teacher’s head on social media. Police later shot Anzorov as he advanced toward them, armed. Chnina is accused of alleged association with a terrorist enterprise for targeting the 47-year-old teacher through false information. The public prosecutor requested a sentence of 10 years' imprisonment for him His daughter was tried last year in a juvenile court and given an 18-month suspended sentence. Four other students at Paty’s school were found guilty of involvement and given suspended sentences; a fifth, who pointed out Paty to Anzorov in exchange for money, was given a 6-month term with an electronic bracelet. Abdelhakim Sefrioui, who presented himself as a spokesperson for Imams of France although he had been dismissed from that role, is another key figure in the trial. He filmed a video in front of the school with the father of the student. He referred to the teacher as a 'thug' multiple times and sought to pressure the school administration via social media. Prosecutors have requested a 12-year sentence for him. Some of the defendants expressed regrets and claimed their innocence on the eve of the verdict. They did not convince Paty's family. 'It’s something that really shocks the family,' lawyer Virginie Le Roy said. 'You get the feeling that those in the box are absolutely unwilling to admit any responsibility whatsoever. Apologies are pointless, they won’t bring Samuel back, but explanations are precious to us. But, unfortunately I have to make a more than mixed assessment. We haven’t had many explanations of the facts.' ___ Petrequin reported from London.	https://apnews.com/article/france-teacher-beheading-trial-paty-c03c4c29bef324fbe6dc3095a425ba9a	2024-12-20T01:05:19-08:00	
Taiwan lawmakers clash after party members break into legislature to occupy speaker's chair	TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) — Lawmakers clashed in Taiwan's legislature Friday when members of a leading political party who had broken into the building overnight to occupy the speaker's chair tussled with members of another major party who forced their way in to evict them. Some lawmakers were injured in the clash, according to Taiwan media reports. At issue are three bills being pushed by the Nationalist Party, or Kuomintang, including one that critics say would paralyze the Constitutional Court. Lawmakers from the Democratic Progressive Party removed windows to get into the building Thursday night and take over the speaker's area, piling up a wall of chairs to block access, Taiwan's Central News Agency said. Photos and videos of the morning clash showed a crush of lawmakers pushing and shoving each other as Nationalist members barged in en masse to take control and allow the speaker, Han Kuo-yu, take his position. No details were immediately available on the injuries. The Democratic Progressive Party, known as the DPP, was attempting to block any votes on the bills. Neither they nor the Nationalists, known as the KMT, won a majority in the last legislative election, but the KMT has teamed up with a minor party to take control of the legislature. Taiwan's president, Lai Ching-te, is from the DPP. A DPP leader said in a social media video Thursday night that the party's actions were extreme but that it had no other options, the Central News Agency reported. Negotiations on the bills have failed to resolve differences between the parties. Besides restricting the court, the bills would make a public recall of elected officials more difficult and redistribute tax revenues by giving a larger share to local governments. Thousands of DPP supporters protested outside the legislature on Thursday night and Friday. Lawmakers in Taiwan have brawled in the past. In 2020, they threw pig guts at each other over a government decision to lift a ban on the import of U.S. pork and beef.	https://apnews.com/article/taiwan-legislature-brawl-clash-tussle-lawmakers-a832d9cee2bc99e7f46ba70a3defe3e9	2024-12-20T00:51:57-08:00	
Russian missiles target Kyiv after Ukraine fires US-made missiles across the border	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — A Russian ballistic missile attack on Ukraine’s capital Kyiv early Friday killed at least one person and injured nine others, officials said. Moscow claimed it was in response to a Ukrainian strike on Russian soil using American-made weapons. At least three loud blasts were heard in Kyiv shortly before sunrise. Ukraine’s air force said it intercepted five Iskander short-range ballistic missiles fired at the city. The attack knocked out heating to 630 residential buildings, 16 medical facilities, and 30 schools and kindergartens, the city administration said, and falling missile debris caused damage and sparked fires in three districts. 'We ask citizens to immediately respond to reports of ballistic attack threats, because there is very little time to find shelter,' the air force said. During the almost three years since the war began Russia has regularly bombarded civilian areas of Ukraine, often in an attempt to cripple the power grid and unnerve Ukrainians. Meanwhile Ukraine, struggling to hold back Russia's bigger army on the front line, has attempted to strike Russian infrastructure supporting the country’s war effort. The Russian Ministry of Defense said the strike was in response to a Ukrainian missile attack on Russia's Rostov border region two days earlier. That attack used six American-made Army Tactical Missile System, known as ATACMS, missiles and four Storm Shadow air-launched missiles provided by the United Kingdom, it said. That day, Ukraine claimed to have targeted a Rostov oil refinery as part of its campaign to strike Russian infrastructure supporting the country's war effort. The use of Western-supplied weapons to strike Russia has angered the Kremlin. Ukraine fired several American-supplied longer-range missiles into Russia for the first time on Nov. 19 after Washington eased restrictions on their use. That development prompted Russia to use a new hypersonic missile, called Oreshnik, for the first time. President Vladimir Putin suggested the missile could be used to target government buildings in Kyiv, though there have been no reports of an Oreshnik being used for a second time. Answering the Ukrainian attack on Rostov on Wednesday, the Defense Ministry said it carried out a group strike with 'high-precision, long-range weapons' on the command center of Ukraine’s military intelligence agency and another location where it said Ukraine’s Neptune missile systems are designed and produced. The attack also targeted Ukrainian ground-based cruise missile systems and U.S.-made Patriot air defense systems, the Defense Ministry said. 'The objectives of the strike have been achieved. All objects are hit,' the defense ministry said in a Telegram post. Its claims could not immediately be verified. ___ This story has been corrected to show that Russia claimed Friday's attack was in response to a Ukrainian strike on Dec. 18, not earlier Friday. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-kyiv-missiles-47036510cfba6f0c58b490613d2e0ff1	2024-12-19T23:48:13-08:00	
Malaysia agrees to resume 'no find, no fee' hunt for flight MH370, 10 years after plane disappeared	KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) — Malaysia's government has agreed in principle to accept a second 'no find, no fee' proposal from a U.S. company to renew the hunt for flight MH370, which is believed to have crashed in the southern Indian Ocean more than 10 years ago, Transport Minister Anthony Loke said Friday. Loke said Cabinet ministers gave the nod at their meeting last week for Texas-based marine robotics firm Ocean Infinity to continue the seabed search operation at a new 15,000-square-kilometer (5,800-square-mile) site in the ocean next year. 'The proposed new search area, identified by Ocean Infinity, is based on the latest information and data analyses conducted by experts and researchers. The company’s proposal is credible,' he said in a statement. The Boeing 777 plane vanished from radar shortly after taking off on March 8, 2014, carrying 239 people, mostly Chinese nationals, on a flight from Malaysia’s capital, Kuala Lumpur, to Beijing. Satellite data showed the plane deviated from its flight path to head over the southern Indian Ocean, where it is believed to have crashed. An expensive multinational search failed to turn up any clues, although debris washed ashore on the east African coast and Indian Ocean islands. A private search in 2018 by Ocean Infinity also found nothing. Under the new deal, Ocean Infinity will get $70 million only if significant wreckage is discovered, Loke said. He said his ministry will finalize negotiations with Ocean Infinity in early 2025. The firm has indicated that January-April is the best period for the search, he said. 'This decision reflects the government’s commitment to continuing the search operation and providing closure for the families of MH370 passengers,' he added. Ocean Infinity CEO Oliver Punkett earlier this year reportedly said the the company had improved its technology since 2018. He has said the firm is working with many experts to analyze data and narrow the search area to the most likely site.	https://apnews.com/article/malaysia-missing-plane-mh370-14f8de88d4b74bb41a5f110434c52838	2024-12-19T23:19:57-08:00	
Giant sloths and mastodons coexisted with humans for millennia in Americas, new discoveries suggest	SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) — Sloths weren’t always slow-moving, furry tree-dwellers. Their prehistoric ancestors were huge — up to 4 tons (3.6 metric tons) — and when startled, they brandished immense claws. For a long time, scientists believed the first humans to arrive in the Americas soon killed off these giant ground sloths through hunting, along with many other massive animals like mastodons, saber-toothed cats and dire wolves that once roamed North and South America. But new research from several sites is starting to suggest that people came to the Americas earlier — perhaps far earlier — than once thought. These findings hint at a remarkably different life for these early Americans, one in which they may have spent millennia sharing prehistoric savannas and wetlands with enormous beasts. 'There was this idea that humans arrived and killed everything off very quickly — what’s called ‘Pleistocene overkill,’' said Daniel Odess, an archaeologist at White Sands National Park in New Mexico. But new discoveries suggest that 'humans were existing alongside these animals for at least 10,000 years, without making them go extinct.' Some of the most tantalizing clues come from an archaeological site in central Brazil, called Santa Elina, where bones of giant ground sloths show signs of being manipulated by humans. Sloths like these once lived from Alaska to Argentina, and some species had bony structures on their backs, called osteoderms — a bit like the plates of modern armadillos — that may have been used to make decorations. In a lab at the University of Sao Paulo, researcher Mírian Pacheco holds in her palm a round, penny-sized sloth fossil. She notes that its surface is surprisingly smooth, the edges appear to have been deliberately polished, and there’s a tiny hole near one edge. 'We believe it was intentionally altered and used by ancient people as jewelry or adornment,' she said. Three similar 'pendant' fossils are visibly different from unworked osteoderms on a table — those are rough-surfaced and without any holes. These artifacts from Santa Elina are roughly 27,000 years old — more than 10,000 years before scientists once thought that humans arrived in the Americas. Originally researchers wondered if the craftsmen were working on already old fossils. But Pacheco’s research strongly suggests that ancient people were carving 'fresh bones' shortly after the animals died. Her findings, together with other recent discoveries, could help rewrite the tale of when humans first arrived in the Americas — and the effect they had on the environment they found. 'There’s still a big debate,' Pacheco said. Scientists know that the first humans emerged in Africa, then moved into Europe and Asia-Pacific, before finally making their way to the last continental frontier, the Americas. But questions remain about the final chapter of the human origins story. Pacheco was taught in high school the theory that most archaeologists held throughout the 20th century. 'What I learned in school was that Clovis was first,' she said. Clovis is a site in New Mexico, where archaeologists in the 1920s and 1930s found distinctive projectile points and other artifacts dated to between 11,000 and 13,000 years ago. This date happens to coincide with the end of the last Ice Age, a time when an ice-free corridor likely emerged in North America — giving rise to an idea about how early humans moved into the continent after crossing the Bering land bridge from Asia. And because the fossil record shows the widespread decline of American megafauna starting around the same time — with North America losing 70% of its large mammals, and South America losing more than 80% — many researchers surmised that humans’ arrival led to mass extinctions. 'It was a nice story for a while, when all the timing lined up,' said paleoanthropologist Briana Pobiner at the Smithsonian Institution’s Human Origins Program. 'But it doesn’t really work so well anymore.' In the past 30 years, new research methods — including ancient DNA analysis and new laboratory techniques — coupled with the examination of additional archaeological sites and inclusion of more diverse scholars across the Americas, have upended the old narrative and raised new questions, especially about timing. 'Anything older than about 15,000 years still draws intense scrutiny,' said Richard Fariña, a paleontologist at the University of the Republic in Montevideo, Uruguay. 'But really compelling evidence from more and more older sites keeps coming to light.' In Sao Paulo and at the Federal University of Sao Carlos, Pacheco studies the chemical changes that occur when a bone becomes a fossil. This allows her team to analyze when the sloth osteoderms were likely modified. 'We found that the osteoderms were carved before the fossilization process' in 'fresh bones' — meaning anywhere from a few days to a few years after the sloths died, but not thousands of years later. Her team also tested and ruled out several natural processes, like erosion and animal gnawing. The research was published last year in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B. One of her collaborators, paleontologist Thaís Pansani, recently based at the Smithsonian Institution, is analyzing whether similar-aged sloth bones found at Santa Elina were charred by human-made fires, which burn at different temperatures than natural wildfires. Her preliminary results suggest that the fresh sloth bones were present at human campsites — whether burned deliberately in cooking, or simply nearby, isn’t clear. She is also testing and ruling out other possible causes for the black markings, such as natural chemical discoloration. The first site widely accepted as older than Clovis was in Monte Verde, Chile. Buried beneath a peat bog, researchers discovered 14,500-year-old stone tools, pieces of preserved animal hides, and various edible and medicinal plants. 'Monte Verde was a shock. You’re here at the end of the world, with all this organic stuff preserved,' said Vanderbilt University archaeologist Tom Dillehay, a longtime researcher at Monte Verde. Other archaeological sites suggest even earlier dates for human presence in the Americas. Among the oldest sites is Arroyo del Vizcaíno in Uruguay, where researchers are studying apparent human-made 'cut marks' on animal bones dated to around 30,000 years ago. At New Mexico's White Sands, researchers have uncovered human footprints dated to between 21,000 and 23,000 years ago, as well as similar-aged tracks of giant mammals. But some archaeologists say it’s hard to imagine that humans would repeatedly traverse a site and leave no stone tools. 'They’ve made a strong case, but there are still some things about that site that puzzle me,' said David Meltzer, an archaeologist at Southern Methodist University. 'Why would people leave footprints over a long period of time, but never any artifacts?' Odess at White Sands said that he expects and welcomes such challenges. 'We didn’t set out to find the oldest anything — we’ve really just followed the evidence where it leads,' he said. While the exact timing of humans’ arrival in the Americas remains contested — and may never be known — it seems clear that if the first people arrived earlier than once thought, they didn’t immediately decimate the giant beasts they encountered. And the White Sands footprints preserve a few moments of their early interactions. As Odess interprets them, one set of tracks shows 'a giant ground sloth going along on four feet' when it encounters the footprints of a small human who’s recently dashed by. The huge animal 'stops and rears up on hind legs, shuffles around, then heads off in a different direction.' ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.

For thousands of Jews, Israel still doesn't feel safe after the Oct. 7 attacks. So they're leaving	LONDON (AP) — Leaving Israel is easier, Shira Z. Carmel thinks, by saying it's just for now. But she knows better. For the Israeli-born singer and an increasing number of relatively well-off Israelis, the Oct. 7, 2023 Hamas attack shattered any sense of safety and along with it, Israel's founding promise: to be the world's safe haven for Jews. That day, thousands of Hamas militants blew past the country's border defenses, killed 1,200 people and dragged 250 more into Gaza in a siege that caught the Israeli army by surprise and stunned a nation that prides itself on military prowess. This time, during what became known as Israel's 9/11, the army didn't come for hours. Ten days later, a pregnant Carmel, her husband and their toddler boarded a flight to Australia, which was looking for people in her husband's profession. And they spun the explanation to friends and family as something other than permanent — 'relocation' is the easier-to-swallow term — acutely aware of the familial strain and the shame that have shadowed Israelis who leave for good. 'We told them we're going to get out of the line of fire for awhile,' Carmel said more than a year later from her family's new home in Melbourne. 'It wasn't a hard decision. But it was very hard to talk to them about it. It was even hard to admit it to ourselves.' Thousands of Israelis have left the country since Oct. 7, 2023, according to government statistics and immigration tallies released by destination countries such as Canada and Germany. There's concern about whether it will drive a 'brain drain' in sectors like medicine and tech. Migration experts say it's possible people leaving Israel will surpass the number of immigrants to Israel in 2024, according to Sergio DellaPergola, a statistician and professor emeritus of Hebrew University in Jerusalem. 'In my view, this year people entering will be smaller than the total of the exit,' he said. 'And this is quite unique in the existence of the State of Israel.' Early information points to a surge of Israelis leaving The Oct. 7 effect on Israeli emigration is enough for prominent Israelis to acknowledge the phenomenon publicly — and warn of rising antisemitism elsewhere. 'There is one thing that worries me in particular: talks about leaving the country. This must not happen,' former premier Naftali Bennett, a staunch critic of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, tweeted in June after a conversation with friends who were leaving. Israel, he wrote, needs to retain the talent. 'Who wants to return to the days of the wandering Jew, without real freedom, without a state, subject to every anti-Semitic whim?' Thousands of Israelis have opted to pay the financial, emotional and social costs of moving out since the Oct. 7 attack, according to government statistics and families who spoke to The Associated Press in recent months after emigrating to Canada, Spain and Australia. Israel's overall population continues to grow toward 10 million people. But it's possible that 2024 ends with more Israelis leaving the country than coming in. That's even as Israel and Hezbollah reached a fragile ceasefire along the border with Lebanon and Israel and Hamas inch toward a pause in Gaza. Israel’s Central Bureau of Statistics estimated in September that 40,600 Israelis departed long-term over the first seven months of 2024, a 59% increase over the same period a year earlier, when 25,500 people left. Monthly, 2,200 more people departed this year than in 2023, CBS reported. The Israeli Ministry of Immigration and Absorption, which does not deal with people leaving, said more than 33,000 people have moved to Israel since the start of the war, about on par with previous years. The interior minister refused to comment for this story. The numbers are equally dramatic in destination countries. More than 18,000 Israelis applied for German citizenship in 2024, more than double the same period in 2023 and three times that of the year before, the Interior Ministry reported in September. Canada, which has a three-year work visa program for Israelis and Palestinians fleeing the war, received 5,759 applications for work permits from Israeli citizens between January and October this year, the government told The Associated Press. In 2023, that number was 1,616 applications, and a year earlier the tally was 1,176 applications, according to Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada. ‘They want to wake up in the morning and enjoy life’ Other clues, too, point to a notable departure of Israelis since the Oct. 7 attacks. Gil Fire, deputy director of Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center, said that some of its star specialists with fellowship postings of a few years in other countries began to waver about returning. 'Before the war, they always came back and it was not really considered an option to stay. And during the war we started to see a change,' he said. 'They said to us, ‘We will stay another year, maybe two years, maybe more.’' Fire says it’s 'an issue of concern' enough for him to plan in-person visits with these doctors in the coming months to try to draw them back to Israel. Michal Harel, who moved with her husband to Toronto in 2019, said that almost immediately after the attacks the phone began ringing — with other Israelis seeking advice about moving to Canada. On Nov. 23, 2023, the couple set up a website to help Israelis navigate moving, which can cost at least 100,000 Israeli shekels, or about $28,000, Harel and other Israeli relocation experts said. Not everyone in Israel can just pack up and move overseas. Many of those who have made the move have foreign passports, jobs at multinational corporations or can work remotely. People in Gaza have even less choice. The vast majority of Gaza's 2.3 million people have been displaced by relentless Israeli bombing since Oct. 7, 2023, yet no one has been able to leave the enclave since May. Before then, at least 100,000 Palestinians are believed to have left Gaza. Health officials in Gaza say Israeli bombing has killed more than 45,000 people. Speaking by phone last month, Harel reported that the site has received views from 100,000 unique visitors and 5,000 direct contacts in 2024 alone. 'It's people who want to move quickly with families, to wake up in the morning and enjoy life,' she said. 'Right now (in Israel), it's trauma, trauma, trauma.' 'Some of them,' Harel added, 'they want to keep everything a secret.' Leaving Zion, a threat to Israel and a shame? Aliya — the Hebrew term for immigration, literally the 'ascent' of Jews into Israel — has always been part of the country's plan. But 'yerida' — the term used for leaving the country, literally the 'descent' of Jews from Israel to the diaspora, emphatically has not. For Israel's first decades of independence, the government strongly discouraged departing Israelis, who were seen in some cases as cowardly and even treasonous. A sacred trust and a social contract took root in Israeli society. The terms go — or went — like this: Israeli citizens would serve in the military and pay high taxes. In exchange, the army would keep them safe. Meanwhile, it’s every Jew’s obligation to stay, work and fight for Israel’s survival. 'Emigration was a threat, especially in the early years (when) there were problems of nation-building. In later decades, Israel became more established and more self-confident,' said Ori Yehudai, a professor of Israel studies at Ohio State University and the author of 'Leaving Zion,' a history of Israeli emigration. The sense of shame is more of a social dynamic now, he said, but 'people still feel they have to justify their decision to move.' Shira Carmel says she has no doubt about her decision. She'd long objected to Netanyahu's government's efforts to overhaul the legal system, and was one of the first women to don the blood-red 'Handmaid's Tale' robes that became a fixture of the anti-government protests of 2023. She was terrified as a new mom, and a pregnant one, during the Hamas attack, and appalled at having to tell her toddler that they were gathering in the bomb shelter for 'hugging parties' with the neighbors. This was not the life she wanted. Meanwhile, Australia beckoned. Carmel's brother had lived there for two decades. The couple had the equivalent of a green card due to Carmel's husband's profession. In the days after the attack, Carmel's brother alerted her to the possibility of a flight out of Israel for free, if on very short notice, which she confirmed with the Australian embassy in Israel. Basic logic, she says, pointed toward moving. And yet. Carmel recalls the frenzied hours before the flight out in which she said to her husband in the privacy of their bedroom: 'My God, are we really doing this?' They decided not to decide, opting instead for: 'We're just getting on a plane for now, being grateful.' They packed lightly. On the ground half a world away, weeks became months. And they decided: 'I’m not going to go back to try to give birth in the war.' In December, they told their families back in Israel that they were staying 'for now.' 'We don't define it as ‘forever,’' Carmel said Tuesday. 'But we are for sure staying for the foreseeable future.' ___ Associated Press writers Melanie Lidman in Jerusalem and Tia Goldenberg in Tel Aviv contributed to this report.

Gisele Pelicot's Australian supporters are moved that their French heroine wore an Aboriginal scarf	MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — A group of Gisele Pelicot’s Australian admirers said Friday they're moved that the victim in France’s notorious drugging-and-rape case has acknowledged her distant supporters Down Under by wearing a scarf adorned with Aboriginal art. The 71-year-old who refused to remain an anonymous victim wore the silk scarf several times during the court process in Avignon, including when 51 men were convicted and sentenced to prison for molesting her after she had been drugged by her former husband, Dominique Pelicot. The scarf was a 220 Australian dollar ($137) gift from a Sydney-based rights advocacy group, Older Women’s Network, its chief executive Yumi Lee said. 'We were astounded, absolutely gobsmacked, honored that she accepted our gesture of solidarity,' Lee said. Lee, 59, said her group with 1,000 members across New South Wales state, who campaign on issues including sexual violence, raised donations to buy the scarf in September when the court case was already underway. They decided on the gesture because Avignon, 17,000 kilometers (11,000 miles) from Sydney, was too distant for most to travel to demonstrate their support in person, Lee said. Gisele Pelicot 'has said that shame has to change sides and she wants all the victims of sexual assault to think that if she can do it, they can too,' Lee said. 'She has also proven that sexual assault knows no barriers. Everyone from young to old are victims of sexual assault. So she’s busted that myth,' Lee added. Lee said she was surprised that Gisele Pelicot’s lawyer wrote to her group to acknowledge the receipt of the scarf. 'Her lawyer wrote to us to say she has received it and was interested in the fact that it’s a First Nation’s design and that she will be wearing it in court. So she has worn it a few times,' Lee said. The scarf is a reproduction of the art of Indigenous painter Mulyatingki Marney. It depicts a cluster of saltwater pools known for their healing properties on Marney’s traditional land, the retailer One of Twelve said on its website. The Canberra-based business showcases art from the Asia-Pacific region and pays the artists royalties from the sales of scarves, ties and woven bags from Papua New Guinea called bilums. 'We picked this design because, number one, it’s beautiful, it’s got lovely colors, it’s drawn by a First Nations, older woman and it’s story about healing,' Lee said. One of Twelve owner Anna Saboisky said the attention Gisele Pelicot had brought to their scarf had overwhelmed the tiny business. A second print run of scarves had almost sold out and a third run was on the way. 'Since I woke up this morning, I’ve had about 20 orders placed online,' Saboisky said. 'We’re just a small business. It’s completely unprecedented to have so much interest in one scarf,' she added. Lee said if Avignon had not been so far away, 'we would be there shouting.' ,	https://apnews.com/article/australia-gisele-pelicot-indigenous-scarf-f286d7cd0d15ea9a446d3d9a3899db65	2024-12-19T21:45:46-08:00	
What to know about Vanuatu, the Pacific island nation struggling to recover from a massive quake	WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — A search expanded on Thursday for those killed or trapped alive by an earthquake in the Pacific island nation of Vanuatu, as rescue workers arriving from abroad fanned out through the capital, Port Vila, encountering flattened buildings that had not yet been searched. Three days after the violent magnitude 7.3 quake struck just offshore from Vanuatu's most populous island, uncertainty persisted about the number of people dead and wounded. Damage was concentrated in Port Vila’s downtown area and the official figure of 10 confirmed deaths and more than 200 people injured was a day old and likely to rise, officials said. Not all of those killed or hurt had been brought to a hospital and would not be included in the figures, aid agencies said. Some residents were scared to visit badly-damaged Vila Central Hospital, the main treatment facility. Nearly 1,000 people were displaced, according to United Nations figures. Aid workers estimated about 20,000 people were likely without water. Water shortage threatens a fresh crisis The biggest threat was the spread of illness from people drinking contaminated water, said Brecht Mommen, a UNICEF water, sanitation and hygiene specialist based in Vanuatu. 'It’s a rush against time to get water trucks organized for those areas so that we prevent a second disaster, which is a diarrhea outbreak,' he said. It was still unclear where broken pipes were located in the immense network servicing Port Vila and it was unknown how long it would take to find and fix them all, Mommen added. Rain and landslides slow relief efforts Relief efforts were hampered by blocked roads, traffic jams and patchy communications. Rain forecast in the next few days threatens to worsen landslides prompted by the quake. They included a major slip that has blocked Vanuatu’s sea port. The airport, currently open only for humanitarian flights, will resume commercial airline operations on Sunday, according to local news outlets. It prompted quiet hope for a return to normal among residents accustomed to life in one of the world’s most natural disaster-prone countries. But analysts said the problems that afflicted Vanuatu before Tuesday’s quake were likely to hinder recovery. A perilous island paradise Vanuatu is an scenic, sprawling archipelago covering a vast expanse of South Pacific Ocean that lies between Australia and Fiji. More than 80 coral and volcanic islands are home to 330,000 people. Perched on the Pacific ring of fire – a belt of tectonic plates and volcanoes – Vanuatu is regularly jolted by earthquakes, though none in living memory as large as Tuesday’s. The country is also among the world’s most imperiled by climate change. Earlier this month Vanuatu led a group of small island nations in a landmark case on the matter in the top United Nations court. The country's envoys argued that as rising seas threaten the existence of Vanuatu and other nations, major polluting countries should be ordered to take more responsibility for curbing their emissions. A struggle to lure tourists back Lush tropical forests and azure seas make the country a popular destination for holidaymakers from Australia and New Zealand, and tourism accounts for about 40% of the economy. The other major contributor is agriculture, with products exported or sold to tourist resorts. Disasters of recent years have frustrated its growth. Visitor numbers dwindled during the coronavirus pandemic and had barely started to recover before three major cyclones in 2023 dealt another blow. In May, the country’s national airline collapsed. Political uncertainty could stall recovery Vanuatu is currently led by a caretaker government after President Nikenike Vurobaravu dissolved Parliament in November as Prime Minister Charlot Salwai faced a no-confidence vote. Salwai, now the caretaker leader, is Vanuatu’s fourth Prime Minister in four years, with his predecessor toppled in a confidence vote in 2023 after a month in office. A snap election is due in January. 'This is one of the most turbulent political systems in this part of the world,' said Riley Duke, a Pacific analyst at the Lowy Institute, an Australian think tank. The political chaos has bred a 'permanent short-term focus', he said, and has deterred some funders of badly-needed development projects. Part of a bigger geopolitical contest Vanuatu has become part of a wider strategic battle for the Pacific in recent years as western countries seek to counter China’s growing influence. Australia is still Vanuatu’s biggest donor, but the government has increasingly looked to China to fund infrastructure and building projects including work this year on a presidential palace. In the process, it has amassed sizeable loans and was rated at high risk of debt distress by the International Monetary Fund before this week’s quake. 'There’s going to be a drive by the next government to secure additional financing, which opens the door to more interest in external financing,' said Duke. 'That obviously has secondary effects for geopolitics.'	https://apnews.com/article/vanuatu-earthquake-pacific-australia-china-recovery-5ad23ef3f4c869285475825234dd5b3e	2024-12-19T21:27:40-08:00	
US drops $10M terrorism bounty offered for capture of Syrian rebel leader who ousted Assad	DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) — The Biden administration said Friday it has decided not to pursue a $10 million reward it had offered for the capture of a Syrian rebel leader whose forces led the ouster of President Bashar Assad earlier this month. The announcement followed a meeting in Damascus between the leader of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, Ahmad al-Sharaa, who was once aligned with al-Qaida, and the top U.S. diplomat for the Middle East, Barbara Leaf, who led the first U.S. diplomatic delegation into Syria since Assad's ouster. HTS remains designated a foreign terrorist organization, and Leaf would not say if sanctions stemming from that designation would be eased. But, she told reporters that al-Sharaa had committed to renouncing terrorism and as a result the U.S. would no longer offer the reward. 'We discussed the critical need to ensure terrorist groups cannot pose a threat inside Syria or externally, including to the U.S. and our partners in the region,' she said. 'Based on our discussion, I told him that we would not be pursuing the Rewards for Justice reward offered,' Leaf said in a telephone news conference from Jordan where she traveled after visiting Syria. Leaf and other U.S. officials have said al-Sharaa’s public statements about protecting minority and women’s rights are welcomed, but they remain skeptical that he will follow through on them in the long run. 'He came across as pragmatic,' she said. 'It was a good first meeting. We will judge by deeds not just by words.' The US. delegation's visit was aimed at pushing for an inclusive government and seeking information on the whereabouts of missing American journalist Austin Tice. Along with Leaf, former special envoy for Syria Daniel Rubinstein and the Biden administration’s chief envoy for hostage negotiations, Roger Carstens, joined the meetings with interim leaders and members of civil society. Carstens said there was no new information confirming Tice's fate or whereabouts but vowed that efforts to find him would continue. He traveled previously to Lebanon to seek information. More U.S. officials are expected to visit Syria in the coming days to pick up the search, he said. 'We’re going to be like bulldogs on this,' Carstens said, adding that the U.S. was focusing on about six prisons where it believed Tice may have been held in the past. He said the U.S. also had information about three more prisons where Tice might have been incarcerated, and up to 40 sites may end up being examined for evidence of Tice’s presence. Tice, who has had his work published by The Washington Post, McClatchy newspapers and others, disappeared at a checkpoint in a contested area west of Damascus as the Syrian civil war intensified. A video released weeks after Tice went missing showed him blindfolded and held by armed men and saying, 'Oh, Jesus.' He has not been heard from since. Assad's government publicly denied that it was holding him. Leaf’s team was the first group of American diplomats to formally visit Syria in more than a decade, since the U.S. shuttered its embassy in Damascus in 2012, although a small number of U.S. diplomats had been assigned to political advisory roles with military units inside Syria since then. Shortly before the delegation arrived in Damascus, the U.S. military said it had conducted airstrikes in northeastern Syria on Thursday, killing a leader of the Islamic State group and one other militant. The strike was part of an ongoing effort to prevent IS insurgents from taking advantage of the upheaval in Syria, including any plan to release the more than 8,000 IS prisoners held in detention by Kurds who have partnered with the U.S., Central Command said in a statement. The Pentagon revealed Thursday that the U.S. had doubled the number of its forces in Syria to fight IS before Assad’s fall. There are roughly 2,000 there now. The diplomats' visit to Damascus will not result in the immediate reopening of the U.S. embassy, which is under the protection of the Czech government, according to U.S. officials, who said decisions on diplomatic recognition will be made when the new Syrian authorities make their intentions clear. ___ Lee reported from Washington.	https://apnews.com/article/syria-united-states-austin-tice-assad-de71dc4920d4677fcfb2d31a2b6e6e54	2024-12-19T20:33:13-08:00	
France's military is being ousted from more African countries. Here's why	DAKAR, Senegal (AP) — It's been a tumultuous month for France and its relationship with former colonies in Africa, as its influence on the continent faces the biggest challenge in decades. As Paris was devising a new military strategy that would sharply reduce its permanent troop presence in Africa, two of its closest allies struck a double blow. The government of Chad, considered France's most stable and loyal partner in Africa, announced on its Independence Day it was ending defense cooperation to redefine its sovereignty. And in an interview published hours later by Le Monde, Senegal's new president said it was 'obvious' that soon French soldiers wouldn't be on Senegalese soil. 'Just because the French have been here since the slavery period doesn’t mean it’s impossible to do otherwise,' President Bassirou Diomaye Faye said. The announcements came as France was making efforts to revive waning influence on the continent. Foreign minister Jean-Noël Barrot was completing a visit to Chad and Ethiopia, and President Emmanuel Macronfor the first time had recognized the killing of as many as 400 West African soldiers by the French Army in 1944. French authorities stayed silent for almost 24 hours after Chad’s announcement, finally saying they were in 'close dialogue' on the future of the partnership. 'Chad’s decision marks the final nail in the coffin of France’s post-colonial military dominance in the entire Sahel region,' said Mucahid Durmaz, a senior analyst at global risk consultancy Verisk Maplecroft, referring to the arid region south of the Sahara. The decisions by Senegal and Chad 'are part of the wider structural transformation in the region’s engagement with France, in which Paris political and military influence continues to diminish,' Durmaz added. They follow the ousting of French forces in recent years by military-led governments in Niger, Mali and Burkina Faso, where local sentiments turned sour following years of French forces fighting alongside local ones in the face of stubborn Islamic extremist insurgencies. What is France’s new strategy in Africa? Jean-Marie Bockel, Macron’s personal envoy for Africa, last month presented to Macron his report on the evolution of the French military presence in Africa. It was part of the 'renewal of our partnership with African countries' that Macron announced in a 2017 speech in Burkina Faso in the early days of his presidency. The details of Bockel's report have not been made public. But three French top officials, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive talks with the concerned countries, said France aimed for a sharp reduction of its military in all its bases in Africa except the Horn of Africa nation of Djibouti — where Macron is expected to travel in the coming days. The officials said it doesn’t mean France would necessarily reduce military cooperation but instead would respond to needs expressed by countries. It could mean providing more specific training in airspace surveillance or drones and other aircraft. France also could deploy troops on a temporary basis. The officials declined to confirm numbers of troop reductions but called it significant. The French army earlier this year also set up a command for Africa, similar to the U.S. AFRICOM. Newly appointed commander Pascal Ianni specializes in influence and information warfare — a need highlighted by Russia's growing presence in Africa. 'You can carry on your military cooperation like many countries do. But the idea of having permanent military bases, which then can be used as political ammunition against you and spun up in kind of a disinformation war, is maybe not the best way of going about things,' said Will Brown, a senior policy fellow at the European Center for Foreign Relations. Meanwhile, France is trying to boost its economic presence in Africa’s anglophone countries like Nigeria, analysts said. Already, its two biggest trading partners on the continent are Nigeria and South Africa. At the time of Chad’s announcement, Macron was hosting talks with Nigerian President Bola Tinubu. Where does France have troops in West Africa, and why? Since the independence of French colonies in Africa, France has maintained a policy of economic, political and military sway dubbed Françafrique, which included having thousands of permanent troops in the region. France still has 600 troops in Ivory Coast, 350 in Senegal and 350 in Gabon, as well as around 1,500 in Djibouti. It has had 1,000 troops in Chad. France's defense ministry said the role of French troops in Africa is to train local soldiers and reinforce their capacities to fight extremism, mainly in peacekeeping, intelligence and logistics. But critics say keeping boots on the ground also has allowed Paris to retain influence and protect political regimes favorable to France. 'The countries of Francophone Africa want a change in the nature of this relationship,' said Gilles Yabi, head of the West Africa Citizen Think Tank. Why are West African countries expelling French troops? Growing anti-French sentiment has led to street protests in several West and North African countries, while governments that gained power on pledges of redefining relationships with the West say ties with France have not benefited the population. They want to explore options with Russia, China, Turkey and other powers. Chad’s President Mahamat Deby 'would not have made this decision if he did not have security guarantees from another actor,' Brown said. 'We know he’s received serious support from the United Arab Emirates, who are very interested in what’s going on in neighboring Sudan and Darfur. We know that Turkey also made some outreach.' Chad borders four countries with Russian military presence. In January, Deby traveled to Moscow to reinforce relations with the 'partner country.' Military leaders of Niger, Mali and Burkina Faso who expelled the French military have moved closer to Russia, which has mercenaries deployed across the Sahel who have been accused of abuses against civilians. But the security situation has worsened in those countries, with increasing numbers of extremist attacks and civilian deaths from both armed groups and government forces. Over the first six months of this year, 3,064 civilians were killed, according to the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project, a 25% increase over the previous six months. It is impossible to say whether the departure of French forces led to the increased violence. But it created a 'huge security vacuum,' said analyst Shaantanu Shankar with the Economist Intelligence Unit, adding that it cannot be filled by Russia. Troops from the Russian private military company Wagner are being financed by the junta governments with fewer financial resources, he said.	https://apnews.com/article/france-chad-military-senegal-sahel-russia-85f2cf5066033db4b0bd044a7ed80438	2024-12-19T20:11:44-08:00	
The warm Turkish welcome for refugees is ending and Syrians are worried	GAZIANTEP, Turkey (AP) — Turkey gained renown as a haven for refugees by welcoming more than 3 million Syrians fleeing violence between forces from Bashar Assad ’s government and a patchwork of rebel groups. But the Syrian president’s ouster this month has led many in Turkey to argue that the refugees have no reason to stay, part of the global backlash against migration. Some Syrians are panicking about returning to a devastated nation. 'There’s no work, electricity, or water. There is no leader. Who will it be? I have no idea,' said Mahmut Cabuli, who fled airstrikes by Syrian government forces and violence by rebel groups in his hometown Aleppo a decade ago. 'I’m scared and don’t know what the authorities will do.' ‘My children were born here' Cabuli spent several years in a refugee camp before he found a job at a textile factory in Gaziantep, a southern Turkish city near the Syrian border. After he met another Syrian refugee, they married and had two children. 'My children were born here,' he said. 'I am working, thank God. I am happy here. I don’t want to go back now.' Many Turks baselessly accuse Syrians of taking their jobs and straining health care and other public services. Riots have damaged Syrian-owned shops, homes or cars, including one in July in the central city of Kayseri following allegations that a Syrian refugee sexually assaulted a child. The riots sparked counterprotests in northern Syria. Turkish authorities said that the alleged perpetrator was arrested and the victim placed under state protection. 'A spark between Syrians and Turkish citizens can immediately cause a big fire, a big flame,' said Umit Yılmaz, the mayor of Sehitkamil, which hosts 450,000 Syrians. 'The Syrians need to be reunited with their homeland immediately,' he said. 'I have come to a point where I am even willing to get in my own car and take them away if necessary.' Was staying in Turkey temporary or for good? In 2014, Turkish authorities gave Syrians universal access to health care, education and the right to work by granting them a legal status known as temporary protection. As a result, Turkey has taken in more Syrian refugees than any other nation — more than 3.8 million at its peak in 2022, or roughly 60% of all the Syrians logged by U.N. refugee agency UNHCR. But more recently, anti-refugee sentiment has surged as Turkey has grappled with problems including persistent inflation — particularly in food and housing — and with high youth unemployment. 'This prolonged stay under temporary protection must end,' said Azmi Mahmutoglu, spokesman for the Victory Party, a right-wing party that has opposed the presence of Syrians in Turkey and called for their repatriation. Hundreds of Syrians have gathered at border gates along Turkey’s 911-kilometer (566 mile) frontier with Syria since Assad's fall and the returns are expected to accelerate if Syria becomes stable. Metin Corabatir, director of the Ankara-based Research Centre on Asylum and Migration, said most of the departures so far appear to be Syrians checking the situation back in Syria before deciding whether to move their families back. Muhammed Nur Cuneyt, a 24-year-old Syrian who arrived in 2011 from the northern town of Azaz, was eagerly waiting at one gate on Dec. 10, saying he was grateful to Turkey for granting refuge but resented hearing anti-Syrian sentiment as his people fought Assad. 'Some were saying ‘Why are the Syrians here? Why don’t you go back and fight with your nation?’' he said. Are they voluntary returns? President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has sought ways to encourage the refugees’ voluntary returns — including building housing in Syria close to the Turkish border after Syrian migration helped weaken support for his Justice and Development party. Erdogan has four more years in office but the main opposition party has a slight lead in polls. One refugee who returned to Syria said that he had signed a document ending his protected refugee status under Turkish law. 'Would they be allowed to come back to Turkey? Corabatir said. 'Our hope is that it will continue.' This week, UNHCR said it does not believe that conditions to end Syrian’s refugee status have been met and it still thinks they need protection. But for Huseyin Basut, the Turkish owner of a pet shop in Gaziantep, Turkey has done all that it can for the Syrians. 'We did all we could as a country and as citizens,' said Bayut, 52. 'Since the war is over, they should return to their homes, build their homes or whatever they need to do and may God help them.' __ Fraser reported from Ankara, Turkey.

Turkey and Russia engage in delicate maneuvers over Syria after Assad’s downfall	The rapid downfall of Syrian leader Bashar Assad has touched off a new round of delicate geopolitical maneuvering between Russia's Vladimir Putin and Turkey's Recep Tayyip Erdogan. With the dust still settling from the stunning events in Damascus, the outcome for now seems to be favoring Ankara, which backed the victorious rebels, while Moscow suffered a bruising blow to its international clout. 'In the game of Czars vs. Sultans, this is Sultans 1 and Czars 0,' said Soner Cagaptay, director of the Turkish Research Program at the Washington Institute. 'Far from being allies, Turkey and Russia are competitors. And in this case, Turkey has outsmarted Russia.' The Assad regime’s demise opens another chapter in the complex relationship between Putin and Erdogan, with wide-ranging implications not just for Syria but also for Ukraine and the two leaders' ties with Washington. Russia and Turkey share economic and security interests — along with an intense rivalry. The personal relationship between Putin and Erdogan often sees them both praising each other, even as they jockey for political and economic gains. 'There are currently only two leaders left in the world -- there is me and there is Vladimir Putin,' Erdogan said recently, reflecting the respect for the Kremlin leader. Putin, in turn, has often praises Erdogan’s political prowess. Conflicts and deals Russia and Turkey backed opposing sides in Syria’s civil war that started in 2011, putting them on a collision course. Tensions spiraled when a Turkish fighter jet shot down a Russian warplane near the Turkey-Syria border in November 2015, soon after Moscow launched its air campaign to support Assad. The Kremlin responded with sweeping economic sanctions that halted Turkish imports, drove Turkish companies from the lucrative Russian market and cut the flow of Russian tourists to Turkey’s resorts. Faced with massive economic damage, Erdogan apologized months later. Soon after, Putin staunchly supported him when he faced an attempted military coup in July 2016, helping to warm ties quickly. In 2018, Moscow and Ankara negotiated a ceasefire and de-escalation deal for the rebel-held Idlib province in northwestern Syria on the border with Turkey and sought to anchor the often-violated agreement with follow-up deals in the next few years. But even as they cooperated on Syria, Moscow and Ankara also vied for influence in Libya, where Russia supported forces loyal to military commander Khalifa Hifter while Turkey backed his Tripoli-based foes. Turkey also aggressively sought to increase its leverage in the former Soviet Central Asian nations competing with Russia and China. In 2020, Moscow backed off when Turkey’s ally Azerbaijan routed ethnic Armenian forces in the fighting over the breakaway region of Karabakh. Even though Armenia hosted a Russian military base, the Kremlin has engaged in a delicate balancing act, seeking to maintain warm ties with both Azerbaijan and Turkey. While their political interests often clashed, economic ties boomed, with Russia boosting natural gas exports to Turkey via a Black Sea pipeline; by building Turkey’s first nuclear plant; and by providing the NATO member with advanced air defense systems — to Washington’s dismay. Relations amid the war in Ukraine Ties with Turkey grew even more important for Putin after he invaded Ukraine in 2022, Europe’s largest conflict since World War II. The West responded with economic sanctions that barred Russia from most Western markets, restricted its access to international financial system, shut transport routes and halted exports of key technologies. Turkey, which didn’t join the sanctions, has emerged as Russia’s key gateway to global markets, strengthening Erdogan’s hand in negotiations with Putin. While Turkey backed Ukraine’s territorial integrity and supplied Kyiv with weapons, Erdogan echoed Putin in accusing the U.S. and NATO of fomenting the conflict. Putin has praised Erdogan for offering to mediate a settlement. In March 2022, Turkey hosted Russia-Ukraine peace talks in Istanbul that soon collapsed, with both Putin and Erdogan blaming the West for their failure. Later that year, Ankara pooled efforts with the United Nations to broker a deal that opened the door for Ukrainian grain exports from its Black Sea ports, an agreement that helped drive down global food prices before falling apart the following year. Turkey’s balancing act in Ukraine is driven by its dependence on the vast Russian market, supplies of natural gas and a flow of tourists. Russia’s focus on Ukraine has eroded its clout in regions where Turkey and other players have tried to take advantage of Moscow's withering influence. In September 2023, Azerbaijan reclaimed control over all of Karabakh in an one-day blitz while Russian regional peacekeepers stood back. That hurt Russia’s ties with Armenia, which has shifted increasingly toward the West. Moscow's new look at Syria Focused on Ukraine, Russia had few resources left for Syria at a time when Hezbollah similarly pulled back its fighters amid the war with Israel and Iranian support for Assad also weakened. Russia tried to sponsor talks on normalizing relations between Turkey and Syria, but Assad stonewalled them, refusing any compromise. Assad’s intransigence helped trigger the Turkey-backed opposition’s offensive in November. The underfunded and demoralized Syrian army quickly crumbled, allowing the rebels to sweep across the country and capture Damascus. Even as it has offered asylum to Assad and his family, Russia has reached out to Syria's new leaders, seeking to ensure security for its troops still there and extend leases on its naval and air bases. At his annual news conference Thursday, Putin said Russia offered Syria's new leaders to use the bases for humanitarian aid deliveries and suggested Moscow could offer other incentives. While Assad's demise dealt a heavy blow to Russia, some believe Moscow could navigate the rapidly changing environment to retain at least some clout. 'Syria’s opposition forces well understand that the country’s future is uncertain,' said Nikolay Kozhanov, a consulting fellow with Chathan House’s Russia and Eurasia program, in a commentary. 'They want Russia, if not as a friend, then a neutral party.' He noted that 'Moscow’s main goal will be to maintain at least a minimal level of influence through a military presence, for example, at its existing bases, or through contacts with other regional players, such as Turkey.' Cagaptay observed that while Turkey would like to see an end to Russia’s military presence in Syria, Ankara’s position will depend on how relations evolve with Washington. 'If we see a reset in U.S.-Turkish ties where Turkey thinks it can comfortably lean on the U.S. against Russia, I can see Erdogan adopting a kind of more boisterous tone vis a vis Putin,' he said. But if the U.S. maintains its alliance with the Kurds and stands against Turkey’s effort to push back on Kurdish fighters in northeastern Syria, 'Ankara may decide that it needs to continue to play all sides as it has been doing for about a decade now,' Cagaptay said. Putin noted Russia understands Turkey's motives in securing its borders, but he also warned that the Kurds could offer strong resistance if attacked. Emre Ersen, a Russia expert at Istanbul’s Marmara University, also noted that while Assad’s fall will diminish Moscow’s influence, 'the relationship between Turkey and Russia will not be devastated by the events in Syria.' 'Obviously, they still need to reach out to each other regarding the crisis in Ukraine, but also because they have very significant economic relations,' Ersen said, adding that Erdogan could be expected to seek more concessions from Russia on energy and trade issues. ___ Suzan Fraser in Ankara, Turkey contributed.	https://apnews.com/article/russia-turkey-putin-erdogan-syria-assad-afbfc5a271438c0c61142f8cb9fcb6f4	2024-12-19T20:05:50-08:00	
Rising butter prices give European consumers and bakers a bad taste	PARIS (AP) — Pastry chef Arnaud Delmontel rolls out dough for croissants and pain au chocolat that later emerge golden and fragrant from the oven in his Paris patisserie. The price for the butter so essential to the pastries has shot up in recent months, by 25% since September alone, Delmontel says. But he is refusing to follow some competitors who have started making their croissants with margarine. 'It’s a distortion of what a croissant is,' Delmontel said. 'A croissant is made with butter.' One of life’s little pleasures — butter spread onto warm bread or imbuing cakes and seared meats with its rich flavor — has gotten more expensive across Europe in the last year. After a stretch of post-pandemic inflation that the war in Ukraine worsened, the booming cost of butter is another blow for consumers with holiday treats to bake. Across the 27-member European Union, the price of butter rose 19% on average from October 2023 to October 2024, including by 49% in Slovakia, and 40% in Germany and the Czech Republic, according to figures provided to The Associated Press by the EU's executive arm. Reports from individual countries indicate the cost has continued to go up in the months since. In Germany, a 250-gram (8.8-ounce) block of butter now generally costs between 2.40 and 4 euros ($2.49-$4.15), depending on the brand and quality. The increase is the result of a global shortage of milk caused by declining production, including in the United States and New Zealand, one of the world’s largest butter exporters, according to economist Mariusz Dziwulski, a food and agricultural market analyst at PKO Bank Polski in Warsaw. European butter typically has a higher fat content than the butter sold in the United States. It also is sold by weight in standard sizes, so food producers can’t hide price hikes by reducing package sizes, something known as ' shrinkflation.' A butter shortage in France in the 19th century led to the invention of margarine, but the French remain some of the continent's heaviest consumers of butter, using the ingredient with abandon in baked goods and sauces. Butter is so important in Poland that the government keeps a stockpile of it in the country's strategic reserves, as it does national gas and COVID-19 vaccines. The government announced Tuesday that it was releasing some 1,000 tons of frozen butter to stabilize prices. The price of butter rose 11.4% between early November and early December in Poland, and 49.2% over the past year to nearly 37 Polish zlotys, or $9 per kilo (2.2 pounds) for the week ending Dec. 8, according to the National Support Center for Agriculture, a government agency. 'Every month butter gets more expensive,' Danuta Osinska, a 77-year-old Polish woman, said while shopping recently at a discount grocery chain in Warsaw. She and her husband love butter — on bread, in scrambled eggs, in creamy desserts. But they also struggle to pay for medications on their meager pensions. So the couple is eating less butter and more margarine, even though they find the taste of the substitute spread inferior. 'There is no comparison,' Osinska said. 'Things are getting harder and harder.' The cost of butter in Poland has become a political issue. With a presidential election scheduled next year, opponents of centrist Prime Minister Donald Tusk are trying to blame him and his Civic Platform party. Other Poles want to blame the national bank's governor, who hails from an opposing political camp. Some consumers decide where to shop based on the price of butter, which has led to price wars between grocery chains that in some cases kept prices artificially low in the past to the detriment of dairy farmers, according to Agnieszka Maliszewska, the director of the Polish Chamber of Milk. Maliszewska thinks domestic, EU-specific and global issues explain butter inflation. She argues that the primary cause in Poland is a shortage of milk fat due to dairy farmers shutting down their enterprises because of slim profit markets and hard work. She and others also cite higher energy costs from Russia’s war in Ukraine as impacting milk production. There is some debate about the potential effect of climate change. Maliszewska doesn't see a link. Economist Dziwulski, however, thinks droughts may be a factor in reducing production. Falling milk prices last year also discouraged investments and pushed dairy producers in the EU to make more cheese, which offered better profitability, he said. An outbreak of bluetongue disease, an insect-borne viral disease that is harmless to humans but can be fatal for sheep, cows and goats, may also play a role, Dziwulski said. The U.S. saw a butter price spike in 2022, when the average price jumped 33% to $4.88 per pound over the course of the year, according to government data. Dairy farmers struggled with feed costs and hot temperatures. U.S. butter prices fell in 2023 before rising again this year, hitting a peak of $5 per pound in September. Higher grocery prices in general weighed on U.S. voters during the presidential election in November. Southern European countries, which rely far more heavily on olive oil, are less affected by the butter inflation — or they just don't consider it as important since they consume so much less. Since last year the cost of butter shot up 44% on average in Italy, according to dairy market analysis firm CLAL. Italy is Europe's seventh-largest butter producer, but olive oil is the preferred fat, even for some desserts. The price of butter therefore is not causing the same alarm there as it is in butter-addicted parts of Europe. Delmontel, the Paris pastry chef, said the rising costs put business owners like him under pressure. Along with refusing to switch out butter for margarine, he has not reduced the size of his croissants. But some other French bakers are making smaller pastries to control costs, he said. 'Or else you squeeze it out of your profit margin,' Delmontel said. ___ Gera reported from Warsaw, Poland.

Stock market today: Asian shares are mixed ahead of key US inflation data	HONG KONG (AP) — Asian shares were mixed Friday as markets awaited U.S. personal spending data for November that are due later in the day. U.S. futures and oil prices fell. Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 index was unchanged at 38,810.26 after the release of November inflation data on Friday. Japan's core inflation rate, which excludes fresh food prices, rose 2.7% year-on-year, surpassing expectations. The data followed the Bank of Japan's decision on Thursday to keep its benchmark rate at 0.25%, which pushed the dollar higher against the Japanese yen. The dollar was trading at 157.11 yen by early Friday, down from 157.43 yen but still higher than the average of 150 yen earlier this month. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong added 0.1% to 19,774.22 and the Shanghai Composite index gained 0.5% at 3,388.22 after China’s central bank kept its loan prime rates unchanged on Friday. The one-year lending rate, which affects corporate and most household loans, remained at 3.1%, while the five-year rate, used as a benchmark for mortgage rates, stayed at 3.6%. Australia’s S&amp;P/ASX 200 dipped 1.3% to 8,061.40. South Korea’s Kospi lost 1.7% to 2,393.60. On Thursday, the S&amp;P 500 edged 0.1% lower to 5,867.08. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose less than 0.1% to 42,342.24 following Wednesday’s drop of 1,123 points, while the Nasdaq composite slipped 0.1% to 19,372.77. This week’s struggles have taken some of the enthusiasm out of the market, which critics had been warning was overly buoyant and would need everything to go correctly for it to justify its high prices. But indexes remain near their records, and the S&amp;P 500 is still on track for one of its best years of the millennium with a gain of 23%. Traders are now expecting the Federal Reserve to deliver just one or maybe two cuts to interest rates next year, according to data from CME Group. Some are even betting on none. A month ago, the majority saw at least two cuts in 2025 as a safe bet. Wall Street loves lower interest rates because they give the economy a boost and goose prices for investments, but they can also provide fuel for inflation. Treasury yields were mixed a day after shooting higher on expectations that the Fed would deliver fewer cuts to rates in 2025. Reports on the U.S. economy came in mixed. One showed the overall economy grew at a 3.1% annualized rate during the summer, faster than earlier thought. The economy has remained remarkably resilient even though the Fed held its main interest rate at a two-decade high for a while before beginning to cut them in September. A separate report showed fewer U.S. workers applied for unemployment benefits last week, an indication that the job market also remains solid. But a third report said manufacturing in the mid-Atlantic region is unexpectedly contracting again despite economists’ expectations for growth. The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.57% from 4.52% late Wednesday and from less than 4.20% earlier this month. But the two-year yield, which more closely tracks expectations for action by the Fed in the near term, eased back to 4.31% from 4.35%. In other dealings, U.S. benchmark crude oil gave up 27 cents to $68.96 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude, the international standard, fell 42 cents to $72.46 per barrel. The euro fell to $1.0359 from $1.0367. ___ AP Business Writer Stan Choe contributed.	https://apnews.com/article/stocks-markets-inflation-japan-658f48959716b4d9b0c16481ff9f11db	2024-12-19T19:43:51-08:00	
For some, the pope's big Holy Year only aggravates housing crisis as overtourism pushes out Romans	When Pope Francis left the Vatican earlier this month for his traditional Christmastime outing downtown, he acknowledged what many Romans have been complaining about for months: That his big plans for a Holy Year had turned their city into a giant construction pit, with traffic-clogging roadworks tearing up major thoroughfares, scaffolding covering prized monuments and short-term rentals gobbling up apartment blocks. Francis urged Romans to pray for their mayor — 'He has a lot to do' — but to nevertheless welcome the upcoming Jubilee as a time of spiritual repair and renewal. 'These worksites are fine, but beware: Don’t forget the worksites of the soul!' Francis said. When he formally opens the Holy Year next week, Francis will launch a dizzying 12-month calendar of events that include special Jubilee Masses for the faithful from all walks of life: artists, adolescents, migrants, teachers and prisoners. And while the Jubilee’s official start means the worst of the construction headache is ending, the arrival of a projected 32 million pilgrims in 2025 is set to only increase congestion in the Eternal City and intensify a housing crunch that has been driving residents away. Like many European art capitals, Rome has been suffering from overtourism as the Italian travel sector rebounds from COVID-19: Last year, a record high number of people visited Italy, 133.6 million, with foreign tourists pushing Italy over the EU average in growth of the travel sector, national statistics bureau ISTAT reported. Rome, with its innumerable artistic treasures, the Vatican and Italy’s busiest airport, was the top city in terms of nights booked in registered lodging, ISTAT said. And yet for all its grande bellezze, Rome is hardly a modern European metropolis. It has notoriously inadequate public transportation and garbage collection. For the past two post-pandemic summers, taxis have been so hard to come by that the city of Rome authorized 1,000 new cab licenses for 2025. Rome’s growing housing crisis has gotten so bad that vigilantes have taken to going out at night with wire cutters to snip off the keyboxes on short-term apartment rentals that are blamed for driving up rents and driving out residents. 'The market is out of control and has definitely gotten worse with touristification, with the additional load of the Jubilee,' said Roberto Viviani, a university researcher whose landlord recently refused to renew his lease in favor of turning the apartment over to an agency to run as a holiday rental. 'The surprise was that he gave the Jubilee as the justification.' All of which has set the stage for a Jubilee opening Dec. 24 that is being received as something of a mixed bag. For the Vatican, the Holy Year is a centuries-old tradition of the faithful making pilgrimages to Rome every 25 years to visit the tombs of Saints Peter and Paul and receiving indulgences for the forgiveness of their sins in the process. For the city of Rome, it’s a chance to take advantage of some 4 billion euros ($4.3 billion) in public funds to carry out long-delayed projects to lift the city out of years of decay and neglect and bring it up to modern, European standards. But for Romans who have seen the short-term rental market take over neighborhoods like Pigneto, on the eastern flank of the capital, it's just another pressure point in a long-running battle to keep the flavor of their neighborhoods with affordable rents for ordinary Romans. 'The Jubilee has significantly worsened this phenomenon that we have seen, above all in the last months,' said Alberto Campailla, director of the association Nonna Roma, which has been slapping stickers 'Your BnB, our eviction' on Pigneto keyboxes to protest the growth of tourist rentals. Rome’s relationship with Jubilees dates to 1300, when Pope Boniface VIII inaugurated the first Holy Year in what historians say marked the definitive designation of Rome as the center of Christianity. Even then, the number of pilgrims was so significant that Dante referred to them in his 'Inferno.' Massive public works projects have long accompanied Holy Years, including the creation of the Sistine Chapel (commissioned by Pope Sixtus IV for the Jubilee of 1475) and the big Vatican garage (for the 2000 Jubilee under St. John Paul II). Some works have been controversial, such as the construction of Via della Concilliazione, the broad boulevard leading to St. Peter’s Square. An entire neighborhood was razed to make it for the 1950 Jubilee. The main public works project for the 2025 Jubilee is actually an extension of that boulevard: A pedestrian piazza along the Tiber linking Via della Conciliazione to the nearby Castel St. Angelo, with the major road that had separated them diverted to an underground tunnel. The project, at 79.5 million euros ($82.5 million) the most ambitious of the 2025 Jubilee works, ran into a predictable glitch over the summer when archaeological ruins were discovered during the dredging of the tunnel. The artifacts were transferred to the castle museum and the digging resumed, with the grand opening scheduled for Monday, the eve of the Jubilee’s start. Mayor Roberto Gualtieri has pointed to another feature of the 2025 projects that previous Jubilees have largely ignored, an emphasis on parks and 'green' initiatives, in keeping with Francis’ focus on environmental sustainability. But Francis himself has acknowledged the paradox of the Jubilee on the lives of everyday Romans. He wrote to Rome-area priests and religious orders earlier this year to ask them to 'make a courageous gesture of love' by offering up any unused housing or apartments in their increasingly empty convents and monasteries to Romans threatened with eviction. 'I want all diocesan realities that own real estate to offer their contribution to stem the housing emergency with signs of charity and solidarity to generate hope in the thousands of people in the city of Rome who are in a condition of precarious housing,' Francis wrote. Gualtieri has gone farther, demanding alongside other mayors that the national government pass the necessary norms to let them regulate the proliferation of short-term rentals, which have been blamed for reducing the available long-term rental stock and driving up prices on average 10% over the past year. 'This for us is an emergency because we need to prevent entire blocks of the center from emptying out and turning into B&amp;Bs, because the presence of residents in the center is fundamental,' Gualtieri said. But the Vatican’s point-man for the Jubilee, Monsignor Rino Fisichella, defended the Holy Year as part of Rome’s fabric and denied the influx of pilgrims was anything but a net gain for the city. 'As long as it has existed, Rome has always been called a ‘common home,’ a city that has always been open to everyone,' Fisichella said on the sidelines of a Jubilee promotional event. 'To think that Rome might reduce the presence of pilgrims or tourists would in my opinion inflict a wound that doesn’t belong to it.' ___ Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

AP Week in Pictures	Dec. 13 - 19, 2024 Community members in Wisconsin continued to wrestle with grief in the aftermath of a school shooting that killed a teacher and a student and wounded six others. France used ships and military aircraft to rush rescuers and supplies to Mayotte after the tiny French island territory off Africa was battered by its worst cyclone in nearly a century. After 51 men were convicted in the drugging-and-rape trial that riveted France and turned Gisele Pelicot into an icon, she expressed support for other victims whose cases don’t get such attention and 'whose stories remain untold.' Luigi Mangione, accused of killing UnitedHealthcare’s CEO, was whisked back to New York to face new federal charges of stalking and murder, which could bring the death penalty if he’s convicted.

Australia announces $118 million deal to enhance policing in Solomon Islands	MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — Australia announced on Friday it will pay for more police in Solomon Islands and create a police training center in the South Pacific island nation’s capital Honiara, where Chinese law enforcement instructors are already based under a bilateral security pact with Beijing. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said Australia would spend 190 million Australian dollars ($118 million) over four years on funding and training new Royal Solomon Islands Police Force recruits with a package that would 'reduce any need for outside support.' 'My government is proud to make a significant investment in the police force of the Solomon Islands to ensure that they can continue to take primary responsibility for security in the Solomons,' Albanese told reporters in Australia's capital Canberra. Albanese and his Solomons counterpart Jeremiah Manele said in a joint statement on Friday the package would build an enduring security capability in the Solomons, 'thereby reducing its reliance on external partners over time.' Australia has been energetically pursuing new bilateral security deals with its Pacific island neighbors since Beijing and the Solomons signed a security deal in 2022 under Manele’s predecessor, Manasseh Sogavare. That deal has created fears among U.S. allies including Australia that the Chinese navy will be allowed to build a base in the strategically important Solomons. Albanese’s Labor Party, which was the opposition at the time the pact was signed, described it as Australia’s worst foreign policy failure in the Pacific since World War II. Australia has recently signed security deals with Papua New Guinea, Tuvalu and Nauru that effectively give Canberra veto powers over any security deals those countries might want to strike with third nations including China. Asked if the new deal would require the Chinese security presence to be removed from the Solomons, Albanese did not directly answer. 'The Solomon Islands of course is a sovereign nation. They have some measures in place and we expect that to continue,' Albanese said. 'As a result of this agreement, what we’ve done is make sure that Australia remains the security partner of choice,' he added. Mihai Sora, a Pacific islands expert at the Lowy Institute, a Sydney-based international policy think tank, said the agreement was a 'clear win for Solomon Islands, which has gained a much-needed boost to its law and justice sector.' 'But Solomon Islands has not committed to scaling back the essentially permanent rotating presence of around 14 Chinese police trainers in the country, who have been running their own parallel training program with Solomon Islands police since 2022,' Sora said in an email. 'So, the agreement falls short of a solid strategic commitment to Australia from Solomon Islands, and there’s no indication that it would derail China-Solomon Islands security ties,' Sora added. Blake Johnson, an analyst at the Australian Security Policy Institute, a Canberra-based think tank, said Chinese policing in the Pacific gives Beijing tools to control Chinese expatriates and pursue other goals. 'They can be very heavy-handed in their response sometimes. There are also concerns around data and privacy risks associated with Chinese police in the region,' Johnson said. 'Sometimes they’re providing surveillance equipment. There are concerns about what that is being used for and what it’s capturing,' he added.	https://apnews.com/article/australia-solomon-islands-police-china-bfde14238c78a99fe9559011f77af8ed	2024-12-19T17:54:30-08:00	
Shamans refuse to evacuate precarious cliff-top shacks in Bolivia despite government order	EL ALTO, Bolivia (AP) — The view is dizzying from the row of small huts that dot one of the mountainsides surrounding Bolivia’s capital. Inside the precarious structures, Aymara shamans pray to the Andean gods to protect them from the threat of collapse. In recent years, the erosion of the mountain range around La Paz has accelerated due to the effects of climate change. A month ago, a mudslide buried an entire neighborhood and killed a girl. This has created a conflict between the shamans and Bolivia’s government, which has ordered the area evacuated. 'The slope is wearing away,' said Gabriel Pari, secretary of water and sanitation for the El Alto municipality, where the huts are located. But, he added, the shamans insist 'they perform rituals to prevent this from happening and refuse to leave. The area is highly risky. They say they have been here for more than 60 years, and nothing has happened.' The site is not a rock formation but a sandy and clay-like soil, according to geological studies. The area has been sacred to the Aymara Indigenous people since pre-Hispanic times. During colonial times, the shamans performed rituals on this summit before entering the city with their llama caravan carrying agricultural products. Pari said the huts function as a workplace for the shamans, who do not live there but often spend the night in the small structures. A sign on the door of Tiburcio Condori’s hut details the services he offers: He sees the future in coca leaves and playing cards. He also cures illnesses and heartaches, makes offerings for success in business and health, and cleanses energy to heal the body and spirit. A bonfire burns outside. The air smells of incense. 'This is solid ground; it will not fall. That is what the coca leaf and Pachamama tell us,' Condori, who has worked as a shaman and spiritual guide for more than 20 years, said using the Indigenous community’s word for Mother Earth. Condori has no plans to evacuate the area, and neither does Ana Chinahuanca. She is among the 100 shamans who work on the cliff, charging around $2 for reading fortunes in coca leaves and up to 15 for energy cleansings. 'They are giving bad information,' Chinahuanca said of the danger warnings. 'This place is safe.'	https://apnews.com/article/bolivia-shamans-cliff-evacuation-erosion-rain-2a75fb555e0066f4d675b015e6e92b15	2024-12-19T13:12:18-08:00	
Chinese national charged with acting as Beijing's agent in local California election	WASHINGTON (AP) — A Chinese national was arrested Thursday on charges of acting as an illegal agent for Beijing when serving as the campaign manager for an unnamed politician elected to a city council in Southern California two years ago. The arrest of Yaoning 'Mike' Sun, 64, came at a time of rising concerns that the Chinese government has cultivated a network of operatives to influence local elections in the U.S. to install politicians who are friendly to Beijing and can help promote Chinese interests. According to a complaint filed Tuesday in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, Sun is accused of conspiring with Chen Jun, who was sentenced to 20 months last month for acting as an illegal agent of the Chinese government. Chen, 71, also a Chinese national, pleaded guilty in July to using Chinese money to bribe federal agents to undermine the anti-Beijing spiritual group Falun Gong. The charge against Sun shows that Chen also conspired to interfere with local elections. It wasn't immediately clear if Sun had a lawyer who could speak on his behalf. Sun was instructed by Chen to write up a report in 2023 to recount to Chinese officials how they helped the local politician get elected, according to the affidavit. Subsequent writings between the two men described the city councilperson as a 'new political star' and included a request for $80,000 to fund more pro-Beijing activities in the United States, according to the court documents. Chen asked Sun to list all the mainstream American politicians the city councilperson was familiar with and told Sun that it would be 'very effective to elevate' the status of the councilperson in China. 'This case is yet another example of a very disturbing trend: the People's Republic of China is seeking to influence foreign and domestic policy in the United States,' Martin Estrada, U.S. attorney for the Central District of California, said in a call with reporters. 'To do so, government officials in China are seeking to help get elected individuals who they see as being friendly to Chinese foreign policy.' The charges against Sun followed those against a former aide to two New York governors in September. Authorities have accused Linda Sun of acting as an illegal agent of the Chinese government and using her positions to subtly advance Beijing’s agenda in exchange for financial benefits worth millions of dollars. In California, Estrada said Yaoning Sun appeared to be ideologically invested in furthering the interests of the Chinese government in the United States, noting that he had previously served in the Chinese military. The complaint does not specify financial gains for Yaoning Sun, who probably is not related to Linda Sun because they share a common Chinese name. In the affidavit, it's alleged that Yaoning Sun, a resident of Chino Hills outside Los Angeles, also ran a media outlet called the 'U.S. News Center' with the councilperson and paid for some of the politician's travel expenses. Prosecutors say Sun worked closely with Chen, who appeared to be in regular contact with Chinese officials. Their communications included how to protest a U.S. congressperson's proposed visit to Taiwan, a self-governed island that Beijing sees as part of Chinese territory. The men discussed how to set up a meeting for the politician to meet with the top Chinese diplomat in Los Angeles and arrange travel plans for the politician to visit China. ___	https://apnews.com/article/china-election-interference-california-yaoning-mike-sun-194aaaa29afea6dda9b55e8cb1cd0c44	2024-12-19T12:08:10-08:00	
2 more Mexican soldiers killed by an improvised landmine, after 2 died earlier this week	MEXICO CITY (AP) — Two more members of Mexico’s armed forces have been killed by an improvised landmine, just days after two soldiers died in a similar blast, officials confirmed Thursday. The blasts, both in the western state of Michoacan, mark an unprecedented one-week death toll from improvised explosive devices, or IEDs, planted by drug cartels in Mexico. Carlos Torres, the interior secretary of Michoacan, said the devices, often described as powerful pipe bombs, were apparently planted around drug labs or cartel encampments. But he suggested the bombs may have been intended to ward off rival gangs, and not necessarily aimed at killing members of the armed forces. 'They place this kind of device around certain key areas, like (drug) labs or like encampments or places where organized crime exists, for their enemies or adversaries,' Torres said. The Michoacan state government said one of the victims in the most recent blast Wednesday was an army sergeant, and the other a member of the National Guard. Torres said they died while on patrol in a southern area of the state dominated by the Jalisco drug cartel. The National Guard is a militarized force that often patrols with the army and often includes active-duty soldiers in its ranks. On Monday, two soldiers were killed in a similar explosion and five others were wounded in another part of the state dominated by the United Cartels gang. Torres said more improvised mines have been located and deactivated. The Jalisco cartel has been locked in a bloody, years-long turf battle with the United Cartels — mainly made up of a gang known as the Viagras — for control of Michoacan, which is home to both labs producing synthetic drugs like methamphetamine, and Pacific coast ports used to smuggle in drugs and the precursor chemicals used to make them. The army had previously acknowledged suffering only six deaths from IEDs between 2018 and 2024. Previous attacks on law enforcement have also included the use of bomb-dropping drones, and the army did not confirm whether the six previous deaths over the last six years were from drones or roadside bombs, or both. Torres said that in the area around Buenavista, Michoacan, in the state's southern hot lands — where Wednesday's explosion occurred — the gangs had been known to use both landmines and small bombs dropped by drones. At leas t some civilians have also been killed by the devices. Defense Secretary Gen. Ricardo Trevilla said Tuesday that devices like the one that exploded Monday were 'very rustic.' But his description of the scene where the two soldiers died Monday suggested that it may have been a sort of grisly booby trap. Trevilla said the army sent out a patrol to check on reports of an encampment of armed men in a rural area. The armed forces detected an area protected by stockades that appeared to be an encampment, but when soldiers approached in vehicles, they found the trail blocked by logs, so they got out and had to approach on foot. While approaching, they spotted three dismembered bodies near the encampment, which appeared to be abandoned. But as they drew closer, a buried device exploded and struck the soldiers. In the only previous detailed report on cartel bomb attacks in August 2023, the Mexican defense department said at that time that a total of 42 soldiers, police and suspects were wounded by IEDs in the first seven and a half months of 2023, up from 16 in all of 2022.	https://apnews.com/article/mexico-explosives-soldiers-killed-ieds-bomb-michoacan-de63fe119d1d0f32154b1b47b9113a01	2024-12-19T11:18:15-08:00	
Israel and Hamas appear close to a ceasefire deal. These are the sticking points	CAIRO (AP) — Israel and Hamas appear closer than they have been in months to agreeing to a ceasefire that could wind down the 14-month war in Gaza and bring home dozens of people held hostage there. But the sides have come close before, only to have talks collapse over various disagreements. This round of negotiations also faces hurdles. The agreement would take place in phases and include a halt in fighting, an exchange of captive Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners, and a surge in aid to the besieged Gaza Strip, according to Egyptian, Hamas and American officials. The last phase would include the release of any remaining hostages, an end to the war and talks on reconstruction. Although Israel and Hamas have expressed optimism that a deal is close, key sticking points remain over the exchange of hostages for prisoners and the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza, people involved in the talks say. 'They are working through the names of hostages who would come out in the first phase — the names of the prisoners that would be released as part of the exchange. And then some specific details about the disposition of Israeli forces during the ceasefire,' White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said Wednesday on MSNBC's 'Morning Joe.' Here’s a closer look at the key issues holding up a deal: Hostage release During its Oct. 7, 2023, attack on southern Israel, Hamas and other groups took about 250 people hostages and brought them to Gaza. A previous truce in November 2023 freed more than 100 hostages, while others have been rescued or their remains have been recovered over the past year. Israel says about 100 hostages remain in Gaza — at least a third of whom it believes were killed during the Oct. 7 attack or died in captivity. The warring sides are haggling over which hostages would be included in an initial release, according to the Egyptian and Hamas officials who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were discussing ongoing negotiations. There have also been disputes about how many hostages will be included, Israeli media reported.. The first batch is expected to be made up mostly of women, older people and people with medical conditions. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also is facing growing pressure from the families of hostages to secure a deal that would release all of them at once. They fear the deal could break down or that loved ones who aren't immediately released could die in captivity. Palestinian prisoners As part of the deal, Israel is expected to free hundreds of imprisoned Palestinians, including dozens who were convicted in bloody attacks. Israel has a history of lopsided prisoner releases, and hundreds were freed in the November 2023 deal. But the officials who spoke to the AP say the sides still disagree over the exact number and names of the prisoners to be freed. Hamas wants high-profile prisoners included. Netanyahu's governing coalition includes hardliners who oppose such releases, with some even pledging to quit the government if too many concessions are made. They point to a 2011 prisoner release that included the former Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, a mastermind of the Oct. 7 attacks who was killed by Israel in October. Israeli media have also reported that there are differences over whether the more serious prisoners who are released will be exiled to third countries. Palestinians returning home The war has displaced an estimated 90% of Gaza’s 2.3 million people, according to U.N. estimates, with the hard-hit northern sector of the territory largely emptied of its prewar population. During the first phase of the developing deal, Israel is expected to withdraw troops from Palestinian population centers and allow some of the displaced to return home. But the extent of the pullback and the number of people allowed to return must still be worked out, the officials say. According to the Egyptian and Hamas officials, Israel is prepared to allow people to return north to Gaza City, the territory's largest city. But it does not want people to return farther north to areas close to the Israeli border. Israeli troops remain active in these areas, battling what Israel says are pockets of insurgency. Israel appears concerned that militants could renew attacks from there if the displaced are allowed to return. But critics say Israel has other intentions. Netanyahu has considered a controversial proposal by former generals to empty the north and cut it off from humanitarian aid as part of a plan to starve out any militants who remain there. Moshe Yaalon, a former Israeli defense minister, said Israel was carrying out ethnic cleansing in those areas of northern Gaza. Netanyahu has also said Israel must maintain long-term control over a strategic strip of land along Gaza's border with Egypt, as well as the freedom for Israeli troops to operate against militants in the future. Hamas is demanding a full withdrawal as part of any ceasefire. In an interview Thursday, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the U.S. remains hopeful that a deal can be finalized before President Joe Biden leaves office on Jan. 20. 'Everyone is pushing on this,' Blinken told MSNBC. 'We want to get it over the finish line. We want to get the hostages home. We want to get a ceasefire so that people can finally have relief in Gaza.' ___ Goldenberg reported from Tel Aviv, Israel.

Pentagon says it doubled the number of US troops in Syria before Assad's fall	WASHINGTON (AP) — The United States doubled the number of its forces in Syria to fight the Islamic State group before the overthrow of President Bashar Assad’s government, the Pentagon said Thursday. The U.S. had previously said 900 troops were in Syria, but Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder, the Pentagon press secretary, announced that 2,000 were there and had been for a while. The Pentagon had been asked repeatedly in recent days and weeks about the U.S. presence in Syria and never disclosed the dramatic increase. Ryder said the additional forces had been in Syria 'at a minimum months — it’s been going on for awhile.' He told reporters the increase in forces was temporary and they are there to augment the U.S. operations against the Islamic State group. He said U.S. Army conventional and special operations forces make up the bulk of the additional troops. Rebel forces overthrew Assad two weeks ago. In the days since, Israel and Turkey have both launched military operations inside Syria's borders, including Tel Aviv's airstrikes against weapons facilities in the east that belonged to Assad's regime and Turkey's offensive in the northeast against Kurdish forces, who have partnered with the U.S. in its fight against the Islamic State. The U.S. also has significantly stepped up airstrikes against IS targets in Syria over concern that a power vacuum would allow the militant group to reconstitute itself. Until Thursday, the Pentagon had insisted there had been no change to the U.S. force numbers in Syria, even as questions arose as to whether the new instability there has put the U.S. mission in jeopardy. President-elect Donald Trump tried to withdraw forces from Syria during his first term, which drove former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis to resign in protest, and as he prepares to return to the White House, Trump has said he does not support U.S. forces getting more involved in Syria.	https://apnews.com/article/syria-us-troops-assad-tice-israel-35ac28d9c95a568828986da011bc02f1	2024-12-19T11:14:12-08:00	
Biden expected to visit Pope Francis in final international trip of his presidency, AP sources say	WASHINGTON (AP) — The White House is expected to announce soon that President Joe Biden will visit the Vatican to meet with Pope Francis next month for what would likely be the final international trip of his presidency, according to three people familiar with the matter. They spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the White House deliberations. Asked about the potential Vatican visit, White House officials declined to comment. Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni also declined to confirm or deny any visit, noting that Vatican policy is only to announce papal audiences with visiting heads of state a few days before they occur. Overseas visits this late in a U.S. presidency aren't typical. The last president to travel overseas in the final month of his presidency was fellow one-termer George H.W. Bush, who traveled in early January 1993 to Moscow to sign a nuclear treaty and to Paris for talks with French President François Mitterrand about the Bosnian war, according to State Department historical records. Biden, a practicing Roman Catholic, last met privately with Pope Francis earlier this year while in Italy for the Group of Seven leaders meeting. He also met with Pope Francis at the Vatican in 2021, when they had a wide-ranging conversation about climate change, poverty and the coronavirus pandemic. Their warm conversation also touched on the loss of the president’s adult son Beau, who died of cancer in 2015, and included jokes about aging well. Biden's support for abortion rights and same-sex marriage has put him at odds with many U.S. bishops, some of whom have suggested he should be denied Communion. But following the Vatican meeting in 2021, Biden said Francis called him a 'good Catholic' who should keep receiving Communion. While in Rome, Biden could take advantage of being at the Vatican during the Holy Year, which officially opens on Christmas Eve. Holy Years are generally celebrated every 25 to 50 years, and over the centuries have been used to encourage the faithful to make pilgrimages to Rome to pray at the tombs of Saints Peter and Paul and obtain an indulgence — the ancient church tradition related to the forgiveness of sins that roughly amounts to a 'get out of Purgatory free' card. Pilgrims who pass through the Holy Door of St. Peter’s Basilica can obtain the indulgence, and the Vatican is expecting some 32 million people will flock to Rome over 2025 to participate in the pilgrimage. ___ Winfield reported from Rome.

Canada's Trudeau to shuffle his Cabinet Friday amid resignation calls and rising discontent	TORONTO (AP) — Embattled Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau will shuffle his Cabinet Friday, a senior official familiar with the matter said Thursday. The official confirmed the shuffle and spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to speak publicly on the matter. Trudeau is facing rising discontent over his leadership, and the abrupt departure of his finance minister on Monday could be something he can’t recover from. A rising number of Liberal lawmakers are calling on Trudeau to resign but new Finance Minister Dominic LeBlanc said Thursday Trudeau has 'full support of his Cabinet.' LeBlanc said he respects the views of Liberal Members of Parliament who want Trudeau to resign. 'That's a view they are expressing. The prime minister listened carefully when that view was expressed to him,' LeBlanc said. 'He listened, in some cases responded to specific things that were raised, and he said he would reflect carefully.' LeBlanc said the government will remain focused on work and addressing the threat by President-elect Donald Trump to impose a 25% tariff on all Canadian products when he is inaugurated next month. Trudeau has led the country for nearly a decade, but has become widely unpopular in recent years over a wide range of issues, including the high cost of living and rising inflation. There is no mechanism for Trudeau’s party to force him out in the short-term. He could resign, or his Liberal party could be forced from power by a 'no confidence' vote in Parliament that would trigger an election that would very likely favor the opposing Conservative Party. As rising numbers of Liberal lawmakers called Tuesday for Trudeau to resign, the country’s minister of natural resources, Jonathan Wilkinson, said 'we all need to give him a little time to reflect.' Concerns about Trudeau’s leadership were exacerbated Monday when Chrystia Freeland, Trudeau's finance and deputy prime minister, resigned from the Cabinet. Freeland was highly critical of Trudeau’s handling of the economy in the face of steep tariffs threatened by Trump. Shortly before Freeland announced her decision, the country’s housing minister also quit. Because Trudeau's Liberals don’t hold an outright majority in the Parliament, they have for years depended on the support of the leftist New Democratic Party to pass legislation and stay in power. But that support has all but vanished — the NDP’s leader has called on Trudeau to resign — and that might clear the way for Parliament to vote 'no confidence.' NDP leader Jagmeet Singh, however, would not commit to bringing down the government at the first opportunity in part because Trump could impose crippling tariffs and Parliament might need to respond with tariffs in retaliation. Parliament is now shut for the holidays until late next month, and a 'no confidence' vote could be scheduled sometime thereafter.	https://apnews.com/article/trudeau-canada-cabinet-shuffle-a949a1c13aff2ccb73cf55678be4fbce	2024-12-19T09:09:26-08:00	
Syrian villagers near the Golan Heights say Israeli forces are banning them from their fields	Israeli forces have set up a position in an abandoned Syrian army base in the village of Maariyah and prevented local farmers from accessing their fields, residents said Thursday. Associated Press journalists who visited the area saw the Israeli troops from a distance and watched a local resident waving a white flag approach to speak with them. The village, on the western edge of Syria's southern Daraa province, is near the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, but outside of a buffer zone in the Golan established by a 1974 ceasefire agreement between Syria and Israel. Abdel Raouf Issa, a resident of Maariyah, said the Israeli military had penetrated about 1 kilometer (two-thirds of a mile) into the village and 'is demanding that we hand over all weapons to the occupation. We told them that we have no weapons at all.' 'They prevented us from farming. They prevented us from moving,' he said. 'We call on the United Nations to remove the occupation as soon as possible.' Kamal Saleh Damara, a local official in the village, said, 'Thank God, we were happy that HTS came,' referring to Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the main insurgent group in the coalition that unseated Assad. 'But then Israel came, and it is preventing people from coming and going and moving.' The Israeli military said in a statement that it is 'operating within the buffer zone and in several additional locations in its proximity to ensure the security of Israel's northern border.' It declined to comment on specific locations where its troops are deployed. Israel seized a swath of southern Syria along the border with the Israeli-annexed Golan Heights shortly after Syrian President Bashar Assad was ousted by rebels on Dec. 8. The capture of the buffer zone, a roughly 400-square-kilometer (155-square-mile) demilitarized area in Syrian territory, has sparked condemnation, with critics accusing Israel of violating a 1974 ceasefire and exploiting the chaos in Syria in the wake of Assad’s ouster to make a land grab. Israel seized control of the Golan Heights from Syria in the 1967 Mideast war and later annexed it — a move not recognized by most of the international community On Wednesday, a group of residents and dignitaries from the buffer zone in Quneitra province put out a statement complaining that the Israeli forces had forcibly displaced the residents of some villages although they 'showed restraint toward the advancing forces and did not resist them.' However, they said some residents were later allowed to return The statement called for Israeli forces to withdraw 'especially from vital facilities such as the Quneitra provincial government building, the main roads and the water wells and tanks serving the area.' Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Tuesday that Israeli forces will stay there until another arrangement is in place 'that ensures Israel’s security.' Netanyahu made the comments from the summit of Mount Hermon — the highest peak in the area — inside Syria, about 10 kilometers (6 miles) from the border with Golan Heights. ———- Associated Press writers Julia Frankel in Jerusalem and Abby Sewell in Damascus contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/syria-golan-hieghts-israel-daraa-maariyah-occupied-d3404840f0d47ff88714938f1aa8a683	2024-12-19T08:57:40-08:00	
Brady Corbet and 'The Brutalist' go for broke	NEW YORK (AP) — Brady Corbet’s 'The Brutalist' emerged less like a new film worth checking out than a movie colossus to behold. Corbet’s visionary three-and-a-half-hour postwar American epic, shot in VistaVision, has taken on the imposing aura of its architect protagonist’s style. Little about it is tailored to today’s more prescribed movie world. It even has an intermission. And yet 'The Brutalist' isn’t just one of the most acclaimed films of the year, it’s edged perilously close to the mainstream. For Corbet, the 36-year-old director, it’s a surprising turn of events. His 215-minute movie, he thought, was surely destined for cult-movie status. 'It’s a great reminder that anything can be mainstreamed,' Corbet says. 'That gives me real hope for the future of the medium. Six months ago, the powers that be, many people were telling me that the film is un-distributable.' Corbet, sitting in the offices of A24, which acquired his film out of the Venice Film Festival, smiles. 'I was definitely not so popular with people as recently as August.' Yet since its arrival at Venice in September, 'The Brutalist' has emerged as a major Oscar contender. Last week, it was nominated for seven Golden Globes. Numerous critics groups have named it the best film of the year. But Corbet and 'The Brutalist' are aiming higher than awards-season success. 'The Brutalist' is a grand bid to bring some visionary bravado back to movies. Corbet, who was an actor in films by Michael Haneke, Olivier Assayas and Lars von Trier before committing to directing, believes film is stuck in a stasis. In a movie world ruled by safe bets and streaming imperatives, 'The Brutalist' dares to go for broke. 'I struggle a lot with movies from the last 20, 30 years,' says Corbet, who has some of the candid swagger of earlier American auteurs. 'There’s many exceptions. But there aren’t as many as there should be. I just feel that they’re perfunctory — narratively perfunctory, stylistically. There are no big swings.' 'The Brutalist,' written by Corbet and his partner, the filmmaker Mona Fastvold, operatically unfolds the fictional story of László Tóth ( Adrien Brody ), a Hungarian architect who, having survived Nazi concentration camps, emigrates to Pennsylvania. He’s scraping by in a working class life when his renovation of a library for a wealthy industrialist, Harrison Lee Van Buren (Guy Pearce), propels him back into architecture. Van Buren becomes László’s benefactor, commissioning him to build a sprawling institute. Their relationship, as patron and artist, grows increasingly tense and disturbed. 'The Brutalist' evolves as a grim character study and sweeping psychodrama about the rapaciousness of American capitalism. It's also a pointed critique of Hollywood. For Corbet and Fastvold, some of the movie’s central dynamic came out of their previous film, ' Vox Lux,' which starred Natalie Portman as a pop star whose fame is born out of a school shooting. The swelling ranks of financiers, Corbet says, made him miserable. 'Our experience on ‘Vox’ was really, really difficult for a variety of reasons. It was much more inside the Hollywood process and that’s partially just because it was shot inside the States,' says Corbet. 'After I made that film, I was like: I’m never working in the United States again. I was just being harassed by the powers that be daily. I remember at one point having a driver drive me around the block so that no one could be in my ear while I was at the monitor.' Fastvold and Corbet, who live in New York with their 10-year-old daughter, shot 'The Brutalist' in Hungary. If the movie is a self-conscious stab at resurrecting some of the visionary spirit of American moviemaking, it’s also a commentary on some of the forces that constrict it today. 'This is the closest we will ever get to making a film about making movies,' says Fastvold. 'We didn’t have a Van Buren but we certainly had our fill of complicated relationships with the people who hold the purse strings.' She adds: 'In the complicated relationship between the patron and the artist, there’s this sense of: I have ownership of the project because I’m paying for it and I almost have ownership of you.' Making 'The Brutalist' wasn’t a piece of cake, either. It took some seven years in total. When Corbet, behind sunglasses, reflected on that struggle at the movie’s Venice press conference, his voice quivered with emotion. Remarkably, it was accomplished with a budget less than $10 million — considerably less than the film’s scope would suggest. 'The film was certainly designed to be outsized and imposing,' Corbet says. 'We knew the film would be long. We knew it was a big object. We also felt it had to be. The form and the content needed to be lock step with each other. The appeal of Brutalism is its commitment to both minimalism and maximalism, and all of my films are playing with that dynamic. I like those extremes.' When Fastvold and Corbet sat down to write, they resolved not to be constrained by any self-imposed limitations. They wrote big. The couple, both of whom grew up with relatives who were architects, were fascinated by the connections of Brutalism, which favors raw concrete, and the war. 'Some of these things wouldn’t exist unless they had gone through the trauma experienced during the war,' says Fastvold. 'There’s an honesty in Brutalism. Instead of covering up how the building is constructed, this is showing things the way they are. That felt connected to how you handle or process trauma, by exposing it.' For Brody, the role had obvious echoes with arguably his most defining performance. In Roman Polanski’s 2002 'The Pianist,' Brody also played a Jewish artist warped by WWII. 'The research and the immersion needed to portray someone who lived through the horrors of World War II left me with an understanding that clearly lingered and exists within me,' Brody says. The actor grants that László is in some sense a stand-in for Corbet. 'Oh definitely. I find that filmmakers often need to exorcise their circumstances,' says Brody. 'Brady is very open and unguarded as he references his own journey and hardships along the way. It’s very relatable. I understand them.' Asked why he thinks moviemaking has grown less adventurous, Corbet describes systematic failure. It's not only business limitations, he says, it's a lack of boldness. 'I find this sort of faux humility to be exactly that,' Corbet says. 'You made a movie. You raised millions of dollars. You assembled a crew of 250. Stop apologizing for it.' He cites the movies of an earlier generation of filmmakers — Stanley Kubrick, Andrei Tarkovsky, Larisa Shepitko, Chantal Akerman — as films 'that really demand to be wrestled with — films that announce themselves.' 'What’s funny is that I think this conservatism has been really damaging for box office as well,' Corbet says. 'Audiences are so savvy that they recognize formulas being rehashed over and over again. And I would say arthouse cinema has become as algorithmic as Marvel and DC Studios.' Corbet already sounds delighted that his next project — a '70s-set horror Western — will further test whatever popularity has come his way thanks to 'The Brutalist.' 'You have to dare to suck,' Corbet says. 'I really think it’s so important. If you’re always trying to color inside the lines, you’re not advancing the conversation.'	https://apnews.com/article/brutalist-brady-corbet-adrien-brody-bc457293c519485da578762d0e21a2c4	2024-12-19T08:04:15-08:00	
Elon Musk considers funding Nigel Farage's populist party, a move that could shake up UK politics	LONDON (AP) — It’s a photo that sent a tremor through British politics: Elon Musk flanked by British politician Nigel Farage and a wealthy backer, in front of a gilt-framed painting of a young Donald Trump. Taken this week at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, the image suggested that Musk, a key player in the incoming U.S. administration, could soon turn his disruptive attention to the U.K. Farage, Trump’s highest-profile British champion, confirmed talks are underway about Musk making a hefty donation to Farage's party Reform U.K. The Times of London reported it could be as much as $100 million, which would be far and away the largest political donation in U.K. history. The reports have sparked calls for Britain’s rules on political donations to be tightened — quickly. 'We did discuss money,' Farage told broadcaster GB News after the meeting with Musk. 'That’s a negotiation we will go back and have again. He is not against giving us money. He hasn’t fully decided whether he will.' Britain has strict limits on how much political parties can spend on elections, but they can accept unlimited donations, as long as the donors are U.K. voters or companies registered in Britain. Musk’s social network X has a British arm, Twitter U.K. Ltd., with a registered address in London. Critics say that is a loophole that allows foreign influence in U.K. politics. The voting watchdog, the Electoral Commission, is calling for changes including limiting the amount a company can donate, so that it can't put in more money than it earns in Britain. 'It’s crucial that U.K. voters have trust in the financing of our political system,' the commission's chief executive Vijay Rangarajan told The Guardian. 'The system needs strengthening, and we have been calling for changes to the law since 2013, to protect the electoral system from foreign interference.' Britain’s center-left Labour Party pledged during the summer election campaign to tighten the rules on political donations, though legislation is not scheduled in the coming year. Prime Minister Keir Starmer's spokesman Dave Pares said Wednesday that work is already underway to 'reinforce existing safeguards' against 'impermissible proxy donations.' Both the Labour government and the right-of-center opposition Conservatives are trying to figure out how to deal with Musk, who has taken a keen interest in the U.K. – and seemingly formed a strong dislike for Starmer. Musk often posts on X about the U.K., retweeting criticism of Starmer and the hashtag TwoTierKeir – shorthand for an unsubstantiated claim that Britain has 'two-tier policing,' with far-right protesters treated more harshly than pro-Palestinian or Black Lives Matter demonstrators. Musk has compared British attempts to weed out online misinformation to the Soviet Union, and during summer anti-immigrant violence across the U.K. tweeted that 'civil war is inevitable.' Farage has echoed some of those themes in his own social media output and his party’s anti-'woke' agenda, which includes pledges to slash immigration, scrap green-energy targets and leave the European Convention on Human Rights. Founded in 2021, Reform U.K. is the latest in a string of small hard-right parties led by Farage that have had limited electoral success, but an outsized influence on British politics. Farage’s opposition to the European Union helped push the country toward voting in 2016 to leave the bloc, a seismic political and economic break with the U.K.’s nearest neighbors. Reform U.K. won just five of the 650 seats in the House of Commons in July’s election, but came second in dozens more and secured 14% of the vote. Now it is pushing for fast growth, trying to professionalize its previously ramshackle organization and holding gatherings around the U.K. to recruit new members. Farage, a strong communicator who has embraced TikTok and other platforms, aims to emulate Trump’s success in using the power of personality and social media to reach the 'bro vote' — young men who are traditionally less likely to turn out at election time. Farage told GB News that Musk has 'already given me considerable help – understanding the process from start to finish, reaching disaffected communities who frankly feel there’s no point voting for anybody.' The electoral power of social media was on show recently in Romania, where far-right candidate Călin Georgescu came from nowhere to win the first round of the presidential election in November, aided in part by a flood of TikTok videos promoting his campaign. Amid allegations that Russia had organized the social media campaign to back Georgescu, Romania’s Constitutional Court canceled the presidential election runoff two days before it was due to take place. With Britain’s Conservative Party trying to recover from its worst election result since 1832, Farage dreams of making Reform the main opposition – or even the government — after the next election, due by 2029. That’s a long shot, but Rob Ford, professor of political science at the University of Manchester, said a big donation from Musk could have 'disruptive potential in all sorts of ways.' He said Musk’s money would give Reform 'the opportunity to try and build up a serious campaign organization, which is something that they have generally lacked.' 'It’s certainly adding a new joker to the pack of cards in British politics,' Ford said. 'We’ve had no shortage of surprising developments here in the past few years. And maybe this is the next one.' ___ A previous version of this story incorrectly gave the reported amount of the donation as 100 million pounds. It is $100 million.	https://apnews.com/article/elon-musk-nigel-farage-reform-uk-donation-6eb3ea7806b31275a52d71919d6fc35f	2024-12-19T06:01:16-08:00	
In Florida, a race is on to save the Everglades and protect a key source of drinking water	EVERGLADES, Fla. (AP) — In a region of Florida known as the River of Grass, John Kominoski plops into hip-deep waters. Blobs of brown periphyton – a mishmash of algae, bacteria and other organisms – carpet the surface. The air is thick and sticky as Kominoski, a Florida International University professor, pushes a rod to secure a tube that collects timed and continuous water samples that will help his team investigate the impacts of climate change and freshwater flows in this unique, sensitive ecosystem. The Everglades ecosystem was degraded and transformed when a highway connecting Tampa and Miami was built in 1928, cutting through a mosaic of prairies, sawgrass marshes, freshwater ponds and forested uplands. Sections of the road are now being elevated to restore water flows into the Shark River Slough – a vital restoration area deep in the Everglades National Park. The highway elevation is part of a massive state-federal project, approved by Congress in 2000 with bipartisan support, that aims to undo damages wreaked upon these wetlands. 'This is the biggest, most complicated and most expensive ecosystem restoration project in the world,' said Eve Samples, executive director of Friends of the Everglades. 'It's really important that we get it right.' More than two decades into it, there are signs of progress. Wildlife is returning to some areas, regions dominated by the invasive melaleuca tree have dropped 75%, and enthusiasm is high as significant projects are finally underway, others gain momentum and funding pours in. But there are also worries: the projects are billions of dollars over budget and questions remain about whether some will work. Once about twice the size of New Jersey, today only half of the Everglades remains. Home to endangered and threatened species, the area buffers storms and is a vital source of drinking water for millions of Floridians. Decades of engineering projects for development and agriculture partitioned and drained water that once flowed freely from the Kissimmee River to Lake Okeechobee to the Florida Bay. Invasive species have transformed the land, and pollution from agriculture – primarily phosphorus – has impoverished water quality. Efforts to repair the Everglades are projected to cost more than $23 billion and take 50 years to complete. Water quality has improved, but challenges remain and accelerating salt water intrusion, sea level rise and higher temperatures are ongoing threats. Since 2019, the South Florida Water Management District has completed, broken ground on, or celebrated other milestones on some 70 projects. This year, lawmakers earmarked $1.275 billion for the next 12 months of restoration efforts – the largest annual amount allocated. It is unclear what Donald Trump may do with restoration efforts when he takes office, but during his first presidential term he allocated funds and helped pass the Great American Outdoors Act, which secured $900 million annually in permanent funding to improve access to public lands, protect watersheds and more. Big enough reservoir? Northwest of Miami, excavators claw mounds of blasted limestone as crews replace acres of sugarcane fields in a massive project that aims to supply clean freshwater to the Everglades. When the $3.9 billion Everglades Agricultural Area Reservoir Project is complete, a reservoir and wetland will store and clean polluted water from Lake Okeechobee in central Florida before it’s discharged into the southern Everglades. Considered by some the most important of the projects, the reservoir, at 10,500 acres (4,249 hectares), will have the capacity to store enough water for the equivalent of about 480,000 to 720,000 homes. Its adjacent 6,500-acre (2,630.5 hectares) wetland – or the stormwater treatment area – will clean reservoir water before it’s discharged. Combined, the project will be nearly the stretch of a marathon. 'The wildlife and the mosaic of habitats that are here rely on getting the water right, and that’s what this project is about,' said Jennifer Reynolds, the director of ecosystem restoration and capital projects for the water district. 'It’s about getting the water right for the natural habitats and also to sustain the population of people who live and recreate here.' Although both the administrations of Democratic President Joe Biden and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican, have called it a 'priority,' it is also among the most controversial projects. The reservoir will be 82.5% smaller than its original plan due to insufficient land. Questions remain about whether it will work when completed. Critics worry the project will be too small and too deep to significantly clean water. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which is constructing the reservoir, has itself indicated uncertainty about whether the water will meet standards. Climate and development threats On that sticky May morning, Kominoski, the FIU professor, and research specialist Rafael Travieso wanted to know the water chemistry, including phosphorus concentrations. While phosphorous levels are rising slightly with increased water flows, data shows the region’s water quality is excellent. That's good news, considering phosphorous pollution has degraded water quality in the Everglades for decades and remains a challenge. The phosphorous has altered the ecosystem, contributing to toxic algae blooms, oxygen depletion and harmed native plants and wildlife. But measurements downstream tell a different story. Salinity levels have gone up, from a few days at a time to weeks and months, Kominoski said, suggesting that sea level rise and salt water intrusion are accelerating. South Florida’s low elevation is especially vulnerable to storms and accelerating sea level rise, with some estimates of up to 4 feet (1.2 meters) by 2100. Experts have also warned of sea level rise impacts and rising temperatures that will decrease water runoff and increase evaporation. In its most recent report to Congress, a committee of experts acknowledged the enormous challenge of accounting for climate change impacts in restoration efforts. They recommended several actions, including developing a set of climate scenarios that are consistently used across all planning and implementation. The Everglades' long-term survival will depend partly on whether mangroves, among its most unique and threatened native species, can keep pace with climate impacts. These salt-tolerant trees that buffer erosion and hurricanes are shifting inland as sea levels rise. While restoration efforts have helped, higher seas remain a threat. 'There are certain points where they are overwhelmed with flooding and it will restrict their ability to stay alive and recoup, and then you experience wetland loss,' said Kevin Montenegro, a student at FIU. Saltwater intrusion also poses threats to biodiversity, drinking water, and peat soils, which store planet-warming carbon. Then there are the people. Florida has undergone decades of population growth, becoming the nations’ fastest-growing state in 2022. In Homestead, south of Miami, there’s pressure to develop flood-prone, low lying farmlands between the Everglades and Biscayne national parks. 'That is a major hurdle and that’s playing out in all 16 counties that encompass the greater Everglades region,' said Samples from Friends of the Everglades. 'Population growth and development are really intense threats right now. Back at Shark River Slough, the airboat roared into action. For the next several hours, Kominoski and Travieso glided over the reflective waters, past tree islands and lily pad clusters, dodging alligators and watching birds take flight as tiger-striped dragonflies clung to their clothes. Some signs of progress Steve Davis looked down at the Tamiami Trail from the backseat of a small airplane some 2,500 feet in the air. The wetlands surrounding the highway were once drier, but restoration efforts have helped increase flows. 'To see water in the dry season, that’s a big deal,' said Davis, chief science officer for the Everglades Foundation. 'We don’t want areas to dry out completely.' As parts of the Everglades are rehydrated and habitats reemerge, so are native species such as the wood stork. Wading bird colonies have returned to the Kissimmee River floodplain. Habitats in swamps or shallow lakes called sloughs are increasing in some areas. And flamingos blown in by Hurricane Idalia have stayed in the Everglades. 'In the last 10 years, progress has ramped up significantly,' said Davis. 'It’s more than optimism. We’re starting to see the benefits.' A new plan for managing Lake Okeechobee's water levels aims to have widespread benefits for restoration efforts. It calls for sending more water south, reducing harmful discharges to the east and west coasts, and allowing more flexibility in water management decisions. Other parts of the Everglades need more help. From the air, floating mats of harmful blue-green algae are sometimes visible on Lake Okeechobee – a sign of warm temperatures and excess nutrients. In the west, sea level rise and salt water intrusion are impacting drinking water wells where the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida live, according to Betty Osceola, an environmental activist and tribe member. The tribe's ancestral tree islands have been flooded by water mismanagement, they've said, decimating plants and animals they've subsisted on. Other areas are drier and face ongoing threats from polluted water and wildfires. 'Restoration efforts are mainly to benefit Everglades National Park,' said Osceola. 'So maybe the national park sees benefits, but at the sacrifice to the tribe.' That’s why the tribe has for decades advocated for the Western Everglades Restoration Project, whose goal is to improve the quantity, quality, timing and distribution of water. The project’s first major feature broke ground in July. The Everglades' future Inside the Everglades, Michael Kennedy-Yoon looked out into the sawgrass marsh with binoculars. The New York resident spotted a soft shell turtle. Earlier he saw two alligators. But he was most excited about the birds he ticked off his list, including an anhinga, a night heron and a swallow-tailed kite. 'I think that preserving and conserving wildlife and wildlife areas is some of the best and most useful uses of our taxpayer money,' Kennedy-Yoon said, sweat glistening on his face. 'Something has to change or else we’re going to lose areas like this.' But it’s more than just restoring and protecting the Everglades for recreation and its wildlife. As Samples from Friends of the Everglades notes, it’s also about building climate resiliency in Florida. She quoted the famous words popularized by author and conservationist Marjory Stoneman Douglas: 'The Everglades is a test. If we pass it, we may get to keep the planet.' Faced with development pressures and climate change, Samples said those words are more true today than ever. ___ The Associated Press receives support from the Walton Family Foundation for coverage of water and environmental policy.

EU leaders insist no decisions can be taken about Ukraine without Ukraine, or behind their backs	BRUSSELS (AP) — European Union leaders insisted on Thursday that no decisions can be taken about the future of war-ravaged Ukraine without its consent or behind the backs of its partners in Europe, barely a month before U.S. President-elect Donald Trump takes office. Ukraine’s position is precarious more than 1,000 days into the war. Russia continues to make gains on the battlefield, pushing the front line gradually westward despite suffering heavy casualties. Ukraine’s energy network is in tatters and military recruits are hard to find. In a show of solidarity at a summit in Brussels with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, many EU leaders repeated a variation of what has become a common mantra — nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine, nothing about security in Europe without Europeans. Trump returns to the White House on Jan. 20 having promised to end the war in Ukraine quickly and talked up his relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Many Europeans are concerned that it might result in a poor deal for Ukraine. The other big worry is that Putin will use any interregnum to rearm and cause more strife. Rumors are swirling in Europe about possible peace talks in early 2025, and whether European peacekeepers might be needed to enforce any settlement, but the leaders are trying to keep a lid on speculation about what they are prepared to do so as not to tip their hand to Russia. The priority now, they say, must be to strengthen Ukraine’s hand, should Zelenskyy decide it’s time to negotiate. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said it’s important to 'ensure long-term aid to Ukraine -– it must be clear that we are prepared to enable support as long as it is needed.' Air defense, artillery and ammunition are high on the list, he told reporters. Asked about Trump, Scholz said that his impression from talking to the president-elect 'is that good cooperation between Europe and the U.S. is possible.' He said that 'the principle is always: no decisions over Ukrainians’ heads, and that of course means over those of the European states.' Luxembourg Prime Minister Luc Frieden had a similar message. 'We need to stand with Ukraine, and every step … needs to be taken with Ukraine and in the presence of the European Union. The future of Ukraine is decided in Europe and not elsewhere,' he said. Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof underlined that only Ukraine can determine the conditions for talks, 'and it is not for us to talk about that. At the moment, Ukraine has not yet indicated that they are prepared to do so.' Zelenskyy said Kyiv needs the EU and U.S. to stay united next year, saying that 'only together the United States and Europe can stop Putin and save Ukraine.' He said that the only effective security guarantee remains NATO membership. Asked for details about what options are being discussed with the Europeans, Zelenskyy said he could not comment. 'There are no decisions about it. There is some will ... political will, and understanding that Putin is dangerous, and total understanding that he will not stop on Ukraine,' he said. It’s difficult to predict what Trump might do, and whether history might be a reliable guide. Under his previous presidency, in 2020, the United States inked a deal on a military withdrawal from Afghanistan directly with the strongest player — the Taliban insurgents — mostly playing down the concerns of the Afghan government and president. The chaotic exit in 2021, finally ordered by U.S. President Joe Biden, humiliated Washington and its allies in NATO as the Afghan security forces they had trained for years and invested billions in collapsed and the Taliban swept to power. In Ukraine, the 27-nation EU has provided at least as much support — more than 180 billion euros ($187 billion) since Russia began its full-fledged invasion almost three years ago — as the United States. But while the world’s biggest trading bloc can probably continue to prop up Ukraine’s ravaged economy, the EU is almost certainly unlikely to be able provide the military backing that the country’s armed forces would require to prevail. ___ Raf Casert in Brussels, and Geir Moulson in Berlin, contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/eu-ukraine-russia-nato-trump-support-zelenskyy-276690fb0a334c769b1631a16843a2f4	2024-12-19T03:14:57-08:00	
Italy's Salvini faces verdict for blocking migrants at sea. Case weighs limits of stemming migration	MILAN (AP) — Italy’s deputy premier, Matteo Salvini, has sounded defiant ahead of Friday’s court verdict in Sicily for blocking some 100 migrants at sea on a humanitarian rescue boat in 2019 when he was interior minister. Salvini, who leads the Euroskeptic, anti-migrant League, told a rally last week that 'defending the borders, the dignity, the laws, the honor of a country cannot ever be a crime.' He has vowed to enter the court in Palermo with his 'head held high' to hear a court’s verdict on whether he is guilty of illegally detaining the migrants aboard the Open Arms rescue ship in Italy's southernmost island of Lampedusa for five days in August 2019. He is also charged with failing to fulfill his public duties. Prosecutors have demanded a six-year jail sentence. A sentence of over five years would also automatically bar him from office. Whatever Friday's sentencing, it won't have immediate effect as verdicts in Italy are only considered final once two levels of appeals are exhausted, a process that can take years. He has already said he won't resign. In August 2019, Open Arms approached Italy with 150 migrants rescued at sea, some in the Maltese rescue area, with Lampedusa the closest port. They spent 10 days in international waters and another five days within sight of Lampedusa, with those onboard growing increasingly agitated amid deteriorating hygienic conditions. Some migrants threw themselves overboard, and minors were evacuated during the stand-off. Eventually, a court ordered the remaining 89 people onboard to be allowed to disembark in Lampedusa. Open Arms' Italian lawyer, Arturo Salerni, dismissed Salvini's claim that he was defending Italy's borders, saying it was his duty as a public official to protect the human rights of people on board. 'The supreme duty, especially of those who belong to governments, is to defend international laws and conventions, and people's rights,'' said Salerni, who is representing Open Arms as an injured party in the trial. 'It cannot be that the interior minister ... can deprive anyone of freedom.' The Open Arms standoff was just one of more than 20 during Salvini's hardline stand against migration when he was interior minister from 2018-2019 during the first government of former Premier Giuseppe Conte. He closed Italian ports to humanitarian rescue ships and accused the groups that rescued migrants at sea of effectively encouraging smugglers. In another incident, a German captain, Carola Rackete, entered the Lampedusa port in June 2019 against Salvini’s orders after declaring a state of emergency on her boat, the Sea-Watch 3, which had been carrying 40 rescued people for some 16 days. She was soon arrested. Italy eventually dropped charges of aiding illegal migration against her. Now transport minister in Premier Giorgia Meloni’s far-right-led government, Salvini has the support of the premier and other ministers in the Palermo trial. He also has won the solidarity of anti-migrant lawmakers from across Europe, who appeared with him recently in Brussels wearing T-shirts with his face that read 'Guilty for having defended Italy.' Since taking power in 2022, Meloni has moved to crack down on migration, striking deals with northern African nations in a bid to prevent departures while also setting up still-dormant centers in Albania aimed to vet migrants rescued at sea in the non-EU country without setting foot in Italy. 'Salvini gets the solidarity of the entire government,'' Meloni told the Italian Senate on Wednesday, to a standing ovation from right-wing lawmakers. He also got the backing of tech billionaire Elon Musk, who has publicly supported Italy's crackdown on migration, criticizing a judge's decision that stymied Italy's plans to screen migrants in Albania. In a post on X on Thursday, Musk said that it is 'crazy that Salvini is being tried for defending Italy.' ____ AP visual journalist Paolo Santalucia contributed from Rome.	https://apnews.com/article/migration-italy-salvini-trial-blocking-migrants-at-sea-8ad5d57d6d5804347f4b906d01240d87	2024-12-19T03:10:51-08:00

Human Rights Watch says Israel's restriction of water supply in Gaza amounts to acts of genocide	NEW YORK (AP) — Human Rights Watch on Thursday accused Israel of causing the deaths of thousands of Palestinians by systematically restricting and targeting Gaza’s water supply in a campaign that amounted to 'acts of genocide.' The rights group was the latest among a growing number of critics to accuse Israel of genocidal acts in its war in Gaza. Israel vehemently denies the allegations, saying its war is directed at Hamas militants, not Gaza's civilians. In Thursday's report, HRW alleged that countless infants, children and adults have died from malnutrition, dehydration and illness as a result of actions by Israeli authorities over more than a year of war to deliberately cut the flow of water and electricity to Gaza, destroy infrastructure and prevent the distribution of critical supplies. 'As a state policy, these acts constitute a widespread or systematic attack directed against a civilian population. Israeli officials are therefore committing the crime against humanity of extermination,' the New York-based group said. The rights group said that the 'pattern of conduct' outlined in its report and statements from Israeli officials 'may indicate' genocidal intent, but it did not come down definitively on one side. Under international law, proving intent is key in concluding whether the crime of genocide has been committed. Israel, founded as a refuge for Jews in the wake of the Nazi Holocaust, strenuously denies such allegations. It says Hamas is responsible for the destruction in Gaza because the group hides and operates in schools, hospitals and residential areas. It says the October 2023 Hamas attack that triggered the war — the deadliest attack on Jews since the Holocaust — amounts to genocide. 'Human Rights Watch is once more spreading its blood libels in order to promote its anti-Israel propaganda,' Israel's Foreign Ministry said. It claimed Israel has worked to facilitate the flow of water and humanitarian aid into Gaza throughout the war. 'Israel will continue to ensure humanitarian aid enters Gaza, in full compliance with international law,' the statement said. The new report by Human Rights Watch outlined what the organization described as an extended, methodical campaign by Israeli officials to deprive Palestinians in Gaza of water. That has drastically reduced the water supply in Gaza, from about 83 liters (21 gallons) per person each day before the war began to between two and nine liters in the months since, the human rights group says. The World Health Organization says people require 50 to 100 liters per day to meet basic needs and keep sickness in check. Human Rights Watch said Israeli forces deliberately razed the solar panels that powered four of Gaza’s six wastewater treatment plants and destroyed a key reservoir. The group alleged Israel also cut off electricity required to run desalination plants and other infrastructure and restricted fuel for backup generators. When the International Court of Justice issued orders in January that Israel provide Palestinians with basic services and assistance, officials ignored them, the group alleged. Human Rights Watch said its findings were based on interviews with more than 60 Palestinians, accounts from utility employees, doctors and other healthcare workers and aid workers, and analysis of satellite images, photos and video. 'Doctors and nurses told Human Rights Watch that they had seen numerous infants, children, and adults die from a combination of malnutrition, dehydration, and disease,' the group said. In its statement, the Israeli Foreign Ministry said it has continued the operation of four water pipelines as well as water pumping and desalination facilities, and allowed international aid groups to deliver water in tankers. Some of the allegations leveled Thursday were echoed by medical aid group Doctors Without Borders, which released its own report accusing Israel of systematically attacking Gaza’s healthcare system and restricting essential humanitarian assistance. The group, which has worked in Gaza for more than 20 years, said its staff has been subjected to more than 40 attacks since the start of the war, including airstrikes, shelling and military incursions at health facilities. As of October, it said 19 of Gaza's 36 hospitals were shut down and continual fighting prevented many residents from reaching those still functioning. 'Attacks on civilians, the dismantling of the healthcare system, the deprivation of food, water and supplies are a form of collective punishment inflicted by the Israeli authorities on the people of Gaza,' the report said. 'This must stop now.' Israel's Foreign Ministry called the report 'entirely false and misleading.' It said Israel does not target innocent health workers and tries to ensure delivery of aid, and charged the medical group with failing to acknowledge Hamas' use of hospitals as bases 'for terrorist activities and operations.' The Oct. 7, 2023, attack by Hamas killed some 1,200 people in Israel, mostly civilians, and took 250 others hostage. Israel's 14-month offensive has killed over 45,000 Palestinians, over half of them women and children, according to local health officials who do not distinguish between civilians and combatants. The offensive has caused widespread destruction and displaced roughly 90% of Gaza's population, according to U.N. estimates, plunging the territory into a humanitarian crisis. The U.N. and international aid groups say Israel has repeatedly restricted aid shipments into Gaza and done little to provide security inside Gaza to allow deliveries to reach their destinations. They say only a fraction of the amount of aid necessary to sustain life in Gaza is reaching Palestinians. Armed gangs have also repeatedly stolen truckloads of aid. HRW's report came two weeks after Amnesty International accused Israel of committing genocide in Gaza. Israel dismissed the allegation as as 'entirely false and based on lies.' Israel has previously refuted charges lodged by South Africa in the International Court of Justice that its forces have carried out inhumane acts in the embattled enclave. Meanwhile, the International Criminal Court is seeking the arrests of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant for allegedly committing war crimes.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-gaza-genocide-human-rights-watch-0cae5c250415975ebbfcfdab6808abc4	2024-12-19T02:26:21-08:00	
Blinken will announce aid for Sudan and talks about AI risks at UN Security Council	UNITED NATIONS (AP) — Secretary of State Antony Blinken is expected to announce about $230 million in new assistance for conflict-torn Sudan during his likely final trip to the United Nations while in office, U.S. officials said. With the U.N. Security Council more divided than ever, Blinken is leading two meetings of the U.N.’s most powerful body on Thursday, capping his engagements with the world body after a tumultuous four years that saw war return to Europe and multiple crises in the Middle East. But neither will focus on Russia’s war with Ukraine or the Mideast, where the U.S. has been frequently at odds with permanent members China and Russia and almost always in the minority when it comes to Israel’s war against Hamas in Gaza. Instead, in an apparent bid to produce a modicum of consensus, Blinken is leading Security Council sessions on artificial intelligence and Sudan, where conflict has sparked a dire humanitarian crisis that aid agencies say has not received enough attention. Blinken is set to announce $200 million for humanitarian aid and $30 million to help Sudan with a transition back to democratic governance, according to three U.S. officials who spoke on condition of anonymity before the announcement. Here’s a look at America's top diplomat at the U.N.: Why is Blinken presiding over Security Council meetings? Blinken has been appearing in person and virtually before the Security Council since March 2021, just after assuming his position as the Biden administration’s top diplomat. In addition to several one-off council meetings, including one in February 2022 shortly before Russia invaded Ukraine, Blinken has gone to New York for a week every September for the annual General Assembly gathering of world leaders. The presidency of the Security Council rotates alphabetically every month among its 15 members. This month, it's the U.S. turn. The country holding the presidency almost always organizes several signature events on topics its government chooses. Presidents, prime ministers and foreign ministers often preside at these meetings, which ministers from other council nations are invited to attend. Why is the US not highlighting the Middle East or Ukraine? Russia and China have blocked all council action condemning the invasion of Ukraine. This has led U.S. officials to believe that a session on the topic, especially as President-elect Donald Trump prepares to take office with a stated goal of ending the war immediately, would likely be a waste of time. On the Middle East, the U.S. has frequently vetoed council action condemning Israel for its tactics against Hamas in Gaza, leaving it virtually alone at the United Nations in supporting Israel. Why is the US focusing on Sudan? War broke out in Sudan last year between rival generals heading the military and paramilitary forces. The fighting has left tens of thousands dead, forced millions from their homes and pushed a large swath of Sudan’s population to starvation — creating an often forgotten global crisis the U.S. is seeking to spotlight. The roughly $230 million in assistance expected to be announced Thursday is significant, but it is close to half of a nearly $425 million aid package that the U.S. announced for Sudan in late September. Sudan 'is facing one of the most dire humanitarian crises on the face of the planet,' State Department spokesman Vedant Patel told reporters Wednesday. 'And so anything we can do to continue to work with partners at the U.N. and otherwise to shed light on that, figure out what ways we can continue to unearth and solidify humanitarian corridors and continue to push for a political solution, that’s absolutely a priority for us and we will continue to use ways to elevate that,' he said. Why did the US choose AI? The U.S. leads the world in developing AI technology, according to a recently released Stanford University index, and it has been in the forefront of U.N. action on AI. In March, the first U.N. resolution on artificial intelligence was adopted by the 193-member General Assembly. Sponsored by the U.S., it gives global support to an international effort to ensure the powerful technology benefits all nations, respects human rights and is 'safe, secure and trustworthy.' Blinken said AI has the potential to do 'tremendous good' but can also pose 'tremendous threats to the international peace and security that this council is charged with upholding.' He noted that 'repressive regimes are using AI-enabled surveillance to target journalists and political dissidents' and that 'if algorithms are built into weapon systems, and if they malfunction, they could spark a conflict.' 'By setting rules of the road for AI we can minimize these risks, we can harness the exceptional promise of this technology,' he said. Will Blinken confront Russia? Blinken has represented the U.S. at the Security Council about half a dozen times at meetings ranging from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine to the war in Gaza. Russia, like the U.S. and China, is a permanent veto-holding member of the 15-nation council, and both have seats at its horseshoe-shaped table. But apart from pointed disagreements during debates, there have been no confrontations or one-on-one meetings between Blinken and Russian diplomats at previous U.N. meetings — and there was none on Thursday. Blinken thanked Russian Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia after his remarks — as is custom — even though Nebenzia accused the U.S. of imposing rules on others but not abiding by them. But the Russian envoy agreed that 'we cannot allow AI to dominate human beings and human values.' It is not unusual for Blinken or other senior U.S. officials to attend international meetings and conferences where Russian officials are present, but interactions are rare. ___ Lee reported from Washington.	https://apnews.com/article/un-security-council-blinken-russia-middle-east-1bb12abf78571cddbfafe41b35b871df	2024-12-19T02:24:19-08:00	
Bank of England set to keep UK interest rates on hold despite paltry economic growth	LONDON (AP) — The U.K.'s central bank is set to keep interest rates on hold later Thursday as inflation has moved further above its target rate, even though the British economy is flatlining at best. The nine-member Monetary Policy Committee is widely expected to keep the bank's main interest rate unchanged at 4.75% in the wake of figures showing inflation rising to 2.6%, further above the target of 2%. With price pressures elevated in the crucial services sector, which accounts for around 80% of the U.K. economy, and wages strong, there are few indications that inflation will get back towards the target anytime soon. As a result, the rate-setting panel, which last cut its key rate in November, is set to take a cautious stance, as lower borrowing rates could stoke inflation. That's a disappointment for many struggling sectors in the U.K. economy that would be helped by lower interest rates in an environment of paltry growth — in fact the British economy has contracted for two months in a row. 'Persistent price pressures will prevent the Bank of England from responding to flat output and falling employment by cutting interest rates,' said Andrew Wishart, an economist at Berenberg Bank. Few economists think interest rates will drop dramatically in 2025 either. It's a similar picture in the U.S., where the Federal Reserve reined in expectations Wednesday of reductions next year after its latest rate cut. Critics argue that the new Labour government’s first budget in October has both elevated inflation pressures while also damping down on growth. A big increase in business taxes may see firms try to offset the additional costs by raising prices or cutting down on hiring. The government argues that it needed to raise taxes to shore up public finances and inject money into cash-starved public services. Still, inflation in the U.K. and across the world is far lower than it was a couple of years ago, partly because central banks dramatically increased borrowing costs from near zero during the coronavirus pandemic when prices started to shoot up, first as a result of supply chain issues and then because of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine which pushed up energy costs. As inflation rates have fallen from multidecade highs, the central banks have started cutting interest rates, though few, if any, economists think that rates will fall back to the super-low levels that persisted in the years after the global financial crisis of 2008-2009.	https://apnews.com/article/uk-economy-interest-rates-growth-labour-4b3de36773e4ac73afa22b7c6ff8525f	2024-12-19T01:40:24-08:00	
US ambassador to Vietnam says US arms manufacturers could help Vietnam build up its armed forces	HANOI, Vietnam (AP) — U.S. weapons manufacturers could work with Vietnamese counterparts to help build up Vietnam's armed forces, the U.S. ambassador to the southeast Asian country said on Thursday. 'Our goal is to ensure that Vietnam has what it needs to defend its interests at sea, in the air, on the ground and in cyberspace,' U.S. Ambassador Mark Knapper said at an international arms expo in the Vietnamese capital Hanoi. Vietnam is hosting the expo that brings together 250 exhibitors including geopolitical rivals including the U.S., China, Russia, Ukraine, Israel and Iran. The expo, held at Hanoi's Gia Lam airport, continues through Sunday. U.S. exhibitors include Boeing and Textron Aviation. China is present with Norinco and Gaodu International Trade. Iran’s defense ministry pavilion isn't far from booths set up by Israeli companies Rafael Advanced Defense Systems and Israel Aerospace Industries. A number of Russian firms are also in attendance along with Ukraine’s Motor Sich. Vietnam has been trying to increase its domestic arms manufacturing while reducing its reliance on Russia for weapon imports. In 2022, Russia made up around 60% of all of Vietnam's military purchases, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. But Vietnam's longstanding efforts to diversify its imports have been accelerated by the war in Ukraine. It has also been trying to boost its own capacity to make arms and displayed indigenously-made military equipment at the expo. A key driver for Vietnam is the escalating tensions in the South China Sea, a key trade and security route. It a flashpoint in Asia and a fault line in the U.S.-China regional rivalry. Vietnam has been critical of China’s increasingly hostile actions in the disputed waters. Vietnam and other Southeast Asian countries have overlapping claims in the busy sea passage. Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh called the event 'message of peace, cooperation and development.' He was later given a tour of a military plane made by U.S. firm Lockheed Martin.	https://apnews.com/article/vietnam-arms-weapons-exposition-manufacturing-0257d237db09c22a8694a1964ea96941	2024-12-19T00:38:32-08:00	
Putin opens his annual news conference, an event he uses to reinforce his authority	MOSCOW (AP) — Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday held his marathon news conference and call-in show, an annual event he has used to reinforce his authority and demonstrate sweeping control of the country’s political scene. Putin began by boasting about Russia's economic performance, saying that it's on track to grow by nearly 4% this year. He acknowledged that consumer inflation is high at 9.3%, but noted Central Bank's efforts to bring it down and insisted that the situation in the economy remains 'stable.' The tightly choreographed session, which is broadcast live by state-controlled TV stations across Russia’s 11 time zones, has been heavily dominated by domestic issues in the past years. Most journalists and ordinary people calling the studio ask about road repairs, utility prices, house maintenance, medical services, government subsidies for families and other economic and social issues. Journalists from the country’s over 80 regions wave colorful signs and placards in the hall near the Kremlin as they try desperately to attract Putin’s attention. Russian state media reported that ordinary citizens submitted more than 2 million questions ahead of the show. Questions about Russia’s military action in Ukraine and soaring tensions with the West are expected to be an important part of the show. Putin, who has held power for nearly a quarter-century, has vowed to bring what he describes as the 'special military operation' to a victorious end and boasted about Russia’s battlefield gains this year. But just two days before Putin’s news conference, a senior Russian general was killed by a bomb outside his apartment building in Moscow. The brazen killing of Lt. Gen. Igor Kirillov, claimed by Ukraine, brought the nearly 3-year-old conflict once again to the streets of the Russian capital. Putin has declared that last month’s strike on Ukraine with a new hypersonic intermediate-range ballistic missile was a response to Western allies’ permission for Kyiv to use their longer-range weapons for strikes on Russia. He threatened that Moscow could launch more strikes on Ukraine with the new Oreshnik missile and warned it could also be used to target military facilities of the countries that allowed Ukraine to use their missiles for attacks deep into Russia. Putin has said that Moscow stands ready for talks on a peaceful settlement to the conflict but reaffirmed his demand that Ukraine must renounce its bid to join NATO and recognize Russia’s gains. Ukraine and the West have rejected those demands. The Russian leader’s comments on Thursday will be closely watched for any signs of shift in his bargaining position ahead of the inauguration of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, who has pledged to negotiate a deal to end the hostilities. Putin could also comment on the downfall of Syrian President Bashar Assad, who he has offered political asylum. Assad’s demise has dealt a painful blow to Russia, which launched a military intervention in Syria nine years ago to prop up Assad’s government amid a civil war. Moscow has quickly sought to establish contacts with the victorious rebels to secure its diplomatic and military personnel in the country and try to extend the lease on its air and naval bases in the country.	https://apnews.com/article/russia-putin-press-conference-ukraine-trump-9eab438ab3eb8f9149a6dc5b67d20d86	2024-12-19T00:14:41-08:00	
French president arrives in Mayotte to survey Cyclone Chido damage	MAMOUDZOU, Mayotte (AP) — France's President Emmanuel Macron arrived Thursday to the Indian Ocean archipelago of Mayotte to survey the devastation that Cyclone Chido wrought across the French territory as thousands of people tried cope without the bare essentials such as water or electricity. 'Mayotte is demolished,' an airport security agent told Macron as soon as he stepped of the plane. The security agent, Assane Haloi, said small children are without water or electricity and have nowhere to go because 'everything is demolished.' 'There’s no roof, there’s nothing. No water, no food, no electricity. We can’t even shelter, we are all wet with our children covering ourselves with whatever we have so that we can sleep,' she said, asking for emergency aid. Macron went on an helicopter for an aerial appraisal of the damage. He then headed to the hospital in Mamoudzou, Mayotte’s capital, to meet with medical staff and patients. He will then visit a destroyed neighborhood. French authorities said at least 31 people have died and more than 1,500 people were injured, more than 200 critically. But it's feared hundreds or even thousands of people have died after the strongest cyclone in nearly a century ripped through the French territory of Mayotte off the coast of Africa on Saturday. Ahamadi Mohammed said Macron's visit 'is a good thing because he’ll be able to see by himself the damage.' 'I think that we’ll then get significant aid to try and get the island back on its feet,' the 58-year-old said. A navy ship was due to arrive in Mayotte on Thursday with 180 tons of aid and equipment, according to the French military. People living in a large slum on the outskirts of Mamoudzou were some of the hardest hit from the cyclone. Many had lost their houses, some had lost friends. Nassirou Hamidouni sheltered in his house when the cyclone hit. His neighbor was killed when his house collapsed on him and his six children. Hamidouni and others dug through the rubble to reach them. The 28-year-old father of five is now trying to rebuild his own house, which was also destroyed. He believes the death toll is much higher than what’s officially being reported given the severity of what he lived through. 'The 30 deaths are too small for how the situation happened, it was very hard,' he said. Mayotte, located in the Indian Ocean between mainland Africa’s east coast and northern Madagascar, is France’s poorest territory.

Pakistan denounces US sanctions on its missile program as biased and putting regional peace at risk	ISLAMABAD (AP) — Pakistan on Thursday denounced new U.S. sanctions on the country's ballistic missile program as 'discriminatory' that put the region's peace and security at risk. Pakistan's Foreign Ministry warned in a statement that the sanctions 'have dangerous implications for strategic stability of our region and beyond.' It also cast doubt on U.S. allegations that targeted businesses were involved in weapons proliferation because previous sanctions 'were based on mere doubts and suspicion without any evidence whatsoever.' It also accused the U.S. of 'double standards' for waiving licensing requirements for advanced military technology to other countries. The sanctions freeze any U.S. property belonging to the targeted businesses and bar Americans from doing business with them. The U.S. State Department said one such sanctioned entity, the Islamabad-based National Development Complex worked to acquire items for developing Pakistan’s long range ballistic missile program that includes the SHAHEEN series of ballistic missiles. The other sanctioned entities are Akhtar and Sons Private Limited, Affiliates International and Rockside Enterprise. State Department spokesman Matthew Miller posted on X platform on Wednesday that the U.S. had been 'been clear and consistent about our concerns' over such weapons proliferation and that it would 'continue to engage constructively with Pakistan on these issues.' Analysts say Pakistan's nuclear and missile program is primarily aimed at countering threats from neighboring India. Security expert Syed Muhammad Ali called the sanctions 'short sighted, destabilizing and divorced for South Asian regional strategic realities.' Pakistan became a declared nuclear power in 1998, when it conducted underground nuclear tests in response to those carried out by its rival and neighbor India. The two sides regularly test-fired their short, medium and long-range missiles. The two South Asian rivals have fought two of their three wars over Kashmir since gaining independence from Britain in 1947. The disputed Himalayan region is split between them and claimed by both in its entirety.	https://apnews.com/article/pakistan-sanctions-ballistic-missiles-shaheen-proliferation-66eb36c61f3d22138972e4fd07c82a2d	2024-12-18T22:48:38-08:00	
Middle East latest: Israeli defense minister warns Yemen's Houthi rebels	Israel’s defense minister said Thursday the country would 'not allow the continuation' of shooting from Yemen’s Houthi rebels, hours after Israel launched heavy airstrikes on rebel sites. 'I suggest the leaders of the Houthi organization to see, to understand and remember, whoever raises a hand against the state of Israel, his hand will be cut off. Whoever harms us will be harmed sevenfold,' said Israel Katz, the defense minister. Israel would 'strike with force,' Katz said, and 'not allow the continuation of this situation of shooting and threats against the state of Israel.' The statement followed a series of intense Israeli airstrikes that shook Yemen’s rebel-held capital and a port city early Thursday and killed at least nine people, officials said, shortly after a Houthi missile targeted central Israel and badly damaged a school building. The Iran-backed Houthis have staged attacks throughout the war on ships in the Red Sea corridor and launched missiles at Israel. The rebels have so far avoided the same level of intense military strikes that have targeted Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon. ___ Here’s the latest: Israel strikes Yemen’s capital after Houthi missile targets central Israel DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Israeli airstrikes hit Yemen’s rebel-held capital and a port city early Thursday and killed at least nine people, officials said, after a Houthi missile targeted central Israel. Israel said it conducted two waves of strikes in a preplanned operation involving 14 fighter jets and targeting infrastructure at Red Sea ports and in Yemen’s rebel-held capital. Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, an Israeli military spokesman, said the strikes hit targets the Iranian-backed Houthis 'have been using in ways that effectively contributed to their military action.' The strikes risk escalating conflict with the Iranian-backed Houthis, whose attacks on the Red Sea corridor have impacted global shipping. The rebels have so far avoided the same level of intense military strikes that have targeted the Palestinian Hamas militant group and Lebanon’s Hezbollah. The Houthi-controlled satellite channel al-Masirah said some of the strikes targeted power stations in the capital, as well as the Ras Isa oil terminal on the Red Sea. The channel, citing its correspondent in the port city of Hodeida, said at least seven people were killed at the nearby port of Salif, while another two were killed at Ras Isa.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-syria-news-19-december-2024-4257fd6348967f08b6bc37107e3f7830	2024-12-18T22:22:37-08:00	
As Russia's threat looms, guns and defense training surge in Finland	KERAVA, Finland (AP) — Unsettled by Russia's expansionism and emboldened by its recent accession to NATO, Finland is rallying to strengthen its national self-defense beyond its traditional military capabilities. The popularity of weapons training in the Nordic country has soared in recent months. Few places tell the story of the rise in Finnish affinity for self-defense more than shooting ranges that are riding a boom of interest. Russian President Vladimir Putin’s order for a full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine — another big Russian neighbor — in February 2022 continues to resonate in many Finnish minds, and partially explains the ballistics binge. The Vantaa Reservist Association, which operates a gun range in a warehouse once used to make sex toys, in Kerava, north of Helsinki, has more than doubled its membership over the last two years and now counts over 2,100 members. 'They have something in the back of their head ringing that this is the skill I have to learn now,' said association chairman Antti Kettunen, standing among bullet-riddled targets. 'I think that the wind has changed, now it’s blowing from the east.' Earlier this year, the coalition government announced plans to open more than 300 new ranges — a big jump from the 670 in operation today. Authorities are encouraging citizens to take up interest in national defense in the country with a 1,340-kilometer (830-mile) border with Russia, where firing shots in ice hockey has been more of a pastime than shooting bullets. 'Interest in national defense is traditionally very high in Finland and especially these days with the Russian aggression on Ukraine, the interest has risen even more,' lawmaker Jukka Kopra, who chairs Finland’s defense committee, told AP earlier in December. Inspired largely by concerns over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Finland became the 31st member of the NATO military alliance last year. Western neighbor Sweden followed suit in March. The two countries last month announced plans to boost their civil defense strategies, without mentioning Russia by name. The surge in self-defense strategies doesn’t stop at shooting ranges. The National Defense Training Association says it has hosted a collective total of 120,000 training days this year, more than double the number three years ago. The national reservists' association, which is about 90% composed of military reservists but also some hobbyists, has grown by more than two-thirds to over 50,000 members since the invasion of Ukraine. And unlike some other European countries, Finland has kept around 50,000 Cold-War era civil defense shelters, which could accommodate roughly 85% of the population of about 5.5 million people. 'This is the new era of civil defense shelters, which is against the newest developments of war,' said Tomi Rask, of Helsinki Rescue Services, during a recent tour of one shelter in the capital. 'We know that all of our neighbors have the capability of harming us, of harming our citizens, and we think that we need to prepare.' Wearing camouflage at the range in Kerava, military reservists and firearm hobbyists bob and weave their way through an obstacle course, at times opening fire with deafening Glock handguns against human-shaped targets. 'Some people do this just for fun,' said member Miikka Kallio, a 38-year-old firefighter. 'Some (do) maybe because of our eastern neighbor: I’ve heard comments that they’ve joined the reservists because of the Russian attack (on Ukraine.)' Finland is no stranger to tensions with Russia and a big part of the country's national identity was forged battling its eastern neighbor - gaining independence from the Russian empire in 1917 and then fending off a large Soviet force with its tiny, ill-equipped army in what become known as the Winter War at the start of the Second World War. Kettunen said learning to shoot guns is a bit like learning to swim: Both require training and preparation. 'When you need to know how to shoot or swim, and you don’t, it’s too late,' he said.	https://apnews.com/article/finland-russia-nato-80b96bce6bb1f04884a825770014611a	2024-12-18T22:10:16-08:00	
Two highway crashes in southeastern Afghanistan kill 50 people and injure 76	Two highway crashes in southeastern Afghanistan have killed a combined total of 50 people and injured 76, a government spokesman said Thursday. One was a collision between a passenger bus and an oil tanker on the Kabul-Kandahar highway late Wednesday, said Hafiz Omar, a spokesman for the governor of Ghazni province. The other was in a different area of the same highway, which connects the Afghan capital with the south. 'The injured have been taken to hospitals in Ghazni and authorities are in the process of handing over the bodies to families,' said Omar. Patients in a more serious condition were transferred to Kabul. Women and children are among the casualties, he added. Traffic accidents are common in Afghanistan, mainly due to poor road conditions and driver carelessness.	https://apnews.com/article/afghanistan-highway-crash-fatalities-ghazni-7e10f075f18d9796902232a14b25e797	2024-12-18T21:32:44-08:00	
Number of dead and missing still unclear as first aid arrives in quake-hit Pacific nation of Vanuatu	WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — Amid the havoc wrought by a violent earthquake two days earlier, Ivan Oswald and his staff at Nambawan Cafe on an idyllic stretch of Vanuatu’s waterfront prepared on Thursday for lunchtime service. The menu for the usual lunchtime rush was replaced with defrosted sausages, readied for emergency workers who are sifting through rubble for those trapped alive or killed in flattened buildings when the massive, 7.3 jolt hit Port Vila, Vanuatu’s capital 48 hours earlier. Search crews were joined Thursday by specialists arriving in waves from Australia, New Zealand and France. Earthquakes are normal for the South Pacific nation made up of 80 islands and home to 330,000 people, but Tuesday’s terrifying shake was like nothing they had felt before. Centered 30 kilometers (19 miles) offshore, at a depth of 57 kilometers (35 miles), the quake has been followed by hundreds of rattling aftershocks. Death toll remains uncertain The death toll was still unclear and official information remained scarce. The government initially confirmed 14 deaths. On Wednesday, it said nine had been verified by the hospital -- but officials expected the number would rise. More than 200 injured people were treated, an official figure not updated in more than a day. On Thursday, telecommunications -- though piecemeal and patchy -- were more widely restored after a near total blackout following the quake. It offered residents of Vanuatu answers about the scale of the damage and about how many people were missing. As word got around that Nambawan had power and an independent internet source, rescuers, tourists and locals visited to charge devices and attempt to locate their relatives. 'We've had a few tears,' said Oswald, the cafe's owner. 'I can't help with the rescue, but I can help with this.' Damage concentrated in the capital The extent of the havoc became clearer on Thursday. The worst-hit area was Port Vila's downtown, busy with lunchtime shoppers on Tuesday. Some outlying islands and villages near the quake's epicenter have experienced landslides. Infrastructure damage was extensive — including to hospitals, roads, buildings, two major water reservoirs and gas pipes — the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said late on Wednesday. Response efforts were hampered by access problems. A massive landslide has blocked the sea port, limiting the transport of essential supplies and personnel, the UN agency said. The airport was open only for humanitarian use on Thursday, but the runway has been deemed operational and the resumption of commercial flights will be considered on Friday. Fears over water and damage to buildings Aid agencies told The Associated Press on Wednesday that their biggest worries were about drinking water and shelter for those unable to return home. The main utilities provider, UNELCO, said it could take two weeks to fully restore water service, according to the Vanuatu Broadcasting and Television Corporation. While the search for survivors and recovery of bodies centered on two collapsed buildings in the city center, homes and businesses throughout Port Vila need structural checks by engineers before they can be used again. Australian search experts on Thursday joined locals who had desperately dug for people yelling out from the crumpled buildings. After dramatic rescues of dust-covered survivors that lifted spirits on Tuesday and Wednesday, the mood had become bleaker about the prospects for those trapped, residents said. It was not known how many people remained in the buildings — a garage and a surf clothing store. Among the dead were two Chinese nationals, according to China’s official Xinhua News Agency, which cited Gu Zihua, an official at the Chinese embassy in Vanuatu. An economic blow Another building housing embassies for several countries — including the United States, France and New Zealand — also crumpled, but no casualties were reported. Military flights evacuated 148 Australian nationals from Vanuatu late on Wednesday. The quake at the start of the summer season in the tourism-dependent island nation threatened an economic crisis if tourists did not return, said Glen Craig, chair of the Vanuatu Business Resilience Council. 'We've had such bad luck,' said Craig, referring to the three cyclones that struck in 2023 and the collapse of Vanuatu's national airline in May. 'We were just getting back on our feet and we were really looking forward to a bumper summer.'	https://apnews.com/article/vanuatu-earthquake-pacific-port-vila-rescue-1a4ce87db29567875d148a46edbce671	2024-12-18T20:58:03-08:00	
Japanese newspaper boss who influenced the nation's postwar politics died at 98	TOKYO (AP) — Tsuneo Watanabe, the powerful head of Japan's largest newspaper who had close ties with the country's powerful conservative leaders, has died, his company said Thursday. He was 98. Watanabe, the editor-in-chief of the Yomiuri Shimbun for over 30 years, died of pneumonia at a Tokyo hospital on Thursday, the Yomiuri said. Watanabe joined the newspaper in 1950 and covered politics throughout his career, attending editorial meetings until last month. He was still checking copy in his hospital room days before his death, the newspaper said. Watanabe cultivated close ties with conservative leaders who governed the country across decades, like Yasuhiro Nakasone and Shinzo Abe, and to helped form Japan's conservative public opinion. Abe was also known as a loyal reader and once told reporters all his opinions could be found in the Yomiuri when he was asked a question about a proposed constitutional revision. Watanabe stirred controversy in 1994 when the Yomiuri published a draft revision to the pacifist constitution calling for a clear reference to the Self Defense Force, Japan's de facto military, and other changes at a time when such ideas were taboo. Born in Tokyo in May, 1926, Watanabe studied philosophy at the University of Tokyo, which was interrupted during the World War II when he was drafted into the Imperial Army, before joining the Yomiuri in 1950. Watanabe, in a number of media interviews, criticized the wartime military for its abusive treatment of soldiers and wasteful deaths. He was also known for his opposition to the inclusion of war criminals among those worshipped at Tokyo's controversial Yasukuni shrine, and criticizing conservative lawmakers who visited the shrine. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba said he has met Watanabe a number of times and 'learned a lot from him about the war and perspectives on Japanese wartime history.' He said he also recently reread one of Watanabe's books on the governing Liberal Democratic Party and was impressed by his insights. Ishiba, embattled and heading a minority government after his party's election loss in October, said 'Under the current political situation, I wish we could seek his advice about our party, the democracy and the future of Japan as a peace-loving nation.' Watanabe served as Washington bureau chief and head of the political news section for the paper before becoming president and editor-in-chief of the Yomiuri Shimbun in 1991. He became chairman of the company in 2004. Despite his brief affiliation with the communist party as a student, Watanabe converted to staunch anti-communism. Watanabe also owned the Yomiuri Giants, Japan’s most popular baseball team, and served on an advisory panel for sumo wrestling.	https://apnews.com/article/japan-yomiuri-newspaper-media-baseball-d5fdb01234c86953d131f3d7a790a2b6	2024-12-18T20:16:33-08:00	
Separated for decades, Assad's fall spurs hope for families split by Golan Heights buffer zone	MAJDAL SHAMS, Golan Heights (AP) — The four sisters gathered by the side of the road, craning their necks to peer far beyond the razor wire-reinforced fence snaking across the mountain. One took off her jacket and waved it slowly above her head. In the distance, a tiny white speck waved frantically from the hillside. 'We can see you!' Soha Safadi exclaimed excitedly on her cellphone. She paused briefly to wipe away tears that had begun to flow. 'Can you see us too?' The tiny speck on the hill was Soha’s sister, Sawsan. Separated by war and occupation, they hadn’t seen each other in person for 22 years. The six Safadi sisters belong to the Druze community, one of the Middle East’s most insular religious minorities. Its population is spread across Syria, Lebanon, Israel and the Golan Heights, a rocky plateau that Israel seized from Syria in 1967 and annexed in 1981. The U.S. is the only country to recognize Israel's control; the rest of the world considers the Golan Heights occupied Syrian territory. Israel's seizure of the Golan Heights split families apart. Five of the six Safadi sisters and their parents live in Majdal Shams, a Druze town next to the buffer zone created between the Israeli-controlled Golan Heights and Syria. But the sixth, 49-year-old Sawsan, married a man from Jaramana, a town on the outskirts of the Syrian capital, Damascus, 27 years ago and has lived in Syria ever since. They have land in the buffer zone, where they grow olives and apples and also maintain a small house. With very few visits allowed to relatives over the years, a nearby hill was dubbed 'Shouting Hill,' where families would gather on either side of the fence and use loudspeakers to speak to each other. The practice declined as the internet made video calls widely accessible, while the Syrian war that began in 2011 made it difficult for those on the Syrian side to reach the buffer zone. But since the Dec. 8 fall of Syrian President Bashar Assad’s regime, families like the Safadis, are starting to revive the practice. They cling to hope, however faint, that regime change will herald a loosening of restrictions between the Israeli-controlled area and Syria that have kept them from their loved ones for so long. 'It was something a bit different. You see her in person. It feels like you could be there in two minutes by car,' Soha Safadi, 51, said Wednesday after seeing the speck that was her sister on the hill. 'This is much better, much better.' Since Assad’s fall, the sisters have been coming to the fence every day to see Sawsan. They make arrangements by phone for a specific time, and then make a video call while also trying to catch a glimpse of each other across the hill. 'She was very tiny, but I could see her,' Soha Safadi said. 'There were a lot of mixed feelings — sadness, joy and hope. And God willing, God willing, soon, soon, we will see her' in person. After Assad fell, the Israeli military pushed through the buffer zone and into Syria proper. It has captured Mount Hermon, Syria’s tallest mountain, known as Jabal al Sheikh in Arabic, on the slopes of which lies Majdal Shams. The buffer zone is now a hive of military and construction activity, and Sawsan can’t come close to the fence. While it is far too early to say whether years of hostile relations between the two countries will improve, the changes in Syria have sparked hope for divided families that maybe, just maybe, they might be able to meet again. 'This thing gave us a hope … that we can see each other. That all the people in the same situation can meet their families,' said another sister, 53-year-old Amira Safadi. Yet seeing Sawsan across the hill, just a short walk away, is also incredibly painful for the sisters. They wept as they waved, and cried even more when their sister put their nephew, 24-year-old Karam, on the phone. They have only met him once, during a family reunion in Jordan. He was 2 years old. 'It hurts, it hurts, it hurts in the heart,' Amira Safadi said. 'It’s so close and far at the same time. It is like she is here and we cannot reach her, we cannot hug her.'	https://apnews.com/article/syria-israel-golan-heights-druze-separated-families-59ed4baf194aec54e1209b5349c4f244	2024-12-18T20:13:01-08:00	
Stock Market Today: Asian shares track Wall Street's selloff after Fed hints at 2 rate cuts in 2025	BANGKOK (AP) — Shares skidded Thursday in Asia after U.S. stocks tumbled to one of their worst days of the year when the Federal Reserve hinted it may deliver fewer rate cuts in 2025 than earlier thought. The Fed cut its key rate by a quarter of a percentage point to between 4.25% and 4.5%, as expected. Other major central banks have stood pat this week, with the Bank of Japan opting Thursday to keep its benchmark rate at 0.25%. That decision, which also was no surprise, pushed the dollar higher against the Japanese yen. Asian markets fell, but generally by less than 2%, with Tokyo's Nikkei 225 falling 0.7% to 38,813.58. The dollar was trading at 156.44 yen, up from 154.79 yen. A weaker yen tends to push prices higher in Japan, which depends heavily on imports, and that in turn raises pressure on the Bank of Japan to raise rates. Analysts say they expect a BOJ rate hike in January, but also that the central bank is wary of big changes as it waits to see possible shocks from President-elect Donald Trump's policies on tariffs. There are 'high uncertainties' surrounding Japan's business outlook and prices and developments in foreign economies and commodity prices, the BOJ said in a statement. Chinese markets also declined. The Hang Seng index fell 0.5% to 19,760.10, while the Shanghai Composite index dropped 0.4% to 3,370.03. Australia's S&amp;P/ASX 200 shed 1.7% to 8,168.20, while the Kospi in South Korea slipped 2% to 2,435.93. India's Sensex fell 1.1%. In Taiwan, the Taiex lost 1%, while Bangkok's SET fell 1.1%. On Wednesday, the S&amp;P 500 fell 3%, just shy of its biggest loss for the year, to close at 5,872.16. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 1,123 points, or 2.6%, to 42,326.87, and the Nasdaq composite dropped 3.6% to 19,392.69. The Russell 2000 index of small-cap stocks tumbled 4.4%. Wednesday's rate cut is the third this year after it began in September to lower rates from a two-decade high to support the job market. Wall Street loves easier interest rates, but the cut was already widely expected and investors were more focused on how much more the Fed will cut next year. A lot is riding on it, particularly after expectations for a series of cuts in 2025 helped the U.S. stock market set an all-time high 57 times so far in 2024. Fed officials released projections on Wednesday showing the median expectation among them is for two more cuts to the federal funds rate in 2025, or half a percentage point’s worth. That’s down from the four cuts expected just three months ago. 'We are in a new phase of the process,' Fed Chair Jerome Powell said. Asked why Fed officials are looking to slow their cuts, he pointed to how well the job market is performing overall and how recent inflation readings have picked up. Powell said some Fed officials, but not all, are also already trying to incorporate uncertainties inherent in a new administration coming into the White House. Worries are rising on Wall Street that President-elect Donald Trump’s preference for tariffs and other policies could further fuel inflation. 'When the path is uncertain, you go a little slower,' Powell said. It’s 'not unlike driving on a foggy night or walking into a dark room full of furniture. You just slow down.' The reduced expectations for 2025 rate cuts sent Treasury yields higher, squeezing the stock market. The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.51% from 4.40% late Tuesday, which is a notable move for the bond market. The two-year yield, which more closely tracks expectations for Fed action, climbed to 4.35% from 4.25%. Nvidia, the superstar stock responsible for a chunk of Wall Street’s rally to records in recent years, fell 1.1% to extend its weekslong funk. It has dropped more than 13% from its record set last month and fallen in nine of the last 10 days as its big momentum slows. In other dealings early Thursday, U.S. benchmark crude oil gave up 46 cents to $69.56 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude, the international standard, fell 42 cents to $72.97 per barrel. The euro rose to $1.0396 from $1.0355.	https://apnews.com/article/stocks-markets-rates-japan-powell-710f79b27e09782eb68f31710c226460	2024-12-18T20:09:59-08:00	
Thousands of Syrian doctors work in Germany. It hopes they will stay after Assad's fall	BERLIN (AP) — Thousands of Syrian doctors work in Germany, and the fall of Bashar Assad is raising concern over the potential consequences for the health sector if many of them were to return home. Germany became a leading destination for Syrian refugees over the past decade, and some politicians were quick to start talking about encouraging the return of at least some after rebels took Damascus earlier this month. Others noted that the exiles include many well-qualified people and said their departure would hurt Germany — particularly that of doctors and other medical staff. 'Whole areas in the health sector would fall away if all the Syrians who work here now were to leave our country,' Interior Minister Nancy Faeser said last week. 'For us it is important that we make the offer to the Syrians who are here, who have a job, who have integrated, who are crime-free, whose children go to school, to stay here and be there for our economy.' Syrians have become a factor in a health sector that struggles to fill jobs, part of a wider problem Germany has with an aging population and a shortage of skilled labor. The head of the German Hospital Federation, Gerald Gass, says Syrians now make up the largest single group of foreign doctors, accounting for 2% to 3%. An estimated 5,000 Syrian doctors work in hospitals alone. Health Minister Karl Lauterbach, who puts the total number of Syrian doctors at over 6,000, says they are 'indispensable' to health care. Gass said the picture hospital operators are getting from Syrian doctors so far is 'very varied.' Some — particularly those with many relatives still in Syria — are considering a quick return if the situation proves stable, while others feel at ease and well-integrated in Germany and want to stay. But 'no looming mass movement toward Syria is recognizable' at present. 'It's certainly not the case that patient care would collapse in Germany if all Syrian doctors returned now,' Gass said. 'But of course we have the situation that these people often work in smaller groups at individual sites' — whose quick departure could force temporary local closures. 'We are well advised to treat these people respectfully,' Gass said. 'And yes, hospital owners are giving thought to how they could fill these jobs.' Many Syrian doctors have made Germany their home Dr. Hiba Alnayef, an assistant pediatric doctor at a hospital in Nauen, just outside Berlin, said she has been asked in the last 10 days, 'what if the Syrians all go back now?' 'I don't know — some want to, but it's very difficult and uncertain,' said Aleppo-born Alnayef, who has spent much of her life outside Syria and came to Germany from Spain in 2016. She said it's something she thinks about, 'but I have a homeland here too now.' She said she and other Syrian doctors and pharmacists would like to build cooperation between Germany and Syria. 'The Germans need specialists, Syria needs support ... renovation, everything is destroyed now,' she said. 'I think we can work well together to help both societies.' Alnayef said the German health system would have 'a big problem' if only part of its Syrian doctors decided to leave — 'we are understaffed, we are burned out, we are doing the work of several doctors.' She said Germany has offered 'a safe harbor,' but that discrimination and racism have been issues and integration is a challenge. Dr. Ayham Darouich, 40, who came from Aleppo to Germany to study medicine in 2007 and has had his own general practice in Berlin since 2021, said that 'as far as I have heard, none of my circle of friends wants to go back.' 'They have their family or their practices here, they have their society here,' Darouich said. German concerns that many might return are 'a bit exaggerated, or unjustified.' But he said Germany needs to do more to persuade medical professionals it trains to stay in the country, and that it could also do more to make itself attractive to foreigners needed to fill the gaps. 'We see that the nurses and medical professionals in hospitals earn relatively little in comparison with the U.S. or Switzerland,' Darouich said, and poorly regulated working hours and understaffed hospitals are among factors that 'drive people away.' ___ Associated Press journalist Pietro De Cristofaro in Berlin contributed to this report. ___ Follow the AP’s Syria coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/syria	https://apnews.com/article/germany-syria-doctors-refugees-5ca73a13c123b514fca33390acca0856	2024-12-18T20:08:29-08:00	
Gisèle Pelicot's ex-husband found guilty of rapes, sentenced to 20 years in prison in France	AVIGNON, France (AP) — A court in France on Thursday sentenced the ex-husband of Gisèle Pelicot to a maximum 20 years of imprisonment for drugging and raping her and allowing other men to rape her while she was knocked out, in abuse that lasted nearly a decade. The sentence against Dominique Pelicot was declared after he was found guilty of all charges against him. At age 72, it could mean that he spends the rest of his life in prison. The verdict was read by the lead judge of the court in Avignon, Roger Arata. Arata read out verdicts one after the other against Pelicot and 50 other men, declaring 'you are therefore declared guilty of aggravated rape on the person of Mme. Gisèle Pelicot' as he worked his way through the first names on the list. Gisèle Pelicot was seated on one side of the courtroom, facing the defendants as Arata announced one guilty verdict after another. The historic case has profoundly shaken France over the past several months. Dominique Pelicot admitted that for years he knocked his then wife of 50 years out with drugs so that he and strangers he recruited online could abuse her while he filmed the assaults. The appalling ordeal inflicted over nearly a decade on Gisèle Pelicot, now a 72-year-old grandmother, in what she thought was a loving marriage and her courage during the bruising and stunning trial have transformed the retired power company worker into a feminist hero of the nation. Stretching over more than three months, the trial galvanized campaigners against sexual violence and spurred calls for tougher measures to stamp out rape culture. Dominique Pelicot and 49 other men were tried in the southern French city of Avignon for aggravated rape and attempted rape and face up to 20 years imprisonment if convicted. Prosecutors asked that he get the maximum penalty and for sentences of 10 to 18 years for the others. They also requested a four-year prison term for another defendant who was tried for aggravated sexual assault. Of the 50 men accused of rape, just one was acquitted but was found guilty of aggravated sexual assault. The defendants were all accused of having taken part in Dominique Pelicot's sordid rape and abuse fantasies that were acted out in the couple's retirement home in the small Provence town of Mazan and elsewhere. Dominique Pelicot testified that he hid tranquilizers in food and drink that he gave his then wife, knocking her out so profoundly that he could do what he wanted to her for hours. One of the men was on trial not for assaulting Gisèle Pelicot but for drugging and raping his own wife — with the help and drugs from Dominique Pelicot, who was also tried for raping the other man's wife. The five judges voted by secret ballot in their rulings, with a majority vote required to convict and also for the sentences of those found guilty. Campaigners against sexual violence are hoping for exemplary prison terms and view the trial as a possible turning point in the fight against rape culture and the use of drugs to subdue victims. Gisèle Pelicot's courage in waiving her right to anonymity as a survivor of sexual abuse and successfully pushing for the hearings and shocking evidence — including videos — to be heard in open court have fueled conversations both on a national level in France and among families, couples and groups of friends about how to better protect women and the role that men can play in pursuing that goal. 'Men are starting to talk to women — their girlfriends, mothers and friends — in ways they hadn’t before,' said Fanny Foures, 48, who joined other women from the feminist group Les Amazones in gluing messages of support for Gisèle Pelicot on walls around Avignon before the verdict. 'It was awkward at first, but now real dialogues are happening,' she said. 'Some women are realizing, maybe for the first time, that their ex-husbands violated them, or that someone close to them committed abuse,' Foures added. 'And men are starting to reckon with their own behavior or complicity — things they’ve ignored or failed to act on. It’s heavy, but it’s creating change.' A large banner that campaigners hung on a city wall opposite the courthouse read, 'MERCI GISELE' — thank you Gisèle. Dominique Pelicot first came to the attention of police in September 2020, when a supermarket security guard caught him surreptitiously filming up women’s skirts. Police subsequently found his library of homemade images documenting years of abuse inflicted on his wife — more than 20,000 photos and videos in all, stored on computer drives and catalogued in folders marked 'abuse,' 'her rapists,' 'night alone' and other titles. The abundance of evidence led police to the other defendants. In the videos, investigators counted 72 different abusers, but weren't able to identify them all. Although some of the accused — including Dominique Pelicot — acknowledged that they were guilty of rape, many didn't, even in the face of video evidence. The hearings sparked wider debate in France about whether the country’s legal definition of rape should be expanded to include specific mention of consent. Some defendants argued that Dominique Pelicot’s consent covered his wife, too. Some sought to excuse their behavior by insisting that they hadn’t intended to rape anyone when they responded to the husband’s invitations to come to their home. Some laid blame at his door, saying he misled them into thinking they were taking part in consensual kink.	https://apnews.com/article/france-gisele-pelicot-rape-trial-verdicts-2b25791099f785fabb3c46123d30d9f9	2024-12-18T20:05:47-08:00	
South Korea's acting leader vetoes opposition-sponsored bills, deepening political strife	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea’s acting leader on Thursday vetoed a spate of contentious bills sponsored by the main opposition party, deepening political strife in the wake of parliament’s impeachment of President Yoon Suk Yeol. The ruling and opposition parties have been bickering over how much authority Prime Minister Han Duck-soo, the country's No. 2 official, has assumed since the opposition-controlled National Assembly last Saturday voted to suspend Yoon’s presidential powers over his short-lived Dec. 3 martial law. The Constitutional Court is to determine whether to formally dismiss the conservative Yoon as president or reinstate him. Law enforcement authorities are also separately investigating whether Yoon's martial law enforcement amounted to rebellion. Yoon's defense minister, police chief and several other military commanders have already been arrested over the case. The main liberal opposition Democratic Party earlier considered impeaching Han as well for failing to stop Yoon's martial law declaration, but shelved the idea after he became acting leader. Four of the six bills vetoed by Han were meant to introduce greater state financial assistance programs for the country’s agriculture and fisheries industries. The most contentious bill is the Grain Management Act, which would require the government to buy surplus rice if the price drops too sharply to protect the country’s farming industry and promote its food sovereignty. Han said the bill would cause 'immense' financial burdens on the government and eventually lead to further drops in rice prices. Another controversial bill is the National Assembly Testimony Appraisal Act, which would give lawmakers more power to request people to attend parliament hearings and submit documents. Under the proposed legislation, individuals could no longer decline such requests by citing the protection of trade secrets or personal information. The Democratic Party said the bill is necessary to determine the full details of Yoon’s martial law decree. But Han said the bill would likely infringe upon people’s privacy and that there are concerns among business leaders that key technology and company secrets could be leaked. 'I’m heavy-hearted because I’ve asked the National Assembly to discuss and act on the six bills again at a time when we desperately need cooperation among the government and the ruling and opposition parties,' Han said in televised comments at the start of a Cabinet Council meeting on Thursday. 'But the government should make a responsible decision that prioritizes the principles of the Constitution and the future of our country.' Democratic lawmaker and spokesperson Noh Jongmyun quickly criticized Han, warning him 'not to cross a line,' adding, 'We’ll immediately drag him down if he’s found to have collaborated with the rebellion.' Han’s office later sent formal documents on his vetoes to the National Assembly. To enact a bill vetoed by a president, the parliament needs support from two-thirds of its 300 lawmakers. The Democratic Party and other small opposition parties together hold 192 seats. Observers earlier speculated the Democratic Party would reconsider impeaching Han if he vetoed the bills. Another source of contention between the rival parties is whether Han has the right to appoint three vacant justices' seats at the Constitutional Court, as filling the vacancies could affect the court's decision on Yoon. The martial law enactment lasted only six hours, but it caused huge political turmoil in South Korea and set off alarms from its neighbors and diplomatic partners. Yoon sent hundreds of troops and police officers to the National Assembly to block its vote on his decree. But many lawmakers managed to enter a parliament hall and unanimously voted it down, forcing Yoon's Cabinet to lift it. Yoon has defended his decree as an act of governance, saying it was a warning to the Democratic Party, which he said has been using its parliamentary majority to obstruct his agenda. Meeting with foreign media on Thursday, Seok Dong-hyeon, a lawyer and spokesperson for Yoon’s emerging legal team, echoed Yoon’s assertion that his short-lived power grab didn’t amount to a rebellion. Seok said Yoon did not intend to paralyze the parliament and denied claims the president ordered the military to arrest his political opponents, including Democratic Party leader Lee Jae-myung. 'Regarding the charges of rebellion, he never even thought about it, so he cannot possibly agree to such an accusation,' Seok said. 'What kind of a rebellion is announced through a press conference broadcast to citizens, media and the whole world, as if he was saying, ‘I’m now about to commit a rebellion?'' Seok said. 'When the National Assembly followed the constitutional procedure to lift martial law after two or three hours, we abided by that procedure.' He said Yoon may appear in the Constitutional Court to directly defend his case. When asked whether Yoon would continue to ignore law enforcement’s requests to question him and search his office, Seok declined to give a specific answer, saying these matters would be handled by Yoon’s legal team, which he said is nearly assembled.	https://apnews.com/article/south-korea-martial-law-yoon-impeachment-acting-leader-2b56a4b1c006bfe8c80742b37e11c52d	2024-12-18T19:21:28-08:00	
Macao's casino boom brings wealth but at a cost, 25 years since China's takeover	MACAO (AP) — When Portugal returned its colony Macao to China in 1999, coffee shop owner Daniel Chao was a first grader living in a different world. Since then his sleepy hometown has transformed into a bustling gaming hub lined with glittering casinos. Its once quiet streets are now jammed with tourist buses. But the growing wealth of the city dubbed the 'Las Vegas of the East' has not brought qualities of sustainable development such as economic diversity and high civic participation. 'What was once a relaxed, free place in my childhood has become a place that is crowded and highly commercialized,' said Chao. Macao will mark the 25th anniversary of its return to Chinese rule on Friday. Chinese President Xi Jinping is visiting the city for three days and the city is festooned with celebratory banners and other decorations. A fireworks display is planned for next week. Since 1999, the city of 687,000 has transformed from a monopoly-driven gambling enclave into the world’s biggest gaming hub, packed with mainland Chinese tourists. Its GDP per person has more than quadrupled to $68,000, roughly on a par with Denmark and Australia and surpassing Hong Kong's of about $50,000. China rules Macao under a 'one country, two systems' arrangement similar to its governance of Hong Kong, a former British colony. Macao is the only Chinese city where casino gambling is legal and it has resorts run by affiliates of the American gaming giants MGM Resorts, Las Vegas Sands and Wynn Resorts. Since Macao opened its casino market following the handover to Beijing, its economy has grown to $46 billion in 2023 from $6.5 billion in 1999, despite economic slumps during the COVID-19 pandemic and a crackdown on the junkets that have facilitated visits by high-roller gamblers from elsewhere. The economic growth has come at a cost. Chao’s mother worked at a casino job that brought better pay and a bigger apartment, but also stress and irregular hours. He remembers doing homework at 5 a.m., after her night shift. When he was working as a teacher, his students often went to sleep late or had to rely on paid tutors because their parents also worked casino shifts. The city’s tourism boom has brought years of easy money that gave its businesses scant incentive to strive to improve their products or services and develop the resilience needed to overcome the hard times of the pandemic and competition from mainland Chinese products, Chao and some other residents said. Chao has considered leaving the city, but opted to stay. 'Leaving must come at a heavy price,' he said, adding that 'it seems Macao isn’t exactly unlivable yet.' The ruling Communist Party's agenda for Macao now holds sway, with city leaders often referring to national plans. That’s a marked shift from the past, when the city rarely felt any direct impact from Beijing, said Ieong Meng U, a professor at the government and public administration department of the University of Macao. He expects Macao to become increasingly integrated with nearby Guangdong province over the next decade, following plans to promote tourism, Chinese medicine, finance, technology and exhibitions. China has designated a special zone on Hengqin island in neighboring Zhuhai city, jointly run by Guangdong and Macao, that is planned to have about 120,000 Macao residents by 2035. The closer economic ties have coincided with more intrusive political controls, especially after huge anti-government protests in Hong Kong in 2019 that led Beijing to crack down on virtually all public dissent. A vigil commemorating China’s bloody 1989 military crackdown on the Tiananmen Square pro-democracy protests was banned. Pro-democracy figures were barred from running in Macao's 2021 legislative elections. Last year, the city toughened its national security law. In November, Macao Journalists Association expressed concerns over signs of declining press freedom, saying some local media outlets have been asked to withdraw their articles due to political pressure. Activist Jason Chao, no relation to Daniel Chao, decided to leave. After years of working to promote greater democracy, he grew frustrated by officials' lack of willingness to change and the tendency of Macao residents to rely on solving problems through seeking Beijing's help or personal connections rather than civic participation, a habit he says partly stems from the city's colonial heritage under Portuguese rule. 'I exhausted the tactics I had learned at that time,' Chao said. In 2017, Chao left to study overseas. He's now a director of a civil society organization serving Hong Kong immigrants in Britain. Some older residents believe life has improved in the past quarter century. Ka Man Chun, a retiree, likes the annual cash handouts, funded by gaming tax reserves, that the government has given residents since 2008. This year, each permanent resident received $1,240, Ka says he feels safe since he steers clear of politics. '25 years have passed, there’s nothing really bad,' he said. Macao’s public security, economy and welfare have improved significantly from the colonial era, said Anna Ng, a flower shop owner in her 60s. Though critics say Macao has failed to diversify its economy, Ng sees signs of progress in the city’s growing exhibition industry and says she's found new opportunities in cultural and creative activities. Enid Ieong said she has grown bored with the city's limited choices for careers and leisure activities and wants to join her boyfriend in Hong Kong. She dreams of living in Hong Kong's Sai Kung, an area famous for its scenic beauty and beaches. Ieong mocked the annual cash handout as compensation for what she calls the psychological damage of living in a gaming hub. 'I feel like I was born in a grand mansion, but am only responsible for sweeping the floor,' she said.	https://apnews.com/article/macao-25th-anniversary-handover-casino-china-6f6bc0345cf94bd787a65c4623f7d7e8	2024-12-18T19:06:30-08:00	
Airstrikes hit Yemen's rebel-held capital and port city after Houthi attack targets Israel	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — A series of intense airstrikes shook Yemen's rebel-held capital and a port city early Thursday, shortly after a Houthi missile targeted central Israel. It wasn't immediately clear who launched the strikes on Sanaa, which the Iranian-backed Houthis have held for over a decade. The Houthis also reported strikes in Hodeida as well. But initial information on the targets of the attack and the timing suggested Israel may have conducted the assault. Houthi-controlled media reported the strikes, but offered no immediate information on casualties nor damage. The Houthi-controlled satellite channel al-Masirah said that some of the strikes targeted power stations in the capital, as well as the Ras Isa oil terminal on the Red Sea. Rebel-held Hodeida, some 145 kilometers (90 miles) southwest of Sanaa, has been key for food shipments into Yemen as its decadelong war has gone on. There's also longstanding suspicion that weapons from Iran have been transferred through the port. The strikes happened just after the Israeli military said its air force intercepted a missile launched from Yemen before it entered the country’s territory. 'Rocket and missile sirens were sounded following the possibility of falling debris from the interception,' the Israeli military said. Sirens sounded near Tel Aviv and the surrounding areas, and a large explosion was heard overhead at the time. The Houthis did not immediately claim the missile attack, but said an important military statement would be issued in the coming hours, following a pattern of how they claim their assaults. The Israeli military did not respond to a request for comment. Israel has struck the Houthis in the past over attacks targeting Israel and in recent weeks have threatened to again attack the rebels. Israel previously struck Hodeida and its oil infrastructure in July after a Houthi drone attack killed one person and wounded 10 in Tel Aviv. American forces have also launched a series of strikes on the Houthis over nearly a year due to Houthi attacks on shipping in the Red Sea corridor. On Monday, the U.S. military's Central Command said it hit 'a key command-and-control facility' operated by the Houthis in Sanaa, later identified as the al-Ardi complex once home to the government's Defense Ministry. But on Thursday, a U.S. military official said the attacks weren’t carried out by the Americans, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the ongoing strikes. The Houthis have targeted some 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones since the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip started in October 2023 after Hamas' surprise attack on Israel. The Houthis have seized one vessel and sunk two in a campaign that has also killed four sailors. Other missiles and drones have either been intercepted by separate U.S.- and European-led coalitions in the Red Sea or failed to reach their targets, which have also included Western military vessels. The rebels maintain that they target ships linked to Israel, the U.S. or the United Kingdom to force an end to Israel’s campaign against Hamas in Gaza. However, many of the ships attacked have little or no connection to the conflict, including some bound for Iran. The Houthis have battled a Saudi-led coalition into a stalemate in a wider Yemen war that’s killed more than 150,000 people, including civilians. The conflict also has created one of the world’s worst humanitarian disasters that's believed to killed tens of thousands more.	https://apnews.com/article/yemen-houthi-rebels-airstrikes-sanaa-israel-hamas-war-8f73755ccc47a34261cc041658403b4d	2024-12-18T16:54:11-08:00	
Researcher: North Korea can produce ballistic missiles for Russia to use against Ukraine in months	UNITED NATIONS (AP) — North Korea demonstrated this year that it could produce ballistic missiles and supply them to Russia for use against Ukraine in a matter of months, the head of a research organization that traces weapons used in the war said Wednesday. Jonah Leff told the U.N. Security Council that researchers on the ground examined remnants of four missiles from North Korea recovered in Ukraine in July and August, including one that had marks indicating it was produced in 2024. 'This is the first public evidence of missiles having been produced in North Korea and then used in Ukraine within a matter of months, not years,' he said. Leff also had briefed the Security Council in late June, telling members that the organization he heads, Conflict Armament Research, had 'irrefutably' established that ballistic missile remnants found in Ukraine early this year were from a missile manufactured in North Korea. The U.K.-based organization, which was established in 2011 to document and trace weapons used in conflicts to assist governments in countering diversion and proliferation, has worked in Ukraine since 2018. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un vowed his country would 'invariably support' Russia’s war in Ukraine when he met Russia’s defense chief in late November, the North’s state media reported. Russia’s U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia objected to the second appearance of Leff at the council meeting, chaired by Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield of the United States, which holds the council’s rotating presidency this month. He claimed Leff represents NATO and the European Union, and questioned whether his organization could provide impartial assessments. And he accused Thomas-Greenfield of violating Security Council practices and transforming its meetings 'into a politicized act of buffoonery.' The U.S. ambassador retorted that Russia had vetoed a resolution that ended the monitoring of sanctions against North Korea by U.N. experts, which she said makes organizations like Conflict Armament Research and its independent, well-regarded experts all the more critical. She said its reports show why Russia was determined to block the renewal of the mandate for the U.N. experts. Russia and North Korea 'are engaging in unlawful arms transfers and training, in brazen violation of numerous council resolutions,' Thomas-Greenfield said. Leff stood by the organization's research and said its analysis highlights three observations about North Korea’s missile activities. It confirms the continued use of freshly manufactured North Korean ballistic missiles in Ukraine, he said, and the discovery of the 2024 manufacturing mark on one missile reveals the very short period between the production of these ballistic missiles, their transfer and eventual use in Ukraine. Leff also said the presence of recently produced missile components not from North Korea, some bearing 2023 production marks, 'illustrates North Korea’s robust acquisition network for its ballistic missile program, despite U.N. sanctions prohibiting the transfer of this material for military purpose.' North Korea’s U.N. Ambassador Kim Song insisted that its relationship with Russia is 'a positive contribution to international peace and security and can by no means be subject of the criticism.' He accused the United States and its allies of inciting 'confrontation and discord among nations,' by intervening militarily across the planet and providing Ukraine with billions of dollars in military aid, including long-range weapons.	https://apnews.com/article/un-north-korea-ukraine-ballistic-missiles-e917b0eb55fd7489532c33d982731ff0	2024-12-18T14:20:27-08:00	
Timothée Chalamet and Saoirse Ronan chat fame and friendship	LONDON (AP) — Timothée Chalamet and Saoirse Ronan may be juggling multiple releases and busy schedules, but the bright young stars managed to reunite on Wednesday in London for a conversation at the British Film Institute. The former co-stars met on Greta Gerwig’s 2017 high school film 'Lady Bird' and were paired up again several years later in her adaptation of 'Little Women.' Though professionally their lives have taken them in different directions, they’ve remained friends and will 'dip back in every few years' to catch up, Ronan said. 'That is what is so beautiful about this point in our lives, we’re really lucky that the two of us are doing really well and our paths can continue to cross,' Ronan added, as her husband, Jack Lowden supported from the audience. Both had busy years appearing in multiple film releases that are now vying for awards recognition. Chalamet took on the role of Bob Dylan in James Mangold’s 'A Complete Unknown,' which is out Christmas day, and Ronan played a young alcoholic who tries to escape the depths of her addiction by moving home to the Orkney Islands in Scotland in 'The Outrun.' Chalamet also stepped back into the role of Paul Atreides in the epic sci-fi 'Dune: Part Two,' and Ronan starred in Steve McQueen’s 'Blitz.' The audience watched back-to-back scenes of the collaborations with Gerwig. Chalamet quipped that a 'Lady Bird scene is a lot better than I remember it being!' The conversation then shifted to their relationship with fame. Chalamet said it’s the 'most boring thing to talk about in my life.' Ronan agreed: 'I just pretended that all of that doesn’t exist.'	https://apnews.com/article/film-timothee-chalamet-saoirse-ronan-a31d362ad5f5f61691c9c81928b116b0	2024-12-18T13:57:28-08:00	
China's getting a big electric car battery swapping boost in 2025. Would that work across the globe?	Detroit (AP) — China will soon see a massive expansion of electric vehicle battery swapping, as global battery maker CATL said Wednesday it is investing heavily in stations there next year. Battery swapping is not new — but it's had a challenging journey. Adoption of electric vehicles has varied in regions across the globe over the past several years, and that doesn't always bode well for building new infrastructure. While the technology could do well in China, it's uncertain whether it could work in other countries. What is battery swapping? Battery swapping allows EV drivers to pull into a station on a low battery and receive a swapped, fully-charged battery within minutes. An EV has to be equipped with the right technology to receive a swap — and not many models around the world currently have it. Automakers have to buy into the idea, and EV adoption among consumers also has to grow, so that investing in new infrastructure seems worthwhile. Consumers also have to be comfortable not owning their battery. Why could it work in China? China is much further along in adopting EVs than other countries. Not only is it the world's largest auto market, but in July, the country hit a milestone with 50% of new sales electric — and it accounts for most of this year's global EV sales. China supports EV growth through government subsidies and mandates. So it makes more sense for companies to invest in unique EV infrastructure there because that's more likely to be needed. What other attempts at battery swapping have occurred? The most notable example might be Israeli startup Better Place, which tried its hand at swapping in 2007. But the company shut down a few years later after investing a lot of money and coming up against roadblocks with logistics. EV adoption was especially low at the time. Could it work in the United States? Europe? Startup Ample, for example, has a modular battery swapping station that it says can complete a swap in 5 minutes. That’s important as charging time remains a point of concern for prospective EV buyers. Even the fastest fast chargers could take at least 15 minutes for a decent charge. But in the U.S., pure EVs only accounted for 8% of new vehicle sales as of November. Meanwhile Nio, a rival Chinese EV brand, has about 60 swap stations in northern Europe, and the EV adoption is higher there than the U.S., but the same challenges remain. Different automakers put different batteries in their various EV models, so a station would need all of those available if the industry didn't agree to a standardized battery, and not all of those models are out yet in volume. This is something that really needs scale. Swapping could help with EV cost — currently a barrier to adoption for many — because a driver wouldn’t necessarily own the most expensive part of an EV: the battery. Greg Less, director of the University of Michigan Battery Lab, said with proper framing and education, people might like the idea of battery swapping. To him, it's not unlike buying a propane-fueled grill and purchasing a refilled tank every so often. But it would require a rethinking of car ownership. 'Where I could see it working is if we went entirely away from vehicle ownership and we went to a use-on-demand model,' Less added. 'I don’t think we’re there yet.' What vehicle uses might be b est for swapping? Battery swapping might make most sense for ride-sharing or other fleet vehicles. Drivers of buses, taxis, Uber or Lyft vehicles want to spend as much time on the road as possible, transporting customers and making money. If battery swapping can shorten the time needed to charge EVs, that makes driving one less disruptive to their business. ___ Alexa St. John is an Associated Press climate solutions reporter.

An arson attack targets a Montreal synagogue and a nearby Jewish office building is damaged	MONTREAL (AP) — A synagogue in a Montreal suburb was targeted in what police suspect was an arson attack early Wednesday, the second time the building in this Canadian city was hit by an incendiary device in little more than a year. Police said a nearby Jewish office building was apparently also targeted Wednesday, though it was unclear if the two attacks were linked. Montreal police received a 911 call shortly before 3 a.m. about a fire at the Congregation Beth Tikvah on the island suburb of Dollard-des-Ormeaux, police spokesperson Véronique Dubuc said. Firefighters extinguished the blaze and found an incendiary device at the scene, she said. A window of the synagogue was smashed and a door was damaged. 'Witnesses told us that they saw one suspect that was leaving rapidly shortly after the fire started,' she said, adding that the building was damaged by smoke but the overall consequences of the fire were minor. No injuries were reported and there have been no arrests in the case, Dubuc said, adding that police have not yet determined whether the fire was a hate crime. A few hours later, officers at the scene of the fire noticed a similarly smashed window and a damaged glass door at a nearby building belonging to the West Island office of the Federation CJA, a building frequented by the city’s Jewish community. Dubuc said no incendiary device was found at the second location. Police are investigating a possible link between the two incidents, she said. The same synagogue and the CJA building were targeted by arson in November 2023, causing minor damage to the synagogue’s front door and the back door of the CJA office. No one was injured in those attacks and police have not made arrests in that case. Jewish groups and politicians condemned the targeting of the Jewish institutions on Wednesday. 'This vile antisemitic attack against Montreal’s Jewish community is cowardly and criminal,' Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on X. Israeli President Isaac Herzog denounced the attack and called 'on the Canadian government to act decisively, and show that such hatred will not be tolerated.'	https://apnews.com/article/synagogue-arson-montreal-canada-49a8dace464e0b83def53ed21725bbe0	2024-12-18T13:21:29-08:00	
US effort to curb China's and Russia's access to advanced computer chips 'inadequate,' report finds	WASHINGTON (AP) — The Commerce Department's efforts to curb China's and Russia's access to American-made advanced computer chips have been 'inadequate' and will need more funding to stymie their ability to manufacture advanced weapons, according to a report published Wednesday by the Senate's Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. The Biden administration imposed export controls to limit the ability of China and Russia ability to access U.S.-made chips after Russia's invasion of Ukraine nearly three years ago. The agency's Bureau of Industry and Security, according to the report, does not have the resources to enforce export controls and has been too reliant on U.S. chip makers voluntarily complying with the rules. But the push for bolstering Commerce's export control enforcement comes as the incoming Trump administration says it is looking to dramatically reduce the size and scope of federal government. President-elect Donald Trump has tapped entrepreneurs Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy to lead a new 'Department of Government Efficiency' to dismantle parts of the federal government. The Trump transition team did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the report. BIS’s budget, about $191 million, has remained essentially flat since 2010 when adjusted for inflation. 'While BIS’ budget has been stagnant for a decade, the bureau works diligently around the clock to meet its mission and safeguard U.S. national security,' Commerce Department spokesperson Charlie Andrews said in a statement in response to the report. Andrews added that with 'necessary resources from Congress' the agency would be 'better equipped to address the challenges that come with our evolving national security environment.' In a letter to Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo on Wednesday, Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, chair of the subcommittee, pointed to an audit of Texas Instruments that showed the Russian military continued to acquire components from Texas Instruments through front companies in Hong Kong to illustrate how the export controls are failing as an effective tool. The committee's findings, Blumenthal said, suggest that Texas Instruments 'missed clear warning signs' that three companies in its distribution chain had been diverting products to Russia. Texas Instruments did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 'While Congress must provide BIS more resources to undertake its critical mission, it is long past time for BIS to make full use of the enforcement powers Congress has conferred upon it and take aggressive steps to cut the flow of U.S. semiconductors into the Russian war machine,' Blumenthal wrote. It's not just Texas Instruments that's the issue. The subcommittee in September published a report that found aggregated exports from four major U.S. advanced chip manufacturers nearly doubled from 2021 to 2022 to Armenia and Georgia. Both of those countries are home to front companies known to assist Russia in acquiring advanced chips made in the U.S. despite export controls. China, meanwhile, has created 'vast, barely disguised smuggling networks which enable it to continue to harness U.S. technology,' the subcommittee report asserts. Washington has been gradually expanding the number of companies affected by such export controls in China, as President Joe Biden’s administration has encouraged an expansion of investments in and manufacturing of chips in the U.S. But Chinese companies have found ways to evade export controls in part because of a lack of China subject matter experts and Chinese speakers assigned to Commerce's export control enforcement. The agency's current budget limits the number of international end-use checks, or physical verification overseas of distributors or companies receiving American-made chips that are the supposed end users of products.

CNN says its report on a freed Syrian prisoner is not what it initially believed	CNN is acknowledging that a gripping story it aired last week depicting a Syrian man being let free from a Damascus prison after the fall of dictator Bashar Assad's regime was not what it seemed. The network said that it has since found out that the man shown in correspondent Clarissa Ward's report, which initially aired on Dec. 11, apparently gave a false identity. 'This moment captures the complexity of the situation in Syria,' CNN's Jake Tapper said on Tuesday. In the report, Ward was being escorted by a Syrian rebel through a prison that had been run by the Syrian Air Force intelligence services and emptied since the Assad government fell. That's what they thought, at least — until they came upon a padlocked door. The rebel guard shot the lock to open the door to a cell, where they found a man hiding under a blanket. Clearly bewildered and shaking, he gulped water when offered, said 'oh, God, there is light!' when led outdoors and hugged the guard when told of the change in power. He told Ward that his name was Adel Ghurbal from the Syrian city of Homs, and that he was a civilian who had been arrested three months ago and spent time in three different prisons. But a few days later, a Syrian fact-checking site, Verify-Sy, said that the man was really Salama Mohammad Salama, and that he was a former intelligence officer for the Assad government. CNN obtained a photo of Salama and, through facial recognition software, found that it was a better than 99 percent chance that was the same man from their report, the network said. Ward said Tuesday that CNN didn't know why he had been arrested. Verify-Sy reported that Salama, who had a reputation for extortion, had been thrown in prison because of a dispute with a superior officer over sharing some of the profits, she said. CNN has been unable to confirm that or locate Salama, she said. A CNN spokeswoman said that no one outside of the network knew ahead of time of the plans to visit the prison. CNN reported the scene as it unfolded, the network said. It was arresting video, and the temptation to air Ward's story was obvious. While CNN did due diligence and research in uncovering the problem after the fact, the question is whether the network could have, or should have, done more to verify the prisoner's story before it was used. 'I think we need to be humble about the challenges,' Ward said on the air Tuesday. 'It is a chaotic atmosphere, there is a huge amount of flux, and it is very difficult to verify information in real time on the ground ... Stories take unexpected turns. We have to continue to report them without fear or favor, but it is immensely challenging in this environment and I think we need to be transparent about that.' ___ David Bauder writes about media for the AP.

Manhattan man pleads guilty to helping establish secret Chinese police station in NYC	NEW YORK (AP) — A Manhattan resident has pleaded guilty to helping establish a secret police station in New York City on behalf of the Chinese government. Chen Jinping, 60, entered the guilty plea on a single count of conspiracy to act as an agent of a foreign government in Brooklyn federal court on Wednesday. Matthew Olsen, an assistant attorney general in the U.S. Department of Justice, said Chen admitted in court to his role in 'audaciously establishing an undeclared police station' in Manhattan and attempting to conceal the effort when approached by the FBI. 'This illegal police station was not opened in the interest of public safety, but to further the nefarious and repressive aims of the PRC in direct violation of American sovereignty,' he said in statement, referring to the People's Republic of China. Prosecutors say Chen and his co-defendant, Lu Jianwang, opened and operated a local branch of China’s Ministry of Public Security in Manhattan’s Chinatown neighborhood starting in early 2022. The office, which occupied an entire floor of the building, performed basic services, such as helping Chinese citizens renew their Chinese driver’s licenses, but also identified pro-democracy activists living in the U.S., according to federal authorities. The clandestine Chinese police operation was shuttered in the fall of 2022 amid an FBI investigation. But in an apparent effort to obstruct the federal probe, Chen and Lu deleted from their phones communications with a Chinese government official they reported to, prosecutors said. China is believed to be operating such secretive police outposts in North America, Europe and other places where there are Chinese communities. The country, however, has denied that they are police stations, saying that they exist mainly to provide citizen services such as renewing driver’s licenses. The arrest of Chen and Lu in April 2023 was part of a series of Justice Department prosecutions aimed at cracking down on 'transnational repression,' in which foreign governments such as China work to identify, intimidate and silence dissidents in the U.S. Lawyers for Chen and Lu declined to comment Wednesday. Chen faces up to five years in prison at his sentencing on May 30. Lu, who is due back in court in February, had a longstanding relationship with Chinese law enforcement officials, according to prosecutors. Over the years, they say, the Bronx resident, who was also known as Harry Lu, helped harass and threaten a Chinese fugitive living in the U.S. and also worked to locate a pro-democracy activist in California on behalf of China’s government. ___ Follow Philip Marcelo at twitter.com/philmarcelo.	https://apnews.com/article/chinese-government-justice-department-new-york-police-51213e1daf36cb8f615b329de06afe30	2024-12-18T10:08:47-08:00	
Egypt's prime minister briefly pauses a news conference after feeling dizzy	CAIRO (AP) — Egypt's prime minister was forced to briefly pause a televised news conference on Wednesday after experiencing some dizziness, a government spokesperson said. Prime Minister Mustafa Madbouly, 58, was speaking at the new administrative capital in Cairo during his weekly Cabinet news briefing when he felt unwell, grabbed the microphone stand tightly and asked for a pause. According to Cabinet spokesperson Mohamed el-Homsani, the prime minister felt dizzy and had to pause his remarks but was soon better and resumed the briefing after a few minutes. Madbouly was speaking about President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi 's meetings at home and abroad. El-Homsani said Madbouli was exhausted, had experienced a severe cold days earlier but refused to rest and was tired after leaving the office late Tuesday. He also had several meetings on Wednesday morning, before the news conference, the spokesperson said, adding that the prime minister is taking medication, including antibiotics. Madbouly, an architect by profession, became prime minister in 2018. Egypt is hosting an eight-country economic cooperation summit in Cairo on Thursday with Indonesia, Malaysia, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Iran, Nigeria and Turkey due to attend the gathering.	https://apnews.com/article/egypt-prime-minister-mustafa-madbouly-dde9bc5a130b7f5c35a5c04ea904af88	2024-12-18T09:00:58-08:00	
China and India agree to work on solution to their border dispute in the Himalayas	BEIJING, China (AP) — China and India agreed Wednesday to work toward a solution to their long-running border dispute in the Himalayas after a military standoff that began with a deadly clash in 2020. The development follows a pact on border patrols the two Asian giants reached in October, which finally broke a stalemate that started with the clash in the Ladakh region. The clash was the first deadly confrontation between India and China since 1975 and sent tensions soaring. A statement from China’s Foreign Ministry after talks between the special representatives on border issues — Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi and Indian National Security Advisor Ajit Doval — said the two sides would seek 'fair and reasonable' solutions and formulate a roadmap, undertaking the easier steps first and dealing with the tough ones later. The October border pact was followed days later by a meeting between Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, their first in five years. Wang and Doval called for continued implementation of the border patrol agreement and said the two countries would strengthen cross-border exchanges, including the resumption of trips by Indian pilgrims to Tibet, the Chinese statement said.	https://apnews.com/article/china-india-border-dispute-d808afcdb6eb7a5deab3babea425bc6f	2024-12-18T08:10:29-08:00	
Cyclone Chido leaves Mayotte reeling. Warmer oceans fueled it	The Indian Ocean archipelago of Mayotte is reeling from Cyclone Chido, the most intense storm to hit the French territory in 90 years. At least 22 people have been killed since Chido made landfall on Saturday, as high winds swept away entire neighborhoods, damaged major infrastructure and uprooted trees. And while Africa's southeast coast is no stranger to devastating cyclones, climate scientists have warned in recent years that storms in the area are getting more intense and more frequent as a result of human-caused climate change. When is cyclone season in southeast Africa? Cyclone season in southeast Africa runs from December to March, when waters in the region are at their warmest. That's because warm water fuels tropical storms so they tend to happen when oceans hit their peak temperatures for the year. In recent years, devastating storms such as Cyclone Freddy in 2023, Batsirai in 2022 and Idai in 2019 all battered the southeastern coast of Africa — including swathes of Malawi, Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Madagascar — during southern hemisphere summer. Cyclones are the same as hurricanes, but carry that name in the Indian Ocean and Australia. How does climate change make cyclones worse? Human-caused climate change, caused largely by the burning of coal, oil and gas, has heated up the planet: the atmosphere is now 1.3 degrees Celsius (2.3 Fahrenheit) warmer than pre-industrial times. That matters because one ingredient for a cyclone, or hurricane, is warm water — at least 27 degrees Celsius (80 Fahrenheit), according to the United States' National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association. With rising global temperatures, sea surface temperatures have reached all-time recorded highs. This warmer water can make the resulting storms more powerful, with stronger winds, heavier rainfall and more destructive storm surges. In 2022, a group of climate scientists found that cyclones that pummeled southeast Africa that year were made worse by climate change. Because of a lack of weather data gathered in the region, they weren't able to say by how much. Is Chido a ‘bomb cyclone'? Storm intensity is measured by central pressure — the lower the pressure, the stronger the storm. A storm is considered a 'bomb' when the pressure drops rapidly, meaning the storm grows very quickly. According to NOAA, a bomb cyclone, also known as bombogenesis, occurs when the atmospheric pressure drops at least 24 millibars over a 24-hour period. It typically results in extremely strong winds and heavy precipitation, which can cause coastal flooding. Hazards can also include blizzard conditions. Bomb cyclones are more commonly associated with cold-weather systems. Cyclone Chido intensified rapidly, leading some to tag it a bomb cyclone. However, while it intensified rapidly, it would not meet the bomb cyclone criteria due to different formation processes. In a tropical region, cyclones rely primarily on warm ocean waters and atmospheric instability rather than the temperature contrasts (typically between cold and warm air masses) driving bomb cyclones. Shortage of early warning systems Much of the African continent lacks the weather data and forecasting that other countries take for granted. Figures from the World Meteorological Organization estimate that the continent has just 37 radar facilities for tracking weather, compared to Europe's 347 and North America's 291. It means that countries vulnerable to weather extremes are less prepared when deadly storms hit, so they can't evacuate on time. Death tolls of the more devastating cyclones in recent years have gone into the hundreds — and 2019's Idai saw over 1,000 people killed. In 2022, the U.N. launched a project that aims to put every person in the world in range of early weather-warning systems within five years. The WMO's secretary-general, Celeste Saulo, has made better access to weather forecasts a priority for the agency, calling adapting to climate change an 'essential necessity.' ___ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Several children killed in stampede at a holiday fair event in Nigeria, state governor says	ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) — Several children have died during a stampede on Wednesday at a holiday funfair in southwestern Nigeria, authorities said. The incident happened at the Islamic High School in Basorun, Oyo State, near the economic hub of Lagos. Security forces attended the scene and arrested the event organizers, state governor Seyi Makinde said in a statement. 'Earlier today, an incident occurred in Islamic High School Basorun, the venue of an event organised for families. Sadly, a stampede at the venue has led to multiple loss of lives and injuries. This is a very sad day,' Makinde said. 'We sympathise with the parents whose joy has suddenly been turned to mourning due to these deaths,' he added. Nigeria's national emergency services said it has deployed a team to help provide assistance to the victims. Children injured at the venue were taken to local hospitals where parents were asked to check for missing persons. Video footage that appeared to be from the scene showed a large crowd of mostly children looking on as some children were being carried away from an open field. Local media identified the event organizers as the Women In Need Of Guidance and Support Foundation, which held a similar event for children last year. The group was preparing to host up to 5,000 young people at this year's event, the Oyo-based Agidigbo FM radio station reported on Tuesday, citing the organizers who had featured on its program. Children 'will win exciting prizes like scholarships and other bountiful gifts,' they said. An investigation has been opened into the causes of the stampede, Makinde said, adding 'anyone directly or remotely involved in this disaster will be held accountable.'	https://apnews.com/article/nigeria-stampede-children-school-65ca20abe5f96771b97df60e3a1e11bc	2024-12-18T07:07:04-08:00	
Mauritius wants to rethink a deal with the UK over remote islands housing a key US base	LONDON (AP) — The British government said Wednesday it still plans to hand over a contested Indian Ocean archipelago, which is home to a strategically important military base, to Mauritius, after that country’s new leader backed away from the contentious deal. The U.K. and Mauritius announced an agreement in October to transfer sovereignty of the Chagos Islands, a chain of more than 60 islands just south of the equator off the tip of India. Under the deal, the U.K.-U.S. naval and bomber base on the largest of the islands, Diego Garcia, would remain under U.K. control for at least 99 years. When it made the announcement, Britain’s Labour Party government said it was finalizing details of a treaty with the Mauritian government. Since then, voters in Mauritius ousted the government that made the deal, replacing it with one led by Prime Minister Navin Ramgoolam. Ramgoolam said he was reopening negotiations because the draft deal 'would not produce the benefits that the nation could expect from such an agreement.' He told lawmakers in Mauritius’ parliament on Tuesday that his government 'is still willing to conclude an agreement with the United Kingdom' and had submitted counterproposals. Britain's Foreign Office Minister Stephen Doughty said he was confident the deal would be finalized, and it was 'completely understandable that the new Mauritian government will want time to study the details.' 'I am confident that we have agreed a good and fair deal that is in both sides’ interests,' he told lawmakers in the House of Commons. 'It protects the base at proportionate cost. It has been supported across the national security architecture in the United States and by India.' The U.K.’s opposition Conservatives have accused the government of surrendering sovereignty over a British territory. The deal was hailed by U.S. President Joe Biden as a 'historic agreement' that secured the future of the Diego Garcia base. But supporters of U.S. President Donald Trump have slammed it. British lawmaker Nigel Farage, a Trump ally, said 'there is very deep disquiet' among incoming Trump administration officials 'as to what this may mean for the long-term future of Diego Garcia.' One of the last remnants of the British Empire, the Chagos Islands have been under British control since 1814. Britain evicted as many as 2,000 people from the islands in the 1960s and 1970s so the U.S. military could build the Diego Garcia base, which has supported U.S. military operations from Vietnam to Iraq and Afghanistan. In 2008, the U.S. acknowledged it also had been used for clandestine rendition flights of terror suspects. The U.S. has described the base, which is home to about 2,500 mostly American personnel, as 'an all but indispensable platform' for security operations in the Middle East, South Asia and East Africa. The displaced Chagossians fought unsuccessfully in U.K. courts for years for the right to go home. Under the deal, they and their descendants could be allowed to return to the islands, apart from Diego Garcia. Mauritius, which lies east of Madagascar in southern Africa, is around 2,100 kilometers (1,250 miles) southwest of the Chagos Islands.	https://apnews.com/article/uk-chagos-islands-mauritius-trump-a5af31a28e76fc622be48fbde7e10f3d	2024-12-18T06:46:47-08:00	
What Assad's fall has revealed about Syria's trade in the stimulant drug Captagon	BEIRUT (AP) — Since the fall of former Syrian President Bashar Assad, industrial-scale manufacturing facilities of the amphetamine-like stimulant Captagon have been uncovered around the country, which experts say fed a $10 billion annual global trade in the highly addictive drug. Among the locations used for manufacturing the drug were the Mazzeh air base in Damascus, a car-trading company in Latakia and a factory that once made snack chips in the Damascus suburb of Douma. Government forces seized the factory in 2018. 'Assad’s collaborators controlled this place. After the regime fell ... I came here and found it on fire,' Firas al-Toot, the original owner of the factory, told The Associated Press. 'They came at night and lit the drugs on fire but couldn’t burn everything.' 'From here, Captagon pills emerged to kill our people,' Abu Zihab, an activist with Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the main group now ruling the country, said while his group gave journalists access to the site. Syria's nearly 14-year-old civil war fragmented the country, crumbled the economy and created fertile ground for the production of the drug. Militias, warlords and the Assad government transformed the production of Captagon from a small-scale operation run by criminal groups into a billion-dollar industrial revenue stream. The recent ousting of Assad has disrupted these networks and has given a closer look at its operations — revealing the workings of a war economy that sustained Assad’s power over Syria. Experts say the change in Syria might create an opportunity to dismantle the Captagon industry. How did Syria build its Captagon empire? Captagon was first developed in Germany in the 1960s as a prescription stimulant for conditions like narcolepsy. It was later outlawed due to heart issues and its addictive properties. Its amphetamine-like effects made it popular in the Middle East among both elites and fighters, as it enhanced focus and reduced fatigue. Assad's government recognized an opportunity in the cheaply manufactured drug amid Syria’s economic turmoil and the heavy sanctions imposed on it. Captagon is produced through a simple chemical process that involves mixing amphetamine derivatives with excipients to form tablets, typically in makeshift labs. The Captagon trade began industrializing around 2018-2019 as the Assad regime — and other armed groups in Syria -- invested in production facilities, warehouses and trafficking networks. This allowed Syria to emerge as the largest producer of Captagon globally, with some production also occurring in Lebanon. Most seized consignments of Captagon originated from Syria, according to data by the New Lines Captagon Trade Project, an initiative of the New Lines Institute think tank. Evidence of the Assad regime’s sponsorship of the Captagon industry is overwhelming, the report published in May said. The Security Office of the 4th Armored Division of the Syrian Arab Army, headed by Bashar al-Assad’s brother Maher oversaw operations and created a coordinated production system, the report added. Where and how was Captagon smuggled? Captagon was smuggled across borders in trucks and cargo shipments. Sometimes the drugs were concealed in food, electronics and construction materials to evade detection. The primary smuggling routes were Syria’s porous borders with Lebanon, Jordan and Iraq, from which the drug was distributed throughout the region. The leading markets are wealthy Gulf countries like Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. In Lebanon, the Captagon trade has flourished, particularly near the Syrian border and in the Bekaa Valley. Lebanese authorities struggled to curb the flow of Captagon from Syria, which analysts say was facilitated by the Hezbollah militant group. Following the discovery of crates of fruit meticulously packed with bundles of the drug hidden among pomegranates and oranges, Saudi Arabia and the UAE implemented bans on Lebanese agricultural products. Captagon has also found its way as far as Southeast Asia and parts of Europe. How much revenue did it produce for the Assad regime? The annual global trade in Captagon had an estimated value of $10 billion, with the ousted Assad family's annual profit reaching around $2.4 billion, according to Caroline Rose, director of the New York-based New Lines Institute Captagon Trade Project. 'Seeing the uncovering of so many industrial-scale facilities affiliated with the regime was shocking but not surprising. There was extensive evidence linking key regime-aligned cronies and Assad family members to the trade,' said Rose, whose organization tracks all publicly recorded Captagon seizures and lab raids. The discovery of the facilities, she said, confirmed 'the concrete relationship between Captagon and the former regime.' The exact number of factories in Syria remains unclear, but experts and HTS members estimate that there are likely hundreds spread throughout the country. Captagon as a narco-diplomatic tool While neighboring countries have long sought to curb drug trafficking, their influence over Assad was limited. Saudi Arabia imposed strict penalties for Captagon trafficking and enhanced border security, collaborating with other Gulf states to monitor smuggling routes. However, these efforts faced challenges from the complex networks operating across Syria, Lebanon and Jordan. Captagon provided Assad's government with leverage to end his political isolation. In recent years, as several Arab states reestablished ties with him, stopping the Captagon trade was a key demand in talks aimed at normalizing relations. In May 2023, Syria was readmitted to the Arab League, where it had been suspended since 2011 due to Assad’s brutal crackdown on protesters. Syria pledged to clamp down on smuggling, leading to the formation of a regional security coordination committee. Shortly after the summit and in a possible sign of behind-the-scenes trade-offs, Jordan intensified surveillance along the Syrian border. Activists and experts attributed airstrikes on a known drug kingpin’s home and on a suspected Captagon factory near Daraa to Jordan, likely with Assad’s consent. The future of Captagon in post-Assad Syria Assad has turned Syria into 'the largest Captagon factory in the world,' HTS leader Ahmad al-Sharaa stated in a victory speech at Damascus’s Umayyad Mosque on Dec. 8. 'Today, Syria is being cleansed, thanks to the grace of Almighty God.' While Assad and his circle may have been the primary beneficiaries, there is also evidence that Syrian opposition groups were involved in drug smuggling. Rebel groups, local militias and organized crime networks manufactured and smuggled the drug to finance their operations, analysts say. 'Likely, we will see a short-term supply reduction in the trade, with a decline in the size and frequency of seizures as industrial-scale production is largely halted. However, criminal actors are innovative, likely seeking out new locations to engage in production and smuggling, particularly as demand levels remain stable,' Rose said. They may also 'seek out alternative illicit trades to engage in instead,' she said. In addition to dismantling the Captagon trade, the country's transitional government should 'establish programs for economic development that will incentivize Syrians to participate in the country’s formal, licit economic sphere,' Rose said.	https://apnews.com/article/syria-captagon-bashar-assad-97c57e94b9cbc1bdc91926b7e85dc981	2024-12-18T06:17:14-08:00	
Nigerians press for solar jobs and electricity, with little success	BAKU, Azerbaijan (AP) — In sun-drenched Nigeria, 14 new solar farms were supposed to jumpstart a meager solar industry and generate huge amounts of power, about one-fifth as much as the country’s entire electric grid offers on a good day. 'We were very excited because we were pioneers,' said Najim Animashaun, managing director of Nova Solar Power, who was working on one of the projects in 2016. But that ambition collapsed when Nigeria's government wouldn't provide critical guarantees to developers. It's not that demand is low for clean power — the smallest solar systems for homes have exploded in popularity and created jobs — but big developers haven't been able to overcome Nigeria's reputation as a risky place to do business. It's a problem across sub-Saharan Africa, where 83% of the people in the world who lack electricity live. Despite tremendous solar potential, very little of it has been installed. 'Many of your countries face sky-high borrowing costs, runaway debt, and inadequate climate finance and investment,' said António Guterres, the United Nations secretary-general, at a panel on Africa’s green transition at this year's global climate negotiations in Baku, Azerbaijan. The result, he said, is: 'your clean energy revolution held back.' Nigeria may be the problem's epicenter. More Nigerians live without electricity than citizens of any other country. Their numbers have even grown compared to a decade ago: Africa’s most populous country, with more than 220 million people, grew faster than its power sector expanded. Even those connected to the grid live with frequent outages. Millions are forced to rely on wood for cooking and noxious, noisy diesel generators for sporadic electricity. At the climate talks in Baku, at least $300 billion annually was pledged to help developing countries like Nigeria transition away from fossil fuels and cope with a warmer world and its more extreme weather. It was blasted by many developing nations as far too little. Having enough funds will be vital for Nigeria, which is facing an enormously challenging energy transition. It is an oil state, a major petroleum exporter that runs its government largely on oil revenue. It burns natural gas for most of its electricity. It is trying to simultaneously expand its economy to pull tens of millions of people out of poverty and transition to net-zero by 2060. To do so, there will need to be a flood of new renewable projects like solar and hydropower. Animashaun of Nova Solar Power said in the years before the 14 solar projects were announced, Nigeria opened its electric sector to attract more private investment and made it easier for new producers to sell power. There was strong investor backing, too. He was optimistic. 'There was a proliferation of projects and that proliferation of projects created competition among ourselves,' he said. Everybody wanted to be first to finish. But Nigeria has high interest rates and is considered a financially problematic place to do business and the deal never closed. As the solar industry matured and prices dropped, the government tried to get out of an agreement to pay what it viewed as too high a price for solar power. Developers couldn't get the guarantees they wanted from officials and international development banks. Animashaun said he knew the deal was in serious jeopardy when the government proposed a deal in local currency instead of dollars. 'The currency has lost 90% of its value since I started this project,' he said. 'So, Nigeria isn’t really bankable.' A wholly inadequate grid leads to demand for any electricity at all With the Nigerian grid providing only a fraction of the electricity that people need, some employ a solar solution that provides at least some power. Micro-solar systems that power only lights and perhaps charge a cell phone tripled from 2016 to 2023, according to GOGLA, an off-grid energy industry association. Sales of small rooftop systems that can run some appliances increased even more, although sales did fall off some when a subsidy program ended this year. Sun King is a major seller of these small devices that can replace dirty and expensive kerosene lamps or diesel generators. The micro-solar industry also requires a big workforce at a time when Nigeria's young population needs jobs. Olamide Ayo-Ogunlade is the human resources lead for West and Central Africa at Sun King. When she started four years ago, the company had 19 stores in the country, now it has 90. More than 8,000 salespeople or 'energy officers' in Nigeria sell the products, install them in homes, service them and collect customer debts. 'Most of the time we find that energy officers start off as customers,' she said. 'They buy the product themselves, see how fantastic it is, then they are exposed to the opportunity to be an entrepreneur in the energy space.' They’ll knock on doors and show up at markets, churches and mosques in new areas to make sales. Energy officers are trained, in person and online, on the company and its products and they work with mentors. That attention to training matters. Across the region, some question solar's reliability, according to Siré Diallo, an energy and climate finance expert with the United Nations Development Programme. 'Many of the installations that are being done, the consumers were not satisfied because either it was poor installation, or the equipment itself was of low quality,' he said. It has gotten better in recent years, he said, but training programs need to grow. There’s certainly demand for jobs, said Akin Olukiran, CEO of ABG-CAPS Clean Energy Generation, which installs solar systems for businesses. 'I get on average about 10, maybe 20 applications per day, unsolicited,' he said, adding many applicants have tremendous potential and he tries to help them find opportunities, but 'the jobs are not there.' Alberto Rodríguez Gómez, manager in the Africa energy program at the nonprofit Rocky Mountain Institute, says a planned changeover at the the largest market in Nigeria's capital city illustrates one solution that produces reliable electricity, improvements in air quality, plus employment. Solar panels paired with batteries will keep the market running on its own minigrid even during common blackouts. Up until now, sellers laboring in cramped stalls have no alternative but to turn on diesel generators during frequent outages. 'I struggle because the air is thick, the air is nasty, it is also very noisy so it is also really hard to just maintain a conversation,' Gomez said of the market when the generators run. A future with solar at the market 'is like going from hell to heaven.' A new $750 million program was approved by the World Bank last year to improve electricity access to 17.5 million Nigerians by supporting projects like microgrids or small home solar systems. Much more is needed. Animashaun believes that Nigeria is approaching a 'come to Jesus moment' on energy — there's pressure on the government to deliver at a time when living costs are rising. 'If you want to avoid social unrest, you have to do something,' he said. ___ The Associated Press receives support from the Walton Family Foundation for coverage of water and environmental policy.

China has expanded its nuclear force and strengthened ties to Russia, the Pentagon says	WASHINGTON (AP) — China is expanding its nuclear force, has increased military pressure against Taiwan and has strengthened its ties with Russia over the past year, according to a Pentagon report Wednesday that details actions accelerating key areas of conflict with the United States. The report, however, also notes that the recent rash of corruption allegations within China's powerful Central Military Commission, which oversees the People’s Liberation Army, is hurting Beijing’s military growth and could slow its campaign to modernize. The impact, said a senior defense official, is a bit of a mixed bag because while there has been progress in some programs, China has slid back in others. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to describe the U.S. assessment, warned that Beijing is working toward developing a more diverse and technologically sophisticated nuclear force. While the expected number of nuclear warheads has maintained consistent growth, China is broadening its targeting abilities. Beijing is going to be able to go after more and different types of targets, do greater damage and have more options for multiple rounds of counterstrikes, the official said. The U.S. is urging China to be more transparent about its nuclear program, while also warning that America will defend its allies and take appropriate steps in response. According to the report, which provides the annual U.S. assessment of China’s military power and is required by Congress, China had more than 600 operational nuclear warheads as of May, and the U.S. expects it will have more than 1,000 by 2030. The Chinese Embassy, in response, said China has always 'firmly adhered to a nuclear strategy of self-defense,' follows the no-first-use nuclear policy and maintains its nuclear capabilities at the minimum level required for national security. Liu Pengyu, the embassy spokesman, said such annual reports by the Pentagon are 'filled with ‘Cold-War' thinking and zero-sum game mentality, which China firmly opposes.' The Biden administration has worked to maintain a balance with China, building up the U.S. military presence in the Asia-Pacific region to be ready to counter Beijing while also encouraging increased communications between the two countries at the diplomatic and military levels. That uptick in talks has coincided with a decrease in coercive and risky intercepts of U.S. aircraft since late 2023, compared with the previous two years. China still, however, does what the U.S. military considers 'unsafe' flights near American and allied forces in the region. The Pentagon’s national defense strategy is built around China being the greatest security challenge for the U.S., and the threat from Beijing influences how the U.S. military is equipped and organized for the future. The corruption within the PLA has resulted in at least 15 high-ranking officials being ousted in a major shakeup of China’s defense establishment. 'This wave of corruption touches every service in the PLA, and it may have shaken Beijing’s confidence,' the report said. In June, China announced that former Defense Minister Li Shangfu and his predecessor, Wei Fenghe, were expelled from the ruling Communist Party and accused of corruption. Last month, another senior official, Miao Hua, was suspended and put under investigation, according to China's Defense Ministry. The U.S. report points to a persistent increased military presence by China around Taiwan, the self-governing island that China claims as its own. It said China's navy has been in the region more and that there have been increased crossings into the island's air defense identification zone and major military exercises in the area. Just last week, a large deployment of Chinese navy and coast guard vessels in the waters around Taiwan triggered alarm as Taiwanese officials said it looked like China was simulating a blockade. Officials have said there were as many as 90 ships involved in what Taiwan described as two walls designed to demonstrate that the waters belong to China. Taiwan split from communist China in 1949 and has rejected Beijing’s demands that it accept unification. China says it will do so by force if necessary, and leaders have said they want to be ready to do so by 2027. Beijing also has demanded that Washington not interfere with the Taiwan issue, citing that it is an internal matter. The United States is obligated under domestic law to help defend Taiwan and give it weapons and technology to deter invasion. The island democracy has been the chief source of tension between Washington and Beijing for decades and is widely seen as the most likely trigger for a potentially catastrophic U.S.-China war. More broadly, the report concluded that the PLA continued its drive to develop greater military capabilities but 'made uneven progress toward its 2027' milestone for modernization. One area of expansion, the report said, is with unmanned aerial systems, which officials said are 'quickly approaching U.S. standards.' Regarding Russia, the report said China has supported Russia's war against Ukraine and sold Russia dual-use items that Moscow's military industry relies on. Dual use items can be used for both civilian and military purposes.	https://apnews.com/article/china-military-taiwan-corruption-defense-9c1f0e145a250f2b8bd7f6f3dd4b7083	2024-12-18T06:00:54-08:00	
Teen charged in UK dance class stabbings pleads not guilty to murder	LONDON (AP) — A teen charged with killing three girls and wounding 10 other people in a stabbing rampage at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class in England this summer remained silent in court Wednesday as not guilty pleas were entered on his behalf. Axel Rudakubana, 18, who has refused to speak in each court appearance, was read the charges of three counts of murder, 10 counts of attempted murder and additional charges related to possessing the poison ricin and for having an al-Qaida manual. Justice Julian Goose ordered a clerk to enter the pleas in Liverpool Crown Court as Rudakubana stayed mum during a video appearance from a London prison where he is held. His trial is scheduled for Jan. 20. It was the first time in a court appearance that the teen did not pull his sweatshirt collar over his nose to obscure his face. He appeared to smile as an officer confirmed that the court proceeding could be heard at the prison. The judge noted that Rudakubana was not responding. He swayed from side to side as the charges were read and bent forward at one point. Rudakubana was charged in August with murdering three girls — Alice Dasilva Aguiar, 9, Elsie Dot Stancombe, 7, and Bebe King, 6 — and stabbing 10 other people on July 29 in the seaside town of Southport in northern England. The attack at a small dance and yoga studio on the first day of summer vacation sparked rioting across England and Northern Ireland fueled by far-right activists that lasted a week. The violence, which injured more than 300 police officers and led to fiery attacks on hotels housing migrants, began after Rudakubana — then unnamed –- was falsely identified as an asylum seeker who had recently arrived in Britain by boat. Rudakubana was born in Wales to Rwandan immigrants. More than 1,200 people were arrested for the disorder that lasted a week and hundreds have been jailed for up to nine years in prison. A report released Wednesday was critical of police for failing to recognize the threat of violent disorder after a number of smaller incidents across the U.K. in the previous two years. The report from the Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire and Rescue Services said there were also lapses in gathering intelligence from social media and the dark web. Rudakubana was charged in October with additional counts for production of a biological toxin, ricin, and possession of information likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing to commit an act of terrorism for having the manual in a document on his computer. Police have said the stabbings have not been classified as acts of terrorism because the motive is not yet known.	https://apnews.com/article/england-stabbing-attack-dance-class-terror-charge-ricin-d0a2bba2b24b2a17d6534d5367258c12	2024-12-18T05:31:59-08:00	
What's known about the brazen bombing that killed a top Russian general in Moscow	The killing of a senior Russian general in a bombing outside his apartment building in Moscow was the boldest assassination yet of a top military officer and again brought the war in Ukraine to the streets of the capital. Some things to know about the attack and who is suspected of being behind it: What happened? Lt. Gen. Igor Kirillov was killed Tuesday morning by a bomb hidden on an electric scooter parked near the entrance of his apartment block in southeastern Moscow as he left for his office. Kirillov’s assistant also died in the attack. The bomb was triggered remotely, according to Russia’s Federal Security Service, or FSB. The explosion was caught on video from a camera mounted inside a car, showing the men walking out of the building and the fiery blast. Who were the victims? Kirillov, 54, was the chief of Russia's Radiation, Biological and Chemical Protection Forces. These special troops are tasked with protecting the military from the enemy’s use of nuclear, chemical or biological weapons and ensuring operations in a contaminated environment. He was under sanctions from several countries, including the U.K. and Canada, for his actions in Moscow’s war in Ukraine. On Monday, Ukraine’s Security Service, or SBU, opened a criminal investigation against him, accusing Kirillov of directing the use of banned chemical weapons. Russia has denied using any chemical weapons in Ukraine and has accused Kyiv of using them. Kirillov, who took his post in 2017, was one of the highest profile figures to level those accusations. He held numerous briefings to accuse the Ukrainian military of using toxic agents and planning to launch attacks with radioactive substances — claims Kyiv and its Western allies rejected as propaganda. His assistant, Ilya Polikarpov, was also killed in the attack. Who has claimed responsibility? An SBU official said Tuesday that the agency was behind the attack. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to release the information, described Kirillov as a 'war criminal and an entirely legitimate target.' The SBU official provided the video of the bombing. Who has been detained? The FSB said Wednesday it detained a suspect, described as a citizen of the Central Asian nation of Uzbekistan who was born in 1995. The Tass and RIA-Novosti news agencies identified him as Akhmad Kurbanov. According to the FSB, the suspect said he was recruited by Ukrainian special services. The Associated Press could not confirm the conditions under which the suspect made the statement to the security services. The FSB said the suspect said he had been promised $100,000 and resettlement to a European Union country in exchange for killing Kirillov. The agency said that acting on instructions from Ukraine, the suspect traveled to Moscow, where he obtained a homemade bomb, placed it on an e-scooter and parked it at the entrance to Kirillov's apartment building. The suspect rented a car to monitor the location and set up a camera that livestreamed the scene to his handlers in the Ukrainian city of Dnipro, detonating the bomb when Kirillov left the building, the FSB said. The suspect faces a sentence of up to life imprisonment, the FSB said. Russian media reports said the FSB tracked the suspect by studying video from surveillance cameras and cellphone calls. What's still not known? The FSB has not said how the suspect was recruited. He was detained in a village in the Moscow region, Interior Ministry official Irina Volk told Tass. It is not known where he is being held or when he will appear in court. That is expected in the coming days, to hear the terms of his pre-trial detention. Under Russian law, a person may only be remanded in custody for 48 hours before a court order is made. What has Russia said about the attack? Russian officials have described the bombing as a 'terrorist act.' The Kremlin said Wednesday it was 'obvious' that Ukraine was behind Kirillov’s killing, with spokesman Dmitry Peskov saying Kyiv 'does not shy away from terrorist methods.' While President Vladimir Putin has not publicly spoken about the attack, Peskov said he expressed his condolences on Kirillov's death. Dmitry Medvedev, deputy head of Russia’s Security Council, described the attack as an attempt by Kyiv to distract public attention from its military failures and vowed that its 'senior military-political leadership will face inevitable retribution.' Vyacheslav Volodin, speaker of the lower house of parliament, called Kirillov 'a professional military man, an intellectual, a Russian patriot.' He 'did a lot to increase the effectiveness of the radiation, chemical and biological defense forces, to ensure the security and sovereignty of our country,' Volodin said. —- Illia Novikov in Kyiv, Ukraine, contributed.	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-general-bomb-suspect-arrested-817ba9cd738fb09e673c261f21a4c1ff	2024-12-18T05:21:43-08:00	
Families scramble to help after deadly cyclone rips through French territory of Mayotte off Africa	MAMOUDZOU, Mayotte (AP) — Relatives of families struggling after Cyclone Chido ripped through the French island territory of Mayotte expressed helplessness Wednesday, a day before France’s president and another 180 tons of aid were expected to arrive. Some survivors and aid groups have described hasty burials, the stench of bodies and the devastation of precarious informal settlements whose population of migrants makes it even more challenging to determine the number of dead. 'A catastrophe of exceptional intensity,' French authorities said in an update Wednesday. 'The island is devastated.' It noted 31 confirmed deaths but said the Muslim practice of burial within 24 hours could mean the real toll is quite different. Mayotte, in the Indian Ocean off Africa’s east coast, is France’s poorest territory and a magnet for migrants hoping to reach Europe. Already, France's interior minister this week has proposed cracking down. The cyclone on Saturday was the deadliest storm to strike the territory in nearly a century. It devastated entire neighborhoods on the collection of islands with winds that exceeded 220 kph (136 mph), according to the French weather service. Many people had ignored cyclone warnings, thinking the storm would not be so extreme. Now residents pick their way across a landscape in search of food as telecommunications remain tenuous and even sturdily built structures including health centers have been damaged. Driving the streets of Mayotte, AP reporters saw destroyed houses, felled trees and people lining up for water. Dozens of French military personnel set up a makeshift camp at the airport. French Prime Minister François Bayrou on Tuesday said more than 1,500 people were injured, including more than 200 critically, but authorities fear hundreds and possibly thousands of people have died. Authorities said about 100,000 lived in a 'precarious situation.' On the French island of Reunion about a three-hour flight away, loved ones were coming together to donate aid for survivors. Some said their families in Mayotte had no food or water and roofs were blown off houses. It had taken days to make contact with some. 'It is difficult because I feel helpless,' said Khayra Djoumoi Thany, 19. Anrafa Parassouramin also has family in Mayotte. 'We are also afraid of disease outbreaks, because people are drinking water from wherever they can get it, and it’s not necessarily potable water,' she said. Health Minister Geneviève Darrieussecq has raised concerns about the risk of a cholera epidemic on the archipelago which earlier this year had an outbreak of a highly drug-resistant strain of the disease. French authorities said the distribution of 23 tons of water began Wednesday. The French minister for overseas matters, François-Noël Buffet, told French radio Europe 1 that aid brought by plane has started being allocated to locations across Mayotte. The minister said the water supply system was 'working at 50%' and presented a risk of 'poor quality.' Electricity had partially resumed. Mayotte’s hospital was badly damaged. A field hospital should be operational by early next week, Buffet said. A Navy ship was due to arrive in Mayotte on Thursday with 180 tons of aid and equipment, according to the French military. But the main airport could not accept commercial flights because of damage. The road network was also widely damaged. French President Emmanuel Macron will travel to Mayotte on Thursday and visit a hospital and a destroyed neighborhood, his office said. 'Our compatriots are living through the worst just a few thousand kilometers away,' Macron said in a statement. Some residents of Mayotte have long criticized the French government of neglect. On Tuesday evening, a program on public broadcaster France 2 raised 5 million euros ($5.24 million) in aid for Mayotte through the Foundation of France charity, the channel said. ___ Corbet reported from Paris.	https://apnews.com/article/mayotte-france-cyclone-chido-aid-e073dfc2eda629af0a297e74f2f333fa	2024-12-18T05:03:03-08:00	
France’s highest court upholds corruption conviction of former President Nicolas Sarkozy	PARIS (AP) — France’s highest court has upheld an appeal court decision which had found former President Nicolas Sarkozy guilty of corruption and influence peddling while he was the country's head of state. Sarkozy, 69, faces a year in prison, but is expected to ask to be detained at home with an electronic bracelet — as is the case for any sentence of two years or less. He was found guilty of corruption and influence peddling by both a Paris court in 2021 and an appeals court in 2023 for trying to bribe a magistrate in exchange for information about a legal case in which he was implicated. 'The convictions and sentences are therefore final,' a Court of Cassation statement on Wednesday said. Sarkozy, who was France’s president from 2007 to 2012, retired from public life in 2017 though still plays an influential role in French conservative politics. He was among the guests who attended the reopening of Notre Dame Cathedral earlier this month. Sarkozy, in a statement posted on X, said 'I will assume my responsibilities and face all the consequences.' He added: 'I have no intention of complaining. But I am not prepared to accept the profound injustice done to me.' Sarkozy said he will seek to bring the case to the European Court of Human Rights, and hopes those proceedings will result in 'France being condemned.' He reiterated his 'full innocence.' 'My determination is total in this case as in all others,' he concluded. Sarkozy’s lawyer, Patrice Spinosi, said his client 'will comply' with the ruling. This means the former president will have to wear an electronic bracelet, Spinosi said. It is the first time in France’s modern history that a former president has been convicted and sentenced to a prison term for actions during his term. Sarkozy’s predecessor, Jacques Chirac, was found guilty in 2011 of misuse of public money during his time as Paris mayor and was given a two-year suspended prison sentence. Sarkozy has been involved in several other legal cases. He has denied any wrongdoing. He faces another trial next month in Paris over accusations he took millions of dollars from then-Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi to illegally finance his successful 2007 campaign. The corruption case that led to Wednesday's ruling focused on phone conversations that took place in February 2014. At the time, investigative judges had launched an inquiry into the financing of Sarkozy’s 2007 presidential campaign. During the inquiry, they discovered that Sarkozy and his lawyer, Thierry Herzog, were communicating via secret mobile phones registered to the alias 'Paul Bismuth.' Wiretapped conversations on those phones led prosecutors to suspect Sarkozy and Herzog of promising magistrate Gilbert Azibert a job in Monaco in exchange for leaking information about another legal case involving Sarkozy. Azibert never got the post and legal proceedings against Sarkozy have been dropped in the case he was seeking information about. Prosecutors had concluded, however, that the proposal still constitutes corruption under French law, even if the promise wasn’t fulfilled. Sarkozy vigorously denied any malicious intention in his offer to help Azibert. Azibert and Herzog have also been found guilty in the case.	https://apnews.com/article/france-court-ruling-sarkozy-corruption-715483927ad6dfc7799ca8a9f28303cf	2024-12-18T04:32:04-08:00	
China's CATL is planning a major expansion of battery swapping for electric vehicles	XIAMEN, China (AP) — The world's largest maker of batteries for electric vehicles said Wednesday it will get into battery swapping in China in a big way starting next year. The idea behind battery swapping is to refuel quickly, similar to filling a conventional car with gas. Instead of waiting for the batteries to recharge, one swaps out the old ones with a block of fresh ones at a swap station. An EV driver pulls into a swapping station, and automated technology exchanges the low battery for a fully-charged one the station has available. China-based CATL announced plans to open 1,000 swap stations next year in China, including in Hong Kong and Macao, with a long-term goal of 10,000 stations built with partners. If the company follows through, it could rival Nio, a 10-year-old Chinese electric car brand that has opened more than 2,700 stations and has plans for at least 5,000. Nothing on that scale exists elsewhere in the world, though Nio has about 60 swap stations in northern Europe. Such a large investment is possible in China, where government support has transformed the world's largest auto market into a heavily electric one and made the country a leader in EV technology. 'By 2030, battery swapping, home charging, and public charging stations will share the market,' Robin Zeng, the CEO of CATL, predicted at a splashy presentation in southeast China's Fujian province, where CATL is based. He appealed to corporate partners to work together to 'build more convenient, more economical and safer services for customers, promoting a brand-new way of life.' Battery swapping faces hurdles. It requires a standardization of the battery pack so the swap stations can handle it, and most EVs have their own configuration. An electric vehicle has to be equipped with the right technology in order to use a battery swapping station, and not many EV models around the world currently allow for swapping. Conversely, an electric car can use any charging station in China because all use a common plug, and fast-charging technology is reducing the time for a recharge. Jing Yang, a Fitch Ratings director who focuses on China’s auto and renewable energy sectors, said automakers may be concerned that adopting a standard battery pack could cede too much control of their supply chain to others. Electric car manufacturers have many changing specifications to stay on top of and invest in as the EV market evolves, making new technology a hard sell. It is difficult to get automakers to buy into less feasible infrastructure if EV adoption in a region is still relatively low. But some may want to test the waters to see if battery swapping can improve sales, and doing so with CATL or Nio could reduce the cost, she said. That's because a driver wouldn't have to own the battery, which is currently the most expensive part of an EV. China auto market analyst Lei Xing believes that swapping can complement the country's well-developed charging network. 'I don’t see it becoming mainstream, but I do see it becoming a key part of that infrastructure landscape,' he said. Michael Davidson, a renewable energy expert at the University of California, San Diego, believes that charging will dominate 'and maybe there’ll be some battery swapping options mixed in there.' The concept has proven easier to implement with fleet vehicles — taxis, buses and commercial trucks — that have a standard model and, in some cases, stick to set routes. CATL, which launched a small pilot project two years ago aimed at taxis, will start its rollout with fleets and expand to individual car owners later, said Zhang Kai, the deputy president of CATL's battery swapping subsidiary. Swapping is still faster than fast-charging. The CATL station, branded EVOGO, can change a battery pack in 100 seconds, said Yang Jun, the CEO of the subsidiary. Time is money for taxi and truck drivers, Lei said. Wang Wubing, a driver at China’s popular Didi ride-hailing service, said at an EVOGO station in the city of Xiamen that he swaps batteries to save time so he can pick up more customers. But it is more expensive than charging. In the U.S., battery swapping made headlines nearly two decades ago with the startup Better Place, which later shut down. Now, companies such as Ample have reinvented the technology, also starting with the ride-hailing market. Uber and Lyft drivers that own electric cars want to spend time on the road and earning money instead of waiting even for the fastest EV charge. Ample says its swaps take just 5 minutes. Both CATL and Nio have announced agreements with automakers to use their swap stations. The question is whether enough automakers and drivers adopt it to raise use of the stations to a profitable level. ___ Moritsugu reported from Beijing.

Middle East latest: Israel orders another Gaza evacuation ahead of an offensive	The Israeli military on Wednesday ordered Palestinians to evacuate another section of central Gaza ahead of an offensive in the built-up Bureij refugee camp, even as Israel and the Hamas appeared to inch closer to a ceasefire in the 14-month war. Israeli President Isaac Herzog said he will meet Wednesday with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's Mideast envoy, Adam Boehler, at home in Jerusalem. Boehler, a former aid to Jared Kushner, met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu earlier this week. As deadly Israeli strikes pound Gaza each day, talks to broker the ceasefire and hostage release deal have restarted after a monthslong pause. The deal on the table includes a six-week pause in fighting in which Hamas would release 30 hostages, including three of four dual Israeli-U.S. citizens. In exchange, Israel would release hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. Trump has said he wants a quick end to the war. Israeli bombardment and offensives in Gaza have killed more than 45,000 Palestinians during the war, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. The ministry’s tally does not distinguish between combatants and civilians, but it says more than of half the dead were women and children. Israel launched the war in retaliation for Hamas’ October 2023 attack on southern Israel in which militants killed some 1,200 people and abducted 250 others, around 100 of whom remain in captivity. Israel believes a third of the remaining hostages are dead. ___ Here’s the latest: Syrians recover human remains from site used by Hezbollah and other Assad allies DAMASCUS — The Syrian Civil Defense group, known as the White Helmets, uncovered at least 21 corpses as well as incomplete human remains on Wednesday in the Sayyida Zeinab suburb of the capital Damascus. The discovery was made at a site previously used by Lebanon’s Hezbollah and Iran-backed Iraqi militias, both allies of deposed President Bashar Assad during the country’s civil war. The site included a field kitchen, a drugstore and a morgue, according to Ammar al-Salmo, an official with the White Helmets, a volunteer organization that operated in areas that were controlled by the opposition. Rescue teams in white hazmat suits searched the site, located not far from the revered shrine of Sayyida Zeinab, the granddaughter of Prophet Mohammad. The remains were placed into black bags and loaded onto a truck as bystanders from the neighborhood looked on. 'Some (of the remains) are skeletons, others are incomplete, and there are bags of small bones. We cannot yet determine the number of victims,' al-Salmo said. 'Damascus has become a mass grave,' he said, pointing out the growing reports of war-related graves and burial sites in the capital and other places in Syria. Iran and Hezbollah provided Assad’s government with military, financial and logistical support during the civil war. Israeli settlers briefly crossed into Lebanon, the military says JERUSALEM — A group of Israeli settlers have briefly crossed the border into Lebanon before they were removed by troops, the military acknowledged Wednesday. The civilians who crossed the border came from the Uri Tzafon movement, a group calling for Israeli settlement of southern Lebanon. Photos posted by the group online Saturday showed a small group of activists holding signs and erecting tents inside Lebanon while Israeli soldiers were present. After first denying the reports to Israeli media, the military said Wednesday that civilians had crossed the border 'by a few meters' and were removed by troops. The military called the border breach a 'serious incident' and said it was investigating. 'Any attempt to approach or cross the border into Lebanese territory without coordination poses a life-threatening risk and interferes with the IDF’s ability to operate in the area and carry out its mission,' the military said, using the acronym for the Israel Defense Forces. The settler group Uri Tzafon, which means 'Awaken the North' in Hebrew, crossed the border in the area of the Lebanese village of Maroun Al-Ras. In the past, the movement has said the area is home to an old Hebrew settlement. Groups of settler activists also have breached the Gaza border more than once since the Israel-Hamas war erupted on Oct. 7, 2023, at one point erecting small wooden tents before they were evacuated by troops. Daniela Weiss, the leader of the movement to resettle Gaza, claims she has entered Gaza twice since the start of the war. Israel’s settler movement has been emboldened by its current government -- the furthest-right in Israeli history -- and is now seeking to expand to parts of southern Lebanon and the north of the Gaza. UN envoy says Syria needs a credible and inclusive transition DAMASCUS, Syria — The U.N. envoy to Syria said after concluding a visit to Damascus and meeting the new administration that the country needs 'a political transition that will be credible, inclusive and include the broadest range of the Syrian society and Syrian parties.' Geir Pedersen said Wednesday that the process should take place under a U.N. resolution adopted in 2015 to help negotiate a political solution between the government of now-deposed President Bashar Assad and the opposition. 'There is a lot of hope. We can all see the beginning of a new Syria ... that in line with Security Council Resolution 2254 will adopt a new constitution that will ensure that there is a new social contract for all Syrians and that we will have free and fair elections when that time comes after a transitional period, also in line with Security Council Resolution 2254,' Pedersen said. It is not yet clear if Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, the main former rebel group now in control of Syria, will pursue such a process. The group has set up an interim administration comprising members of its 'salvation government' that had ruled its former stronghold in northern Syria. It will oversee the country until March, but the new rulers have not made clear how the transition to a fully empowered government would take place. Pedersen also warned of ongoing violence in parts of the country, particularly in the northeast, where U.S.-backed, Kurdish-led forces and Turkish-backed armed groups have clashed, and called for humanitarian assistance and for starting a process to end Western sanctions on Syria. Israeli students walk out of class to call for release of hostages JERUSALEM — Hundreds of Israeli students walked out of school Wednesday to call for an immediate deal to release the remaining hostages held by Hamas in the Gaza Strip as there appears to be progress in ceasefire talks. From Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, students headed for central junctions, blocking roads and holding signs with the faces of the captives remaining in Gaza after 14 months of war. There are 100 hostages in Gaza, a third of whom Israel’s government says are dead. Hamas militants dragged them to Gaza in the October 2023 attack on Israel that sparked the war. At the high school in central Israel attended by hostages Naama Levy and Guy Illouz, who Israel’s military says was killed in the Oct. 7 attack, students crammed the auditorium with signs reading 'Bring them Home Now.' In Tel Aviv, high school students chanted, 'Their time is up. There’s a deal on the table.' Netanyahu takes the stand on Day 4 of corruption trials TEL AVIV, Israel — Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu took the stand on the fourth day of testimony in his corruption trials Wednesday, saying the accusations against him are 'idiotic.' Netanyahu, the first sitting Israeli leader to take the stand as a criminal defendant, is on trial on charges of fraud, breach of trust and accepting bribes in three separate cases. Netanyahu was supposed to testify on Tuesday, but it was canceled after he requested a postponement due to 'security reasons.' Netanyahu went to the summit of Mount Hermon, part of the Syrian buffer zone that Israeli forces seized after President Bashar Assad was ousted by rebels last week. It appeared to be the first time an Israeli leader had set foot that far into Syria. The testimony, set to take place six hours a day, three days a week for several weeks, will take up a significant chunk of Netanyahu’s working hours. Critics ask if he can capably manage a country embroiled in a war on one front, containing the fallout from a second, and keeping tabs on other potential regional threats, including from Iran. Damascus airport reopens for domestic flights DAMASCUS, Syria — The Damascus airport reopened Wednesday for the first time since the fall of the government of Bashar Assad, and the first civilian plane took off from Damascus and landed in the northern city of Aleppo. The airport is currently open only to domestic flights, but Syrian airspace is open to international traffic. Airport officials have not yet specified when international flights will resume at the Damascus airport, but Saad Khair Bec, technical supervisor, called Wednesday’s reopening 'an important day in the life of the Syrian people ... after the fall of the former shabby regime.' State institutions have been gradually returning to work in recent days, including the main port in the coastal city of Latakia. UN migration agency head says interim Syria leaders recognize challenges ahead GENEVA — The head of the U.N. migration agency said she was reassured by commitments she heard from Syria’s new caretaker government in meetings in Damascus, as the country seeks to rebuild after more than a half-century of rule under the Assad family. Amy Pope, director-general of the International Organization for Migration, said in a phone interview Wednesday that Syria’s new leaders 'recognize the job they have ahead of them is enormous and that they need the support of the international community.' IOM estimates about 100,000 people — many looking to return to their former homes — have entered Syria from neighboring countries since Dec. 8, the day former President Bashar Assad fled the country as opposition fighters swarmed into the capital. 'We are also seeing about 85,000 people come out' of Syria into Lebanon through established border crossing points, she said. 'It’s a rough figure: There’s certainly people who cross informally and so they’re not counted.' Most of those found to be leaving are Shiite Muslims, she said. The armed groups who took control of Syria are primarily from the country’s majority Sunni Muslim community, including Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the terrorist-designated group that led the coalition of armed opposition groups that drove Assad from power. 'There’s no question to me that at this moment in time, they are looking for ways to make this work, to be more inclusive, to build partnerships across the international community, to build partnerships with other governments,' Pope said of the caretaker government. 'It’s just going to be a question of whether they can deliver.'

Animal welfare group says bacterial infection killed Sonia the elephant in Pakistan	ISLAMABAD (AP) — Pakistani veterinary surgeons found that a bacterial infection killed an elephant at a safari park in the city of Karachi earlier this month, a veterinarian with a global animal welfare organization said Wednesday. Dr. Amir Khalil with the Vienna-based Four Paws told The Associated the infection spread through 19-year-old Sonia’s body from her foot, leading to her death. 'We are very sad for Sonia,' he said, raising concerns about how Pakistani authorities handle animals. Four Paws said in a statement the autopsy was conducted last week and that Sonia's death showed neglect on part of local authorities who had earlier said a heart attack may have been the cause of death. There was no immediate comment from Pakistani officials. An African elephant's average lifespan is usually between 60 and 70 years in the wild, according to the World Wildlife Fund, and a bit shorter in captivity. Sonia, a small adult, was brought to Pakistan in 2009 with three other elephants. One of her companions, Noor Jahan, died at a Karachi zoo last year at the age of 17. Sonia was recently reunited with her sister Madhubala, who was transferred from Karachi Zoological Garden last month to be with her family. Madhubala was separated from sisters Sonia and Malika about 15 years ago. Four Paws, which made the post-mortem available on Tuesday, said the 'microbiological results from Sonia’s autopsy revealed the presence of various bacteria. The source of the bacteria was an advanced abscess on Sonia’s foot which was just recently discovered and treated during our stay for Madhubala’s relocation'. It also said Khalil sent a 'prophylactic treatment plan' for Malika and Madhubala to authorities, urgently recommending antibiotic treatment, alongside blood tests for both elephants before and after the treatment. Khalil said he planned to visit Pakistan in February to examine the remaining elephants but Sonia's death showed that better care was needed for the animals. Pakistan has a troubled history with elephants in captivity. In 2020, Kaavan, dubbed the 'world’s loneliest elephant' after languishing alone for years in a Pakistani zoo, was sent to a Cambodian sanctuary for the much-needed company of other elephants. Efforts to transfer Kaavan from Pakistan were supported by singer and actor Cher, who campaigned for his rescue.	https://apnews.com/article/pakistan-elephant-autopsy-death-sonia-four-paws-52be1ff3f28cf6ef01844ac037db06cd	2024-12-17T23:55:39-08:00

UK inflation increase solidifies expectations interest rates will be kept on hold	LONDON (AP) — Inflation in the U.K. rose to its highest level in eight months during November, official figures showed Wednesday, a development that has cemented market expectations that the Bank of England will opt against cutting borrowing costs this week. The Office for National Statistics said consumer price inflation rose by 2.6% in the year to November, up from 2.3% the previous month. It said stubbornly high inflation in the crucial services sector, which accounts for around 80% of the U.K. economy, and an increase in fuel prices was largely behind the overall increase. The increase, which took inflation further away from the Bank of England's target of 2%, was in line with market expectations. This is the biggest increase since March, leading economists to rule out any prospect that the Bank of England will cut its main interest rate from 4.75% after its policy meeting on Thursday. James Smith, research director at the Resolution Foundation economics think tank, said that the 'latest data shows the challenge Britain faces in squeezing inflation out of the economy.' Rate-setters had anticipated a pickup in inflation when the central bank last cut rates in early November as price pressures eased earlier in the year — in September, inflation had fallen to its lowest level since April 2021. Still, inflation in the U.K. and across the world is far lower than it was a couple of years ago, partly because central banks dramatically increased borrowing costs from near zero during the coronavirus pandemic when prices started to shoot up, first as a result of supply chain issues and then because of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine which pushed up energy costs. As inflation rates have fallen from multidecade highs, the central banks have started cutting interest rates, though few, if any, economists think that rates will fall back to the super-low levels that persisted in the years after the global financial crisis of 2008-2009. Recent developments have scaled back expectations of rapid cuts from the Bank of England. Rising wages and stubbornly high inflation in the services sector, the biggest single part of the U.K. economy, have prompted economists to scale back expectations of rapid rate cuts next year. Critics have argued that the new Labour government's first budget in October will lead to higher inflation than otherwise would have been case. The extra public spending announced in the budget will be largely funded through increased business taxes and borrowing. Economists think that the splurge, coupled with the prospect of businesses cushioning the tax hikes by raising prices, could put upward pressure on prices.	https://apnews.com/article/britain-economy-inflation-interest-rates-05d118699b71950480206efd92e112a8	2024-12-17T22:46:12-08:00	
Russia says suspect detained in killing of senior general in Moscow	MOSCOW (AP) — Russia's security service said Wednesday that it has detained a suspect in the killing of a senior general in Moscow. The suspect was described as an Uzbek citizen recruited by Ukrainian intelligence services. Russia’s Federal Security Service, or FSB, didn't name the suspect, but said he was born in 1995. According to a statement by the FSB, the suspect said himself that he was recruited by Ukrainian special services. Lt. Gen. Igor Kirillov was killed Tuesday by a bomb hidden in a scooter outside his apartment building in Moscow, a day after Ukraine’s security service leveled criminal charges against him. His assistant also died in the attack. A Ukrainian official said the service carried out the attack. The FSB said the suspect had been promised a reward of $100,000 and permission to move to a European Union country in exchange for killing Kirillov. The agency stated that, acting on instructions from Ukraine, the suspect traveled to Moscow, where he picked up a homemade explosive device. He then placed the device on an electric scooter and parked it at the entrance to the residential building where Kirillov lived. The suspect then rented a car to monitor the location and set up a camera that livestreamed footage from the scene to his handlers in the central Ukrainian city of Dnipro. Once Kirillov was seen leaving the building, the suspect detonated the bomb. According to the FSB’s statement, the suspect faces 'a sentence of up to life imprisonment.' Kirillov, 54, was the chief of the military’s nuclear, biological and chemical protection forces and was under sanctions from several countries, including the U.K. and Canada, for his actions in Moscow's military operation in Ukraine. On Monday, Ukraine’s Security Service, or SBU, opened a criminal investigation against him, accusing him of directing the use of banned chemical weapons. Russia has denied using any chemical weapons in Ukraine and, in turn, has accused Kyiv of using toxic agents in combat. Kirillov, who took his current job in 2017, was one of the most high-profile figures to level those accusations. He held numerous briefings to accuse the Ukrainian military of using toxic agents and planning to launch attacks with radioactive substances — claims that Ukraine and its Western allies rejected as propaganda. The bomb used in Tuesday’s attack was triggered remotely, according to Russian news reports. Images from the scene showed shattered windows and scorched brickwork. Russia’s top state investigative agency said it’s looking into Kirillov’s death as a case of terrorism, and officials in Moscow vowed to punish Ukraine.	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-general-killed-suspected-arrested-32e504b029d8db0b8d52474d75efc383	2024-12-17T22:20:02-08:00	
As wars rage around them, Armenian Christians in Jerusalem's Old City feel the walls closing in	JERUSALEM (AP) — As the war in Gaza rages, Syria's government transforms, and the Israeli-occupied West Bank seethes, Armenian residents of the Old City of Jerusalem fight a different battle — one that is quieter, they say, but no less existential. One of the oldest communities in Jerusalem, the Armenians have lived in the Old City for decades without significant friction with their neighbors, centered around a convent that acts as a welfare state. Now, the small Christian community has begun to fracture under pressure from forces they say threaten them and the multifaith character of the Old City. From radical Jewish settlers who jeer at clergymen on the way to prayer, to a land deal threatening to turn a quarter of their land into a luxury hotel, residents and the church alike say the future of the community is in flux. Their struggle, playing out under the cover of many regional crises, reflects the difficulty of maintaining a non-Jewish presence in a Jerusalem where life has hardened for religious minorities in the Old City. Chasms have emerged between the Armenian Patriarchate, the traditional steward of community affairs, and the mainly secular community itself. Its members worry that the church is not equipped to protect their dwindling population and embattled convent from obsolescence and takeover. A tent in a parking lot Walk through the narrow passageways of the Armenian Quarter, past a perpetually manned guard post and into an open lot with a towering pile of shrapnel crested with the Armenian flag. You’ve arrived at the headquarters of the 'Save the Arq' movement. It’s where some residents of the Armenian Quarter have decamped, in a structure with reinforced plywood walls hung with ancient maps, to protest what they see as an illegal land grab by a controversial real estate developer. The land under threat is where the community parks their cars and holds group dinners. It also includes parts of the patriarchate itself. It’s been a receiving point for those fleeing the mass killing of some 1.5 million Armenians by Ottoman Turks, widely viewed by scholars as the first genocide of the 20th century. Turkey denies the deaths constituted genocide. The patriarchate has batted away offer after offer to sell the land. That changed in 2021, when an Armenian priest, Baret Yeretsian, signed a fraudulent deal leasing the lot for up to 98 years to a company called Xana Capital, registered just before the agreement was signed. Xana then turned over half the shares to a local businessman, George Warwar, who has been involved in various criminal offenses, according to court filings, including a 24-month prison sentence for armed robbery, and has declared bankruptcy in the past. In court documents seen by the AP, the patriarchate has admitted that Warwar bribed the priest and that the two had sustained 'various inappropriate connections' leading up to the signing of the deal. Community members were outraged when they found out, prompting the priest to flee the country. The patriarchate cancelled the deal in October, but Xana fought back, and the two are now in mediation over the contract. Xana Capital has since sent armed men to the lot, the activists say, attacking members of the community, including clergy, with pepper spray and batons. With the future of the site unclear, the activists say they appealed to the patriarchate to find out what was going on. The activists say that Warwar has the backing of a prominent settler organization seeking to expand Jewish presence in Jerusalem’s Old City. The organization, Ateret Cohanim, is behind several controversial land acquisitions in the Old City, and its leaders were photographed meeting with Warwar and Danny Rothman, the owner of Xana Capital who also uses the last name Rubinstein, in December 2023. The organization denied any connection to the land deal. 'But as soon as the deal was signed, the patriarchate went into silent mode, bunker mode,' said Setrag Balian, 27, a ceramicist. 'We decided that we have to take action and not once again be on the sidelines, watching and hoping that the patriarchy will take the right steps.' So Balian and fellow resident Hagop Djernazian collected some 300 signatures from the community and filed suit against the patriarchate in February, asking them to declare the deal void and to say, for posterity, that the land belongs to the community. In response, the patriarchate said it owns the land, not the community. Xana, meanwhile, filed a response calling the activists antisemitic squatters. The patriarchate's response and Xana's words, the activists said, leave open the chance that the land could be leased again in the future. 'It made us feel like we could not trust the institution who brought us to this day to solve this problem, to solve this conflict,' said Hagop Djernazian. The patriarchate declined to comment on the land deal for this article, saying it could impact mediation efforts underway with Xana. A single observer Inside the Armenian convent, the clergy are hushed, pathways empty. On a recent afternoon, priests in black robes rang the bell for daily prayers at the St. James Cathedral, the storied Armenian church occupying one of the highest points in the Old City. Filing into the darkened space, the men and the young seminary choir were joined only by an Israeli tour group and one Armenian woman who'd come to pray. Father Parsegh Galamterian, church sacristan, has watched prayers thin out over the years, as the Armenian population in the quarter has shrunk from about 15,000 in 1948, the founding of the state of Israel, to around 2,000. 'The future is difficult,' he says. Armenians began arriving in the Old City as early as the 4th century, inspired by the religious significance of the city to Christianity. In the early 20th century, they were joined by masses of Armenians who flocked to Jerusalem after being driven out of the Ottoman Empire. Theirs is the smallest quarter in the Old City, home to Armenians with the same status as Palestinians in Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem — residents but not citizens, effectively stateless. Today, the newcomers are mainly boys who arrive from Armenia to live and study in the convent. Some stay, but many drop out of studies. Clergy say that's partially because attacks against Christians have ramped up within the walls of the Old City, leaving the Armenians – whose convent is closest to the Jewish Quarter and is tucked along a popular route to the Western Wall – vulnerable. Father Aghan Gogchyan, the patriarchate’s chancellor, said he’s regularly attacked by groups of Jewish fundamentalists. He recalled one instance, a month ago, when clergy were headed to prayer. He was intercepted by a group of settlers, who asked if they were Christians. '’You know that you don’t have a future here in the Holy Land. You’re not going to continue to live here,' he recalled one man saying. '’This is our country. We are going to eradicate you.' 'This is the word he used,' said Gogchyan. 'We are going to eradicate you from our country.' The Rossing Center, which tracks anti-Christian attacks in the Holy Land, documented about 20 attacks on Armenian observers, Armenian private property, and church properties in 2023, many involving ultranationalist Jewish settlers spitting at Armenian clergy or graffiti reading 'Death to Christians' scrawled on the quarter’s walls. 'What is being said behind closed doors is that Jerusalem is becoming a place that is no longer hospitable to Christianity,' said Daniel Seidman, a Jerusalem lawyer and peace activist. 'You can see the needle moving. The spike in hate crimes is not part of this plan, but it's part of the impact.' The incidents send a clear message to the next generation, said Gogchyan: stay away. 'The new generation doesn’t want to be in the center of the conflict,' said Gogchyan. 'They’re building their future in different countries. Despite the fractures, Armenian clergy and activists told the AP they want the same thing: a continued presence in the Old City. 'Some people feel helpless and hopeless and they want to leave,' said Balian. 'But I think the majority sees that there is a struggle going on. It gives us a meaning. It gives us a purpose. It gives us a reason to stay here.' ___ Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

Israel's borders have shifted throughout its history. Action in Syria may reshape them again	JERUSALEM (AP) — Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, entered Syrian territory Tuesday and said Israeli troops would remain in the area indefinitely, blurring the border with its northern neighbor. Since its establishment in 1948, Israel has never had fully recognized borders. Throughout its history, the frontiers with its Arab neighbors have shifted as a result of wars, annexations, ceasefires and peace agreements. Now, the downfall of Syrian President Bashar Assad has created a situation that could once again reshape Israel’s borders. As Assad was toppled early this month, Israel quickly moved into the Syrian side of a 50-year-old demilitarized buffer zone. Netanyahu described the move as defensive and temporary, and said it was aimed at making sure that none of the groups jostling for power inside Syria threatened Israel. But in Tuesday’s visit to the Syrian side of the buffer zone, Netanyahu made clear that Israel plans on staying for some time. Speaking on the windswept summit of Mount Hermon overlooking Syria, he said Israel would remain 'until another arrangement is found that will ensure Israel’s security.' Here is a closer look at the evolution of Israel’s borders over the years. Israel’s establishment In 1947, the United Nations approved a plan to partition what was then British-controlled Mandatory Palestine into Jewish and Arab states. The contested city of Jerusalem was to be administered by the U.N. This plan, however, was never implemented. Israel declared independence in May 1948, and neighboring Arab countries declared war. That war ended with Israel in control of some 77% of the territory – with Jordan controlling the West Bank and east Jerusalem, and Egypt in control of the Gaza Strip. 1967 Mideast war During the six days of fighting of the 1967 Mideast war, Israel captured the West Bank and east Jerusalem from Jordan, Gaza and the Sinai peninsula from Egypt, and the Golan Heights from Syria. Initially celebrated by Israel, the lightning victory set the stage for decades of conflict that continue to reverberate today. Israel quickly annexed east Jerusalem – home to the city’s most sensitive Jewish, Muslim and Christian holy sites as well as its Palestinian population. Although Israel has never formally annexed the West Bank, it has informally incorporated much of the territory by building settlements that are now home to over 500,000 Jewish Israelis. The international community overwhelmingly considers both east Jerusalem and the West Bank occupied territory. Israel also built settlements in the Sinai, Golan and the Gaza Strip. 1979 peace agreement with Egypt Under Israel’s first peace agreement with an Arab country, Israel returned the Sinai peninsula to Egypt and dismantled all settlements there. 1981 Golan annexation Israel annexed the Golan Heights, a strategic mountainous region overlooking northern Israel. In 2019, then-President Donald Trump became the first and only foreign leader to recognize Israel’s control. The rest of the world still considers the area occupied Syrian territory. Netanyahu announced this week he wants to expand the Golan settler population after Assad’s downfall. 1982 invasion of Lebanon After a brief invasion of Lebanon against Palestinian militants in 1978, Israel reentered the country in 1982 in an operation that turned into an 18-year occupation of southern Lebanon. Israel withdrew in 2000 under heavy fire from the Hezbollah militia. 1993 Oslo Accords Israel and the Palestinians reached an interim peace deal granting the Palestinians autonomy in Gaza and parts of the West Bank, while leaving Israeli settlements intact. The accords were meant to pave the way for a two-state solution, but repeated rounds of peace talks ended in failure. The Palestinians seek all of the West Bank and Gaza for their hoped-for state, with east Jerusalem as their capital. 2005 Gaza withdrawal Then-Prime Minister Ariel Sharon led a unilateral withdrawal from Gaza, uprooting all troops and 21 settlements from the territory. Two years later, Hamas militants overran Gaza and ousted the Palestinian Authority. 2023 war in Gaza and Lebanon Responding to Hamas’ Oct. 7 cross-border attack, Israel invades Gaza in an operation that continues. Israeli leaders have not laid out a clear postwar plan but have indicated they will maintain a buffer zone along Gaza’s border with Israel along with some sort of long-term military presence. Some hardliners in Netanyahu’s governing coalition have called for the re-establishment of Jewish settlements. In October, Israeli ground troops invaded southern Lebanon after a year of fighting with Hezbollah militants. Under a ceasefire, Israel has pledged to withdraw from a strip of land it is occupying by late January. The fall of Assad As opposition forces ousted Assad on Dec. 8, Israeli military forces moved into the Syrian side of the demilitarized buffer zone, established after the 1973 Mideast war. Israel now controls the zone and targets deeper inside the country. Although Israel has said the move is temporary, its open-ended presence has drawn international criticism from countries such as Egypt, Turkey and Saudi Arabia as well as the United Nations. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has urged all countries with interests in Syria to 'try to make sure that we’re not sparking any additional conflicts.' The new Syrian government has already lodged a complaint with the U.N. Security Council about Israeli advances into Syrian territory. The leader of the largest insurgent group, Ahmad al-Sharaa, has publicly condemned Israel’s operations but said Syria is not seeking a military conflict with Israel. Carmit Valensi, an expert on Syria at Israel's Institute for National Security Studies, said she does not think the Israeli presence will morph into a longer-term occupation. She said Israel has little to gain by provoking al-Sharaa, who is also known as Abu Mohammed al-Golani, and a long-term occupation would be costly economically and for Israel's war-fatigued army. 'It could take some time for Israel to withdraw. It depends how things develop in Syria,' she said. 'If we see a moderate regime emerge, in the same line Golani is trying to pave, I don't see any reason to hold those territories for the long term.'	https://apnews.com/article/israel-borders-history-syria-gaza-war-golan-5fdf8fdbe2ec2cee7b9cf7f78fbb1c8c	2024-12-17T19:57:45-08:00	
Stock market today: Wall Street drifts ahead of the Federal Reserve's rate decision	NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stock indexes are drifting higher Wednesday as Wall Street waits for an announcement from the Federal Reserve that could guide its direction into next year. The S&amp;P 500 rose 0.2% to inch closer to its all-time high set earlier this month. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 173 points, or 0.4%, as of 12:56 p.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite added 0.2%. Jabil jumped 9.8% to help lead the market after reporting stronger profit and revenue for the latest quarter than analysts expected. The electronics company also raised its forecast for revenue for its full fiscal year. Nvidia, the superstar responsible for a chunk of Wall Street’s rally to records in recent years, climbed 3.9% following a weekslong funk. It had dropped more than 12% from its record set last month and fallen in eight of the nine previous days as its big momentum slowed. On the losing side of Wall Street was General Mills, which dropped 3.2% despite reporting a stronger profit than expected. The maker of Progresso soups and Cheerios said it will increase its investments in brands to help them grow, which pushed it to cut its forecast for profit this fiscal year. Trading is likely to remain relatively quiet until the afternoon, when the expectation is for the Fed to deliver its third cut to interest rates of the year. After getting inflation nearly all the way down to its 2% target from more than 9%, the Fed has been easing its main interest rate off a two-decade high to offer support for the slowing job market. The big question is how much more the Fed will cut in 2025, and the hope is that Fed Chair Jerome Powell may give some signals in his press conference following the announcement on interest rates. Fed officials will also unveil projections for where they see interest rates and the economy heading in upcoming years. Expectations for cuts in 2025 have been diminishing, in part because inflation has recently picked up the pace. Worries are also high that President-elect Donald Trump’s preference for tariffs and other policies could further spur inflation, along with economic growth. Treasury yields were holding relatively steady as the bond market waited for more clues on where rates are heading. The yield on the 10-year Treasury slipped to 4.39% from 4.40% late Tuesday. The two-year yield, which more closely tracks expectations for Fed action, eased to 4.23% from 4.25%. In stock markets abroad, London’s FTSE 100 edged up by less than 0.1% after data showed inflation accelerated to 2.6% in November, its highest level in eight month. The Bank of England is also meeting on interest rates this week and will announce its decision on Thursday. In Japan, where the Bank of Japan will wrap up its own policy meeting on Friday, the Nikkei 225 slipped 0.7%. That was despite a 23.7% jump for Nissan Motor Corp., which said it was in talks on closer collaboration with Honda Motor Co., though no decision had been made on a possible merger. Honda Motor’s stock lost 3%. Nissan, Honda and Nissan alliance member Mitsubishi Motors Corp. agreed in August to share components for electric vehicles like batteries and to jointly research software for autonomous driving to adapt better to dramatic changes in the auto industry. ___ AP Writer Zimo Zhong contributed.	https://apnews.com/article/stocks-markets-rates-nissan-2b868351d485db56e9c80f520c97b595	2024-12-17T19:47:35-08:00	
Nissan, Honda confirm talks on closer collaboration but say there's been no decision on a merger	BANGKOK (AP) — Japanese automakers Nissan Motor Corp. and Honda Motor Co. confirmed Wednesday that they are discussing closer collaboration but denied reports they have decided on a merger. Nissan’s share price soared more than 22% in Tokyo after reports citing unnamed sources said it might merge with Honda to form the world’s third-largest automaking group. Honda’s share price fell as much as 3%. The reports said that Nissan alliance member Mitsubishi Motors Corp. was included in the talks. All three Japanese automakers announced in August that they planned to share components for electric vehicles like batteries and jointly research software for autonomous driving to adapt better to dramatic changes in the auto industry centered around electrification. A preliminary agreement between Honda, Japan's second-largest automaker, and Nissan, third largest, was announced in March. Trading in Nissan’s shares was suspended but then resumed after the companies jointly issued a statement saying they were 'considering various possibilities for future collaboration, but no decisions have been made.' A merger could result in a behemoth worth about $55 billion based on the market capitalization of all three automakers. Joining forces would help the two companies gain larger scale to compete with Japan's market leader Toyota Motor Corp. and with Germany’s Volkswagen AG. Nissan has an alliance with Renault SA that is under review. Last month, it said it was slashing 9,000 jobs, or about 6% of its global work force, and reducing global production capacity by 20% after reporting a quarterly loss of 9.3 billion yen ($61 million). Earlier this month it reshuffled its management and its chief executive, Makoto Uchida, took a 50% pay cut to take responsibility for the financial woes. He said Nissan needed to become more efficient and respond better to market tastes, rising costs and other global changes. Honda reported its profits slipped nearly 20% in the first half of the April-March fiscal year from a year earlier, as sales suffered in China. The ascent of Chinese automakers is shaking up the industry at a time when manufacturers are struggling to shift from fossil fuel-driven vehicles to electrics. Toyota made 11.5 million vehicles in 2023, while Honda rolled out 4.2 million and Nissan produced 3.4 million. Mitsubishi Motors made just over 1 million. Even after a merger Toyota would remain the biggest Japanese automaker.	https://apnews.com/article/japan-nissan-honda-merger-evs-56199be5bf5b99b0c739acfb1a9244dd	2024-12-17T18:48:38-08:00	
Japanese space startup aborts 2nd satellite launch attempt minutes after liftoff	TOKYO (AP) — A Japanese space startup said its second attempt to launch a rocket carrying satellites into orbit had been aborted minutes after liftoff Wednesday and destroyed itself again, nine months after the company's first launch attempt ended in an explosion. Space One's Kairos No. 2 rocket lifted off from a coastal site in the mountainous prefecture of Wakayama in central Japan. The company said it had aborted the flight after concluding that it was unlikely to complete its mission. 'We are very sorry that we could not achieve as far as a final stage of the mission,' Space One President Masakazu Toyoda told a news conference Wednesday. 'We don't consider this a failure because we are getting valuable data that will help our pursuit toward a next challenge.' He said he hoped to find the cause to address the problems as soon as possible to achieve a success next time. Company executive and space engineer Mamoru Endo said the abnormality in the first stage engine nozzle or its control system is likely to have caused an unstable flight of the rocket, which started spiraling in midflight and eventually destroyed itself about three minutes after liftoff, using its autonomous safety mechanism. The rocket, which rose higher than 100 kilometers (60 miles) above ground, entered space entered space before it was destroyed, officials said. Space One aims to be Japan’s first company to put a satellite into orbit, hoping to boost Japan’s lagging space industry with a small rocket for an affordable space transport business. Wednesday's flight, postponed twice from Saturday because of strong winds, came nine months after a failed debut flight in March, when the rocket was intentionally exploded five seconds after takeoff. The flight was carrying a government satellite that was intended to monitor North Korea’s missile launches and other military activities. Kairos No. 2 rocket was carrying five small satellites, including one from the Taiwanese space agency and several from Japanese startups. Space One said it had fixed the cause of the debut flight failure, which stemmed from a miscalculation of the rocket’s first-stage propulsion. Japan hopes the company can pave the way for a domestic space industry that competes with the United States. Tokyo-based Space One was set up in 2018 with investments from major Japanese companies, including Canon Electronics, IHI, Shimizu and major banks, to commercialize space delivery services at lower costs and regular flights as many as 20 times a year, compared to six currently planned by the government-led space program. Japan’s space development programs are led by Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, or JAXA, and industry leaders such as Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and IHI, as they develop two main flagship rockets, the large H3 rocket and the much smaller Epsilon, to cater to the growing satellite transport business.	https://apnews.com/article/japan-space-rocket-satellite-commercial-abort-space-one-52409d53f2c187c0548188d160df03be	2024-12-17T17:30:31-08:00	
Rescuers dig for survivors of Vanuatu earthquake with no water and unclear death toll	WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — Vanuatu's capital was without water on Wednesday, a day after reservoirs were destroyed by a violent magnitude 7.3 earthquake that wrought havoc on the South Pacific island nation, with the number of people killed and injured expected to rise. The government's disaster management office said early Wednesday that 14 deaths were confirmed, but hours later said nine had been verified by the main hospital. The number was 'expected to increase' as people remained trapped in fallen buildings, a spokesperson said. About 200 people have been treated for injuries. Two of those killed were Chinese nationals, according to China’s official Xinhua News Agency, which cited Gu Zihua, an official at the Chinese embassy in Vanuatu. Frantic rescue efforts that began at flattened buildings after the quake hit early Tuesday afternoon continued 30 hours later, with dozens working in dust and heat with little water to seek those yelling for help inside. A few more survivors were extracted from the rubble of downtown buildings in Port Vila, also the country's largest city, while others remained trapped and some were found dead. A near-total telecommunications collapse meant people struggled to confirm their relatives' safety. Some providers began to reestablish phone service but connections were patchy. Internet service had not been restored because the submarine cable supplying it was damaged, the operator said. The earthquake hit at a depth of 57 kilometers (35 miles) and was centered 30 kilometers (19 miles) west of the capital of Vanuatu, a group of 80 islands home to about 330,000 people. A tsunami warning was called off less than two hours after the quake, but dozens of large aftershocks continued to rattle the country. The Asia-Pacific head of the International Federation of Red Cross, Katie Greenwood, speaking to The Associated Press from Fiji, said it was not clear how many people were still missing or killed. 'We have anecdotal information coming from people at the search and rescue site that are fairly confident that unfortunately those numbers will rise,' she said. The capital’s main medical facility, Vila Central Hospital, was badly damaged and patients were moved to a military camp. Clement Chipokolo, Vanuatu country director at the Christian relief agency World Vision, said health care services, already strained before the quake, were overwhelmed. No water in Port Vila While power was out in swathes of Port Vila, the biggest fear among aid agencies was the lack of water. Two large reservoirs serving the capital were totally decimated, the National Disaster Management Office said. Resident Milroy Cainton said people were joining large queues to buy water in stores, but could only purchase two or four bottles at a time. 'People are not really concerned about electricity, they're just concerned about water,' he said. UNICEF was recording a rise in diarrhea among children, a sign that they had begun to drink tainted water, said the chief of the Vanuatu office, Eric Durpaire. Officials told residents of areas where water had been restored to boil it. Some people remain trapped under the rubble At least 10 buildings sustained major damage, many in a busy downtown area full of lunchtime shoppers when the quake hit. An unknown number of people were trapped inside, and Cainton, the resident, said rescuers had been forced to target their efforts to where they believed people could be saved. Michael Thompson, who runs a tourism business in Vanuatu, was among the rescuers and posted a video on Facebook of the frenzied efforts and dust-covered survivors on gurneys along with pleas for people to bring tools and water to the site. Officials said Wednesday night that Port Vila appeared to be the worst-hit area, but some nearby villages and offshore islands had experienced landslides. Three bridges were 'at high risk of collapse' in heavy rain, the government said. Embassies are damaged A building housing a number of diplomatic missions in Port Vila — including those of the United States, Britain, France and New Zealand — was destroyed, with a section of the building cleaving off and flattening the first floor. Windows were buckled and walls crumbled. The U.S. State Department said its embassy staff were safe, but the building was no longer functional. The office opened in July as part of a push by the U.S. to expand its Pacific presence to counter China’s influence in the region. New Zealand’s foreign ministry said officials have accounted for all embassy staff. Australia’s foreign ministry said its workers were safe. All flights grounded Damage to the seaport and airport is likely to hamper aid efforts and economic recovery in a country dependent on agricultural exports and tourism. The airport was closed to commercial flights for a further 72 hours from Wednesday. But the runway was deemed functional for humanitarian flights by French engineers who arrived by helicopter. Military craft from Australia and New Zealand were due to begin arriving Wednesday night, carrying search and rescue personnel and equipment, as well as relief supplies. Dan McGarry, a journalist living in Vanuatu, said there had been a 'massive landslide' at the international shipping terminal. The government said the main wharf was closed. Vanuatu’s position on a subduction zone — where the Indo-Australian tectonic plate moves beneath the Pacific Plate — means earthquakes of greater than magnitude 6 are not uncommon, and the country’s buildings are intended to withstand quake damage. ___ Associated Press writers Mayuko Ono in Tokyo, Japan; Rod McGuirk in Melbourne, Australia; and Emily Wang in Beijing contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/vanuatu-earthquake-pacific-ocean-port-vila-magnitude-85f483b151f928cc25175038c33fb6d1	2024-12-17T17:18:56-08:00	
Ontario's premier says Trump's tariffs would be a disaster for US markets	TORONTO (AP) — The premier of Canada's most populous province said Tuesday President-elect Donald Trump's plan to impose sweeping 25% tariffs on all Canadian products would be a 'disaster' that would hurt U.S. stock markets. Ontario Premier Doug Ford also said in an interview with The Associated Press that he's 'extremely worried' about Trump's plan to launch a mass deportation of millions of undocumented people. Ford said he has a plan to send hundreds of police officers to the border if they come north. Ford said tariffs won't work considering how integrated the U.S. and Canadian economies are. He noted that in the auto sector alone parts and go back and forth between Canada-U.S. border seven or eight times before being assembled in Ontario or Michigan. 'It is so integrated. I don't even know how you separate that in the supply chain. It would be a disaster,' Ford told the AP. 'It will affect the market. The market will drop and we have every CEO saying that is not the way to go.' Ford said the market consequences will get Trump's attention. 'I know he has many scorecards, but one is the stock market. It will affect the market, the market will drop,' Ford said. Brian Hughes, a Trump-Vance transition spokesperson, said in response to Ford's comments that 'President Trump has promised tariff policies that protect working Americans from the unfair practices of foreign companies and foreign markets.' Ford said he's also very worried about Trump’s mass deportation plan. Trump has talked about creating 'the largest mass deportation program in history,' calling for using the National Guard and mobilizing domestic police forces. 'I am extremely concerned,' Ford said. 'We do have a plan ready. We have hundreds of provincial police officers that are ready within hours, if not immediately, to hit the borders.' Ford said a combination of local police, provincial police and the federal government will all be working together. 'We’ll make sure that we tighten up that border like we’ve never seen before,' he said. Trump has threatened to impose 25% tariffs on all Canadian goods if Canada and Mexico do not stem the flow of migrants and fentanyl from entering the U.S. border — even though far fewer of each crosses into the U.S. from Canada than from Mexico. Ford made the comments shortly after Canada's federal government announced some more details about a billion dollar border plan that's designed to avert the tariffs. Canada's national police plans to create a new aerial intelligence task force to provide round-the-clock surveillance of Canada’s border using helicopters, drones and surveillance towers. Canada will also propose to the United States the creation of a North American 'joint strike force' to target organized crime groups that work across borders. 'We’re stepping up to keep our border strong and secure: By deploying new helicopters, drones and surveillance tools. By adding new scanners and sniffer dog teams to stop and seize fentanyl. By cracking down on the money laundering that’s funding cross-border crime,' Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said in a post on X. Trudeau is under pressure from some of his own lawmakers to resign after his finance minister quit cabinet. Ford said it’s up to Trudeau to resign and said Canada’s provincial premiers are united in telling the Americans how important U.S-Canada trade is. Ford reiterated he would restrict electricity exports to Michigan, New York and Minnesota if the sweeping tariffs are imposed. 'I want to sell them more energy, more critical minerals, but I’m going to always keep every tool in our tool box available' Ford said. 'That’s the the last thing I want to do. We have the energy. They need the energy.' About 60% of U.S. crude oil imports are from Canada, and 85% of U.S. electricity imports as well. Canada is also the largest foreign supplier of steel, aluminum and uranium to the U.S. and has 34 critical minerals and metals that the Pentagon is eager for. Nearly $3.6 billion Canadian ($2.7 billion) worth of goods and services cross the border each day. Canada is the top export destination for 36 U.S. states. Ford said he spoke with the governors of Michigan and New York and they 'fully understand.' Michigan is Ontario’s top trading partner. 'We want to sit down and explain to Trump and inform him that we aren’t the enemy,' Ford said. 'And as for Mexico I want to do a bilateral trade deal directly with the U.S.' Flows of migrants and seizures of drugs at the two countries’ border are vastly different. U.S. customs agents seized 43 pounds of fentanyl at the Canadian border during the last fiscal year, compared with 21,100 pounds at the Mexican border. Most of the fentanyl reaching the U.S. — where it causes about 70,000 overdose deaths annually — is made by Mexican drug cartels using precursor chemicals smuggled from Asia. On immigration, the U.S. Border Patrol reported 1.53 million encounters with migrants at the southwest border with Mexico between October 2023 and September 2024. That compares to 23,721 encounters at the Canadian border during that time.	https://apnews.com/article/canada-trump-us-ontario-ford-tariffs-2b8f74835456ed37d5c0b2f2e8688d7b	2024-12-17T15:30:37-08:00	
Deadly violence in Nigeria linked to breakup of United Methodist Church over LGBTQ policies	A religious schism has turned deadly in Nigeria, with a church member fatally shot and two young children killed as homes were set ablaze, according to United Methodist News Service. The news service said the reported violence on Sunday stemmed from a schism in the worldwide United Methodist Church over its decision to repeal LGBTQ bans — and the ensuing formation of the new Global Methodist Church by breakaway conservative churches. According to the news service, a United Methodist church member was shot and killed in a confrontation between both factions in Taraba, a state in northeast Nigeria. Homes were set ablaze, claiming the lives of two children, ages 2 and 4, of the overseer of a United Methodist school and nursery, the news service said. Another 10 church members were reported injured. The worldwide Global Methodist Church held its inaugural general conference earlier this year. It was created by churches breaking away from the United Methodist Church — an international denomination with a strong U.S. presence. While the UMC, at its general conference in May, lifted its longstanding bans on LGBTQ ordination and same-sex marriage, it also granted local conferences the right to set their own standards. The West Africa Central Conference, which includes Nigeria, restricts marriage to between a man and a woman and instructs its churches to follow national laws on LGBTQ issues, according to the news service. In a statement, local United Methodist bishops condemned the violence and asked that there be no retribution. 'We are outraged that such an atrocity would occur among Christians, especially brothers and sisters who were once part of the same Methodist family,' they said in a statement. 'We further urge GMC members, at all levels, to put an immediate end to the violence and refrain from disseminating misinformation that fuels fear and disdain that can lead to violence,' they said. The Assembly of Bishops of the Global Methodist Church issued a statement saying it is actively looking into the allegations and is seeking to determine what has happened. 'We mourn the loss of human life, decry the use of violence in any form, and call on both Global Methodists and United Methodists to serve as agents of peace,' it said. ___ Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

Brazilian Santa swaps sleigh for Jet Ski to deliver toys — and joy — to disabled children in Rio	RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) — Santa Claus is coming to town ... on a Jet Ski. Dozens of children with disability gathered on Rio de Janeiro's Copacabana beach on Tuesday to receive presents — and joy — from the white-bearded man himself, a joint effort by the city's firefighters and nonprofit associations. Under 27 Celsius degrees (80 Fahrenheit), firefighter sargeant Thiago Carvalho de Paiva wore Santa Claus costumes in tropical Rio, moving through the water as beachgoers cheered. 'We wanted to find a special way for Santa Claus to arrive,' said Renato Grigorovski, a spokesman for Rio’s firefighters' department. The day began with a show of sniffing dogs displaying their skills and continued through lunch, with popcorn and refreshing acai bowls. The celebration reached its peak when Santa arrived on Jet Ski, making a grand entrance on the shores of Brazil 's postcard city. But it was not all fun and games for Santa. After delivering presents, De Paiva quickly jumped back into the water to rescue three people who appared to have trouble returning to shore. None was injured, firefighters said. ____ Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america	https://apnews.com/article/santa-claus-jet-ski-rio-brazil-7a89ad01b77f2d845d62aa1818c1a30d	2024-12-17T13:57:53-08:00	
More world leaders from Argentina and El Salvador invited to Trump's inauguration	FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) — More world leaders are confirming they have been invited to President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration, and Argentine President Javier Milei is disclosing his plans to travel to Washington, breaking an American political tradition that kept foreign heads of state away from the transfer of power. Milei's spokesman Manuel Adorni told journalists in a text message that Trump had invited the Argentine leader, noting how it was the first time such an invitation had been extended to the president from the South American nation. And the Salvadoran ambassador to the U.S. said there had been an invitation to President Nayib Bukele and was still waiting to hear whether he would accept it. No head of state has previously made an official visit to the U.S. for the inauguration. On Monday, Trump spoke about his invitation to Chinese President Xi Jinping, revealing he had not declined it or confirmed his attendance yet. He was asked which other world leaders had been invited and whether Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was among them. Trump said the Ukrainian leader had not been invited, 'but if he’d like to come, I’d like to have him.' Trump's transition team did not respond to a request for information, but last week, spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said Trump had invited world leaders. On Monday, Trump said world leaders were calling him when asked a question about what other heads of state he had invited. El Salvador’s ambassador to the U.S. Milena Mayorga said on a radio show that she was waiting to see if Bukele will accept the invitation saying it was still under consideration due to security reasons. Milei was the first foreign leader to meet with Trump after the election, traveling from Buenos Aires to the president-elect's Mar-a-Lago club. Milei, who describes himself as an 'anarcho-capitalist' receives praise frequently from billionaire Elon Musk and biotech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, who will helm the so-called 'Department of Government Efficiency' to fire federal workers, cut programs and slash federal regulations. In his message to journalists, Milei's spokesperson Adorni said Trump is creating an entity similar to his new ministry of deregulation in Argentina. Milei brandished a chainsaw while campaigning on budget cuts, and then implemented a series of austerity measures, laying off tens of thousands of government workers, freezing public infrastructure projects and imposing wage and pension freezes below inflation. Many economists express cautious optimism that, as radical as some of the measures Milei has adopted, he is taking the right steps to rescue crisis-prone Argentina. Milei hopes good relations between the two countries could help Argentina reach a new deal with the International Monetary Fund, which would relieve pressure on the billions of dollars in debt repayments due next year. ___ Rey reported from Buenos Aires, Argentina.

A couple hundred North Korean troops killed, wounded in battles with Ukrainian forces	WASHINGTON (AP) — A couple hundred North Korean troops fighting alongside Russian forces against Ukraine have been killed or wounded during battle in the Kursk border region, a senior military official said Tuesday. The official didn't provide details on exactly how many have been killed, but said the North Korean forces don't appear to be battle-hardened, which contributes to the number of casualties they've had. The official was providing the first significant estimate of North Korean casualties, which comes several weeks after Ukraine announced that North Korea had sent 10,000 to 12,000 troops to Russia to help it in the almost 3-year war. The White House and Pentagon on Monday confirmed that the North Korean forces have been battling on the front lines in largely infantry positions. They have been fighting with Russian units and, in some cases, independently around Kursk. The casualty disclosure comes as the Biden administration is pressing to send as much military aid as possible to Ukraine before President-elect Donald Trump takes over. But a senior defense official told reporters Tuesday that the Defense Department may not be able to send all of the remaining $5.6 billion in Pentagon weapons and equipment stocks intended for Ukraine before Jan. 20, when Trump is sworn in. Both officials spoke on condition of anonymity to provide a U.S. assessment of the war. According to the Pentagon, there is about $1.2 billion remaining in longer-term funding through the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, which is used to pay for weapons contracts that would not be delivered for a year or more. The official said the administration anticipates releasing all that money by the end of this year. The $5.6 billion is in presidential drawdown authority (PDA), which allows the Pentagon to take weapons off the shelves and send them quickly to Ukraine. That is a substantial amount of money, the defense official said, and while the U.S. will continue to provide weapons to Ukraine until Jan. 20, there may well be funds remaining that will be available for the incoming Trump administration to spend. Trump has talked about getting some type of negotiated settlement between Ukraine and Russia, creating some unease about whether he will provide Ukraine all the weapons funding approved by Congress. Ukrainian and Russian forces have been in a fierce battle around Kursk, and the official said Russia has been able to take back about 20% of the territory gained there by Kyiv. They said it will be possible for Ukraine to hold ground there for some time, but it will depend on how the rest of the fight is going, including the long-range strikes that Kyiv has been launching. The officials said it's not clear if Moscow has asked Pyongyang for additional forces, but acknowledged that Russia continues to lose as many as 1,200 troops a day in casualties — including both dead and wounded. But so far, Russia has been able to generate enough forces to replace them.	https://apnews.com/article/north-korea-ukraine-casualties-kursk-russia-a1207ba61ded5061f721ffa0f0650851	2024-12-17T13:24:11-08:00	
At least 25 are killed and dozens are missing after an overcrowded boat capsizes in Congo	KINSHASA, Congo (AP) — An overcrowded boat capsized on a river in central Congo on Tuesday, killing at least 25 people, including children, and leaving dozens missing, officials and local residents said. The vessel was believed to have more than 100 passengers on board after leaving from the town of Inongo, northeast of the capital of Kinshasa. It capsized a few hundred meters (yards) into the journey along the Fimi River, the latest such tragedy to strike Congo. A search was underway for the missing hours later on Tuesday as concerns rose that the death toll could be far higher. 'There was overloading at roof level and, as far as the lifeless human bodies are concerned, at least 25 have been recovered so far,' said David Kalemba, Inongo’s river commissioner. The capsized boat was also loaded with goods, according to Alex Mbumba, a resident of the area. 'Among the dead are children, but it’s difficult to give an exact death toll at the moment as ... the boat had a lot of passengers,' said Mbumba. Tuesday's wreck was the fourth this year in the Maï-Ndombe province, a region surrounded by rivers and where many rely on river transportation. Congolese officials have often warned against overloading and vowed to punish those violating safety measures for water transportation. However, in remote areas where most passengers come from, many are unable to afford public transport for the few available roads. At least 78 people drowned in October when an overloaded boat sank in the country’s east while 80 lost their lives in a similar accident near Kinshasa in June. The latest accident prompted calls for the government to equip the province with flotation devices. 'The government must act to improve safety on the waters of our province (because) navigation conditions are dangerous,' said Mbumba. ___ McMakin reported from Dakar, Senegal, and Katumwa from Goma, Congo.	https://apnews.com/article/congo-boat-sink-mai-ndombe-389c60b793f0ce05d79fcc7d67273ad2	2024-12-17T11:58:51-08:00	
Four police officers killed in Mexico's most violent state	MEXICO CITY (AP) — Gunmen in northern Mexico attacked a police patrol and killed four officers in a shooting that also left four people wounded, authorities said Tuesday. The attack took place Monday in the north-central state of Guanajuato, which has Mexico’s highest number of homicide s. It has long been the scene of bloody turf battles between rival cartels, and the state has long been among the most deadly for police in Mexico. State prosecutors said Tuesday the attack occurred in the town of Uriangato, near the border with the neighboring state of Michoacan. Those killed in the attack included one female officer. The industrial and agricultural state of Guanajuato has for years been the scene of a bloody turf battle between the Jalisco New Generation Cartel and a local gang, the Santa Rosa de Lima Cartel.	https://apnews.com/article/mexico-violence-four-police-officers-killed-f531a00a117bc05933318d1801793ddc	2024-12-17T11:09:56-08:00	
After Assad's fall, the task of unearthing the dead from Syria's mass graves is just beginning	NAJHA, Syria (AP) — Bones are visible here and there among the mounds of earth in a field south of Damascus, one of the mass graves around Syria believed to hold the bodies of tens of thousands of people killed under Bashar Assad’s rule. With his ouster, residents, forensic teams and international groups face what could be a yearslong task of unearthing the dead. In this site alone, by the town of Najha, several tens of thousands of bodies could have been buried, said Stephen Rapp, a former U.S. ambassador-at-large for war crimes issues who was visiting the site Tuesday. Some are believed buried under already existing graves of a regular cemetery nearby, he said. It's too soon to start digging, and it's unknown how many bodies remain there or if some were moved over the years. But here and there, bones were visible, including some vertebrae from a human spine and fragments of a femur. Rapp is working with two organizations that aim to help document mass graves and identify officials implicated in war crimes — the Commission for International Justice and Accountability and the Syria Emergency Task Force. They and other groups have for years been remotely gathering witness testimonies and satellite imagery to track and estimate the size of mass graves that swelled from crackdowns by Assad's feared security agencies, particularly in the early years of Syria's civil war that began in 2011. With Assad's fall 10 days ago, they are now able to see them firsthand. That gives the chance to 'really corroborate what we already know about the machinery of death that was maintained and operated by the Assad regime,' Rapp said. 'It is all so unthinkable that this is happening in the 21st Century.' More than 150,000 Syrians remain unaccounted for after disappearing into Assad's prisons and most are believed to be in mass graves around the country, said Mounir al-Mustafa, deputy director of the White Helmets, a Syrian search and rescue team. An array of prisons run by the military, intelligence and security agencies were notorious for systematic torture, mass executions and brutal conditions that killed other inmates from disease and starvation, according to human rights groups, whistle-blowers, and former detainees. The White Helmets have received reports of at least 13 mass grave sites around the country, eight of them near Damascus, including Najha, al-Mustafa said. 'We can’t open these mass graves yet. That is a massive task to document and take samples and give codes to the corpses before we can identify those people,' he said. The priority is to take stock of the unidentified bodies above ground, those in hospital morgues and in clashes, al-Mustafa said. Rapp, who arrived in Syria on Monday, visited another suspected grave site, in al-Qutayfah, 37 kilometers (23 miles) north of the capital. He plans to meet with officials from the new transitional government installed since the lightning offensive on Damascus on Dec. 8 that forced Assad to flee the country. He intends to discuss ways to secure and eventually excavate the sites, gather samples from remains for identification and preserve thousands of documents discovered in many security branches and prisons. 'There needs to be a process. That is what I will be engaging with government representatives about,' Rapp said. He said he will also see what the international community can do to assist the government in criminal prosecutions and in ensuring they meet international standards. On Monday, residents and medical teams began on their own digging up a mass grave in the village of Izraa in southern Daraa province. The remains of over 30 corpses were uncovered, and the teams estimated the total number could reach 70. Moussa Al-Zouebi, the head of the village’s health directorate, said some of the people whose remains were uncovered were executed by 'shooting in the head, in the eye, or by burning.' A local forensic team and rebel fighters handled bags of human remains as an excavator rumbled in the background, while relatives stood by. Relatives said they initially had hopes that they would find their loved ones in a prison. 'But we didn’t find anyone and it broke our hearts. They were burned alive here after being doused in fuel,' Mohammad Ghazaleh said at the mass grave site. The new authorities in Damascus have designated a hotline for people and ex-prisoners to identify locations and secret prisons used by Assad’s government to find any trace of missing persons. The insurgents have freed thousands of prisoners in Damascus and other cities, including Aleppo, Homs and Hama. 'It is understandable that the desperate family members will try to go to a site hoping that they find some sign of their relatives, some information,' Rapp said. He said the same is happening with documents found at sites. 'Although that is understandable, it can be damaging to an investigation,' he said. Rapp said the process of securing and cataloguing documents could take up to three months but identifying those buried in mass graves could take more than two years.	https://apnews.com/article/syria-mass-graves-stephen-rapp-fea6c06369a866786fa5633900e22419	2024-12-17T10:32:22-08:00	
Canada's prime minister faces calls to resign. Here's what could happen next	TORONTO (AP) — Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau faces growing pressure to resign from his own Liberal Party after his top minister abruptly quit and criticized his handling of the budget. Trudeau has led the country for nearly a decade, but has become widely unpopular in recent years over a wide range of issues, including the high cost of living and rising inflation. There is no mechanism for Trudeau's party to force him out in the short-term. He could resign, or his party could be forced from power by a 'no confidence' vote in Parliament that would trigger an election that would very likely favor the opposing Conservative Party. If his party were to survive a vote in Parliament — which seems increasingly unlikely — Trudeau could choose to stay on as prime minister until there is an election. As rising numbers of Liberal lawmakers called Tuesday for Trudeau to resign, the country’s minister of natural resources, Jonathan Wilkinson, said 'we all need to give him a little time to reflect.' Here's a deeper look at the possible paths for Trudeau and Canada. Trudeau could resign and allow other liberals to vie for his office If Trudeau resigns, which political analysts consider a likely scenario, the Liberals would need to choose an interim prime minister to lead the country at least until elections are held. It isn't clear yet who the most likely candidate would be for any interim role. Longer term, a person likely to seek power in the Liberal Party post-Trudeau is Mark Carney, the former head of the Bank of Canada, and later the Bank of England. Carney has long been interested in entering politics and becoming prime minister. Another possible candidate is Trudeau’s new finance minister, Dominic LeBlanc. The former public safety minister, and a close friend of Trudeau, LeBlanc recently joined the prime minister at a dinner with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago. Concerns about Trudeau's leadership were exacerbated Monday when Chrystia Freeland, the former finance minister, quit his Cabinet. Freeland was highly critical of Trudeau's handling of the economy in the face of steep tariffs threatened by Trump. Shortly before Freeland announced her decision, the country's housing minister also quit. 'My guess is that if another minister or two goes, he’s toast, he will be forced to resign,' said Canadian historian Robert Bothwell. Opposition parties could vote to topple Trudeau's grip on power With voters deeply unhappy, Parliament has the authority to try to knock Trudeau's Liberal party from power by holding a 'no confidence' vote that would trigger an early election. And if a majority of Parliament votes against his government, Trudeau would then be 'erased in the election,' Bothwell said. The walls are rapidly closing in on Trudeau. Because Liberals don’t hold an outright majority in the Parliament, they have for years depended on the support of the leftist New Democratic Party to pass legislation and stay in power. But that support has all but vanished — the NDP's leader has called on Trudeau to resign — and that clears the way for Parliament to vote 'no confidence.' After Tuesday, Parliament will be shut for the holidays until late next month, and a 'no confidence' vote could be scheduled sometime thereafter. The Conservative Party, which has a commanding lead in the polls over the Liberals, has not publicly called for Trudeau’s resignation. And because of tactics the Liberal Party can deploy to delay a 'no confidence' vote, Conservatives might not be able to force one for a couple of months, said Nelson Wiseman, professor emeritus at the University of Toronto. A vote of no confidence would trigger an immediate election. Trudeau could try to hang on to power The political winds are blowing heavily against Trudeau, but he could theoretically cling to power a while longer. While a growing number want him to resign, one longtime supporter, Liberal lawmaker James Maloney, said Trudeau has the support of his base in Parliament. If Trudeau’s Liberal party survives no confidence votes in the coming months — an unlikely scenario — the latest the next federal election could be held is October 20. The odds of an election much sooner than that have gone up. 'I expect an election in late spring, unless Trudeau decides to dissolves Parliament and dives into an election before then,' said Wiseman. With Liberals' grip on power fading, experts say the best they can hope for in the next election is to hold the Conservatives to a minority government that will be reliant on other parties to pass legislation. The latest polling from Nanos has the Conservatives leading the Liberals 43% to 23%, suggesting Conservatives could win a majority of the seats.	https://apnews.com/article/trudeau-canada-resign-freeland-trump-f346160f062846bbbaac73dbdd597941	2024-12-17T10:13:17-08:00	
Iran pauses the process to implement a new, stricter headscarf law for women, official says	TEHRAN, Iran (AP) — Iran has paused the process of implementing a new, stricter law on women’s mandatory headscarf, or hijab, an official said — a bill that many believe could have reignited the protests that engulfed the Islamic Republic after the 2022 death of Mahsa Amini. The controversial law, which was approved by the parliament in September 2023, will not be sent to the government as planned this week, according to one of the country's vice presidents. The development effectively means that Iran has halted enacting the legislation. The law levies harsher punishments for women who refuse to wear the hijab and for businesses that serve them, penalties previously rejected by Iran’s reformist President Masoud Pezeshkian as he tries to restart talks with the West over sanctions imposed on Iran over its nuclear program. 'According to the discussions held, it was decided that this law will not be referred to the government by the parliament for now,' Shahram Dabiri, the vice president in charge of parliamentary affairs, was quoted as saying in an interview Monday with the pro-reform Ham Mihan daily. The decision to halt the legislation — at least temporarily — was reached by top executive, legislative and judiciary bodies, Dabiri also said. At the moment, it is 'not feasible to implement this bill,' he added, without elaborating. Had the bill passed to the government, Iran's president would have had little room to maneuver. By law, he’s required to endorse the bill within five days, after which it would have taken effect in 15 days. The president has no authority to veto it. Pezeshkian could try to convince Iran’s 85-year-old Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has final say on all matters of state, to halt the bill. If the bill had been enacted, Pezeshkian could also refuse to act on it or urge police not to enforce it, setting up a potential constitutional crisis that hard-liners could try to exploit to weaken him. The president had earlier described the law as having 'many questions and ambiguities.' Amini died on Sept. 16, 2022, after her arrest by the country’s morality police over allegedly not wearing her hijab to the liking of the authorities. Iran has denied being responsible for her death and disputes she was beaten. However, United Nations investigators have concluded Amini 'was subjected to physical violence that led to her death,' which they blamed on the morality police. The monthslong security crackdown that followed Amini’s death killed more than 500 people and saw over 22,000 detained. In the years since, Iranian women on the streets increasingly have ignored the existing hijab law, walking in public with their hair uncovered despite the threat of arrest or harassment. The new, 74-section law envisages fines of $800 for first offenses and $1,500 for second offenses, followed by prison terms of up to 15 years for third offenses. Also, celebrities and public figures could see the confiscation of 8% of their net worth, while businesses face the possibility of closure and fines for serving those not wearing a headscarf. Travel bans also would have been enacted for offenders. The law also would have allowed foreign nationals, including the millions of Afghans living in Iran, to work as informers reporting women not wearing the hijab. Business owners and taxi drivers would be encouraged to report on uncovered women. Otherwise, they can face cash fines. The scope of the law, which would be in place for three years, is extraordinary even for the Islamic Republic. It also includes allowing police access to private surveillance footage and even footage recorded by security forces, the Defense Ministry and the country’s civilian nuclear agency. ___ Associated Press writer Jon Gambrell in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/iran-mandatory-headscarf-hijab-law-protests-26e6015d6e47b18238f0ac4c08c4d33a	2024-12-17T09:41:54-08:00	
Stellantis pledges invest $2.1 million in Italian production in 2025 during talks with government	MILAN (AP) — Carmaker Stellantis will invest 2 billion euros ($2.1 billion) in Italian production next year and spend another 6 billion euros ($6.3 billion) in the supply chain, the head of European operations told a government panel on Tuesday. Stellantis executives laid out prospects for Italian operations just weeks after the board forced former CEO Carlos Tavares to resign amid slumping sales. He is being replaced by an executive committee led by chairman John Elkann until a new CEO is named. Stellantis, the world’s fourth-largest carmaker, was formed from the 2021 merger of Fiat Chrysler and PSA Peugeot. Its fiscal base is in the Netherlands, but it retains headquarters in Turin, Paris and Auburn Hills, Michigan. Stellantis European chief Jean-Philippe Imparato told the economic, labor and economic development ministers that Turin would become the headquarters of the carmakers’ European operations from January, addressing a concern among Italian officials and unions since the merger that the automaker’s center of gravity had shifted. Meeting behind closed doors, Imparato told the ministers that Stellantis’ six automaking factories in Italy will boost production from 2026 with the launch of more than a dozen new models through 2032, according to the Stellantis media office. New models include a new Fiat Pandina city car in Pomigliano d’Arco near Naples from 2028, while Mirafiori in Turin will be the basis of production for the 500 city car with both hybrid and full-electric powertrains. Melfi and Cassino in southern Italy will get new hybrid vehicles, including a new Jeep Compass and Alfa Romeo Giulia. 'I won’t hide that 2025 will be a hard year, but all of the factories in Italy will be active,' Imparato told a news conference after the meeting, which also included unions, regional officials and industry representatives. Economic Development Minister Adolfo Urso said that one reason for production lulls are new European rules that come into effect Jan. 1 that one-fifth of cars being produced must be electric vehicles, or face stiff fines. He called for the rules to be changed. Plants in Italy have been cycling through short-term layoff programs because of lagging sales, especially of electric vehicles. While unions welcomed the announcements, they remained skeptical that they would lead to a turnaround. They said the layoff schemes were likely to continue through next year. 'There are not the conditions to say that we have entered a new phase,'' said Rocco Palombella, head of the Uilm union. 'Perhaps a new phase in industrial relations, but not a new phase guaranteeing factories, or to say the situation will improve from tomorrow.'	https://apnews.com/article/italy-stellantis-production-be5847c3e34e1a4cbf792ca2d63f64bb	2024-12-17T09:33:22-08:00	
Russian opposition figure says fears of his mother's poisoning in Berlin proved false	BERLIN (AP) — A prominent Russian opposition politician freed as part of the largest East-West civilian prisoner swap since the Cold War said Tuesday that fears of his mother's poisoning in Berlin have proven false. Vladimir Kara-Murza, a dual Russian-U.K. citizen and one of the leading Russian opposition figures, said that the worries that his mother could have been poisoned or suffered a heart attack haven't been corroborated. He added that she remains in a Berlin hospital where she continues to undergo examination. 'My mom is indeed in a hospital in Berlin, but suspicions of poisoning or a heart attack haven't been confirmed, thank God,' he said on the messaging app Telegram. Kara-Murza was arrested in 2022 after criticizing the war in Ukraine that had begun weeks earlier. He was convicted in 2023 of treason and other charges, and sentenced to 25 years in prison in a case he called politically motivated. He fell ill in 2015 and 2017 from two near-fatal poisonings he blamed on the Kremlin. Kara-Murza was among 16 prisoners that Russia and its ally Belarus released in an August swap — Americans, Germans and Russian dissidents, most of whom were imprisoned on charges widely seen as politically motivated. Those freed in the historic exchange included journalists Evan Gershkovich and Alsu Kurmasheva and former U.S. Marine Paul Whelan. Moscow in return got eight Russians jailed in the West for spying, hacking computers and even a brazen daylight murder. The deal took a long time to negotiate, and officials were discussing a possible swap that would involve Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny just before his sudden and unexplained death in an Arctic penal colony in February. Navalny's family and his allies blamed his death on the Kremlin, accusations it has rejected. Navalny had been jailed since January 2021, when he returned to Moscow after recuperating in Germany from nerve agent poisoning he blamed on the Kremlin. The Kremlin vehemently denied it was behind the poisoning. Last month, Kara-Murza, who was awarded the Pulitzer Prize this year, was among opposition figures who organized a march of at least 1,000 people in central Berlin who rallied against Russian President Vladimir Putin and his war in Ukraine. German police said earlier Tuesday that a German-Russian woman was taken to an isolation ward at the German capital's Charite hospital after informing medical staff that she suspected she had been poisoned. Police, which didn't identify the woman, said the woman was taken to the ward at Charite after voicing her suspicion to staff at a clinic. They said that blood tests for 'all kinds of poisonous substances' were being conducted. They said they were investigating a possible attempted killing, and that all necessary measures were being taken to find any possible suspects.	https://apnews.com/article/germany-russia-suspected-poisoning-hospital-ab768dcfa89541ae204dbf6a1b368e39	2024-12-17T09:15:25-08:00	
Pharrell Williams is named a UNESCO goodwill ambassador	PARIS (AP) — Pop star and fashion designer Pharrell Williams was named UNESCO’s goodwill ambassador for artistic education and entrepreneurship on Tuesday in Paris, continuing his cultural dominance of the French capital as Louis Vuitton menswear artistic director and performer at Notre Dame Cathedral’s reopening earlier this month. Williams said he hoped to 'deepen that sense of unity and togetherness' in work that 'evens the odds for marginalized communities.' He also spoke about his impoverished youth, adding: 'Growing up in Virginia, never in my wildest dreams did I think I would be given an opportunity like this one.' The role of goodwill ambassador for the Paris-based U.N. cultural agency involves promoting its initiatives that include protecting Indigenous cultures, advancing education and health care for women, raising awareness about genocide prevention and safeguarding cultural heritage. The U.N. agency said Williams will be 'a mentor and role model for young creators, particularly in Africa, where UNESCO supports the development of cultural industries.' Williams joins a list of goodwill ambassadors that includes U.S. jazz musician Herbie Hancock, Brazilian artist Vik Muniz and Japanese filmmaker Naomi Kawase. Williams has been particularly visible in Paris this year. Shortly before the Paris Olympics, his role as Louis Vuitton menswear designer took center stage during a star-studded event at UNESCO’s headquarters. The show, celebrating the beauty of human skin, featured models wearing garments in shades representing the diverse hues of humanity. UNESCO leaders hope that Williams' global influence and deep connections to fashion and music will draw fresh attention to the agency’s work. Williams is American, and his selection as goodwill ambassador also may be highlighting the readmission of the United States to UNESCO last year. The U.S. exit under President Donald Trump cited alleged anti-Israel bias within the agency. The decision followed a 2011 decision by UNESCO to include Palestine as a member state, which led the U.S. and Israel to cease financing for the agency. The U.S. return under President Joe Biden was marked by a flag-raising ceremony attended by U.S. First Lady Jill Biden.	https://apnews.com/article/pharrell-williams-unesco-goodwill-ambassador-1f6d37964aa8aea7dd9425f62d44101e	2024-12-17T09:08:21-08:00	
Lawsuit accuses State Department of creating loopholes for Israel on military aid and human rights	WASHINGTON (AP) — The State Department has carved out exceptions for close ally Israel that block a U.S. law restricting foreign military support over human rights abuses, a lawsuit from a group of Palestinians in Gaza and American relatives asserted Tuesday. Former State Department officials and crafters of the 1997 Leahy law were among those advising and backing the lawsuit. The lawsuit details the barriers that it accuses the State Department of creating on Israel's behalf to skirt enforcement and asks courts to intervene. That is after campus protests and moves by some lawmakers failed in their goal of limiting U.S. military support to Israel over civilian deaths in Gaza during the war with Hamas. 'It's really a modest set of goals here: There's a U.S. law. We'd like the federal government to adhere to U.S. law,' said Ahmed Moor, a Philadelphia-based Palestinian American who joined the lawsuit on behalf of cousins, uncles and aunts displaced and killed in the 14-month war. The law bars U.S. military assistance to foreign military units when there is credible evidence of gross human rights abuses. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has denied that the department has given Israel a pass. 'Do we have a double standard? The answer is no,' he said in April. The State and Justice departments declined to comment Tuesday. Israel says it makes every effort to limit harm to Palestinian civilians in its military operations. The Biden administration has warned Israel to do more to spare civilians in the Gaza war, holding back one known weapons shipment of 2,000-pound bombs. A State Department report in May concluded there was 'reasonable' evidence that Israel's use of U.S.-provided weapons in Gaza violated international law that protects civilians but bypassed a decision on limiting arms, saying the war itself made it impossible for U.S. officials to judge for certain. It also declined last month to hold back arms transfers as it had threatened over humanitarian aid to Gaza. Charles Blaha, a former State Department official who helped oversee reviews under the Leahy law, argued that enforcing the law for Israel would have prevented much of the harm that civilians in Gaza are suffering. 'The secretary of state has made all the decisions so far on Israel and the Leahy law, and every single decision has resulted in those units being eligible' for continued U.S. military support, Blaha said. 'And that’s not the way the normal process works.' U.S. military support to Israel in the light of Palestinian civilian deaths was a fraught issue in the presidential election. Republicans and many Democrats demanded unwavering military backing to Israel. The Biden administration's refusal to limit support cost Democrats some votes from some Arab and Muslim voters and others. Tuesday's lawsuit is part of a last push on the outgoing Biden administration by Muslim Americans and others to limit U.S. military support to Israel, which is estimated to have reached $17.9 billion in the first year of the war — over its treatment of Palestinian civilians. Two former Senate staffers, Tim Reiser and Stephen Rickard, were instrumental in crafting the law named for former Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy and said the rising death toll in Gaza warranted the court case. The nonprofit Democracy for the Arab World Now, an Arab-rights group founded by slain Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, helped bring the lawsuit for five Palestinians and Palestinian Americans. The plaintiffs include a former Gaza math teacher and humanitarian worker now living in a tent after losing 20 family members and being uprooted seven times. Hamas militants began the war with an Oct. 7, 2023, attack in Israel, killing about 1,200 people and taking some 250 hostages, some of whom are still being held. The Gaza health ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians in its death tolls, said the war has killed 45,000 Palestinians. The lawsuit was filed under the Administrative Procedures Act. Groups ranging from immigration advocates, Medicare groups, petroleum giants and fishermen have used the law in the past to try to shape how U.S. public agencies enforce laws. It accuses State Department officials under President Joe Biden of creating a series of high barriers when vetting Israel's military for Leahy law violations. Former State officials, including Blaha, have accused the U.S. of effectively exempting Israel from enforcement, and the lawsuit offers some details for the first time. It claims obstacles include setting up a multimember committee from the State and Defense departments in 2020 solely to consider possible violations by the Israeli military and uniquely requiring the deputy secretary of state to sign off on any findings of violations. The process also carves out an additional loophole for Israel, the lawsuit says, giving its government alone a chance to stave off a restriction of military support over a human rights abuses by showing it has addressed the problem. The State Department used that exception in August, saying it had decided against cutting off aid to an Israeli military unit in the West Bank over grave human rights abuses because it removed two responsible soldiers from combat and committed to special training and oversight of remaining members. The unit was accused in the death of a 79-year-old Palestinian American man it had taken into custody. On Monday, Blinken met at the State Department with the family of another American, 26-year-old Seattle resident Aysenur Ezgi Eygi, who was shot and killed after taking part in a demonstration in the West Bank in September. Blinken told the family that Israel had recently informed the U.S. it was wrapping up its investigation of her death, Miller said Monday. State officials in the 50-minute meeting 'kept repeating this frankly kind of bogus claim of it being an accident,' widower Hamid Ali said after the meeting. U.S. officials told the family they did not yet know enough details to say whether the family's demands for an independent U.S. criminal investigation were warranted, Ali said.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-military-aid-gaza-us-biden-leahy-law-3fe632e1ef524656b7a201bc4c1651a2	2024-12-17T08:19:16-08:00	
The killing of a Russian general is one of several that Moscow blames on Ukraine	Ukraine’s Security Service, or SBU, has claimed responsibility for killing Lt. General Igor Kirillov, head of the military’s nuclear, biological and chemical protection forces, in a bombing Tuesday in Moscow. Kirillov, 54, was killed alongside his assistant, Ilya Polikarpov, when a bomb planted on a scooter exploded outside an apartment block. An official with the SBU said the agency was behind the attack. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to release the information, described Kirillov as a 'war criminal and an entirely legitimate target.' On Monday, Kirillov was charged in absentia by the SBU for 'ordering the use of banned chemical weapons against Ukraine’s Defense Forces.' Russia has accused Ukraine of carrying out other high-profile attacks throughout the nearly 3-year-old war. Kyiv has hinted at its involvement but Ukrainian officials have stopped short of publicly claiming responsibility. Other high-profile attacks that Russia has blamed on Ukraine: Darya Dugina TV commentator Darya Dugina, 29, was killed in August 2022 when a remote-controlled bomb planted in her SUV blew up as she drove on Moscow's outskirts. Her father, Alexander Dugin, was widely believed to be the intended target. The philosopher, writer and political theorist is an ardent supporter of the war and a prominent proponent of the ideology that emphasizes traditional values, the restoration of Russia’s power and the unity of all ethnic Russians. Ukraine denied responsibility for the attack, with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy saying Dugina is 'not our responsibility. She is not a citizen of our country. We are not interested in her.' Russia’s Federal Security Agency, the FSB, publicly identified two suspects, Ukrainian citizens. Vladlen Tatarsky Military blogger Vladlen Tatarsky was killed in April 2023 when a bomb tore through a cafe in central St Petersburg where he had been speaking. Tatarsky, 40, supported the war in Ukraine and filed regular reports from the front for his Telegram followers. Born in the Donbas region, Ukraine’s industrial heartland, the former coal miner was convicted of bank robbery and escaped after a Russia-backed separatist rebellion engulfed the region in 2014. He joined the rebels and fought on the front line before turning to blogging. Darya Trepova, 26, was convicted of the bombing and sentenced to 27 years in prison after she was seen on camera presenting a small statue to Tatarsky that exploded shortly afterward. Trepova testified she didn’t know the gift contained a bomb. Zakhar Prilepin Nationalist Russian writer Zakhar Prilepin narrowly avoided death in a car bombing in Russia’s Nizhny Novgorod region in May 2023. His driver was killed, while Prilepin was hospitalized with broken bones, bruised lungs and other injuries. Prilepin, known for support of the war, was sanctioned by the European Union. A Ukrainian, Alexander Permyakov, was found guilty of the attack in a Russian court and sentenced to life imprisonment. Russia’s Investigative Committee accused him of working under orders from Kyiv. Stanislav Rzhitsky Former submarine commander Stanislav Rzhitsky was gunned down in July 2023 while jogging in Krasnodar, Russia. Ukrainian media reported that Rzhitsky was one of six submarine commanders able to launch the long-range missiles that hit Vinnytsia, Ukraine, a year earlier, killing 23 people and wounding over 100. When he died, Rzhitsky was deputy head of a military mobilization office in Krasnodar. Russian media outlets reported that the 42-year-old regularly used a fitness app that could have been used to track his movements, Kyrylo Budanov, head of the Ukrainian Defense Ministry’s main intelligence directorate, denied Kyiv's involvement in the death. However, the agency also released details about the killing, including the time of the attack and the number of shots fired. A 64-year-old Ukrainian-born man, Sergei Denisenko, was later arrested. Illia Kyva Illia Kyva, a Ukrainian lawmaker who fled to Russia shortly after the full-scale invasion, was found dead near Moscow in December 2023 with a gunshot wound to the head. A controversial political figure in Ukraine before the war, Kyva, 46, often appeared on pro-Kremlin TV talk shows and discussions. A month before his death, a Ukrainian court found him guilty in absentia of treason and sentenced him to 14 years in prison. Andriy Yusov, a spokesman for Ukraine’s military intelligence, said after Kyva’s death that 'the same fate will befall other traitors of Ukraine.' He did not say who was behind the killing. Russia’s state Investigative Committee opened a probe, but no charges have been made. Sergei Yevsyukov Sergei Yevsyukov, the former head of a prison that housed Ukrainian POWs, was killed Dec. 9 after a bomb exploded under a car in the Russian-occupied city of Donetsk, Ukrainian media reported. One other person was injured in the blast. Yevsyukov had run the Olenivka Prison, where dozens of POWs died in a missile strike in July 2022. He later was charged in absentia by Ukrainian authorities with 'mass torture.' Russian authorities said Saturday they had detained a suspect in the attack. Mikhail Shatsky Ukrainian media reported Dec. 12 that Russian missile designer Mikhail Shatsky was gunned down in a suburban Moscow park. Shatsky worked at the Moscow Experimental Design Bureau Mars, where he reportedly oversaw the modernization of cruise missiles. Several Ukrainian media outlets reported that Shatsky had been shot while walking in the Kuzminsky forest, near his home. Russian news media reported on a disturbance in the same area on the day of Shatsky’s reported death, but did not elaborate.	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-killings-bomb-shooting-f456551684132c9ccee1420df8b9b282	2024-12-17T08:15:48-08:00	
Netanyahu says Israeli troops will occupy a buffer zone inside Syria for the foreseeable future	JERUSALEM (AP) — Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Tuesday that Israeli forces will stay in a buffer zone on the Syrian border, seized after the ouster of Syria's President Bashar Assad, until another arrangement is in place 'that ensures Israel's security.' Netanyahu made the comments from the summit of Mount Hermon — the highest peak in the area — inside Syria, about 10 kilometers (6 miles) from the border with the Israel-held Golan Heights. It appeared to be the first time a sitting Israeli leader had set foot that far into Syria. Netanyahu said he had been on the same mountaintop 53 years ago as a soldier, but the summit’s importance to Israel’s security has only increased given recent events. Israel seized a swath of southern Syria along the border with the Israeli-annexed Golan Heights days after Assad was ousted by rebels last week. Israel’s capture of the buffer zone, a roughly 400-square-kilometer (155-square-mile) demilitarized area in Syrian territory, has sparked condemnation, with critics accusing Israel of violating a 1974 ceasefire and possibly exploiting the chaos in Syria in the wake of Assad's ouster to make a land grab. 'We will stay ... until another arrangement is found that ensures Israel’s security,' said Netanyahu who had traveled to the buffer zone on Tuesday with Defense Minister Israel Katz. Katz said he instructed the Israeli military to quickly establish a presence, including fortifications, in anticipation of what could be an extended stay in the area. 'The summit of the Hermon is the eyes of the state of Israel to identify our enemies who are nearby and far away,' he said. An Israeli military official, who spoke on condition of anonymity in line with military regulations, said there is no plan to evacuate the Syrians living in villages within the buffer zone. The buffer zone between Syria and the Israeli-controlled Golan Heights was created by the U.N. after the 1973 Mideast war. A U.N. force of about 1,100 troops had patrolled the area since then. A U.N. spokesman said Tuesday that the advance of Israeli troops, however long it lasts, violates the 1974 deal that set up the buffer zone. That agreement 'needs to be respected, and occupation is occupation, whether it lasts a week, a month or a year, it remains occupation,' spokesman Stephane Dujarric said. There was no immediate comment from Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the insurgent group that led the ouster of Assad, or from Arab states. Israel still controls the Golan Heights, which it captured from Syria during the 1967 Mideast war and later annexed — a move not recognized by most of the international community. Mount Hermon's summit is divided between the Israeli-annexed Golan Heights, Lebanon, and Syria. Only the United States recognizes Israel’s control of the Golan Heights. With Assad gone, a top U.N. official said Tuesday that militant leaders who have taken over Syria have committed to 'an ambitious scaling-up of vital humanitarian support' for millions in desperate need of food and other aid. The leader of the insurgent HTS — Ahmad al-Sharaa, formerly known as Mohammed al-Golani — and the country's caretaker prime minister, Mohammed al-Bashir, pledged to support the movement of aid from Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan and other neighboring countries 'for as long as humanitarian operations are required,' said Tom Fletcher. Fletcher, who heads the the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, known as OCHA, spoke to the U.N. Security Council members from Damascus via a video link. Germany said Tuesday that its diplomats had also met with insurgent leaders to discuss Syria's political transition and 'our expectations regarding the protection of minorities and women’s rights.' German officials, who have noted the rebel group's history of links to al-Qaida, said they will measure the group and the new government based on its actions. The United States has previously said that its officials have been in direct contact with HTS insurgents who ousted Assad. In other developments, bodies of more than 30 Syrians who vanished under Assad's rule were uncovered in a mass grave on Monday. Forensic teams and rebels worked together to unearth the remains in the village of Izraa, north of the city of Daraa, as families of the missing stood by. The relatives said they had initially hoped to find their loved ones in prison. 'But we didn’t find anyone and it broke our hearts. They were burned alive here after being doused in fuel,' said Mohammad Ghazaleh, who was waiting at the mass grave site. Some of the bodies recovered showed evidence that they had been shot in the head or burned, said Moussa Al-Zouebi, head of Izraa’s health directorate. Syria's new authorities have set up a hotline for reporting missing persons and secret detention sites. In the Syrian capital of Damascus, Qatar officially reopened its embassy on Tuesday — nearly 13 years after it severed diplomatic relations with Assad's government. Qatar had reaffirmed its 'categorical rejection of the regime’s repressive policies against the Syrian people' in a statement earlier. Most foreign embassies in Syria have been shut down since after the country’s civil war erupted in 2011. The French Embassy in Damascus raised its flag Tuesday in a 'symbolic gesture' to show support for the Syrian people during the transition. It's reopening is pending ongoing evaluation of political and security conditions, French Foreign Minister French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot said. The Turkish Embassy in Damascus also recently reopened. ___ Associated Press writer Edith M.

Filipina who won a last-minute reprieve from the Indonesian firing squad in 2015 is to return home	JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) — Indonesian authorities were set to return a Filipina woman to the Philippines after midnight, who was on death row in Indonesia and was nearly executed by firing squad in 2015, under an arrangement between the two countries. Mary Jane Fiesta Veloso — who spent almost 15 years in an Indonesian prison for drug trafficking — won a last-minute reprieve that will lead to her testimony exposing how a criminal syndicate duped her into being an unwitting accomplice and drug courier. Veloso was moved late Sunday to a female prison in Indonesia’s capital of Jakarta, from where she has been flown back to the Philippines. She was escorted to Soekarno-Hatta International Airport on Tuesday night for a flight to Manila. Her repatriation was made possible by a 'practical arrangement' for the transfer of prisoners signed between the two countries on Dec. 6, after a longstanding request from Manila. Veloso told a group of reporters outside the Pondok Bambu female prison in eastern Jakarta, that she was overwhelmed by a variety of emotions, before getting into the car that took her to the airport. She thanked Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto and his government for sending her back home to serve her sentence in her country, 'So, I can be closer to my children and family.' 'Thank you, Indonesia, I love Indonesia,' Veloso said. She said that she brought many souvenirs given by her Indonesian fellow inmates and friends, including a guitar, books, knittings and rosaries. Veloso, who will turn 40 next month, was arrested in 2010 at an airport in the Indonesian city of Yogyakarta, where officials discovered about 2.6 kilograms (5.7 pounds) of heroin hidden in her luggage. The single mother of two sons was convicted and sentenced to death. Her case caused a public outcry in the Philippines. She traveled to Indonesia in 2010, where her recruiter, Maria Kristina Sergio, reportedly told her a job as a domestic worker awaited her. Sergio also allegedly provided the suitcase where the drugs were found. In 2015, Indonesia moved Veloso to an island prison where she and eight other drug convicts were scheduled to be executed by firing squad despite objections from their home countries Australia, Brazil, France, Ghana and Nigeria. Indonesia executed the eight but Veloso was granted a stay of execution because Sergio was arrested in the Philippines, just two days earlier. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime says Indonesia is a major drug smuggling hub despite having some of the strictest drug laws in the world, in part because international drug syndicates target its young population. Indonesia’s last executions of one of its citizens and three foreigners were carried out in July 2016. About 530 people are on death row in Indonesia, mostly for drug-related crimes, including 96 foreigners, the Ministry of Immigration and Corrections’ data showed last month. Five Australians who spent almost 20 years in Indonesian prisons for heroin trafficking returned to Australia Sunday under a deal struck between the Indonesian and Australian governments. ___ Associated Press journalist Achmad Ibrahim in Jakarta, Indonesia, contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/indonesia-philippines-mary-jane-veloso-prison-transfer-b39862f49d73c51b31153717950ffcf5	2024-12-17T06:31:28-08:00	
Russian lawmakers approve a bill that could remove the terrorist designation for the Taliban	MOSCOW (AP) — The lower house of Russia's parliament on Tuesday approved a bill that would set the stage for Moscow to remove the designation of the Taliban in Afghanistan as a terrorist group. Under the bill passed by the State Duma in the second and third readings, the official terrorist designation of an organization could be suspended by a court. The legislation still needs to be approved by the upper house and signed by President Vladimir Putin to become law. The Taliban were put on Russia’s list of terrorist organizations in 2003, and any contact with such groups is punishable under Russian law. At the same time, Taliban delegations attended various forums hosted by Moscow. Russian officials have shrugged off questions about the seeming contradiction by emphasizing the need to engage the Taliban to help stabilize Afghanistan. The Soviet Union fought a 10-year war in Afghanistan that ended with Moscow withdrawing its troops in 1989. Since then, Moscow has made a diplomatic comeback as a power broker, hosting talks on Afghanistan involving senior representatives of the Taliban and neighboring nations. There is a deepening divide in the international community on how to deal with the Taliban, who have been in power for three years and face no internal or external opposition. Afghanistan’s rulers have pursued bilateral ties with major regional powers.	https://apnews.com/article/russia-taliban-parliament-bill-afghanistan-extremism-82938ed13e0930f81f7be95512e25ce0	2024-12-17T05:43:07-08:00	
Bluey' is bound for the big screen with a feature film coming in 2027	NEW YORK (AP) — 'Bluey' is heading to the big screen. The Walt Disney Co. and BBC Studios announced Tuesday that a film based on the hit Australian animated series will arrive in theaters in 2027. The movie will be written and directed by series creator Joe Brumm, with a voice cast led by the series' regulars, including Melanie Zanetti and David McCormack. According to the companies, the CGI-animated film will 'continue the adventures of Bluey, a lovable, inexhaustible, blue heeler dog, who lives with her Mum, Dad and her little sister, Bingo.' 'I’ve always thought ‘Bluey’ deserved a theatrical movie,' Brumm said in a statement. 'I want this to be an experiential event for the whole family to enjoy together.' After Brumm launched the Australian production in 2018, the series has grown into a worldwide sensation and was the most-watched series globally on Disney+ in 2024. 'Since its debut on Disney Jr. and Disney+, Bluey has become a global phenomenon, uniting families everywhere with its heartfelt stories of play, imagination and connection,' said Dana Walden and Alan Bergman, Disney Entertainment co-chairs.	https://apnews.com/article/bluey-movie-disney-ff83a5a48aa29a7a5f6270b4cb45ca5e	2024-12-17T05:41:57-08:00	
Germany's election contenders set out contrasting plans to revive the economy, reduce migration	BERLIN (AP) — Leading contenders in Germany's upcoming election presented their programs on Tuesday, setting out contrasting visions of how to put new vigor into Europe's biggest economy and tackle other issues such as migration. Chancellor Olaf Scholz, a center-left Social Democrat, will seek a second term in the parliamentary election expected on Feb. 23 — more than three months after his unpopular three-party coalition collapsed in a dispute about how to revive the stagnant economy. He hopes for a come-from-behind victory against center-right challenger Friedrich Merz, whose Union bloc leads all recent polls. Also seeking the top job are Vice Chancellor Robert Habeck of the environmentalist Greens, Scholz's remaining coalition partner; and Alice Weidel of the far-right Alternative for Germany, which is polling strongly but has no realistic chance of governing because other parties refuse to work with it. The Social Democrats, Union and Greens all hope to implement as much as they can of their programs presented Tuesday, but any new government will almost certainly be a coalition and require extensive compromises. It's the economy ... The Union is pledging tax cuts for individuals and companies and wants to raise the level at which the highest level of income tax, 42%, kicks in. It wants to make working overtime more financially attractive. It also wants to abolish a tax once paid by everyone to finance the costs of integrating the former East Germany, now levied only on higher earners. It hopes to free up money by reforming the benefit system for the long-term unemployed and getting more people into jobs. It also wants to cut the value-added tax rate on dining out. Scholz's Social Democrats pledge a lower income tax burden for 95% of earners. They want to reduce value-added tax on groceries. The Social Democrats and Greens want to increase the national minimum wage, which will be 12.82 euros ($13.47) per hour on election day, to 15 euros — reprising an issue both parties campaigned on in 2021. Scholz's party wants a 'made in Germany bonus' to encourage investment in new plants and equipment. It also wants to set up a 'Germany fund' to invest public and private money in energy networks, innovative companies and building new homes. The Greens propose something similar to finance spending on infrastructure and want the 'super-rich' to make a bigger contribution, for example to help finance education. All the contenders have proposals to reduce electricity prices. To borrow or not to borrow The Social Democrats and Greens want to reform Germany's self-imposed restrictions on borrowing — the 'debt brake,' introduced more than a decade ago, which allows new borrowing to the tune of only 0.35% of annual gross domestic product, though it can be suspended for emergencies that are out of the state's control. The two center-left parties, which are vague about how exactly they would modify it, argue that it has become a barrier to investment. The 'debt brake' played a part in the collapse of Scholz's coalition in November. The chancellor's former coalition partners, the pro-business Free Democrats, insisted on upholding it strictly. The Union wants to hang on to it, arguing that it already has proven its flexibility in times of crisis and prevents Germany from burdening future generations with debt. But Merz has signaled that he might eventually be open to a future reform. Migration The Union wants Germany to turn back at its border migrants trying to enter from other countries in Europe's free travel zone and seek asylum. It wants to increase deportations of migrants who aren't entitled to stay and designate more 'safe countries of origin,' allowing authorities to speed up asylum proceedings. It is pledging to reverse legislation approved under Scholz that eased the rules on gaining citizenship and ended restrictions on holding dual citizenship. The Social Democrats argue that measures the government has taken, including border controls, are already reducing irregular migration significantly. The Greens want a 'fair' and 'binding' distribution of asylum-seekers in Europe. And what about Ukraine? Germany is Ukraine's top military supplier in Europe and its biggest after the United States. All three leading contenders pledge continued aid, but there are differences of emphasis. Scholz says he wants Germany to remain the biggest supplier in Europe but is touting his 'prudence' in ensuring that the war doesn't expand into a conflict between Russia and NATO and underlining his insistence that he won't supply long-range Taurus cruise missiles to Kyiv. The Union and the Greens have been more open to sending the long-range missiles. The Union wants to set up a 'contact group' with France, Poland and the U.K. to consult with the United States on a strategy to support Ukraine and provide 'credible security guarantees.' Current polls suggest it's likely that at least two of the Union, Social Democrats and Greens will end up having to govern together. 'We want to become so strong in this election ... that others have to ask themselves whether they are prepared to work together with us, and we aren't the ones who have to adapt to others and run after them,' Merz said Tuesday.	https://apnews.com/article/germany-election-scholz-merz-habeck-programs-69a8ab1bdef26764f4f10789b081ef39	2024-12-17T05:32:27-08:00	
Father and stepmother sentenced to life in prison for the murder of a 10-year-old girl in England	LONDON (AP) — The father and stepmother of a severely abused 10-year-old girl found dead in her home in England were sentenced Tuesday to life in prison for murder. Urfan Sharif, 42, and Beinash Batool, 30, were convicted of murder last week in her death in what prosecutors called a 'campaign of abuse.' The girl's uncle, Faisal Malik, 29, was found guilty of causing or allowing the girl’s death. He was sentenced to 16 years in prison. After the girl died, the three fled to Pakistan, where Urfan Sharif phoned U.K. police to say he 'legally punished her, and she died,' prosecutors said. He said he 'beat her up too much' but didn't intend to kill her. Police in London then went to the family's home and discovered Sara’s body under a blanket in a bunk bed on Aug. 10, 2023. The three returned to Britain more than a month after they fled and were arrested on suspicion of murder. The trial in the Central Criminal Court exposed horrific details of abuse that included more than 70 fresh injuries and many older ones, including bruising, burns, fractures and bite marks and raised questions about failures by social services and authorities to intervene and protect her. 'Sara’s death was the culmination of years of neglect, frequent assaults and what can only be described as the torture of this small child,' Justice John Cavanagh said. 'The degree of cruelty is almost inconceivable. ... None of you have shown a shred of true remorse.' Politicians and other officials have called for a review of what went wrong and urged reforms to prevent a repeat of such cases. 'Her death is a heartbreaking reminder of the profound weaknesses in our child protection system that, as a country, we have failed time and time again to correct,' Rachel de Souza, children’s commissioner for England, said in a statement after the trial. 'We have been here before — and each time we have said ‘never again.’' Following the trial, family court records were released showing that Urfan Sharif and his former wife, Olga Sharif, had been on the social services' radar three years before Sara Sharif was born. The father and stepmother got custody of Sara and her older brother after reports that their mother abused them. Despite accusations that Urfan Sharif was physically abusing his children, the accusations were never tested in court. Surrey County Council, which raised repeated concerns that Sara was likely to be physically and emotionally abused by her parents, plans to review the circumstances of her death. Child services had investigated after her school reported Sara was bruised but the agency took no further action. Her father later took her out of school to prevent authorities from discovering the abuse, the judge said. She was not schooled at home. Olga Sharif called her daughter’s killers cowards, sadists and executioners, in a statement read by a prosecutor. 'I can’t understand how someone can be such a sadist to a child,' she said. 'She is now an angel who looks down on us from heaven, she is no longer experiencing violence.' During the trial, Sharif initially blamed Batool for Sara’s death but later told jurors he took 'full responsibility.' He admitted throttling her with his hands and battering her with a cricket bat and other objects. The prosecution said the violence became so normalized that no one reacted when she appeared with bruises at a family barbecue. Her parents made her wear a hijab — not for religious reasons but to 'cover up the bruises that were all over Sara’s body,' Cavanagh said. Sara was described as feisty and dreamed of being a fairy tale princess. Her spirit came across in a video taken two days before her death showing her dancing at home, despite multiple broken bones and iron burns on her bottom. 'Despite everything, she smiled at the camera,' the judge noted.	https://apnews.com/article/sara-sharif-uk-pakistan-murder-ccae590bef7cb52f4f4d658a2527a110	2024-12-17T04:08:45-08:00	
Anti-whaling activist Paul Watson is released after 5 months in a Greenland prison	LONDON (AP) — Anti-whaling activist Paul Watson was freed from prison in Greenland on Tuesday and will not be extradited to Japan after five months in custody. He is planning to return home to be reunited with his family during the festive season, he told The Associated Press upon his release. 'I’m certainly quite relieved,' Watson, 74, said during a video interview from Nuuk, Greenland's capital. 'This gives me an opportunity to return home to my two children before Christmas.' Japan had asked Denmark to extradite Watson, who had been in custody in Greenland since his arrest under a Japanese warrant. There was no immediate comment from the Japanese Embassy in Copenhagen. Watson's foundation said he faced a maximum sentence of 15 years in prison in Japan, which does not have an extradition treaty with Denmark. On his way back to France, where he has settled, Watson said he will be careful not to be caught again. 'I have to make sure that I don’t land in Iceland or another country where Interpol might try to have me arrested again,' he said. 'Apparently, the red notice is still there,' he added, in a reference to the system which flags people deemed fugitives to law enforcement worldwide and is one of the crime-fighting organization's most important tools. The Canadian-American citizen is a former head of the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, whose high seas confrontations with whaling vessels have drawn support from celebrities and featured in the reality television series 'Whale Wars.' Japan’s coast guard had sought his arrest over an encounter with a Japanese whaling research ship in 2010 when he was accused of obstructing the crew’s official duties by ordering the captain of his ship to throw explosives at the whaling ship. Watson denied the accusation. 'Well, it’s a total fabrication. We never used explosives. Ever. We did use stink bombs, which are quite harmless,' he said. Watson was subject to an Interpol red notice, and the captain — a New Zealand citizen — was convicted of assault and given a suspended prison term, which allowed him to leave Japan. Watson was arrested on July 21 when his ship docked in Nuuk, Greenland’s capital. Japan had asked Denmark to hand over Watson so he could be tried in Japan. Greenland is an autonomous territory of Denmark. 'I think it all backfired on Japan, because this has put enormous focus on Japan’s continued illegal whaling operations,' Watson said. 'So my time here for five months has actually served a purpose. It’s been an opportunity to continue to expose Japan’s illegal whaling activities.' The Danish Justice Ministry said in a statement that the conditions for extradition were met, but it had not received adequate guarantees from Japanese authorities that the time Watson had already served in custody would be counted against any sentence he would receive in Japan. Watson left Sea Shepherd in 2022 to set up his foundation, which alleged at the time of his arrest that the action was politically motivated — and called for his release. He was detained in Germany in 2012 on a Costa Rican extradition warrant but skipped bail after learning that he was also sought for extradition by Japan, which has accused him of endangering whalers’ lives during his operations in the Antarctic Ocean. He has since lived in countries including France and the United States. He pledged to continue fighting. 'I’ve had five months of not really doing much, so I’m not really tired,' he said. 'But we have a ship, being prepared, to oppose Icelandic whaling operations in June next year. And we have a ship in Australia that is ready to intervene against Japan if they return to the Southern Ocean whale sanctuary. So we’re prepared to take action when we need to.' Japan's says whale meat is part of its food culture and that it supports sustainable use of whales. Japan withdrew from the International Whaling Commission in 2019 and has since resumed commercial whaling within its exclusive economic zone. 'Whaling only continues to exist in Japan through massive subsidies,' Watson claimed. 'In fact, $30 million from the tsunami relief fund was channeled into the whaling industry after 2011. So, you know, this does not benefit the Japanese people at all in any way, shape or form. In fact, what it is is an embarrassment to the Japanese people.' ___ Associated Press Writers Jamey Keaten and David Keyton contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/denmark-paul-watson-extradition-release-7e84fd63fb5cbfcdff21f6e575d9ba5f	2024-12-17T03:25:57-08:00	
From water destruction to deadly heat, Associated Press photographers capture climate change in 2024	After heat records were smashed and a torrent of extreme weather events rocked countless countries in 2023, some climate scientists believed that the waning of the El Nino weather pattern could mean 2024 would be slightly cooler. It didn’t happen that way. This year is expected to break 2023’s global average temperature record and the effects of the warming — more powerful hurricanes, floods, wildfires and suffocating heat — have upended lives and livelihoods. All year, Associated Press photographers around the globe have captured moments, from the brutality unleashed during extreme weather events to human resilience in the face of hardship, that tell the story of a changing Earth. January: Experiencing a changing world As seas rise, salty ocean water of the Pacific encroaches on Vietnam’s Mekong Delta, hurting agriculture and the farmers and sellers who rely on it. Life for those on the Mekong now – paddling across markets and working and sleeping from houseboats – is quickly being altered. In Tahiti, the arrival of the Paris Olympics this year meant giant structures were built on one of their most precious reefs. The reefs sustain the life of sea creatures and in turn, the people of the island. February: Farming against tougher odds In many parts of the world, there were impacts when agriculture intersected with climate change. In Spain and other European countries, farmers were upset over increasing energy and fertilizer costs, cheaper farm imports entering the European Union and pesticide regulations, arguing all these changes could force them out of business. In Kenya, access to water continued to be a struggle for many, while fishers off the Indian coast of Mumbai had to contend with a rapidly warming Arabian Sea. There were bright spots, however, such as the increasing use of natural farming techniques that are more resistant to climate shocks. March: Struggling to get water More than 2 billion people around the world don’t have access to safely managed drinking water, according to the United Nations, a grim reality experienced in so many places. In Brazil, some residents collected water as it came down a mountain, while in India others filled up jugs from a street drain. Drinking from such sources can lead to many waterborne illnesses. April: Fighting to thrive For the Ojibwe tribe in the United States, spearfishing is an important tradition, one they maintained this year in the face of climate change. At the same time, in other parts of the world the impact of climate change was so severe that simply surviving was the best hope. Such was the case in Kenya, where floods took lives and forced many to evacuate, and in an Indian village where flooding is so constant that residents are constantly displaced. May: Getting forced from home When heavy rains led to massive flooding in Uruguay and Brazil, residents were forced from their homes. In both of these places, most people likely returned and were able to rebuild their lives. In other places, there was no going back. Such was the case for Quinault Indian Nation in the U.S., in the process of being relocated inland as coastal erosion threaten their homes. The Gardi Sugdub island off the coast of Panama faced a similar fate — hundreds of families are relocating to the mainland as sea levels rise. June: Suffering from heat From Mexico to Pakistan and beyond, high temperatures hit people hard. Unable to find relief, some sweated profusely while others ended up hospitalized. Many would die, such as in Saudi Arabia, where heat related illnesses killed more than 1,300 during the annual hajj pilgrimage. The heat didn't just impact people, but also oceans and animals, putting at risk some of the most biodiverse ecosystems in the world, such as Ecuador's Galapagos Islands. July: California burning Rising temperatures and prolonged droughts create conditions for more and longer burning wildfires. One of the places that is consistently hard hit is the U.S. state of California. This year was no exception. Wildfires burned more than 1 million acres, chewed through hundreds of homes and led thousands of people to evacuate. As happens in every fire, countless animals also perished or were forced from their habitats. August: Mother nature shining through For all the destruction that climate change caused in 2024, mother nature showed off its beauty. That was on display at Churchill, Manitoba, a northern Canadian town that revels in its unofficial title as polar bear capital of the world. Like every year, tourists enjoyed stunning views of the Hudson Bay, watched beluga whales swim and, of course, came into contact with polar bears. September: Raging waters Water is central for humans and animals, but it can also take lives and leave a path of destruction. It did both in 2024. The scenes were shocking: students in India using rope to cross a flooded street, a little girl in Cuba floating in a container and Nigerians wading through floodwaters after a dam collapsed in the wake of heavy rains. October: Experiencing extremes Throughout the year, there was way too much water in some places and not enough in others, increasingly common as climate change alters natural weather patterns. In the Sahara Desert in Morocco, heavy rain left sand dunes with pools of water. By contrast, the Amazon region in South America, normally lush as a largely tropical area, experienced severe drought. November: Astonishing destruction Around the world, numerous storms unleashed powerful winds and dumped large amounts of water. The result: buildings and homes that looked like they had been hit with a wrecking ball, clothes and other household goods caked in mud and scattered on the ground, and residents walking through floodwaters. December: Looking to 2025 As the end of 2024 approached, the arrival of winter in the Northern Hemisphere meant relief from the heat in the form of cold temperatures and idyllic scenes like snow-frosted trees. But there were also reminders that global warming had already altered Earth so much that climate-driven disasters, such as raging wildfires even during winter months, are never far off. While impossible to predict when and where disaster may strike, one thing is all but certain in 2025: the storms, floods, heat waves, droughts and wildfires will continue. ___ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

TikTok being investigated after suspected meddling in Romania's presidential election	LONDON (AP) — European Union regulators said Tuesday they're investigating whether TikTok breached the bloc's digital rulebook by failing to deal with risks to Romania's presidential election, which has been thrown into turmoil over allegations of electoral violations and Russian meddling. The European Commission is escalating its scrutiny of the popular video-sharing platform after Romania's top court canceled results of the first round of voting that resulted in an unknown far-right candidate becoming the front-runner. The court made its unprecedented decision after authorities in the European Union and NATO member country declassified documents alleging Moscow organized a sprawling social media campaign to promote a long shot candidate, Calin Georgescu. 'Following serious indications that foreign actors interfered in the Romanian presidential elections by using TikTok, we are now thoroughly investigating whether TikTok has violated the Digital Services Act by failing to tackle such risks,' European Commission president Ursula on der Leyen said in a press release. 'It should be crystal clear that in the EU, all online platforms, including TikTok, must be held accountable.' The European Commission is the 27-nation EU's executive arm and enforces the bloc's Digital Services Act, a sweeping set of regulations intended to clean up social media platforms and protect users from illegal content. It ordered TikTok earlier this month to retain all information related to the election. In the preliminary round of voting on Nov. 24 Georgescu was an outsider among the 13 candidates but ended up topping the polls. He was due to face a pro-EU reformist rival in a runoff before the court canceled the results. The declassified files alleged that there was an 'aggressive promotion campaign' to boost Georgescu's popularity, including payments worth a total of $381,000 to TikTok influencers to promote him on the platform. TikTok said it has 'protected the integrity' of its platform over 150 elections around the world and is continuing to address these 'industry-wide challenges.' 'TikTok has provided the European Commission with extensive information regarding these efforts, and we have transparently and publicly detailed our robust actions,' it said in a statement. The commission said its investigation will focus on TikTok's content recommendation systems, especially on risks related to 'coordinated inauthentic manipulation or automated exploitation.' It's also looking at TikTok's policies on political advertisements and 'paid-for political content.' TikTok said it doesn't accept paid political ads and 'proactively' removes content for violating policies on misinformation. The investigation could result in TikTok making changes to fix any problems, or in fines worth up to 6% of the company's total global revenue.	https://apnews.com/article/tiktok-romania-european-union-election-0638e90cb3898fc61619e8aed4731a53	2024-12-17T02:49:36-08:00	
Authorities impose overnight curfew in cyclone-ravaged Mayotte as France rushes in aid	SAINT-DENIS, Reunion (AP) — An overnight curfew goes into force Tuesday evening as authorities try to stabilize Mayotte in the aftermath of Cyclone Chido, the most intense storm to hit the French Indian Ocean archipelago in 90 years. The French military said it is sending four to five planes a day with up to 50 tons of assistance, including food, water and medicine. Hundreds of military personnel have arrived in Mayotte since the weekend. The official death toll from Saturday's cyclone rose to 22, with more than 1,400 people injured including 48 critically, according to the latest report from Mayotte Hospital quoted by Ambdilwahedou Soumaila, the mayor of the capital, Mamoudzou. However, authorities fear hundreds and possibly thousands of people have died. 'The priority today is water and food,' Soumaila told RFI radio, adding that 'there are people who have unfortunately died where the bodies are starting to decompose that can create a sanitary problem. The curfew requires people to stay in their homes between 10 p.m. and 4 a.m. each night as authorities try to prevent looting of damaged buildings. 'We don’t have electricity. When night falls, there are people who take advantage of that situation,' Soumaila said. Speaking on France Inter radio Tuesday morning, Mayotte lawmaker Estelle Youssouffa described the challenges in accounting for victims, especially among undocumented migrants. 'The real toll of those swept away by the mud, winds and tin from shanty towns will never be known,' Youssouffa said. 'This population, by definition undocumented migrants, are the main victims of this tragedy because they feared going to shelters.' Youssouffa shared a harrowing account from an imam she spoke to on Monday, who reported burying more than 30 people in a single day in La Vigie, a makeshift settlement. 'I don’t even know if these figures are included in the official count,' Youssouffa said. Soumaila, Mamoudzou’s mayor, said he planned to visit areas hit hardest by the cyclone on Tuesday, where survivors are still reeling from the destruction. Nearly 70% of Mayotte’s population has been gravely affected, with entire neighborhoods reduced to rubble. Aid efforts continue, with French military aircraft delivering water and food daily. However, power outages and communication disruptions persist, leaving many without basic necessities. The island’s main hospital remains severely damaged, and a field hospital is expected to arrive Thursday. French President Emmanuel Macron has pledged to visit Mayotte soon and to declare a national mourning period. Meanwhile, an initial 655,000 euros ($687,000) was released by a government decree to finance urgent needs on the island. Cyclone Chido is the deadliest storm to strike the territory in nearly a century, underscoring the vulnerability of the island’s impoverished population. The hurricane is also threatening to deepen the political crisis on the French mainland. Less than a week after taking office, newly appointed Prime Minister François Bayrou has come under heavy criticism from across the political spectrum for his perceived mishandling of the emergency. Bayrou did not travel to Mayotte and did not attend in person a crisis meeting, opting instead to chair a town hall meeting in the city of Pau, where he is the mayor. Bayrou took part in the crisis meeting via video. Bayrou responded that the interior minister was in Mayotte and that the two were taking decisions together. He insisted he is busy trying to form a government. Bayrou was appointed prime minister by Macron last week after a historic parliamentary vote toppled the previous government. —— Nouvian reported from Paris. —— AP Africa news: https://apnews.com/hub/africa	https://apnews.com/article/mayotte-france-cyclone-chido-50f0478e0dc3d402245941330b2fbd65	2024-12-17T02:15:50-08:00	
Middle East latest: Israeli strike in Gaza kills at least 8 from the same family, Palestinians say	An Israeli strike in Gaza killed at least eight people from the same family, most of them women and children, Palestinian medics said Tuesday. The strike late Monday hit a house in Gaza City’s central neighborhood of Daraj, according to the Health Ministry’s ambulance and emergency service. Among the bodies recovered from the rubble were a father and his three children, and the children’s grandmother, according to a casualty list obtained by The Associated Press. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military on the strike. Israeli bombardment and offensives in Gaza have killed more than 45,000 Palestinians over the past 14 months, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. The ministry’s tally does not distinguish between combatants and civilians, but it says more than of half the dead were women and children. Israel launched its campaign in retaliation for Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack on southern Israel in which militants killed some 1,200 people and abducted 250 others, around 100 of whom remain in captivity. ___ Here's the latest: UN investigators want to to preserve evidence of atrocities in Syria GENEVA — A U.N.-backed team investigating years of crimes in war-torn Syria says it has reached out to its new government and hopes to deploy to help gather and preserve evidence on the ground -- in hopes of bringing torturers, killers and other war criminals to justice one day. Robert Petit, head of the international, impartial and independent mechanism on Syria, said its team has reason to believe that mass graves exist across Syria, but exhumation, DNA collection and tests for cause of death require 'a lot of resources.' He provided no further details about any such mass graves. Petit said the government of former President Bashar Assad, who fled Syria on Dec. 8, didn’t cooperate with his team, and the change of authority offers a chance to establish the fates of 'tens of thousands of people' who died and suffered under his rule. The investigators, following Assad’s downfall, have told Syrian authorities of 'our willingness to engage and to go to Syria to fulfill our mandate,' he said. 'We are awaiting a response. And as soon as that response is forthcoming, we will deploy.' A 'monitoring cell' on the U.N.-backed team has collected recent images from social media, he said, while its sources on the ground have been able to collect new evidence and testimonies in the wake of Assad’s ouster. The mechanism was created in 2016 by the U.N. General Assembly to collect, preserve, consolidate and analyze evidence of 'serious crimes' committed in Syria since the civil war erupted in March 2011, Petit said. A U.N.-backed Commission of Inquiry is doing similar work. EU plans to reopen its office in Damascus BRUSSELS — The European Union plans to reopen its office in Damascus following 'constructive first contacts' between an envoy and Syria’s new representatives, the bloc’s top diplomat said on Tuesday. 'We are ready to reopen our delegation, which is the European embassy, and we want this to be fully operational,' EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas told EU lawmakers. A diplomat from Beirut was dispatched to Damascus on Monday for talks with representatives of the new leadership and civil society in Syria. Kallas described it as 'a very important step' that would allow for 'really constructive engagement and to have the input and information from the ground as well.' After talks in Turkey with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the EU also wants to 'enhance our engagement in early recovery, including basic services like electricity and water and infrastructure.' British diplomats meet leader of militant group that toppled Assad LONDON — British diplomats have met the leader of the militant group that toppled Syrian leader Bashar Assad. Photographs posted by the group on social media showed senior officials, including the U.K. special representative for Syria, Ann Snow, meeting Hayat Tahrir al-Sham leader Ahmad al-Sharaa, formerly known as Mohammed al-Golani, in Damascus on Monday. Foreign Secretary David Lammy confirmed Monday that Britain had sent 'a delegation of senior U.K. officials to Damascus this week for meetings with the new Syrian authorities and members of civil society groups.' Britain, along with the U.S. and other countries, classifies HTS, a former al-Qaida affiliate, as a terrorist organization. U.K. officials have suggested they may reconsider that designation, but have not given a timeline. They say British officials can still talk to HST in the meantime. In an interview with the Times of London newspaper, Al-Sharaa urged the West to lift sanctions and said Israel should stop its strikes on Syria. 'We do not want any conflict whether with Israel or anyone else and we will not let Syria be used as a launchpad for attacks,' he was quoted as saying. 'The Syrian people need a break, and the strikes must end and Israel has to pull back to its previous positions.' An Israeli strike in Gaza kills at least 8 from same family, Palestinians say DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — An Israeli strike in Gaza killed at least eight people from the same family, most of them women and children, Palestinian medics said Tuesday. The strike late Monday hit a house in Gaza City’s central neighborhood of Daraj, according to the Health Ministry’s ambulance and emergency service. Rescuers recovered the bodies of eight people including two women and four children from under the rubble, it said. Among the dead were a father and his three children, and the children’s grandmother, according to a casualty list obtained by The Associated Press. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military on the strike. German diplomats will hold their first talks with the new Syrian government BERLIN — Germany says its diplomats will hold their first talks on Tuesday with the new Syrian government installed by the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham group, or HTS. The Foreign Ministry in Berlin said the talks will center on an 'inclusive transition process' in Syria and the protection of minorities. The German delegation also plans to sound out the possibility of a German diplomatic presence in Damascus, and will meet representatives of Christian communities among others. The ministry said in a statement that 'we know where HTS comes from and know its origins in al-Qaida ideology,' and said that Germany is watching the activities of the group and the interim government closely. 'As far as can be said at all at this point, they are acting prudently so far,' it added. 'Like our international partners, we will measure them by their actions. Any cooperation requires that ethnic and religious minorities be protected and women’s rights respected.' The U.S. has already said that its officials have been in direct contact with HTS. Germany has been a leading destination for Syrian refugees over the past decade. Mediation efforts in northern Syria fail to reach a permanent truce, US-backed force says DAMASCUS, Syria — A U.S.-backed force in Syria says U.S.-led mediation efforts have failed to reach a permanent truce in Syria's north between the force's fighters and Turkish-backed gunmen. The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces said the failure to end the fighting in the northern areas of Manbij and Kobani were unsuccessful due to Turkey’s unwillingness to accept key points. 'Despite U.S. efforts to stop the war, Turkey and its mercenary militias have continued to escalate over the last period,' the SDF said. The failure of the mediation is expected to lead to a new round of fighting between the SDF and the Turkey-backed Syrian National Army in the areas of Kobani. US military says it bombed a Houthi military facility in Yemen’s capital CAIRO — The U.S. military on Tuesday said it bombed a Houthi military facility in Yemen’s capital, Sanaa, the latest U.S.-led attack on the Iranian-backed rebels. The Houthi media office said the strike hit part of the sprawling complex that houses the rebels’ Defense Ministry. There were no immediate reports of casualties. U.S. Central Command said the strike late Monday targeted a key command and control facility that was 'a hub for coordinating Houthi operations,' including attacks on U.S. Navy and merchant vessels in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden. Houthis have targeted dozens of merchant vessels with missiles and drones since the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza started in October last year. They have seized one vessel and sunk two in the campaign, which has killed four sailors. The rebels have maintained that they target ships linked to Israel, the U.S. or the United Kingdom to force an end to Israel’s campaign against Hamas in Gaza. However, many of the ships attacked have little or no connection to the conflict, including some bound for Iran. Monday’s U.S. strike came hours after the Houthis said they fired a hypersonic ballistic missile toward Israel. The Houthi missile triggered sirens across the Tel Aviv metropolitan area. The Israeli military said it intercepted the missile outside Israel’s borders. However, shrapnel that the military said was likely from an Israeli interceptor missile fell on the roof of a home in east Jerusalem.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-syria-news-17-december-2024-3df6c0a90a0d58efc30e4b5f7143c96f	2024-12-16T22:37:54-08:00

Political strife erupts over South Korean court as it is set to determine the fate of impeached Yoon	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea’s acting leader vowed Tuesday to convey to the world that things are back to normal following parliament’s impeachment of conservative President Yoon Suk Yeol, but rival parties began squabbling over the mechanics of a court ruling to determine whether to formally unseat or reinstate him. The country’s liberal opposition-controlled parliament voted to impeach Yoon last Saturday over his short-lived Dec. 3 martial law imposition, suspending his presidential powers until the Constitutional Court determines whether to uphold or overturn the decision. If Yoon is dismissed, a national election must be held to pick his successor within two months. Prime Minister Han Duck-soo, who became acting leader, has taken steps to reassure the U.S. and other countries and stabilize markets. Presiding over a Cabinet Council meeting on Tuesday, Han said he will 'continuously do my utmost to inform the international society that Republic of Korea is fast regaining stability and maintain confidence with partners.' But the country’s intense political strife appears to be far from over, as the rival parties began bickering over whether to fill three vacant justices’ seats at the Constitutional Court. To formally end Yoon’s presidency, the nine-member court panel needs support from at least six justices. But since three seats remain vacant following retirements, a unanimous decision in favor of Yoon's impeachment is required to throw him out of office for good. Three of the court’s nine justices are directly appointed by the president. Three others are nominated by the Supreme Court head and another three by the National Assembly, and their formal appointments by the president has widely been a formality. The three seats that are currently open are to be nominated by the National Assembly — two by the Democratic Party and the other by Yoon’s ruling People Power Party. The court can rule on Yoon’s case only with the current six justices. But the main liberal opposition Democratic Party, which led the impeachment efforts against Yoon, has said it would speed up the process of restoring the court’s nine-justice system to promote fairness and public confidence in its ruling. But PPP floor leader Kweon Seong-dong, a Yoon loyalist, created a stir Tuesday as he voiced his objection to a Democratic Party push to fill the three vacancies. He said it would be inappropriate for Han, the acting leader, to appoint justices nominated by parliament, saying such authorities solely rest with the president. 'An acting president can appoint Constitutional Court justices when there is a presidential vacancy, but not when the president’s duties are just suspended,' Kweon said. Many observers say the court’s current six-member configuration is advantageous for Yoon’s chances to return to office, as it would only require a single justice rejecting the parliament impeachment. They note Cheong Hyungsik, one of the six justices, is a clear conservative who was directly appointed by Yoon. The Democratic Party quickly dismissed Kweon’s argument as 'absurd and utterly nonsensical' and urged PPP to abide by a November agreement between the rival parties to nominate the three Constitutional Court justices. Party lawmaker and spokesperson Jo Seoung-lae said PPP has 'blatantly revealed their true intention to obstruct the constitutional trial.' There was no immediate response from Han, who during the Cabinet meeting stressed that the government will cooperate with the ruling and opposition parties to stabilize the economy. There is no clear definition about what an acting president can and cannot do over the appointments of court justices. The Democratic party accuses PPP of trying to drag out the impeachment trial at the Constitutional Court, which has up to 180 days to determine Yoon's fate. Time is a crucial issue for Democratic Party leader Lee Jae-myung, who is favored by polls to win a presidential by-election in the event of Yoon’s ouster but grapples with his own legal troubles. Lee could possibly be prohibited from running for president if the appellate and Supreme courts uphold his lower court conviction for election law violation in November. Yoon faces allegations of rebellion and abuse of power over his martial law introduction. Investigative authorities want him to appear for questioning later this week, but officials at Yoon's office and residence on Monday refused to receive requests for his appearance. The martial law declaration, the first of its kind in more than 40 years, drew hundreds of troops who tried to encircle parliament and prevent lawmakers from voting on the decree. Many lawmakers still managed to get inside a National Assembly chamber and voted to overturn Yoon's decree unanimously, forcing Yoon's Cabinet to lift it. Yoon's decree, which harkened back to an era of past military-backed dictatorships, has sparked massive street protests calling for his ouster and resulted in his approval rating plummeting. Yoon's defense minister, police chief and several other senior military commanders have been arrested over their roles in the martial law enforcement. Supporters of Yoon worry that his early exit would severely hamper the country's conservatives and cause them to likely lose a presidential by-election to the liberals, like they did in 2017, when then-impeached conservative President Park Geun-hye was ousted and arrested over a corruption scandal.	https://apnews.com/article/south-korea-martial-law-yoon-constitutional-court-2917db5da7c461ef3eb732e17f938114	2024-12-16T21:02:53-08:00	
Militants attack police post in northwest Pakistan, killing 2 officers and wounding 3	PESHAWAR, Pakistan (AP) — Militants on a motorcycle opened fire Tuesday at a police post in restive northwest Pakistan, killing at least two officers and wounding three others before fleeing the scene, officials said. No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attack in Shangla, a city in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, bordering Afghanistan. Local police officer Nasir Khan said the wounded officers were transported to a nearby hospital. In a statement, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi condemned the attack and offered his condolences to the families of the slain officers. He said 'khwarij' — a term used for Pakistani Taliban — were behind the attack. Naqvi gave no further details. Pakistan in recent months has witnessed a surge in militant attacks, most blamed on separatists in the southwest Balochistan province and Pakistani Taliban, known as Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan or TTP. While the TTP is an ally of the Afghan Taliban who seized power in Afghanistan in 2021, it's a separate group. In November, a suicide bomber killed 12 security personnel and wounded several others after detonating an explosive-laden vehicle at a security post in Bannu, a district in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.	https://apnews.com/article/pakistan-militant-attack-police-post-restive-northwest-bf94bbd80b1b69238cf9d16709afb61c	2024-12-16T20:32:06-08:00	
Stock market today: Asian shares are mixed after Nasdaq sets a record ahead of Fed meeting	BANGKOK (AP) — Shares were mixed in Asia on Tuesday after the Nasdaq set a record ahead of a meeting by the Federal Reserve later this week that could set the direction for markets in the new year. U.S. futures were higher and oil prices fell. Tokyo's benchmark Nikkei 225 index gained 0.2% to 39,528.23, helped by gains in technology shares including SoftBank Group Corp., whose CEO Masayoshi Son joined President-elect Donald Trump in announcing plans Monday by the Japanese technology and telecoms giant to invest $100 billion in U.S. projects over the next four years. SoftBank's U.S. listed shares closed 0.6% higher. Chinese markets slid further, with Hong Kong's Hang Seng index losing 0.4% to 19,725.08. The Shanghai Composite index shed 0.6% to 3,366.89. Investors have appeared disappointed over Beijing's latest announcements about policies aimed at buttressing economic growth and encouraging more consumer demand. 'In China, recent disappointing data continues to pressure domestic policymakers to intensify their policy stimulus to invigorate domestic demand,' Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management said in a commentary. South Korea's Kospi sank 1% to 2,465.76 as authorities were pushing to summon impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol for questioning over his short-lived martial law decree of last week. The country's Constitutional Court began its first meeting Monday on Yoon’s case to determine whether to remove him from office or reinstate him. Australia's S&amp;P/ASX 200 gained 0.8% to 8,314.10, while the Taiex in Taiwan was up 0.2%. In Bangkok, the SET edged 0.2% lower. On Monday, U.S. stock indexes drifted amid mixed trading. The S&amp;P 500 rose 0.4% to 6,074.08 and the Nasdaq composite climbed 1.2% to a record close of 20,173.89. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lagged, giving up 0.3% to 43,717.48. Broadcom leaped 11.2% to help lead the S&amp;P 500 for a second straight day after delivering a profit report last week that beat analysts’ expectations thanks to the wave of enthusiasm about its artificial-intelligence offerings. On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve will announce its last move on interest rates for the year. The widespread expectation is that it will cut its main rate for a third straight time, as it tries to boost the slowing job market after getting inflation nearly all the way down to its target of 2%. The question is how much more it will cut rates next year, and Fed officials will release projections for where they see the federal funds rate ending 2025, along with other economic indicators, once their meeting concludes. Fed Chair Jerome Powell will also answer questions in a press conference following the meeting. Expectations for a series of cuts to rates by the Fed have been one of the main reasons the S&amp;P 500 has set an all-time high 57 times so far this year and is heading for one of its best years of the millennium. The economy has held up better than many feared, continuing to grow even after the Fed hiked the federal funds rate to a two-decade high in hopes of grinding down on inflation, which topped 9% two summers ago. On Wall Street, MicroStrategy jumped as much as 7% during the day as it continues to benefit from the surging price for bitcoin, which set another all-time high on Monday of over $107,000, according to CoinDesk. It was trading at $106,870 early Tuesday. Bitcoin’s price has catapulted from roughly $44,000 at the start of the year on expectations that Trump will favor digital currencies. Treasury yields held relatively steady. The yield on the 10-year Treasury edged down to 4.39% on Monday from 4.40% late Friday. The two-year yield, which more closely tracks expectations for the Fed, eased to 4.24% from 4.25%. In other dealings early Tuesday, U.S. benchmark crude oil lost 12 cents to $70.59 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude, the international standard, lost 4 cents to $73.48 per barrel. The U.S. dollar fell to 154.05 Japanese yen from 154.14 yen. The euro was nearly unchanged at $1.0514. ___ AP Business Writer Stan Choe contributed.	https://apnews.com/article/stocks-markets-rates-fed-softbank-017d11af3f82972d2ae80e8d229fe3e3	2024-12-16T19:12:51-08:00	
Australian state proposes ban on protests at places of worship to fight rising antisemitism	MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — An Australian state government on Tuesday proposed new restrictions on protesters in response to rising antisemitism, including a ban on demonstrations outside places of worship. Victoria Premier Jacinta Allan proposed the new laws after arsonists damaged a Melbourne synagogue this month and protestors kept fearful worshippers trapped inside a Sydney synagogue for three hours a week earlier. 'That’s not peaceful protest. It’s menacing behavior,' Allan said. 'Antisemitism is a cancer and we must leave no stone unturned to fight the evil of antisemitism, to fight the evil of this racism in all of its forms and also to continue to work to help heal our multicultural community, to help build on that social cohesion and continue to support our strong, united Victoria,' she added. The new laws would protect the right of people to 'gather and pray free from fear, harassment and intimidation,' her office said in a statement. The proposed laws, which will be voted on by the state legislature early next year, would establish safe access areas around places of worship and prohibit disturbances of religious gatherings. The laws would also ban protesters flying flags and displaying symbols of groups listed by Australia as terrorist organizations. Face masks used by protesters to conceal their identities and protect against capsicum spray would also be banned. The arson attack on Adass Israel Synagogue on Dec. 6 marked an escalation in targeted attacks in Australia since the war began between Israel and the militant Hamas group started over a year ago in the Gaza Strip. Authorities have declared it a terrorist act, which increases resources available to investigators. A federal law passed in January banned the Nazi salute and the public display of Nazi symbols in response to growing antisemitism, and the government appointed special envoys this year to combat antisemitism and Islamophobia. Australia is an increasingly multicultural society. The latest census in 2021 found that Australians born overseas or with a parent born overseas formed a majority for the first time.	https://apnews.com/article/australia-antisemitism-law-places-worship-0df991f4df85c68a4b9cc49d8ec2c6d2	2024-12-16T17:56:35-08:00	
Magnitude 7.3 earthquake hits Pacific island nation of Vanuatu	WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — A magnitude 7.3 earthquake struck Tuesday just off the coast of Vanuatu in the South Pacific Ocean, the USGS said. The quake occurred at a depth of 57 kilometers (35 miles) and was centered 30 kilometers (10 miles) west of Port Vila, the largest city in the island nation. The jolt was followed by a magnitude 5.5 aftershock near the same location. It was not immediately clear whether it caused any damage, but Vanuatu government websites were offline in the aftermath of the quake and phone numbers for the police and other public agencies did not connect. The USGS warned of tsunami waves for some coasts on Vanuatu, a group of 80 islands that is home to about 330,000 people. Waves could reach 0.3 meters to 1 meter (1 to 3 feet) above the tide level, the agency said. Some islands in the low-lying atoll nation are 3 feet above sea level. The USGS also warned of tsunami waves registering less than 0.3 meters (1 foot) above the tide level for a number of nearby Pacific islands including Papua New Guinea, Fiji and Solomon Islands.	https://apnews.com/article/vanuatu-pacific-earthquake-ocean-3e4cc1e02bc0ec62d5931b00286688ed	2024-12-16T17:42:06-08:00	
Trump says it was 'stupid' for Biden to let Ukraine use US weapons to strike deeper into Russia	PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) — President-elect Donald Trump on Monday suggested that he may reverse President Joe Biden's recent decision to allow Ukrainian forces to use American long-range weapons to strike deeper into Russian territory. Trump called the decision made by Biden last month 'stupid.' He also expressed anger that his incoming administration was not consulted before Biden made the move. With the loosening of the restrictions, Biden gave Ukraine long-sought permission to use the Army Tactical Missile System provided by the U.S. to strike Russian positions hundreds miles from its border. 'I don’t think that should have been allowed, not when there’s a possibility — certainly not just weeks before I take over,' Trump said during at a wide-ranging news conference at his Mar-a-Lago resort. 'Why would they do that without asking me what I thought? I wouldn’t have had him do that. I think it was a big mistake.' Trump's withering criticism of the Biden administration's move comes as the Democratic administration aims to push every last dollar already designated for Ukraine out the door to help repel Russia's invasion before Trump takes office on Jan. 20, with future aid uncertain. But even as Biden tries to surge weaponry and other aid to Ukraine in his final five weeks in office, the moment underscored that it's Trump who holds the most significant influence over how Ukraine can use its U.S.-provided arsenal in the long run. It’s a critical piece of leverage he could use to try to follow through on his campaign pledge to bring about a swift end to the conflict. Asked if he would consider reversing the Biden administration decision, Trump responded: 'I might. I think it was a very stupid thing to do.' The White House pushed back on Trump’s criticism, noting that the decision was made after months of deliberations that started before last month’s election. 'All I can assure you is that in the conversations we’ve had with them since the election, and we’ve had at various levels, we have articulated to them the logic behind it, the thinking behind it, why we were doing it,' White House national security spokesperson John Kirby said of the current administration's coordination with the outgoing administration. Trump's relationship with Russian leader Vladimir Putin has been scrutinized since his 2016 campaign for president, when he called on Russia to find and make public missing emails deleted by Hillary Clinton, his Democratic opponent. Trump publicly sided with Putin over U.S. intelligence officials on whether Russia had interfered in the 2016 election to help him, and Trump has praised the Russian leader and even called him 'pretty smart' for invading Ukraine. Vice President-elect JD Vance has said that while the U.S. has differences with Russia, it was counterproductive to approach Moscow as an enemy. Trump on Monday reiterated his call on both Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Russian President Vladimir Putin to negotiate an end to the war, calling the death and despair caused by the conflict 'carnage.' But Trump also appeared to acknowledge that finding an immediate endgame to the war — something he has previously said he could get done within 24 hours of taking office — could be difficult. 'I think the Middle East will be in a good place,' Trump said, referring to the conflict in Gaza and an unsettled Syria following the ouster of Bashar al-Assad. 'I think actually more difficult is going to be the Russia-Ukraine situation.' Trump declined to say whether he has spoken with Putin since the election. Zelenskyy met with Trump in Paris earlier this month, while the president-elect was visiting France for the reopening of the Notre Dame Cathedral. Zelenskyy and other Ukrainian officials have been making a forceful effort to get Trump to maintain support for Ukraine. But the situation on the ground in Ukraine continues to remain complicated as both sides wrestle for a battlefield advantage that will give them leverage in any negotiations to end the nearly three-year war. The Pentagon last week unveiled U.S. intelligence that predicts Russia could again launch its lethal new intermediate-range ballistic missile against Ukraine soon. Putin deployed the missile for the first time last month days after Biden loosened the restrictions on Ukraine. Putin warned the West that Russia's next use could be against Ukraine’s NATO allies who allowed Kyiv to use their longer-range missiles to strike inside Russia. Biden agreed to loosen the restrictions after Zelenskyy and many of his Western supporters had pressed Biden for months. They argued that the U.S. ban had made it impossible for Ukraine to try to stop Russian attacks on its cities and electrical grids. The outgoing president ultimately made the decision last month amid concerns about Russia deploying thousands of North Korean troops to help it claw back land in the Kursk border region that Ukraine seized this year.	https://apnews.com/article/trump-putin-russia-ukraine-atacms-f3ca80252ea2812b6ab4f6844f7ecd23	2024-12-16T14:58:16-08:00	
Two charged in connection with Iran-backed drone strike that killed 3 US troops in the Middle East	BOSTON (AP) — Two men, including a dual Iranian American citizen, have been charged with conspiring to export sensitive technology to Iran that was used in a drone attack in Jordan that killed three American troops early this year and injured dozens of other service members, the Justice Department said Monday. The pair were arrested after FBI specialists who analyzed the drone traced its navigation system to an Iranian company operated by one of the defendants, who relied on parts and technology funneled into the country by his alleged co-conspirator, prosecutors said. 'We often cite hypothetical risk when we talk about the dangers of American technology getting into dangerous hands,' U.S. Attorney Joshua Levy, the top federal prosecutor in Massachusetts, said at a news conference announcing the charges. 'Unfortunately, in this situation, we are not speculating.' The defendants were identified as Mahdi Mohammad Sadeghi, who prosecutors say works at a Massachusetts-based semiconductor company, and Mohammad Abedininajafabadi, who was arrested Monday in Italy as the Justice Department seeks his extradition to Massachusetts. Prosecutors allege that Abedininajafabadi, who was also called Adedini in court documents, has deep connections to the Iranian government. They say his Tehran-based company manufactures navigation systems for the military drone program of Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard and that he conspired with Sadeghi to circumvent American export control laws, including through the creation of a front company in Switzerland, and procure sensitive technology into Iran. Sadeghi, a naturalized U.S. citizen, was arrested Monday in Massachusetts and was ordered to remain detained following a court appearance. His lawyer did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment. Both men are charged with export control violations, and Abedini separately faces charges of conspiring to provide material support to Iran. Three Georgia soldiers — Sgt. William Jerome Rivers of Carrollton, Sgt. Breonna Moffett of Savannah and Sgt. Kennedy Sanders of Waycross — were killed in the Jan. 28 drone attack on a U.S. outpost in northeastern Jordan called Tower 22. U.S. officials have blamed it on the Islamic Resistance in Iraq, an umbrella group of Iran-backed militias that includes Kataib Hezbollah. In the attack, the one-way attack drone may have been mistaken for a U.S. drone that was expected to return back to the logistics base about the same time and was not shot down. Instead, it crashed into living quarters, killing the three soldiers and injuring more than 40. 'To the people who were injured by this attack, to the loved ones and family members of the people who lost their lives, as the son of a combat veteran I humbly hope that today’s charges bring some measure of justice and accountability,' Levy said. Tower 22 held about 350 U.S. military personnel at the time. It is strategically located between Jordan and Syria, only 10 kilometers (6 miles) from the Iraqi border, and in the months just after Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack on Israel, and Israel’s blistering response in Gaza, Iranian-backed militias intensified their attacks on U.S. military locations in the region. Following the attack, the U.S. launched a huge counterstrike against 85 sites in Iraq and Syria used by Iran's Revolutionary Guard and Iranian-backed militia and bolstered Tower 22’s defenses. ____ Tucker and Copp reported from Washington.	https://apnews.com/article/iran-jordan-drone-justice-department-georgia-8b5a0d927c93998ec84909a252de52d6	2024-12-16T13:50:40-08:00	
Bolivian prosecutors seek the arrest of former President Morales in sexual abuse case	LA PAZ, Bolivia (AP) — Prosecutors in Bolivia on Monday sought the arrest of former President Evo Morales in connection to a sexual abuse investigation involving his alleged fathering of a child with a 15-year-old girl. The arrest warrant, which still must be approved by a judge, was issued after Morales defied an order to testify in the case. Morales, a former coca grower who ruled Bolivia for 13 years until 2019, has been holed up in the rural area of Chapare, ringed by loyal supporters, since talk of his arrest first surfaced in September. Morales, 65, is alleged to have had a child with a teenage girl in 2016 — a sexual relationship that would have constituted statutory rape under Bolivian law. Morales hasn't commented yet on the arrest order but previously denied any wrongdoing and accused his handpicked successor, fellow leftist Luis Arce, of conspiring with his enemies to prevent him from running in next year's presidential election. 'It's a dark plan to eliminate me politically and physically,' Morales said previously. On Monday, police were repelled in a standoff with Morales supporters, who accused the authorities of acting violently. ____ Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america	https://apnews.com/article/bolivia-evo-morales-arrest-order-5f0931c989431172642a1559dffbc01a	2024-12-16T13:37:53-08:00	
Negotiators say Israel and Hamas are inching toward a ceasefire deal. This is what it may look like	After months of deadlock, Israel and Hamas appear to be moving closer toward a ceasefire to end their 14-month war. Top officials from the U.S., Qatar and Egypt have resumed their mediation efforts in recent weeks and reported greater willingness by the warring sides to wrap up a deal. In a key concession, Hamas officials say they are prepared to show more 'flexibility' on the timing of an Israeli troop withdrawal from Gaza, and Israel’s defense minister, Israel Katz, said Monday that a deal is closer than ever. Officials on all sides have cautioned that key details must still be worked out. But there is a general sense of optimism that has been lacking for many months. The changing sentiment appears to be the result of several factors. Israel has inflicted heavy damage on Hamas over the course of the war. The group is more isolated after Hezbollah’s ceasefire with Israel, and Iran, a key backer of both militant groups, has suffered a number of setbacks, highlighted by the downfall of its close ally, Syria’s Bashar Assad. In the U.S., both the outgoing Biden administration and the incoming administration of President-elect Donald Trump have signaled they want a deal completed before the Jan. 20 inauguration. According to Egyptian and Hamas officials, the agreement would take place in phases and include a halt in fighting, an exchange of captive Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners, and a surge in aid to the besieged Gaza Strip. Israel says Hamas is holding 100 hostages — over one-third of whom are believed to be dead. Here is a closer look at the emerging deal, according to the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were discussing closed negotiations. Preliminary ceasefire The first phase would last from six to eight weeks. During that time, Hamas would release some 30 hostages – roughly half of those believed alive. They include three or four dual U.S.-Israeli citizens. Israel would release hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, including as many as 100 who are serving long sentences for alleged involvement in bloody attacks. Increased aid The deal calls for a massive increase in aid to Gaza, which has plunged into a humanitarian crisis during the 14-month war. An estimated 90% of Gaza's 2.3 million people have been displaced, in many cases multiple times, and aid workers report severe hunger across the territory. This is expected to include a reopening of the territory’s Rafah crossing with Egypt, which has been closed since Israeli ground troops invaded the southern border town in May. The crossing is especially important because it is the primary exit point for Palestinians in Gaza who want to travel abroad, and the only one not controlled by Israel. Mediators say they are considering a return to a 2005 agreement that allowed the internationally recognized Palestinian Authority to operate the crossing with European Union observers. That agreement collapsed when Hamas seized control of Gaza in 2007 and expelled the Palestinian Authority forces. Israeli troop withdrawals During the first phase, Israeli troops would withdraw from some Palestinian population centers, allowing many Palestinians to begin returning home. But Israeli troops wouldn't leave Gaza altogether at this stage. They would remain along the Philadelphi corridor – a strategic strip of land along Gaza’s border with Egypt. Ending the war During the initial ceasefire, the sides would continue negotiations on a permanent agreement, to include an end to the war, full withdrawal of Israeli troops, and release of remaining hostages and bodies held by Hamas. Talks would begin on final arrangements for Gaza, including who would govern the territory and plans for rebuilding the destruction.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-gaza-war-ceasefire-egypt-qatar-264087c7a547031a9433ecbbdcd920d2	2024-12-16T13:13:45-08:00

26 people arrested in crackdown on illegal deforestation along Paraguay, Brazil and Argentina border	BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) — Paraguayan authorities arrested 26 people in a crackdown on suspected illegal deforestation along the country's border with Brazil and Argentina, Interpol announced Monday. Fourteen different agencies collaborated in the mid-October sweep, which relied on border inspections, waterway surveillance and aerial monitoring of forests. Some 1,000 logs were seized, including some quebracho wood, prized for its density and high tannin content, Interpol said. Interpol said 12 companies were involved in the alleged deforestation and trafficking of native tree species, and that it identified two criminal networks. A spokesman said alleged crimes include illegal logging of various tree species, illicit trafficking of timber, use of fake documents to traffic in illegal wood, and various acts of deforestation. He said the delay in announcing the arrests was in part to allow for follow-up investigation. 'Illegal deforestation encompasses a broad spectrum of criminal activities, from document fraud to money laundering and corruption,' said Kat Henn, Interpol’s assistant director of environmental security. 'This operation highlights the urgent need for continued multi-agency and sustained cross-border cooperation to tackle the criminal networks devastating our environment for profit.' Interpol has been boosting its presence in what's called the Tri-Border area for years. The agency has said the area — with two rivers separating the states and creating many entry points — is 'conducive to a wide range of illegal activities.' ' Organized crime is increasingly making forested areas their hub of operations — not just for the cover but to illegally extract flora, fauna and mineral resources,' Gimena Sanchez, a human rights advocate at the Washington Office on Latin America, told The Associated Press. Fighting deforestation in South America 'means fighting sophisticated transnational organized crime networks,' she added. Deforestation typically results from land being converted to raise cattle or soybeans, as well as logging or mining. It leads to a slew of negative environmental impacts, including erosion, biodiversity loss, and increased risk of flooding, as well as the loss of a valuable carbon sink. Though some progress has been made in recent years to slow deforestation, especially in Brazil and Colombia, Latin America lost 138 million hectares (about 341 million acres) of forest between 1990 and 2020, according to a United Nations report. Gabriel Funari, head of the Amazon Observatory of Illicit Economies for Global Initiative, said they are seeing large transnational criminal groups that have grown through drug trafficking revenue, such as one of Brazil’s largest crime gangs, Primeiro Comando da Capital — commonly known as PCC — increasingly diversifying their investment portfolios into various illicit markets with goods that pass through the Tri-Border, like firearms, timber, wildlife and gold. In Latin America, the direct environmental harms caused by drug trafficking are much smaller than those from perceived legal industries like cattle ranching and industrial agriculture, says Bram Ebus, a consultant for Crisis Group in Latin America. 'Nevertheless, it is the drug money that is laundered through these economic activities that finances and accelerates deforestation,' he said. ___ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Palestinian security forces launch a rare crackdown on militants in the West Bank	JENIN, West Bank (AP) — Palestinian security forces have launched a rare crackdown against local militant groups in the northern West Bank, sending in armored cars and engaging in fierce gunbattles that have killed at least two people in the volatile area. The raid marks an unusual step for the Palestinian Authority, the governing body for semi-autonomous pockets in the occupied West Bank that is internationally recognized but has largely lost control of militant strongholds such as Jenin, where forces operated through the weekend and into Monday. Israeli troops have stepped into the vacuum in recent years, particularly since the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas militant attack that triggered the ongoing war in Gaza. Palestinian health officials say 811 Palestinians have been killed since then in the West Bank, most by Israeli raids into Palestinian cities and towns. Israel says most of the dead have been militants. On Saturday, Palestinian security forces said they had begun the operation in the Jenin refugee camp, a longtime militant stronghold. The operation was continuing Monday, with AP reporters hearing heavy gunfire and spotting at least two Palestinian armored vehicles roaming the outskirts of the camp. The U.N. humanitarian office said that security forces took over part of a hospital in Jenin, using it as a base and shooting from inside. Forces detained at least eight men, pulling one out of the hospital on a stretcher, the U.N. said. The main U.N. agency for Palestinians, UNRWA, suspended its services, including schooling. The militant groups Islamic Jihad and Hamas operate freely across Jenin, and its streets are regularly lined with posters depicting slain fighters as martyrs to the Palestinian struggle. Young men carrying walkie-talkies patrol the alleys. Israel says the militant groups are part of the Iranian 'axis of resistance.' Both groups receive funding and other support from Iran, but they are deeply rooted in Palestinian society. The security forces are 'operating according to a clear political vision' from Palestinian leadership 'on the importance of imposing order, establishing the rule of law, restoring civil peace and societal security,' spokesman Brig. Gen. Anwar Rajab said. The troops were focused on 'eradicating' Iran-backed groups that were trying to incite 'chaos and anarchy,' he added. Palestinian security forces have reported the deaths of two men in the crackdown: a 19-year-old civilian, Rabhi Shalabi, shot riding a motorcycle, and an Islamic Jihad militant, Yazi Jaayseh. Security forces, which initially denied killing Shalabi before admitting it in a statement Friday, have not said why they targeted the young man. His 15-year-old cousin, who was also on the motorcycle, was shot in the head and wounded. U.N. officials, citing local video footage, have said the pair were unarmed and delivering food from a family restaurant when they were shot, and that Shalabi raised both in the air hands before he was killed. It was not immediately clear why the Palestinian Authority decided to launch the crackdown now. Such actions are unpopular with the Palestinian public, where many accuse the Palestinian security forces of collaborating with Israel. The Israeli military said it was not involved in the operation and did not comment further. Hamas senior official Mahmoud Mardawi slammed the Palestinian Authority operating in Jenin as an 'attempt to end the resistance.' In comments released by Hamas late Monday, he urged the Palestinian Authority to immediately stop its 'unpatriotic behavior that serves the occupation.' The U.S. has sought to strengthen the Palestinian Authority, hoping it will help run the Gaza Strip after the war. White House officials declined to comment publicly on their position on the Jenin operation. Officials at the U.S. National Security Council also declined to comment. Overall, since the start of the war, the U.N. says that at least seven Palestinians have been killed by Palestinian security forces, and at least 24 Israelis have also been killed by Palestinian attackers in the West Bank.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-authority-jenin-hamas-islamic-jihad-131b0b0d82608142d979919330ab96c5	2024-12-16T11:01:38-08:00	
UN announces initiative to overcome political deadlock in Libya	UNITED NATIONS (AP) — The top U.N. official in Libya announced a new initiative Monday to overcome a three-year deadlock and move the divided oil-rich North African nation toward a national election. The U.N. deputy special envoy for Libya, Stephanie Koury, told the U.N. Security Council that as a first step, the U.N. political mission in Libya known as UNSMIL intends to establish an advisory committee, with a deadline to develop options to resolve outstanding electoral issues and a road map for holding an election. 'The committee will be composed of experts and respected personalities, who are reflective of the spectrum of Libyan political forces, social, cultural and geographical components,' she said. Koury stressed that the committee isn't 'a dialogue group to take decisions,' but to generate options for follow-on action by Libyan decision-makers. Libya plunged into chaos after a NATO-backed uprising toppled and killed longtime dictator Moammar Gadhafi in 2011. The country split, with rival administrations in the east and west backed by rogue militias and foreign governments. The country’s political crisis stems from the failure to hold an election on Dec. 24, 2021, and the refusal of Prime Minister Abdul Hamid Dbeibah — who led a transitional government in the capital of Tripoli in the west — to step down. In response, Libya’s parliament based in the east appointed a rival prime minister who was replaced, while the powerful military commander Khalifa Hifter continues to hold sway in the east. Koury said the polarization and unresolved electoral issues are threatening Libya’s national unity and territorial integrity, crumbling the country's transitional architecture. And she said competition between armed groups for control of territory and access to Libya’s resources threatens stability. Over the past several weeks, Koury said that she shared the initiative's broad framework with key Libyan actors and regional and international partners. On Sunday night, she presented UNSMIL’s plan to overcome political deadlock to the Libyan people. The key objectives are stability, pursuing 'Libyan ownership,' helping unify and strengthen Libyan institutions, and promoting the inclusivity of Libyan political forces and cultural groups. U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Linda Thomas-Greenfield, this month’s council president, said that a new political process is needed in Libya and otherwise it will face deeper divisions, a further erosion of sovereignty and a return to violence. 'We continue to believe the U.N. is the best-placed international actor to lead that process,' she said. 'We call on the entire international community to stand behind these U.N.-led efforts.'	https://apnews.com/article/un-libya-election-deadlock-initiative-road-map-eca3b6af8c3525a769d0366db3afd46c	2024-12-16T10:49:29-08:00	
Joy and wonder: Between the bumps of the world, exuberance shone through in 2024	She jumps, her eyes closed, and she grins — this little girl surrounded by gang violence in her own neighborhood in Haiti. The jump rope game she is playing brings out an exuberance in her that the conditions around her cannot squelch. Around the planet, so many human beings — in so many circumstances — could use this kind of joy. But in a world that offered so much heartache and cataclysm in 2024, those kinds of feelings can be hard to find and recognize. Life rushes by, leaving its marks. Moments of joy and wonder, it seems, sometimes must be extracted and pointed out before they disappear. This collection of images by AP photojournalists does exactly that. For every disruptive news story in the world, perhaps there is an equal moment of joy or wonder. But because news is, by definition, things that are out of the ordinary, sometimes everyday moments get lost in the rush of events. These photos, taken together, make a conscious choice to grab at that joy and wonder, and to distill it and recapture it in a concentrated burst — reminding us that even in dark days, it is still out there. Some, like the little Haiti girl and the image of displaced Palestinian youths playing, demonstrate that even while traveling hard roads, people can find respite. Some, like the photo of a coca vendor at a legal market in Bolivia, demonstrate that smiles can burst forth at any part of the day. Some, like the young people performing a street dance in a Rio de Janeiro favela, or slum, show that exuberance knows no boundaries and will inevitably poke through. And some show the literal joyful footprints of humanity — as with the footprints on a snow-covered rugby field in Chile that took pains to walk in the shape of a heart. Patterns, blown kisses, celebrations of equality, ice skaters, the unself-conscious playing of children, a motorcycle riding against a dramatic sunrise, even a partier reveling in being immersed in a pool of squashed tomatoes — these images, gathered from all around the world, offer an antidote for much of the rest of 2024. They tell us that happiness and exuberance are possible in multiple conditions, even some of the worst ones. And in doing so, they also hint that, at any moment, those good feelings might be possible for us, too. ___ Ted Anthony, director of new storytelling and newsroom innovation at The Associated Press, writes frequently about photography.

Atlanta and Seattle to play first WNBA regular season game in Canada in August	The WNBA will stage its first regular season game outside the U.S. when Atlanta and Seattle play in Vancouver on Aug. 15, the league announced Monday. The league has had two exhibition games in Canada, including one played by Seattle in Edmonton this past season. The Toronto Tempo will begin play in 2026 as the first international team in league history. 'The WNBA Canada Game has been a tremendous opportunity to grow our league’s footprint, and we look forward to hosting the first-ever international regular season game with the Seattle Storm’s return to Canada to face the Atlanta Dream,' WNBA Commissioner Cathy Engelbert said. 'As we prepare to establish permanent roots in Canada with a Toronto franchise, this game and our year-round engagement efforts are a nod to the incredible momentum around women’s basketball in Canada.' The Dream participated in the first preseason WNBA game in Europe when they beat the British national team in 2011. 'This is a monumental moment for the WNBA, and we are honored that the league chose the Dream to participate in the first regular-season game outside the U.S,' Atlanta Dream president and COO Morgan Shaw Parker said. 'We look forward to showcasing our amazing athletes on a global stage in Vancouver. Members of our team have competed internationally, and now they will be doing so wearing Dream colors and representing the city of Atlanta.' This will mark the fifth WNBA game played outside the U.S., with a previous contest played in Mexico in 2004 to go along with the Canada and England games. Viewership in Canada was up 175% last season from the previous year and the league set new highs in the country across digital platforms, including WNBA League Pass and social media. 'The WNBA Canada Game is an opportunity to showcase the WNBA and its talent to more fans. The Storm is honored to be a part of this international celebration of basketball,' Seattle CEO and president Alisha Valavanis said. 'Playing in front of fans in Edmonton in 2024 was a highlight of the season and we’re looking forward to bringing the Storm energy back to Canada in 2025.' ___ AP WNBA: https://apnews.com/hub/wnba-basketball	https://apnews.com/article/wnba-canada-dream-storm-13a42f29d66937220724c80afdcc073d	2024-12-16T09:29:31-08:00	
Who is the alleged Chinese spy with close ties to Britain's Prince Andrew?	LONDON (AP) — An alleged Chinese spy who cultivated close ties with Prince Andrew said Monday he has done 'nothing wrong or unlawful' as Britain's government faced questions about what it is doing to thwart security threats from China. British authorities allege businessman Yang Tengbo — known only as 'H6' until a High Court judge lifted an anonymity order Monday — was working on behalf of the United Front Work Department, an arm of the Chinese Communist Party that is used to influence foreign entities. It's the most high-profile case in a series of espionage scandals in recent years that involved suspected or confirmed Chinese intelligence-gathering in Britain's establishment, including in Parliament. Here's a look at Yang's case: Who is Yang Tengbo? Yang, 50, also known as Chris Yang, is listed as a director of Hampton Group International, a business consultancy advising U.K.-based companies on their operations in China. He has been photographed with senior U.K. politicians, including former Prime Ministers David Cameron and Theresa May, at events. Yang is reportedly a key member of Pitch@Palace China, an initiative by Prince Andrew to support entrepreneurs. Yang worked as a junior civil servant in China before arriving in the U.K. in 2002 to study. He earned a master’s degree in public administration and public policy at the University of York before starting his business. He was granted the right to live and work in the U.K. for an indefinite period in 2013. Yang told authorities he has spent regular time in Britain and considered it his second home. What happened with Prince Andrew? Details about Yang's case emerged last week at a special immigration tribunal, which upheld a decision by British authorities to ban Yang from entering the U.K. in 2023. The Home Office said he was believed to have carried out 'covert and deceptive activity' for the Chinese Communist Party. Judges agreed with MI5, Britain's domestic intelligence, that Yang 'represented a risk to the national security' and dismissed his appeal. The tribunal heard that in 2021, authorities found documents that showed how close Yang was to Prince Andrew, King Charles III's younger brother. One letter from a senior adviser to Andrew told Yang he should 'never underestimate the strength' of his relationship with the royal. 'Outside of his closest internal confidants, you sit at the very top of a tree that many, many people would like to be on,' the adviser wrote. The tribunal said that when Yang was interviewed by immigration authorities he failed to give a full account of his relationship with the prince, which it said had a 'covert and clandestine' element. Authorities have not made public what information Yang allegedly obtained or was seeking to obtain. But the tribunal cited a 2022 statement by the MI5 director that described the United Front Work Department's aims as buying and exerting influence, amplifying pro-China voices and silencing those critical of the Chinese government's authority. Andrew has been repeatedly criticized for his links to wealthy foreigners and prompted critics to suggest that those individuals were trying to buy access to the royal family. What has been said about the allegations? Yang strongly denied the espionage claims and said he was a victim of a changing political climate that had seen a rise in tensions between Britain and China. 'I have done nothing wrong or unlawful,' he said in a statement. 'The widespread description of me as a ‘spy’ is entirely untrue.' Andrew's office said the royal met Yang 'through official channels' and nothing of a sensitive nature was ever discussed. What is the U.K.'s relationship with China? Prime Minister Keir Starmer said he is concerned about the challenge posed by China, but stood by his government's strategy of engagement and cooperation with Beijing. Starmer, who took office this summer, has sought to repair frayed ties and in November became the first British leader to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping since 2018. Opposition lawmaker Iain Duncan Smith, a leading critic of Beijing, said that glosses over the clear threat China poses. Yang was already a known member of China's United Front Work Department, he told Parliament, and should not have been able to gain access to the royal family without scrutiny. 'The reality is that there are many, many more involved in exactly this kind of espionage that’s taking place,' he said. In 2022 British intelligence officials warned politicians that Christine Lee, a British-Chinese lawyer, had been seeking to improperly influence members of Parliament for years. A parliamentary researcher was arrested in 2023 on suspicion of providing sensitive information to China. ___ Danica Kirka in London contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/britain-andrew-china-businessman-prince-df7354a1cf404a203e809ce36c4754d5	2024-12-16T09:19:59-08:00	
As he prepares to leave leadership, McConnell challenges Trump on foreign policy	WASHINGTON (AP) — Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell is challenging President-elect Donald Trump to reject the isolationist voices within their party and build his foreign policy around military strength, arguing that if the U.S. retreats from global engagement, 'its enemies will be only too happy to fill the void.' In an essay published Monday in Foreign Affairs, McConnell took the rare step of warning Trump directly as he plans to step down from his post in the coming weeks. The Kentucky Republican plans to stay in the Senate and has made clear that his top priority will be pushing for the United States to maintain and improve its global strength. 'The time to restore American hard power is now,' McConnell wrote, arguing that military readiness should override 'both left-wing faith in hollow internationalism and right-wing flirtation with isolation and decline.' McConnell has long pushed back against the growing isolationist wing in his party, making an aggressive, ultimately successful push this year to pass aid to Ukraine when many in his party in Congress were openly opposed to it. But the essay is his most direct warning yet to Trump and his allies and advisers, including Vice President-elect JD Vance, an Ohio senator who was one of the loudest voices in opposition to the Ukraine aid. Trump has railed against 'forever wars' since before his first term in office and long spoken favorably of Russian President Vladimir Putin. He made clear during his campaign that he would move to end the war in Ukraine quickly and has called on Putin to reach an immediate ceasefire with Ukraine. He has also said he would be open to reducing military aid to Ukraine and pulling the United States out of NATO. McConnell wrote that Trump 'deserves credit' for reversing some Obama-era limitations on assistance to Ukraine in his first term and authorizing a transfer of lethal weapons to Kyiv. But he writes that the former and future president 'sometimes undermined these tough policies through his words and deeds,' including his relationship with Putin. 'He courted Putin, he treated allies and alliance commitments erratically and sometimes with hostility, and in 2019 he withheld $400 million in security assistance to Ukraine,' McConnell wrote. 'These public episodes raised doubts about whether the United States was committed to standing up to Russian aggression, even when it actually did so.' Trump should 'commit to a significant and sustained increase in defense spending,' McConnell recommended, as well as investments in the defense industry and access to new military capabilities. McConnell’s essay comes after years of an intensely complicated relationship with Trump, aligning with him when it served his purposes in the Senate while criticizing him behind his back and, to a lesser extent, in public. He did not speak to Trump for more than three years after the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol by Trump’s supporters, but endorsed him earlier this year after it became clear that he would be the GOP presidential nominee. The essay also comes as there is speculation about McConnell’s new role as a rank-and-file member, whether he will oppose some of Trump’s nominees and otherwise challenge him publicly now that he is freed from the responsibilities of leadership. However that may play out, McConnell has made clear that he wants to cement his legacy by pushing the party to embrace the U.S. role as a global leader. He writes that Trump will 'no doubt hear from some that he should prioritize a single theater and downgrade U.S. interests and commitments elsewhere,' including by elevating Asia at the expense of interests in Europe and the Middle East. But if 'the United States continues to retreat, its enemies will be only too happy to fill the void.' 'A Russian victory would not only damage the United States’ interest in European security and increase U.S. military requirements in Europe; it would also compound the threats from China, Iran, and North Korea,' McConnell writes.	https://apnews.com/article/mcconnell-trump-isolationism-foreign-affairs-dcad297fa82e1794612fa2582e21162f	2024-12-16T09:10:29-08:00	
Russian presence in Syria remains. But it's unclear for how long	HMEIMIM, Syria (AP) — A convoy of Russian military vehicles rolled down the highway towards the Syrian city of Tartus on Monday as soldiers stood guard. Planes periodically descended and rose from Russia’s Hmeimim air base in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia while smoke rose from the base. It was unclear what was burning. In the streets of Hmeimim, a town dotted with orange groves, many of the shops bear signs in Russian, a nod to the significance of the Russian military presence. But whether and how long that presence will last after the fall of former Syrian leader Bashar Assad is now an open question. Russia’s scorched-earth intervention on behalf of its ally, Assad, once turned the tide of the Syrian civil war. In 2017, Assad’s government signed a deal with Russia that offered it a free lease of the Hmeimim air base and the Tartus naval base for 49 years. But opposition forces in the country’s northwest launched a shock offensive last month that again threatened Assad’s rule. This time, Moscow largely stood aside — although it has granted asylum to the former president and his family. On Monday, in his first public statement since his ouster, Assad said he had left Damascus for the Hmeimim air base on Dec. 8 after insurgents stormed the capital, but hadn't planned to flee the country. He said that after the base came under attack by drones, the Russians decided to evacuate him to Russia. Since Assad's departure, there have been no clashes between Russian troops and the former insurgents who have suddenly become the de facto security forces for all of Syria. That's despite the fact that many of the fighters are from areas of northern Syria that came under frequent Russian bombardment and have little love for Moscow. A fighter guarding the shuttered civilian airport next to the Hmeimim base said Monday, 'The Russians are preparing to withdraw from Syria, God willing.' He gave only his nickname, Abu Saif, because he wasn't authorized to comment publicly. Russian forces have pulled out of some areas of Syria. Russian forces and military vehicles were seen withdrawing from southern Syria on Friday toward their primary base in the city of Latakia. On Thursday, the British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that Russian forces were leaving bases in Ain Issa and Tel Al-Samn in the Al-Raqqah countryside. Satellite images released by Maxar Technologies on Friday show what appear to be cargo planes at a Russian military airfield in Syria with their nose cones opened to receive heavy equipment, along with helicopters being dismantled and prepared for transport. Moscow has reached out to the new Syrian authorities to try to ensure the security of its bases and extend its forces' stay. The three-starred flag of the Syrian revolution was quickly hoisted at the Syrian Embassy in Moscow in place of the old government's two-starred flag. In an interview with The Associated Press on Monday, Obeida Arnaout, spokesman for the political department of the new transitional government, called on Russia to 'reconsider its presence' in Syria, as well as its interests. But he didn't rule out the possibility that Russian forces could remain. 'Their interests were linked to the criminal Assad regime. They can reconsider and take the initiatives to reach out to the new administration to show that they have no animosity toward the Syrian people, and that the era of Assad regime is finally over,' Arnaout said. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in a call with reporters Monday that Moscow was discussing the issue with the new authorities. 'We are in contact with representatives of the forces that are currently in control of the situation in the country, and all of this will be determined in the course of dialogue,' Peskov said. ___ Sarah El Deeb contributed to this report from Damascus, Syria.	https://apnews.com/article/syria-russia-latakia-hmeimim-tartous-c29f7a33912753c133f20c44ea7160be	2024-12-16T07:46:02-08:00	
Prince Andrew's Chinese spy drama again pushes King Charles III to rein in scandal-prone brother	LONDON (AP) — How do you solve a problem like Prince Andrew? That’s the question facing King Charles III as the drama surrounding his 64-year-old brother roils Britain and the monarchy once again. In the latest episode, a Chinese businessman has been barred from the U.K. because of concerns he cultivated links with Andrew in an alleged effort to influence British elites on behalf of the Chinese Communist Party. The man, identified Monday as Yang Tengbo, said he wasn't involved in espionage and had 'done nothing wrong or unlawful.' The allegations represent the most high-profile example to date of a threat intelligence officials have repeatedly warned about: China’s increasing efforts to secretly influence politicians and other members of the British establishment to support the country’s expansionist policies. But the story also made news because it involves Andrew, once second-in-line to the British throne but now a constant source of tabloid fodder because of his money woes and links to questionable characters, including the late American financier and convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein. Queen Elizabeth II stripped Andrew of his royal duties and charity roles, but the unflattering headlines kept coming. More recently, Charles has tried to persuade his brother to cut his expenses by leaving the sprawling royal estate he occupies west of London and moving to a cottage inside the security perimeter of Windsor Castle. But Andrew remains ensconced at the 30-room Royal Lodge. The king needs to take more aggressive action to keep Andrew out of the public eye, such as barring him from processions and other royal events, said Ed Owens, author of 'After Elizabeth: Can the Monarchy Save Itself?’’ While Andrew said in a statement that nothing sensitive was ever discussed and that he ceased contact with the Chinese businessman as soon as concerns were raised, his constant brushes with scandal tarnish the work of the royal family, Owens said. 'Andrew is toxic and he is very much damaged goods,' he added. 'He can only, through his behavior, further undermine the reputation of the monarchy. It’s in the king’s best interest, it’s in the best interests of the future of the monarchy, for Andrew to take a step back.' Scandal fuels anti-monarchy criticism Britain’s most prominent anti-monarchy group used the latest scandal to call for a parliamentary inquiry into alleged royal corruption. 'When a Chinese spy befriends a royal, they want access to the British state. We must know if the royals have given them what they want,' said Graham Smith, leader of Republic, which seeks to replace the monarchy with an elected head of state. Andrew has become a cautionary tale about the temptations and pitfalls of modern royalty. When Andrew was born he was second in line to the throne, the proverbial spare who was there to step in if disaster struck the heir, his brother Charles. But after Charles married, Andrew’s position dropped with every new child and grandchild. He now stands at eighth place in the royal pecking order. The Epstein scandal costs Andrew his job While other senior royals spend much of their time opening recreation centers and meeting community leaders on behalf of their more exalted relations, Andrew initially took on bigger tasks. After 22 years in the Royal Navy, including combat operations as a helicopter pilot during the Falklands War, Andrew was named Britain’s special representative for international trade and investment in 2001. But he was forced to step down in 2011 amid growing concern about his friendship with Epstein, who had been sentenced to 18 months in prison after pleading guilty to soliciting a minor for prostitution. Andrew had also been criticized for meeting with the son of Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi and the son-in-law of ousted Tunisian President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali. Even before that, some members of Parliament had raised concerns about the sale of Andrew’s former home, Sunninghill Park, to a son-in-law of former Kazakh ruler Nursultan Nazarbayev in 2007. The buyer allegedly paid 15 million pounds ($19 million) — 3 million pounds more than the asking price. But Andrew’s links to Epstein have been his biggest problem. The disastrous BBC interview Questions about the relationship resurfaced after Epstein was again arrested on sex trafficking charges in 2019. In an effort to silence criticism, Andrew gave a disastrous interview to the BBC’s Newsnight program in which he tried to explain away his contacts with Epstein and failed to show empathy for victims. Amid the backlash, Andrew announced on Nov. 20, 2019, that he was stepping away from royal duties 'for the foreseeable future.' In a statement, he called his association with Epstein 'a major disruption to my family’s work.' But that didn’t end the scandal. In August 2021, one of Epstein’s victims sued Andrew in a New York cour t, alleging that the prince had sex with her when she was underage. Andrew denied the allegations, but he was stripped of all military affiliations and royal charity work as the case moved through the legal process. Netflix film brings a global audience Andrew ultimately settled the case for an undisclosed sum, with a joint statement indicating the prince would make a 'substantial donation' to a victims’ rights charity. British newspapers reported amounts for the settlement ranged from $6 million to $16 million. Even now, Andrew’s interview haunts the prince and the royal family. It resurfaced earlier this year in the Netflix movie 'Scoop,' reminding a worldwide audience of his missteps. 'He has consistently used his privileged position and his power to cozy up to convicted sex offenders, Chinese spies — in pursuit of his own interests, whether it’s about expanding his own influence or indeed extending his own business interests,’’ Owens said. 'That’s the problem here, that he’s used the position given to him by birth to seek out these opportunities.'	https://apnews.com/article/prince-andrew-yang-tengbo-chinese-spy-b3aeebcf4f7d73eaac3dae37b4b3760e	2024-12-16T06:50:56-08:00	
Syria's ousted leader Assad says he wanted to keep fighting but Russian allies evacuated him	DAMASCUS (AP) — Ousted Syrian leader Bashar Assad said Monday he wanted to stay in the country after rebels captured the capital, but the Russian military evacuated him from their base in western Syria after it came under attack. They were Assad's first public comments since he was overthrown by insurgent groups just over a week ago following a swift offensive that has shaken up the country's alliances and led to celebrations in a nation long stifled by civil war. Meanwhile, a spokesman for the new transitional government told The Associated Press that the new Syria will be inclusive and open to the world. Assad said on Facebook that he left Damascus on the morning of Dec. 8, hours after insurgents stormed the capital. He said he left in coordination with Russian allies to their Hmeimim air base in the coastal province of Latakia, where he had planned to keep fighting. But after the Russian base came under attack by drones, he said, the Russians decided to move him that night to Russia. 'At no point during these events did I consider stepping down or seeking refuge nor was such proposal made by any individual or party,' Assad said in the English text of his statement. 'The only course of action was to continue fighting against the terrorist onslaught.' In Damascus, residents dismissed Assda's comments and some said he had abandoned Syria's people long ago. 'Is he going to run away from us? He still won’t be able to run away from God,' said one resident, Moataz al-Ahmed, as children stepped on a fallen statue of Assad's father, Hafez, who had begun the family's half-century rule. The spokesman for the transitional government's political department said in an interview Monday that 'the Assad regime is finished with no return' and Russia 'should reconsider its presence on Syrian territory as well as its interests.' The spokesman, Obeida Arnaout, told the AP that Syria has entered a new phase that will be open to the world, and the new government is looking to build good relations with its neighbors and beyond. He also called on the U.S. and other countries to reconsider the designation of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham — the main rebel group and a former al-Qaida affiliate — as a terrorist organization, calling it 'not right and not accurate' designation. Already, the U.S. has said its officials have been in direct contact with the group. Syria is home to multiple ethnic and religious communities, often pitted against each other by Assad’s state and years of war. Many of them fear the possibility that Sunni Islamist extremists will take over. The new leadership also has been in contact with the U.S. to return American citizen Travis Timmerman, who was among the prisoners released from government detention centers when Assad fell, Arnaout said. 'There are political contacts at the highest levels in a way that benefits the Syrian people and that strengthen the current administration,' he said. Asked whether the new government's security forces would cooperate with the U.S. to combat remaining militants with the Islamic State group, Arnaout said Syrian factions have ousted and rejected IS and the group no longer has a significant presence in the country. U.S.-backed, Kurdish-led forces in northeast Syria have been the main U.S. ally in fighting IS and oversee detention centers housing IS militants. However, the future of the Kurds and the semi-autonomous region they control is unclear in the country's new post-Assad order. Clashes over territory have taken place in some areas between Kurdish forces and the armed groups that overthrew Assad. Arnaout said the Kurds are part of the Syrian people and their rights will be protected. However, he said the new government will not accept that any part of Syria be outside of Damascus' control. 'Kurds are one of the components of the Syrian people and we are very keen that this group has its rights protected,' he said. 'The social fabric in Syria is a source of strength and not weakness. But we affirm that we don’t any part of Syria to be separated.' The U.N. envoy for Syria, Geir Pedersen, said Monday he met with HTS leader Ahmed al-Sharaa and was briefed on the challenges and priorities of the Syrian people going forward. Pederson has called for the lifting of international sanctions on Syria to allow for faster rebuilding. Meanwhile, a U.K.-based war monitor said Israeli airstrikes early Monday hit missile warehouses on the Syrian coast and called it the 'most violent strikes' in that part of Syria since 2012. Israel has been pounding with hundreds of airstrikes what it says are military sites in Syria after the dramatic collapse of Assad’s rule, wiping out air defenses and most of the arsenal of the former Syrian army. Israeli troops have also seized a border buffer zone, sparking condemnation, with critics accusing Israel of violating the 1974 ceasefire and possibly exploiting the chaos in Syria for a land grab.	https://apnews.com/article/syria-war-assad-russia-news-16-december-2024-72a8e44f762da2ff78434ff76faeb633	2024-12-16T06:30:06-08:00	
Canada's finance minister resigns as unpopular Trudeau faces biggest test of his political career	TORONTO (AP) — Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau faced the biggest test of his political career after Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland, long his most powerful and loyal minister, announced Monday she was resigning from the Cabinet. It was a move that stunned the country and raised questions about how much longer the unpopular Trudeau can stay in his job. Freeland, who was also deputy prime minister, said that Trudeau had told her Friday that he no longer wanted her to serve as finance minister and that he offered her another role in the Cabinet. But she said in her resignation letter to the prime minister that the only 'honest and viable path' was to leave the Cabinet. 'For the past number of weeks, you and I have found ourselves at odds about the best path forward for Canada,' Freeland said. Freeland and Trudeau disagreed about a two-month sales tax holiday and $250 Canadian ($175) checks to Canadians that were recently announced. Freeland said that Canada is dealing with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's threat to impose sweeping 25% tariffs and should eschew 'costly political gimmicks' it can 'ill afford.' 'Our country is facing a grave challenge,' Freeland said in the letter. 'That means keeping our fiscal powder dry today, so we have the reserves we may need for a coming tariff war.' The resignation comes as Freeland, who chaired a Cabinet committee on U.S. relations, was set to deliver the fall economic statement and likely announce border security measures designed to help Canada avoid Trump's tariffs. The U.S. president-elect has threatened to impose a 25% tax on all products entering the U.S. from Canada and Mexico unless they stem the numbers of migrants and drugs. Trudeau has said that he plans on leading the Liberal Party into the next election, but there are some party members who don't want him to run for a fourth term. It wasn’t immediately clear what Freeland's resignation from the Cabinet means for Trudeau’s immediate future. 'This news has hit me really hard,' a shocked Transport Minister Anita Anand said. She added that she needed to digest it before commenting further. Opposition Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre said that the government is losing control at the worst possible time. 'Justin Trudeau has lost control, but he's hanging onto power,' Poilievre said. 'All this chaos, all this division, all this weakness is happening as our largest neighbor and closet ally is imposing 25% tariffs under a recently elected Trump with a strong mandate, a man who knows how to identify weakness.' No Canadian prime minister in more than a century has won four straight terms. The federal election has to be held before October. The Liberals must rely on the support of at least one major party in Parliament, because they don’t hold an outright majority themselves. If the opposition New Democratic Party, or NDP, pulls support, an election can be held at any time. Trudeau channeled the star power of his father in 2015, when he reasserted the country’s liberal identity after almost a decade of Conservative Party rule. But the son of late Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau is now in big trouble. Canadians have been frustrated by the rising cost of living and other issues like immigration increases following the country’s emergence from the COVID-19 pandemic. Trudeau’s legacy includes opening the doors wide to immigration. He also legalized cannabis and brought in a carbon tax intended to fight climate change. Freeland said in the resignation letter that Canadians 'know when we are working for them, and they equally know when we are focused on ourselves. Inevitably, our time in government will come to an end.' Freeland's resignation comes as Trudeau has been trying to recruit Mark Carney to join his government. Carney is the former head of the Bank of England and Bank of Canada. He was so well regarded after helping Canada dodge the worst of the global economic crisis that the U.K. named him the first foreigner to serve as governor of the Bank of England since it was founded in 1694. Carney has long been interested in entering politics and becoming the leader of the Liberal Party. It wasn't immediately clear if Carney has agreed to join Trudeau's Cabinet. 'This is quite a bombshell,' said Nelson Wiseman, professor emeritus at the University of Toronto. 'Freeland was not only finance minister but also deputy prime minister and, until a couple of years ago, was seen as Trudeau’s heir as Liberal leader and prime minister.' Wiseman said that leaks from the prime minister’s office suggest that she was a poor communicator and made Freeland’s status questionable. 'There was talk about her becoming foreign minister again and that would have been a good fit for her, but the stab in the back from the prime minister's office cast the die,' Wiseman said. Daniel Béland, a political science professor at McGill University in Montreal, also called it a political earthquake and not just because Freeland was the second most powerful official in government. 'Also because of how she resigned: by publishing a letter on social media that clearly criticizes the prime minister only hours before she was supposed to present the government’s fall economic statement,' Béland said. 'This is clearly a minority government on life support but, until now, the (opposition) NDP has rejected calls to pull the plug on it. It’s hard to know whether this resignation will force the NDP to rethink its strategy.' NDP leader Jagmeet Singh released a statement, but didn't say whether his party would vote to topple the government. 'While the Liberals fight with each other, I believe we should be fighting for Canadians jobs at risk from Donald Trump's tariffs,' Singh said in a statement. 'People deserve a government that fights for you for a change.'	https://apnews.com/article/finance-minister-chrystia-freeland-resigns-trudeau-a8355a62870edd962fee8138dc6bfc77	2024-12-16T05:42:53-08:00	
EU slaps sanctions on dozens more Russian officials and targets its shadow oil and gas fleet	BRUSSELS (AP) — The European Union on Monday imposed fresh sanctions on dozens of officials linked to Russia’s war on Ukraine, including two top North Korean defense officials, a military unit blamed for an attack on a Kyiv children’s hospital and the heads of companies in the energy sector. Russia’s vast shadow fleet of ships that Moscow is exploiting to skirt restrictions on transporting oil and gas, or carrying stolen Ukrainian grain, was also targeted. Fifty-two vessels were added to a growing list of ships banned from European ports and deprived of services. 'This package of sanctions is part of our response to weaken Russia’s war machine and those who are enabling this war, also including Chinese companies,' EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said. 'We will stand by the Ukrainian people on all fronts: humanitarian, economic, political, diplomatic and military.' In all, EU foreign ministers froze the assets of 54 people and 30 'entities,' which are usually companies, ministries, government agencies or other organizations. Travel bans were also imposed on officials. The EU has slapped several rounds of sanctions on Russia since President Vladimir Putin ordered his troops into Ukraine in February 2022. More than 2,300 officials and entities have now been impacted. North Korean Defense Minister No Kwang Chol was targeted for being directly involved in the military cooperation, including sending thousands of troops to Russia. Deputy Chief of the armed force's General Staff, Kim Yong Bok, was also hit for going to Russia to supervise their deployment. Several companies were also targeted this time, including Russian defense firms, a chemical plant and a civil Russian airline providing logistical support to the armed forces. Measures were also imposed on Chinese nationals accused of supplying drone parts and electronic equipment. Interests in China, India, Iran, Serbia and the United Arab Emirates accused of helping Russia to circumvent EU sanctions or trade restrictions on the movement of sensitive items that Moscow uses on drones and missiles were also hit.	https://apnews.com/article/eu-sanctions-russia-ukraine-korea-drones-ships-e21dc29c798b27bc4791c992a09fcfb8	2024-12-16T04:29:24-08:00	
Syrian rebel force deploys to a village near Damascus to stop looters	HUSSEINIYEH, Syria (AP) — A rebel force deployed to a village in southeastern Damascus to stop looters who swarmed a residential complex and set some apartments on fire. The raid by the rebel force comes a week after the fighters marched on the Syrian capital in their lightening offensive that forced Syrian President Bashar Assad to flee, ending five decades of his family rule. The rebel fighters have prioritized security in Damascus, where there was limited looting of private properties and attacks on security and government buildings. On Sunday, a rebel force arrived at the village of Husseiniyeh after looters, including women and children, emptied a residential complex, walking away with furniture, windows, food, copper wires and anything they can get their hands on. 'Our things were all looted. My house of 25 years is all looted. If they are not looting, they are burning. Everything. As you see. They started today with copper wires,' one resident said. He then stopped a child walking away with a box containing metal cables. Another resident, a school principal, said her house was looted and she was unable to stop it. She scolded the rebel force, and a fighter told her they will set up a checkpoint in the area to prevent the looters, who largely come from a nearby village. At times, looters fired grenades at apartments, setting them on fire. The residential complex houses former military officers and soldiers. The rebels opened fire, shooting at the wheels of looters' cars and next to the crowd to disperse it. No injuries were reported. They also called on looters still inside the buildings to hand themselves in. Some looters fled, still hanging on to their booty, while the rebels detained about a dozen. ___ Follow the AP’s Syria coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/syria	https://apnews.com/article/syria-rebels-looters-8b188ee618e4ce1a0ab8fec63cda0c07	2024-12-16T03:17:12-08:00	
Ukraine claims North Korean troops were killed as they fought alongside Russian forces	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukraine’s military intelligence agency claimed Monday that around 30 North Korean troops were killed or wounded in fighting against the Ukrainian army at the weekend in Russia’s Kursk border region. This is the first reported casualties since the Pentagon and Ukraine announced North Korea has sent about 10,000 troops to Russia to help it in the almost 3-year war. The casualties occurred around three villages in Kursk, where Russia has for four months been trying to quash a Ukrainian incursion, the agency, known by its acronym GUR, said in a public post on the Telegram messaging app. At least three North Korean servicemen went missing around another Kursk village, GUR said. It was not possible to independently verify the Ukrainian claims. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov referred related questions to the Russian Defense Ministry, which didn’t immediately comment. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has pledged unwavering support for Russia’s full-scale invasion of its neighbor under a mutual defense pact. The alliance gave a jolt to international relations, and Russian President Vladimir Putin said Monday that the planned deployment of U.S. intermediate-range missiles to Europe and Asia has brought new threats. 'In view of rising geopolitical tensions, we must take additional measures to ensure the security of Russia and our allies,' Putin told a meeting with top military brass. 'We are doing it accurately and in a balanced way to avoid being drawn into a full-scale arms race.' However, military analysts say the language barrier has bedeviled combat coordination between Russian and North Korean troops. 'The poor integration and ongoing communication problems between Russian and North Korean forces will likely continue to cause friction in Russian military operations in Kursk … in the near term,' the Institute for the Study of War, a Washington think tank, said late Sunday. On Nov. 5, Ukrainian officials said that their forces had for the first time engaged with North Korean units that had been recently deployed to help Russia. Ukraine seized land in Russia’s Kursk border region last August in what was the first occupation of Russian territory since World War II. The operation embarrassed the Kremlin and aimed to counter unceasingly glum news from the front line. The incursion hasn’t significantly changed the war’s dynamics. Over the past year, Russia has been on the front foot, with the exception of Kursk, and has been grinding deeper into eastern Ukraine's Donetsk region despite heavy losses. Russian Defense Minister Andrei Belousov said Monday the military has been making steady gains in Ukraine, claiming that they have accelerated recently, with Russian forces capturing about 30 square kilometers (11.5 square miles) of territory a day. — Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-north-korea-troops-33bf427736c5802fb97df41fdbf61396	2024-12-16T02:50:22-08:00

Prosecutors summon Kosovo's prime minister in a move his supporters say is politically motivated	PRISTINA, Kosovo (AP) — Kosovo's Special Prosecutor’s Office has summoned Prime Minister Albin Kurti Monday to testify in a case that remains unclear, with his supporters saying it’s a politically driven move as the country gears up for election. According to Liridona Kozmaqi, the spokeswoman for the prosecutor’s office, Kurti was on a trip abroad and that another date would be set for the summons. She declined to give details on the nature of the case. However, Kurti’s spokesman, Perparim Kryeziu, said in a Facebook post last week the premier was called to testify in a case under Article 414 of the Criminal Code, which regulates offenses related to 'abuse of official post or authority.' Kryeziu accused the summons of being politically motivated and 'an attempt to influence the outcome of the 2025 elections.' Kosovo will hold a parliamentary election on Feb. 9, a vote expected to be a key test for Kurti whose governing left-wing Self-Determination Movement Party won by a landslide in 2021. The main contenders for the coming election are the Democratic Party of Kosovo, whose main leaders are at The Hague tribunal accused of war crimes, and the Democratic League of Kosovo, the oldest party in the country that has lost much support after the death of its leader Ibrahim Rugova. Local polls show that Kurti’s party is the front-runner. The main issue overshadowing the election remains the stalled normalization talks with Serbia, which the European Union has facilitated since 2011, but with little progress. The talks are decisive toward the two countries’ membership in the bloc. Kosovo was a former Serbian province until a 78-day NATO bombing campaign in 1999 ended a war between Serbian government forces and ethnic Albanian separatists in Kosovo, which left about 13,000 dead, mainly ethnic Albanians, and pushed Serbian forces out. Serbia does not recognize Kosovo’s independence, proclaimed in 2008.	https://apnews.com/article/kosovo-prime-minister-kurti-abuse-of-post-d48d128d0bb1dce712625fb0a04b30b8	2024-12-16T01:53:36-08:00	
Rescuers in Italy working to free cave explorer trapped underground	MILAN (AP) — A major rescue operation was underway Monday in a cave northeast of the Italian city of Bergamo to free a woman who was injured in a fall and became trapped while exploring with eight other people. Ottavia Piana, 32, remained blocked deep inside the Bueno Fonteno cave, where the temperatures were ranging from 7 degrees Celsius to 8 degrees Celsius (44-46 degrees Fahrenheit) in high humidity. Piana, considered an expert cave explorer, was injured after falling some 5 meters (16 feet) Saturday evening during an expedition to map a kilometer (half a mile) of an uncharted branch of the cave, but rescuers said she is alert and responsive. She suffered multiple traumas, including to the face, ribs and knee, rescuers said. Members of her team reported her missing after reaching the surface Saturday evening, and rescuers reached her late Sunday. They are using small explosives in an attempt to breach the last 100 meters (yards) to reach her. A spokesman for rescue operation, Mauro Guiducci, said it was impossible to foresee how long it would take to free Piana. 'One thing is certain, these kinds of operations are very long,’’ Guiducci said, adding that a team of 20 technicians were operating inside the cave and dozens more were assisting above ground.	https://apnews.com/article/cave-rescue-spelunker-trapped-italy-ef44fbb290d811af56c8457fdc6ba5e7	2024-12-16T01:15:25-08:00	
Sri Lanka's president holds talks with Modi in India in first overseas visit	NEW DELHI (AP) — Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake was hosted Monday by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his first overseas visit since assuming office that focused on shoring up ties as concerns grew over China's influence in the region. Modi said India and Sri Lanka will establish electricity grid connectivity and a multi-product petroleum pipeline that will further boost investment and commercial links between the nations. The Sri Lankan leader arrived in New Delhi on Sunday on his first overseas trip since becoming president in September. He held meetings with India's External Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar and National Security Adviser Ajit Doval. At a press briefing attended by both leaders, Dissanayake said he would not allow Sri Lanka to be used in 'a manner that is detrimental to the interest of India.' 'The cooperation with India will certainly flourish and I want to reassure our continued support for India,' he said. India has been expanding its economic and defense ties with Sri Lanka amid concerns over China’s growing hold in the island nation. Beijing was once widely seen as having an upper hand with free-flowing loans and infrastructure investments in Sri Lanka. Even though China remains Sri Lanka’s largest bilateral lender, Colombo’s economic collapse in 2022 provided an opportunity for India, as New Delhi stepped in with massive financial and material assistance including food, fuel and medicines.

Death toll in Gaza Strip from Israel-Hamas war tops 45,000, Palestinians say	DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — The death toll in the Gaza Strip from the 14-month war between Israel and Hamas militants has topped 45,000 people, Palestinian health officials said Monday, with 52 dead arriving at hospitals across the bombed-out strip over the past 24 hours. The Gaza Health Ministry does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in its count, but it has said that more than half of the fatalities are women and children. The Israeli military says it has killed more than 17,000 militants, without providing evidence. With the death toll mounting ever higher, efforts to reach a ceasefire have picked up in recent weeks after repeatedly faltering. Qatar, Egypt and the United States have renewed their efforts to broker a deal at senior levels in recent days. Mediators have said there appears to be more willingness from both sides to conclude a ceasefire. The Health Ministry said 45,028 people have been killed and 106,962 have been wounded since the start of the war. It has said the real toll is higher because thousands of bodies are still buried under rubble or in areas that medics cannot access. The latest war has been by far the deadliest round of fighting between Israel and Hamas, with the death toll now amounting to roughly 2% of Gaza’s entire prewar population of about 2.3 million. A family is among the dead as another airstrike hits a shelter Among the dead reported in the overall toll were 10 people, including a family of four, who were killed in an overnight Israeli strike in Gaza City, Palestinian medics said. The strike late Sunday hit a house in Gaza City’s eastern Shijaiyah neighborhood, according to the Health Ministry’s emergency service. Rescuers recovered the bodies of 10 people from under the rubble, including those of two parents and their two children, it said. Israel claims Hamas is responsible for the civilian death toll because it operates from within civilian areas in the densely populated Gaza Strip. Rights groups and Palestinians say Israel has failed to take sufficient precautions to avoid civilian deaths. The war began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting another 250. Israel responded by heavy bombardment and a ground incursion into the Palestinian enclave. Around 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, at least a third of whom are believed to be dead. Most of the rest were released during a cease-fire last year. A separate strike on a school on Sunday in the southern city of Khan Younis killed at least 13 people, including six children and two women, according to Nasser Hospital where the bodies were taken. The hospital initially reported the strike had killed 16 people, but it later revised the death toll as the three other bodies had been from a separate strike that hit a house. Louise Wateridge, a spokeswoman for UNRWA, the United Nations relief agency for Palestinians, said she met with children injured in Sunday’s strike on the the school turned shelter. They included a 17-year-old girl who suffered a severe leg injury and shrapnel wounds. She survived along with her twin sister and three other sisters, Wateridge said. Their mother died and Wateridge said one of the sisters described 'how their mother’s bones were crushed under the rubble. There was nothing they could do to save her.' Wateridge also met with two siblings aged 2 and 5 at Nasser Hospital where the casualties were taken. Both children have severe head and body injuries, with 2-year-old Julia losing sight in her eye. 'There is nothing we can do. We are already waiting for the next attack,' Wateridge quoted a doctor as telling her. The Israeli military said it had 'conducted a precise strike on Hamas terrorists who were operating inside a command and control center embedded within a compound' that had served as a school in Khan Younis. It did not provide evidence. A Palestinian journalist killed in an airstrike is mourned In central Gaza's Nuseirat urban refugee camp, mourners gathered for the funeral of a Palestinian journalist working for the Qatari-based Al Jazeera TV network who was killed Sunday in a strike on a point for Gaza's civil defense agency. They carried his body through the street from the hospital, his blue bulletproof vest resting atop. The strike also killed three civil defense workers, including the local head of the agency, according to Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital. The civil defense is Gaza’s main rescue agency and operates under the Hamas-run government. Al Jazeera said Ahmad Baker Al-Louh, 39, had been covering rescue operations of a family wounded in an earlier bombing when he was killed. The International Federation of Journalists said last week that 104 journalists and media workers have been killed so far in 2024, with more than half of them perishing during the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip. The group said that since the Oct. 7, 2023, start of the war, at least 138 had been killed, including 55 Palestinian media professionals in the calendar year. The Israeli military said its strike had targeted Hamas and Islamic Jihad militants 'who were operating in a command and control center embedded in the offices of the ‘Civil Defense’ organization in Nuseirat.' It accused the journalist of having been a member of Islamic Jihad, an accusation his colleagues in Gaza denied. Gaza's civil defense also rejected the claims that militants had been operating from the site. 'We were stunned by the Israeli occupation statement,' Mahmoud al-Lawh, the journalist’s cousin, told The Associated Press. 'These claims are lies and misleading to cover up this crime.' ___ Magdy reported from Cairo ___ Follow AP’s war coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war	https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-news-12-16-2024-9f7c8f0df71dc4c97a6b31aed6e13304	2024-12-16T00:30:28-08:00	
France rushes help to Mayotte, where hundreds or even thousands died in Cyclone Chido	CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) — France was rushing help by ship and military aircraft to its poor overseas territory of Mayotte in the Indian Ocean on Monday after the island was shattered by its worst storm in nearly a century. Authorities in Mayotte fear hundreds and possibly thousands of people have died in Cyclone Chido, although the official death toll on Monday morning stood at 14. Rescue teams and medical personnel have been sent to the island off the east coast of Africa from France and from the nearby French territory of Reunion, as well as tons of supplies. French television station TF1 reported Monday morning that Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau had arrived in Mamoudzou, the capital of Mayotte. 'It will take days and days to establish the human toll,' he told French media. French authorities said more than 800 more personnel were expected to arrive in the coming days as rescuers comb through the devastation caused by Chido when it hit the densely populated archipelago of around 300,000 people on Saturday. Mayotte Prefect François-Xavier Bieuville, the top French government official in Mayotte, told local TV station Mayotte la 1ere on Sunday that the death toll was several hundred people and could even be in the thousands. He said Mayotte’s poor slums of metal shacks and other informal structures had suffered terrible damage and authorities were struggling to get an accurate count of the dead and injured after the worst cyclone to hit Mayotte since the 1930s. Entire neighborhoods have been flattened, while public infrastructure like the main airport and hospital have been badly damaged and the electricity supply has been knocked out, French authorities said. The damage to the airport control tower means only military aircraft can fly into Mayotte, complicating the response. Mayotte is France’s poorest department and is regarded as the poorest territory in the European Union, but it is a target for economic migration from even poorer countries like nearby Comoros and even Somalia because of a better standard of living and the French welfare system. Bieuville, the Mayotte prefect, said it would be extremely hard to count all the dead and many might never be recorded, partly due to the Muslim tradition of burying people within 24 hours of their deaths and also because of many undocumented migrants living on the island. Chido ripped through the southwestern Indian Ocean on Friday and Saturday, also affecting the nearby islands of Comoros and Madagascar. Mayotte was directly in the cyclone’s path, though, and took the brunt. Chido brought winds in excess of 220 kph (136 mph), according to the French weather service, making it a category 4 cyclone, the second strongest on the scale. It made landfall in Mozambique on the African mainland late Sunday, where authorities and aid agencies have said more than 2 million people may be impacted in another poor country where health facilities are already limited. Mozambique media reported three people had died in the north of the country where the cyclone made landfall, but said that was a very early toll. Further inland, Malawi and Zimbabwe have also made preparations for possible evacuations because of flooding as Chido continues its eastern trajectory, although the cyclone has weakened as it passes over land. December through to March is cyclone season in the southwestern Indian Ocean and southern Africa has been pummeled by a series of strong ones in recent years. Cyclone Idai in 2019 killed more than 1,300 people, mostly in Mozambique, Malawi and Zimbabwe. Cyclone Freddy left more than 1,000 dead across several countries in the Indian Ocean and southern Africa last year. —— AP Africa news: https://apnews.com/hub/africa	https://apnews.com/article/mayotte-cyclone-chido-climate-weather-43890b2cee0d90e67b6263f278782334	2024-12-16T00:21:45-08:00	
Middle East latest: Death toll from Israel-Hamas war tops 45,000. Israel strikes Syrian targets	Palestinian health officials said Monday the death toll from the Israel-Hamas war, now in its 14th month, topped 45,000 people. This comes as 52 dead arrived at hospitals across the bombed-out strip over the past 24 hours, including a family of four, in Gaza City overnight, according to Palestinian medics. The Israel-Hamas war erupted on Oct. 7 last year when Hamas militants stormed southern Israel, killing some 1, 200 people and taking another 250 hostage. Israel responded with heavy bombardment and a ground incursion into the Gaza Strip. Meanwhile, a UK-based war monitor says Israeli airstrikes early Monday hit missile warehouses in Syria and called it the 'most violent strikes' since 2012. Israel has been pounding what it says are military sites in Syria after the dramatic collapse of President Bashar Assad’s rule, wiping out air defenses and most of the arsenal of the former Syrian army. Israeli troops have also seized a border buffer zone, sparking condemnation, with critics accusing Israel of violating the 1974 ceasefire and possibly exploiting the chaos in Syria for a land grab. The Assad family’s rule, which lasted more than half a century, collapsed just over a week ago following a stunning rebel advance. The new Syrian administration, led by the former insurgents who toppled Assad, has complained to the U.N. Security Council about the Israeli bombardment and incursions into Syrian territory in the Golan Heights. However, it has also said it does not want a military confrontation with Israel. Here is the latest: Assad says he wanted to keep fighting but Russians evacuated him DAMASCUS, Syria — Ousted Syrian leader Bashar Assad says he had no plans to leave the country after the fall of Damascus a week ago but the Russian military evacuated him after their base in western Syria came under attack. The comments are the first by Assad since he was overthrown by insurgent groups. Assad said in a statement on his Facebook page that he left Damascus on the morning of Dec. 8, hours after insurgents stormed the capital. He said he left in coordination with Russian allies to the Russian base in the coastal province of Latakia, where he planned to keep fighting. Assad said that after the Russian base came under attack by drones, the Russians decided to move him on the night of Dec. 8 to Russia. 'I did not leave the country as part of a plan as it was reported earlier,' Assad said. Death toll from Israel-Hamas war tops 45,000 Health officials in the Gaza Strip say the death toll from the 14-month war between Israel and Hamas militants has reached 45,028 people. The Gaza Health Ministry does not distinguish between civilians and combatants. It said more than half of the fatalities were women and children. The Israeli military says it has killed more than 17,000 militants, without providing evidence. The Health Ministry also said 106,962 have been wounded since the start of the war. Turkey condemns Israeli plan to expand settlements in the occupied Golan Heights ANKARA, Turkey — A Turkish Foreign Ministry statement said Monday the decision marked a 'new stage in Israel’s goal of expanding its borders through occupation,' adding that Ankara was concerned that the move would harm efforts to establish peace and stability in Syria. 'The international community must show the necessary reaction to Israel and ensure that the illegal activities of (Prime Minister Benjamin) Netanyahu’s government come to an end,' the statement read. Qatar also condemned the decision, calling it 'a new episode in a series of Israeli aggressions on Syrian territories and a blatant violation of international law.' The Israeli government approved Netanyahu’s plan on Sunday with the aim to encourage population growth in the area. Israel captured the Golan Heights in the 1967 Mideast war and annexed it, though the international community except for the U.S. regards it as occupied. Israeli figures show the remote territory is home to about 50,000 people, about half of them Jewish Israelis and the other half Arab Druze, many of whom still consider themselves Syrians. Mourners in Gaza gather for funeral of Al Jazeera journalist DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — In central Gaza’s Nuseirat urban refugee camp, mourners carried Monday the body of Ahmad Baker Al-Louh, 39, a Palestinian journalist working for Al Jazeera, from the hospital through the streets. His blue bulletproof vest rested atop him. Al-Louh was killed the day before in a strike on a point for Gaza’s civil defense agency and Al Jazeera said had been covering rescue operations of a family wounded in an earlier bombing when he was killed. Sunday’s strike also killed three civil defense workers, including the local head of the agency, according to al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital. The civil defense is Gaza’s main rescue agency and operates under the Hamas-run government. Israeli strike kills 10 in Gaza City DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — The 10 included a family of four, Palestinian medics said Monday, as the Israel-Hamas war raged on for the 14th month in the Gaza Strip. The strike late Sunday hit a house in Gaza City’s eastern Shijaiyah neighborhood, according to the Health Ministry’s ambulance and emergency service. Rescuers recovered the bodies of 10 people from under the rubble, including those of two parents and their two children, it said. US embassy advises Americans to leave Syria DAMASCUS, Syria — The U.S. embassy in Damascus advised Americans to leave Syria, saying the security situation there continues to be volatile and unpredictable with armed conflict and 'terrorism throughout the country.' The embassy, which has been closed since 2012, posted a statement on X, warning U.S. citizens who were unable to leave the country to prepare 'contingency plans for emergency situations.' It didn't give further details. The statement also said that the U.S. government is unable to provide any routine or emergency consular services to U.S. citizens and those who need 'emergency assistance to depart should contact the U.S. Embassy in the country they plan to enter.' Sleeper cells of the Islamic State group have claimed responsibility for deadly attacks over the past months in different parts of Syria. Despite their defeat in March 2019, the extremists still pose a threat in the war-torn country. War monitor says Israel targets missile warehouses DAMASCUS, Syria — The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based war monitor, reported early Monday that Israeli airstrikes pounded missile warehouses and other former Syrian army sites along Syria’s coast in the 'most violent strikes in the Syrian coast region since the beginning of the (Israeli) strikes in 2012.' The Israeli military declined to comment on the strikes. The observatory said that 'violent explosions' were heard in the coastal city of Tartous 'as a result of the successive strikes and the flying of ground-to-ground missiles from the warehouses.'	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-syria-news-16-december-2024-4ed0ec24506a1b78f0561ed0cc8f0994	2024-12-15T22:57:46-08:00	
For the first time in 8 years, a US Navy ship makes a port call in Cambodia, a top Chinese ally	SIHANOUKVILLE, Cambodia (AP) — A U.S. Navy warship arrived Monday in Cambodia, the first such visit in eight years to a nation that is China’s close ally in Southeast Asia. Cambodia's government has suggested the port call reflects an upgrade in often-strained relations. The USS Savannah docked at the port of Sihanoukville on the Gulf of Thailand for a five-day visit. The Savannah, classed as a Littoral Combat Ship, carries a crew of 103. 'It’s great to be back, returning U.S. presence to here after eight years,' the ship’s commanding officer, Daniel A. Sledz, said in brief remarks to reporters. He was given a bouquet of flowers by a Cambodian officer and shook hands with a line of her colleagues. The United States for many years has had rocky relations with Cambodia, criticizing its government for political repression and human rights violations. There is particular concern about its close ties with China, which Washington fears may get exclusive access to a Cambodian naval base on the Gulf of Thailand, not far from where the Savannah docked. Recently, there seem to have been moves to patch up relations. Cambodia’s Ministry of National Defense said last week that the visit was scheduled after a U.S. request for a port call, and would 'strengthen and expand the bonds of friendship as well as promote bilateral cooperation' between the two nations. Two days before that, Cambodia’s foreign ministry noted 'positive momentum of bilateral ties and cooperation' and 'the reinvigoration of military-to-military cooperation' between Cambodia and the U.S. U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin visited Cambodia in early June, where he held talks with Prime Minister Hun Manet and other senior officials. He also met with Cambodian alumni of U.S. military training programs. Hun Manet himself is a graduate of the U.S. Military Academy at West Point. The U.S. Defense Department said at the time that Austin's discussions concerned 'opportunities to strengthen the U.S.-Cambodia bilateral defense relationship in support of regional peace and security,' and other matters. But Washington remains concerned that the upgrading of Cambodia’s Ream Naval Base near Sihanoukville will serve Beijing’s strategic interests in the region. The U.S. and others suggest China’s navy is establishing a permanent base at Ream, which would give it easier access to the Malacca Strait, a critical shipping route between the South China Sea and the Indian Ocean. Controversy over the Chinese activity at Ream initially arose in 2019 when The Wall Street Journal reported that an early draft of an agreement seen by U.S. officials would allow China 30-year use of the base, where it would be able to post military personnel, store weapons and berth warships. Cambodia’s government has denied such an agreement or any intention to grant China special privileges at the base, though Beijing has funded its expansion. In September, Cambodia’s Defense Ministry said that China is giving its navy two warships of the type it has had docked there for months. China is set to hand over two newly built Type 56 corvettes — smaller vessels typically used for coastal patrols — next year at the earliest, after Cambodia requested China’s support. Cambodia’s defense ministry said the Savannah’s port call will include 'a working meeting with the commander of the Ream Naval Base,' as well as meetings with provincial officials and 'a friendship sports competition between the crews of the U.S. Navy and the Cambodian Navy.' Cambodian Navy Capt. Mean Savoeun, deputy commander of the Ream Naval Base, was among those dockside welcoming the Savannah to Sihanoukville. He said he was happy to see the good relationship between Cambodia and the U.S., especially their navies, and believed the visit will bring closer diplomatic cooperation.	https://apnews.com/article/china-ream-navy-base-sihanoukville-6057b6416c9d6622e5beebd7f22b8a70	2024-12-15T22:42:59-08:00	
Pakistan begins last anti-polio vaccination campaign of the year after a surge in cases	ISLAMABAD (AP) — Pakistan began on Monday its last nationwide vaccination campaign for the year to protect 45 million children from polio after a surge in new cases hampered efforts to stop the disease, officials said. According to the World Health Organization, Pakistan and neighboring Afghanistan remain the only two countries where the potentially fatal, paralyzing virus hasn’t been stopped, Pakistan has reported 63 confirmed cases since January. Ayesha Raza Farooq, the prime minister’s adviser for the polio eradication program, said the anti-polio drive will continue until December 22. 'As a mother, I am appealing to you to open your doors for health workers,' she said. Pakistan regularly launches such campaigns despite violence affecting medical personnel who oversee the vaccinations and security forces escorting them. Militants falsely claim that vaccination campaigns are a Western conspiracy to sterilize children. Authorities deployed thousands of police officers to protect the health workers following intelligence reports that insurgents could target them. However, gunmen opened fire Monday on police escorting polio workers in Karak, a city in the restive Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, killing a police officer and wounding a health worker, local police official Ayaz Khan said. More than 200 polio workers and police assigned for their protection have been killed since the 1990s, according to health officials and authorities. The latest anti-polio drive campaign began a day after Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif met with medical staff and vowed that Pakistan would win the war against polio. Afghanistan reported at least 23 confirmed cases in 2024, according to data from the World Health Organization. In September, the Afghan Taliban suddenly stopped a door-to-door vaccination campaign in Afghanistan, a devastating setback for polio eradication as the virus is one of the world’s most infectious and any unvaccinated groups of children where the virus is spreading could undo years of progress.	https://apnews.com/article/pakistan-polio-vaccination-campaign-surge-cases-78b8313185c8ee69e7713af11d5beb73	2024-12-15T22:07:22-08:00	
Stock market today: Asian shares fall as China reports lackluster data, while bitcoin hits new highs	BANGKOK (AP) — Shares retreated Monday in Asia after China reported lackluster economic indicators for November, while bitcoin surged to fresh highs, topping $106,000. Oil prices fell and U.S. futures were little changed. Bitcoin was trading at $104,948 early Monday, up 3.4% but down from an earlier high of $106,495. The price of the cryptocurrency has surged since the election in November given U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's bitcoin-friendly stance. Trump signaled a lighter regulatory approach to digital currencies with his choice of crypto advocate Paul Atkins to be the next chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Bitcoin was trading below $70,000 before the Nov. 5 election. A report Monday showed Chinese retail sales slowed in November, while growth in factory output was flat and home sales declined. The report said the economy and employment were stable, but noted a complicated 'external environment,' reflecting unease over the outlook in coming months once U.S. President-elect Donald Trump takes office, potentially delivering on promises to sharply hike tariffs on imports from China. Japan's Nikkei 225 index edged 0.1% lower, to 39,438.74, while the Hang Seng in Hong Kong lost 0.8% to 19,821.24. The Shanghai Composite index was almost unchanged, at 3,390.91. South Korea's Kospi lost 0.3% to 2,486.47 as South Korean law enforcement authorities were pushing to summon impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol for questioning over his short-lived martial law decree and the Constitutional Court met to discuss whether to remove him from office or reinstate him. Taiwan's Taiex edged 0.1% higher, while the Sensex in India fell 0.4%. Thailand's SET dropped 0.9%. On Friday, major stock indexes on Wall Street drifted to a mixed finish Friday, capping a rare bumpy week for the market. The S&amp;P 500 ended essentially flat, down less than 0.1% at 6,051.09. The benchmark index posted a loss for the week, its first after three straight weekly gains. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.2% to 43,828.06, while the Nasdaq composite rose 0.1% to 19,926.72, ending just below the record high it set on Wednesday. There were more than twice as many decliners than gainers on the New York Stock Exchange. Gains in technology stocks helped temper losses in communication services, financials and other sectors of the market. Broadcom surged 24.4% for the biggest gain in the S&amp;P 500 after the semiconductor company beat Wall Street’s profit targets and gave a glowing forecast, highlighting its artificial intelligence products. The company also raised its dividend. But some tech stocks were a drag on the market. Nvidia fell 2.2%, Meta Platforms dropped 1.7% and Google parent Alphabet slid 1.1%. Among the market's other decliners were Airbnb, which fell 4.7% for the biggest loss in the S&amp;P 500, and Charles Schwab, which closed 4% lower. Furniture and housewares company RH, formerly known as Restoration Hardware, surged 17% after raising its forecast for revenue growth for the year. Wall Street's rally stalled this week amid mixed economic reports and ahead of the Federal Reserve's last meeting of the year. The central bank is widely expected to cut interest rates for a third time since September when it meets this week. Expectations of a series of rate cuts has driven the S&amp;P 500 to 57 all-time highs so far this year. The Fed has been lowering its benchmark interest rate after aggressively hiking rates to tame inflation. It raised rates from near-zero in early 2022 to a two-decade high by the middle of 2023. Inflation eased under pressure from higher interest rates, nearly to the central bank's 2% target. The economy, including consumer spending and employment, held strong despite the squeeze from inflation and high borrowing costs. A slowing job market, though, has helped push a long-awaited reversal of the Fed's policy. In other dealings early Monday, U.S. benchmark crude oil lost 47 cents to $70.82 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, lost 36 cents to $74.13 per barrel. The U.S. dollar fell to 153.62 Japanese yen from 153.71 yen. The euro rose to $1.0516 from $1.0491.	https://apnews.com/article/stocks-markets-china-bitcoin-rates-744e69dbc29cc0836d2b2401a4c2bcda	2024-12-15T21:16:20-08:00	
China retail sales slow as consumers hold back, while home prices fall	BANGKOK (AP) — Chinese retail sales slowed in November and housing prices fell, the government said Monday, with demand still lackluster despite a flurry of stimulus measures over the past few months. The report came just a few days after top leaders ended an annual planning meeting in Beijing that produced no major new policy initiatives but included promises to do more to encourage people and businesses to spend more more. Analysts said ruling Communist Party leaders were leaving room to do more if U.S. President-elect Donald Trump delivers on his promises to raise tariffs on imports from China once he takes office. The National Bureau of Statistics reported that the economy was stable, with the unemployment remaining at 5%. 'However, we must also see that the external environment is more complicated, domestic demand is insufficient, some enterprises are facing difficulties in production and operation, and the foundation for the sustained recovery of the economy still needs to be consolidated,' Fu Linghui, a spokesperson for the National Bureau of Statistics, told reporters. Retail sales rose 3% from a year earlier, down from October's 4.8% increase and below the 3.5% annual rate in January-November. Consumers held back on spending on non-essentials like cosmetics, alcohol and clothing, though purchases of appliances and vehicles surged thanks to a government program to pay subsidies to entice people to replace older appliances and cars with newer, energy efficient versions and electric vehicles. Auto sales rose 6.6% in November over a year earlier, but have fallen 0.7% year-on-year so far this year. Sales of appliances jumped more than 22%, and have climbed 9.6% so far this year. The cash-for-clunkers and appliance recycling programs have helped keep factories humming, as has President Xi Jinping's emphasis on building up high-tech industries for 'high-quality' development. That has supported manufacturing: growth in factory output ticked up to 5.4% year-on-year from 5.3% in October. Chinese leaders pledged to take a more proactive approach in pepping up the economy after their two-day planning meeting last week, but gave no details on stimulus measures. Also Monday, the government announced a plan to upgrade the entire retail system in the coming five years, saying projects to revamp retail outlets would be rolled out across the country, providing 'business landmarks' including shopping, food and entertainment venues. The plans as outlined in state media make no mention of the key factors that economists say are leading many Chinese families to scrimp and save rather than spend: insecurity about jobs, weaker prices for property and other assets and low incomes. 'Ultimately, consumption will be driven by income growth and the propensity to save,' Oxford Economics said in a report. 'The outlook for the former is cautious and savings are being driven by concerns about the economic outlook.' Investment in fixed assets like factories and in housing construction slowed in November. Property prices fell and home sales also declined in most cities, the statistics bureau said, as China endures a downturn in its real estate market after regulators cracked down on excessive borrowing by developers that plunged the whole industry into crisis. The disruptions to jobs and businesses during the COVID-19 pandemic have further weighed on the world's second-largest economy. 'China’s economy appears to have slowed last month, despite tailwinds from recent policy easing,' Julian Evans-Pritchard of Capital Economics said in a report. 'Growth still looks on course to pick up this quarter, but the disappointing November data underscores the challenge policymakers face in engineering a sustained rebound in growth.' Chinese stocks had climbed recently on renewed hopes for a stronger dose of stimulus to help counter the weak consumer sentiment that has kept the economy growing this year at a rate slightly slower than the government’s official target of about 5%. On Monday, Hong Kong's Hang Seng index fell 1% while the Shanghai Composite index slipped 0.2%. The Hang Seng property index fell 1.3%. Evans-Pritchard said the impacts of a raft of policies to ease credit and support the economy would likely pick up in coming months. 'But we doubt that stimulus can deliver anything more than a short-lived improvement, not least because the current strength of export demand is unlikely to last once President Trump starts to put some of his tariff threats into action.' ___ Associated Press researcher Yu Bing contributed.	https://apnews.com/article/china-economy-trump-tariffs-057555a36a1616e3e819d51c9a2a0383	2024-12-15T20:16:23-08:00	
Germany's Scholz faces a confidence vote. It's expected to lead to an election in February	BERLIN (AP) — Chancellor Olaf Scholz faces a confidence vote in the German parliament on Monday that he's expected to lose, paving the way for the European Union's most populous member and biggest economy to hold an early election in February. Scholz's notoriously rancorous three-party government collapsed on Nov. 6 when the chancellor fired his finance minister in a long-running dispute over how to revitalize Germany’s stagnant economy, and the minister's pro-business party quit the coalition. That left the remaining two center-left partners without a majority in parliament. Leaders of several major parties then agreed that a parliamentary election should be held on Feb. 23, seven months earlier than originally planned. Post-World War II Germany's constitution doesn't allow parliament's lower house, or Bundestag, to dissolve itself — so a confidence vote is needed to set in motion the early election. What is likely to happen? Scholz's Social Democrats hold 207 seats in the Bundestag and are expected to vote for the chancellor. Their remaining coalition partners, the environmentalist Greens, have 117 and plan to abstain. That should mean Scholz gets nowhere near the majority of 367 in the 733-seat chamber needed to win the confidence vote. If Scholz loses, it will up to up to President Frank-Walter Steinmeier to decide whether to dissolve the Bundestag. Steinmeier, who said last month that 'this country needs stable majorities and a government that is capable of acting,' has 21 days to make that decision. Once parliament is dissolved, the election must be held within 60 days. In practice, the campaign is already well underway. Who is in the race? As he formally requested the confidence vote on Wednesday, Scholz said that voters will 'decide in the election how we answer the big questions that we face.' Those, he said, include whether Germany decides to 'invest strongly in our future,' secure jobs and modernize its industry, keep pension levels stable and 'come closer to a just peace in Ukraine without Germany being drawn into the war.' Germany has become Ukraine’s biggest military supplier in Europe, but Scholz also has refused to supply long-range Taurus cruise missiles over concerns of escalating the war with Russia. Center-right challenger Friedrich Merz on Saturday predicted 'one of the hardest election campaigns' in modern German history, as Scholz's Social Democrats 'have their backs to the wall.' He said that it's crucial to make the economy more competitive, because 'the competitiveness of our economy is the precondition for everything else.' Polls show Scholz’s party trailing behind Merz's main opposition Union bloc. Vice Chancellor Robert Habeck, whose Greens are further back, is also bidding for the top job. The far-right Alternative for Germany, which is polling strongly, has nominated Alice Weidel as its candidate for chancellor but has no chance of taking the job because other parties refuse to work with it. Confidence votes are rare in Germany, a country of 83 million people that prizes stability. This is only the sixth time in its postwar history that a chancellor has called one. The last was in 2005, when then-Chancellor Gerhard Schröder engineered an early election that was narrowly won by center-right challenger Angela Merkel.	https://apnews.com/article/germany-scholz-confidence-vote-parliament-election-87c6c0c64726eefaa95d9c46dae611dc	2024-12-15T20:01:44-08:00	
As Trump threatens mass deportations, Central America braces for an influx of vulnerable migrants	SAN PEDRO SULA, Honduras (AP) — As dozens of deported migrants pack into a sweltering airport facility in San Pedro Sula, Norma sits under fluorescent lights clutching a foam cup of coffee and a small plate of eggs – all that was waiting for her in Honduras. The 69-year-old Honduran mother had never imagined leaving her Central American country. But then came the anonymous death threats to her and her children and the armed men who showed up at her doorstep threatening to kill her, just like they had killed one of her relatives days earlier. Norma, who requested anonymity out of concern for her safety, spent her life savings of $10,000 on a one-way trip north at the end of October with her daughter and granddaughter. But after her asylum petitions to the U.S. were rejected, they were loaded onto a deportation flight. Now, she's back in Honduras within reach of the same gang, stuck in a cycle of violence and economic precarity that haunts deportees like her. 'They can find us in every corner of Honduras,' she said in the migrant processing facility. 'We’re praying for God’s protection, because we don’t expect anything from the government.' Now, as U.S. President-elect Donald Trump is set to take office in January with a promise of carrying out mass deportations, Honduras and other Central American countries people have fled for generations are bracing for a potential influx of vulnerable migrants — a situation they are ill-prepared to handle. ‘We don’t have the capacity' Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador, which have the largest number of people living illegally in the U.S., after Mexico, could be among the first and most heavily impacted by mass deportations, said Jason Houser, former Immigration &amp; Customs Enforcement chief of staff in the Biden administration. Because countries like Venezuela refuse to accept deportation flights from the U.S., Houser suggests that the Trump administration may prioritize the deportation of 'the most vulnerable' migrants from those countries who have removal orders but no criminal record, in an effort to rapidly increase deportation numbers. 'Hondurans, Guatemalans, Salvadorans need to be very, very nervous because (Trump officials) are going to press the bounds of the law,' said Houser. Migrants and networks aiding deportees in those Northern Triangle countries worry their return could thrust them into even deeper economic and humanitarian crises, fueling migration down the line. 'We don’t have the capacity' to take so many people, said Antonio García, Honduras' deputy foreign minister. 'There’s very little here for deportees.' People who return, he said, 'are the last to be taken care of.' Making their way back to the US Since 2015, Honduras has received around half a million deportees. They climb down from planes and buses to be greeted with coffee, small plates of food and bags of toothpaste and deodorant. While some breathe a sigh of relief, free from harsh conditions in U.S. detention facilities, others cry, gripped with panic. 'We don’t know what we’ll do, what comes next,' said one woman in a cluster of deportees waiting for their names to be called by a man clacking at a keyboard. Approximately 560,000 Hondurans, about 5% of the country's population, live in the U.S. without legal status, according to U.S. government figures. Of those, migration experts estimate about 150,000 can be tracked down and rapidly expelled. While García said the government offers services to help returnees, most are released with little aid into a country gripped by gangs. They have few options for work to pay off crippling debts. Others like Norma have nowhere to go, unable to return home because of the gang members circling her home. Norma said she’s unsure of why they were targeted, but she believes it was because the relative who was killed had problems with a gang. Despite the crackdown, García estimates up to 40% of Honduran deportees make their way back to the U.S. A looming humanitarian crisis Larissa Martínez, 31, is among those who have struggled to reintegrate into Honduran society after being deported from the U.S. in 2021 with her three children. Driven by economic desperation and the absence of her husband, who had migrated and left her for another woman, the single mother sought a better life in the U.S. Since her return to Honduras, Martínez has spent the past three years searching for a job, not just to support her kids, but also to pay off the $5,000 she owes to relatives for the trip north. Her efforts have been unsuccessful. She built a wobbly wooden home tucked away in the hilly fringes of San Pedro Sula, where she sells meat and cheese to get by, but sales have been slim and tropical rains have eaten away at the flimsy walls where they sleep. So she's begun to repeat a chant in her head: 'If I don’t find work in December, I’ll leave in January.' César Muñoz, a leader at Mennonite Social Action Commission, said Honduran authorities have abandoned deportees like Martínez, leaving organizations like his to step in. But with three deportation flights arriving weekly, aid networks are already stretched thin. A significant uptick could leave aid networks, migrants and their families reeling. Meanwhile, countries like Honduras, heavily reliant on remittances from the U.S., could face severe economic consequences as this vital lifeline is cut. 'We’re at the brink of a new humanitarian crisis,' Muñoz said. Trump’s return has been met with a range of reactions by Latin American nations connected to the U.S. through migration and trade. Guatemala, a country with more than 750,000 citizens living unauthorized in the U.S. , announced in November it was working on a strategy to take on potential mass deportations. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said Mexico is already beefing up legal services in its U.S. consulates and that she would ask Trump to deport non-Mexicans directly to their countries of origin. Honduras’ Deputy Foreign Minister García expressed skepticism about Trump’s threat, citing the economic benefits immigrants provide to the U.S. economy and the logistical challenges of mass deportations. Aid leaders like Muñoz say Honduras isn’t sufficiently preparing for a potential surge in deportations. Even with a crackdown by Trump it would be 'impossible' to stop people from migrating, García said. Driven by poverty, violence and the hope for a better life, clusters of deportees climb aboard buses on their way back to the U.S. As deportations by both U.S. and Mexican authorities spike, smugglers are offering migrants packages in which they get three tries to make it north. If migrants get captured on their journey and sent back home, they still have two chances to get to the U.S. Freshly returned to Honduras, 26-year-old Kimberly Orellana said she spent three months detained in a Texas facility before being sent back to San Pedro Sula, where she waited in a bus station for her mother to pick her up. Yet, she was already planning to return, saying she had no choice: her 4-year-old daughter Marcelle was waiting for her, cared for by a friend in North Carolina. The two were separated by smugglers crossing the Rio Grande, in hopes to increase their chances of successfully crossing over. Orellana vowed to her daughter that they would be reunited. 'Mami, are you sure you’re coming?' Marcelle asks her over the phone. 'Now, being here it’s difficult to know if I’ll ever be able to follow through with that promise,' Orellana said, clinging to her Honduran passport. 'I have to try again. … My daughter is all I have.' ____ Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america	https://apnews.com/article/honduras-trump-mass-deportations-central-america-immigration-c28e71c590a9f3df2d607df13b956656	2024-12-15T19:17:21-08:00	
Zakir Hussain, one of India's most accomplished classical musicians, dies at 73	NEW DELHI (AP) — Zakir Hussain, one of India's most accomplished classical musicians who defied genres and introduced tabla to global audiences, died on Sunday. He was 73. The Indian classical music icon died from idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, a chronic lung disease, at a hospital in San Francisco, his family said in a statement. 'His prolific work as a teacher, mentor and educator has left an indelible mark on countless musicians. He hoped to inspire the next generation to go further. He leaves behind an unparalleled legacy as a cultural ambassador and one of the greatest musicians of all time,' the statement read. Hussain was the most recognizable exponent of tabla, a pair of hand drums that is the main percussion instrument in Indian classical music. Considered the greatest tabla player of his generation, Hussain had a career that spanned six decades in which he collaborated with the likes of singer-songwriter George Harrison, jazz saxophonist Charles Lloyd, drummer Mickey Hart and cellist Yo-Yo Ma. The son of legendary tabla artist Alla Rakha, Hussain was born in 1951 in Mumbai and was taught how to play the instrument by his father at the age of 7. A child prodigy, he was touring by age 12 and performing alongside India’s classical music legends during his teens. In an interview that was shared widely on social media in India, Hussain says his father welcomed him into the world after he was born by speaking tabla rhythms into his ears. 'I was brought home, handed over to my dad in his arms. The tradition was that the father is supposed to recite a prayer in the baby’s ear ... So he takes me in his arms, puts his lips to my ear and recites the tabla rhythms into my ears,' Hussain says in the interview, verbally imitating the rhythmic pattern of the instrument. Both Alla Rakha and Hussain were given the honorific 'Ustad,' an Urdu word that means master. In 1973, Hussain formed the Indian jazz fusion band 'Shakti' with jazz guitarist John McLaughlin. The band played acoustic fusion music that combined Indian music with elements of jazz, introducing a new sound to Western audiences. In 2024, Hussain became the first musician from India to win three Grammy awards in the same year. Hussain’s 'Shakti' won Best Global Music Album, and his collaboration with Edgar Meyer, Béla Fleck and flutist Rakesh Chaurasia won Best Global Music Performance and Best Contemporary Instrumental Album. He had earlier won a Grammy in 2009. In 2023, Hussain received the Padma Vibhushan, India’s second-highest civilian award. Prime Minister Narendra Modi called Hussain a 'true genius who revolutionized the world of Indian classical music' and 'an icon of cultural unity.' 'He also brought the tabla to the global stage, captivating millions with his unparalleled rhythm,' Modi wrote in a post on social platform X. Hussain is survived by his wife and two daughters.	https://apnews.com/article/india-zakir-hussain-tabla-musician-obituary-4e6b09e2a85a35e417d486188c433fe2	2024-12-15T19:12:45-08:00	
Filipino woman who was on death row in Indonesia will return home after almost 15 years in prison	YOGYAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) — A Filipino woman who was on death row in Indonesia — and was nearly executed by firing squad in 2015 — was moved late Sunday to a female prison in Indonesia’s capital, from where she will be flown back to her home country. Mary Jane Veloso, who spent almost 15 years in an Indonesian prison for drug trafficking, was allowed to return home after Indonesia and the Philippines signed a 'practical arrangement' deal on Dec. 6, after a decade of pleading from Manila. In a tearful interview with The Associated Press on Tuesday, Veloso described the decision as being 'like a miracle when I have lost all hope.' 'For almost 15 years I was separated from my children and parents, and I could not see my children grow up,' she said. 'I wish to be given an opportunity to take care of my children and to be close to my parents.' Veloso, who will turn 40 next month, was arrested in 2010 at an airport in the Indonesian city of Yogyakarta, where officials discovered about 2.6 kilograms (5.7 pounds) of heroin hidden in her luggage. The single mother of two sons was convicted and sentenced to death. Veloso has maintained her innocence throughout her 14 years of incarceration. She has spent her time in prison designing Indonesian batik clothing, painting, tailoring and learning other skills. Just before midnight on Sunday, she was escorted through a crush of reporters outside a female prison in Yogyakarta into a waiting van that took her to Jakarta, about 460 kilometers (285 miles) away. Wearing a black T-shirt and dark pants, she made only a brief comment to reporters, saying, 'I’m so happy... Thank you so much and Merry Christmas!' from behind the vehicle's window. Veloso’s case caused a public outcry in the Philippines. She traveled to Indonesia in 2010 where her recruiter, Maria Kristina Sergio, reportedly told her a job as a domestic worker awaited her. Sergio also allegedly provided the suitcase where the drugs were found. In 2015, Indonesia moved Veloso to an island prison where she and eight other drug convicts were scheduled to be executed by firing squad despite objections from Australia, Brazil, France, Ghana and Nigeria. Indonesia executed the eight other convicts, and Veloso was granted a stay of execution because Sergio was arrested in the Philippines just two days ahead of her scheduled execution. The reprieve provided an opportunity for Veloso’s testimony to expose how a criminal syndicate duped her into being an unwitting accomplice and courier in drug trafficking. Yogyakarta female prison’s chief warden, Evi Loliancy, said Veloso was involved in various prison activities arranged by correctional officers, including organizing fashion shows featuring designs by inmates and learning how to dance. 'Mary Jane loves helping her fellow inmates, and she is able to motivate them to be creative,' Loliancy said. 'She will miss us so much and so do we here.' She said Veloso was very happy when she learned that she would be reunited with her family, but also a bit nervous and sad when she was about to leave. 'But we all cheered her on and wish all the best for her,' Loliancy said. Veloso will need to stay for a few days at the Pondok Bambu female prison in Jakarta while waiting for her flight tickets and travel documents, said Sohibur Rachman, an official at the Ministry of Immigration and Corrections. Rachman said his ministry was coordinating with the Philippine Embassy in Jakarta on repatriating Veloso. He has not said when her return will take place but unconfirmed reports said her flight to Manila is scheduled for early Wednesday. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime says Indonesia is a major drug smuggling hub despite having some of the strictest drug laws in the world, in part because international drug syndicates target its young population. Indonesia’s last executions were carried out in July 2016, when an Indonesian and three foreigners were shot by firing squad. About 530 people are on death row in Indonesia, mostly for drug-related crimes, including 96 foreigners, the Ministry of Immigration and Corrections’ data showed as of last month. Five Australians who spent almost 20 years in Indonesian prisons for heroin trafficking returned to Australia on Sunday under a deal struck between the Indonesian and Australian governments. Indonesia recently agreed in principle to return a French national to his home country. ___ Karmini reported from Jakarta, Indonesia.

South Korean investigators push to summon impeached President Yoon, as court set determine his fate	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korean law enforcement authorities are pushing to summon impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol for questioning over his short-lived martial law decree as the Constitutional Court began its first meeting Monday on Yoon’s case to determine whether to remove him from office or reinstate him. A joint investigative team involving police, an anti-corruption agency and the Defense Ministry said it plans to convey a request to Yoon’s office that he appear for questioning on Wednesday, as they expand a probe into whether his ill-conceived power grab amounted to rebellion. Son Yeong-jo, an investigator with the Corruption Investigation Office for High-Ranking Officials, said the team plans to question Yoon on charges of rebellion and abuse of power. He declined to provide specifics when asked how investigators would respond if Yoon refuses to appear. Son said the team tried to deliver the summons request to the presidential office but was rerouted to Yoon’s personal residence after presidential secretarial staff claimed they were unsure whether conveying the request to the impeached president was part of their duties. Yoon was impeached by the opposition-controlled National Assembly on Saturday over his Dec. 3 martial law decree. His presidential powers will be suspended until the Constitutional Court decides whether to formally remove him from office or reinstate him. If Yoon is dismissed, a national election to choose his successor must be held within 60 days. Yoon has justified his martial law enforcement as a necessary act of governance against the main liberal opposition Democratic Party that he described as 'anti-state forces' bogging down his agendas and vowed to 'fight to the end' against efforts to remove him from office. Hundreds of thousands of protesters have poured onto the streets of the country’s capital, Seoul, in recent days, calling for Yoon’s ouster and arrest. It remains unclear whether Yoon will grant the request by investigators for an interview. South Korean prosecutors, who are pushing a separate investigation into the incident, also reportedly asked Yoon to appear at a prosecution office for questioning on Sunday but he refused to do so. Repeated calls to a prosecutors’ office in Seoul were unanswered. Yoon’s presidential security service has also resisted a police attempt to search Yoon's office for evidence. The request came before the Constitutional Court met Monday to discuss the case. The court has up to 180 days to rule. But observers say that a court ruling could come faster. In the case of parliamentary impeachments of past presidents — Roh Moo-hyun in 2004 and Park Geun-hye in 2016 — the court spent 63 days and 91 days respectively before determining to reinstate Roh and dismiss Park. Prime Minister Han Duck-soo, who became the country’s acting leader after Yoon's impeachment, and other government officials have sought to reassure allies and markets after Yoon’s surprise stunt paralyzed politics, halted high-level diplomacy and complicated efforts to revive a faltering economy. Democratic Party leader Lee Jae-myung urged the Constitutional Court to rule swiftly on Yoon’s impeachment and proposed a special council for policy cooperation between the government and parliament. Lee, a firebrand lawmaker who drove a political offensive against Yoon’s government, is seen as the frontrunner to replace him. He lost the 2022 presidential election to Yoon by a razor-thin margin. Kweon Seong-dong, floor leader of Yoon’s conservative People Power Party, separately criticized Lee’s proposal for the special council, saying that it’s 'not right' for the opposition party to act like the ruling party. Yoon’s impeachment, which was endorsed in parliament by some of his ruling People Power Party lawmakers, has created a deep rift within the party between Yoon’s loyalists and his opponents. On Monday, PPP chair Han Dong-hun, a strong critic of Yoon's martial law, announced his resignation. 'If martial law had not been lifted that night, a bloody incident could have erupted that morning between the citizens who would have taken to the streets and our young soldiers,' Han told a news conference. Yoon’s Dec. 3 imposition of martial law, the first of its kind in more than four decades, harkened back to an era of authoritarian leaders the country has not seen since the 1980s. Yoon was forced to lift his decree hours later after parliament unanimously voted to overturn it. Yoon sent hundreds of troops and police officers to the parliament in an effort to stop the vote, but they withdrew after the parliament rejected Yoon’s decree. No major violence occurred. Opposition parties have accused Yoon of rebellion, saying a president in South Korea is allowed to declare martial law only during wartime or similar emergencies and would have no right to suspend parliament’s operations even in those cases.	https://apnews.com/article/south-korea-yoon-martial-law-investigation-constitutional-court-8ec38d61f0ea5c48b3bd1f683b5e9c8d	2024-12-15T15:39:12-08:00	
Referee briefly stops French league match between PSG and Lyon after homophobic chants	A French league soccer match between Paris Saint-Germain and Lyon was briefly interrupted Sunday because of homophobic chanting by PSG fans. Referee Benoît Bastien stopped play in the 53rd minute at the Parc des Princes with host PSG leading 2-1 after the chants were heard. PSG captain Achraf Hakimi approached fans in the Auteuil stand behind one of the goals to ask them to stop. A message reminding fans that discriminatory chants are forbidden was then displayed on the stadium's giant screens. 'The match could be stopped or even lost for the club,' the message read. Play eventually resumed after a few minutes. The chants in Paris were just the latest in a long series of similar incidents as French soccer authorities struggle to tackle the issue. France’s Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau suggested earlier this year that matches should be halted when fans chant homophobic slurs in stadiums. Earlier this month, a French campaign group renewed calls for authorities to take action against homophobic chanting by soccer fans, saying Marseille supporters belted out anti-gay slurs 'with complete impunity' during a home game against Monaco. Homophobic insults often heard at Ligue 1 matches have been tolerated for a long time by club officials, and soccer authorities have struggled to find appropriate ways of tackling the issue. In 2019, following a match at the Parc des Princes between PSG and Marseille during which home fans used homophobic insults, the league launched an action plan allowing spectators to report sexist, homophobic or racist incidents they witness. The abuse has not stopped, though, even intensifying in recent months. French clubs have been sanctioned with fines, and the league’s disciplinary commission also ordered the closure of stands for similar cases in recent years. Also, French law provides for up to one year imprisonment and a 45,000 euro ($47,600) fine when anti-gay insults are made in public. Last season, some PSG players received a one-match suspended sentence by the league disciplinary committee for offensive chants aimed at Marseille after a home league match. Ousmane Dembélé, Hakimi, Randal Kolo Muani and Layvin Kurzawa were filmed using insults while celebrating at the end of a 4-0 win against Marseille. The four players issued apologies. That match was also marred by homophobic chanting by sections of PSG fans targeting Marseille players. ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer	https://apnews.com/article/psg-homophobic-chants-soccer-french-league-0a08eebb6aef5e0d9007cb7d2d10b301	2024-12-15T13:51:49-08:00	
West Africa regional bloc sets up court for crimes under dictatorship in Gambia	SERREKUNDA, Gambia (AP) — West Africa's regional bloc ECOWAS on Sunday approved setting up a special court to try crimes committed in Gambia during its military dictatorship. The landmark decision was announced at the summit of regional heads of state in Nigeria’s capital, Abuja. The court will cover alleged crimes committed under military dictator Yahya Jammeh, whose rule from 1996 to 2017 was marked by arbitrary detention, sexual abuse and extrajudicial killings. Jammeh lost a presidential election in 2016 and went into exile in Equatorial Guinea a year later after initially refusing to step down. Calls for justice for the victims of the dictatorship had been growing for years in Gambia, a country surrounded by Senegal except for a small Atlantic coastline. In 2021, a truth commission in the country wrapped up its hearings with strong recommendations, urging the government to try perpetrators. In May, Jammeh's former interior minister was sentenced to 20 years in jail by a Swiss court for this crimes against humanity. In November, a German court convicted a Gambian man, Bai Lowe, of murder and crimes against humanity for involvement in the killing of government critics in Gambia. The man was a driver for a military unit deployed against opponents of Jammeh. Gambia’s Justice Ministry described the move as a 'historic development' that 'marks a significant step forward for Gambia, the region, and international community' in a statement.	https://apnews.com/article/gambia-jammeh-court-ecowas-33f48f01de800ad437db15f0a91f3a2f	2024-12-15T13:18:31-08:00	
Four men arrested in North Macedonia during anti-terror operation, interior minister says	SKOPJE, North Macedonia (AP) — Four men suspected of planning terrorist attacks were arrested Sunday in western North Macedonia, authorities said. Interior Minister Panche Toshkovski said the arrests were made during raids on several locations in the western towns of Struga and Gostivar. The four men are suspected of being 'part of terrorist organizations (and) have been under surveillance for a long time.' All are Macedonian nationals and were expected to face an investigating magistrate Sunday. Toshkovski did not specify what terrorist organizations the suspects were connected with. 'We have reasonable suspicion that they are connected to groups supporting certain extremist and religious organizations,' he said. 'Their goal (was) to indoctrinate other people from the Balkans who would act accordingly towards the realization of their plans,' Toshkovski added. The suspects face up to eight years in prison if convicted of planned terrorism charges. In December 2020, North Macedonia police arrested eight men on suspicion of planning terrorist attacks on individuals and public buildings in the name of the Islamic State group.	https://apnews.com/article/north-macedonia-arrests-terrorism-eb62bf25df9812bdd86d5eb7aa7e184f	2024-12-15T08:58:34-08:00	
Violent scenes in Glasgow city center ahead of Scottish League Cup final between Celtic and Rangers	GLASGOW, Scotland (AP) — Police said missiles were thrown at officers during violent scenes in Glasgow on Sunday ahead of the Scottish League Cup final between rivals Celtic and Rangers. Police said there were also reports of broken windows and that officers would use stop and search powers to 'prevent disorder and serious violence.' Videos shared on social media appeared to show flares let off in Glasgow city center and gangs of masked people running through the streets. Some shoppers could be seen taking cover in a store entrance as people charged past. 'We have dealt with a number of incidents in Glasgow city center today involving individuals engaging in disorder and violence across the city,' chief superintendent Stevie Dolan said in a statement. 'The use of weapons or violence will not be tolerated and officers will take action where necessary to ensure safety. 'It impacts other members of the public and the vast majority of football supporters who want to enjoy the cup final event safely.' Celtic and Rangers are both based in Glasgow and have one of the fiercest rivalries in British soccer.

French police detain man and seize firearms after 5 people shot dead near Dunkirk	DUNKIRK, France (AP) — French police are investigating the deaths of five people who were fatally shot in the Dunkirk area, in northern France, on Saturday. A 22-year-old man later turned himself in to police, according to authorities and local media. An unnamed company owner in Wormhout, located south of Dunkirk, was killed first, followed by two private security agents and two migrants in Loon-Plage, located just west of Dunkirk, according to the Interior Ministry. Dunkirk's prosecutor said the suspect gave himself up to the gendarmerie brigade in Ghyvelde, east of Dunkirk, at about 5:20 p.m. and said he had killed five people. The man, who was unknown to authorities, was taken into police custody, according to the prosecutor, who said several firearms were found in the man's car. Officials are trying to determine the suspect’s motive.

Israel will close its Ireland embassy over Gaza tensions as Palestinian death toll nears 45,000	DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Israel said Sunday it will close its embassy in Ireland as relations deteriorated over the war in Gaza, where Palestinian medical officials said new Israeli airstrikes killed over 30 people including several children. The decision to close the embassy came in response to what Israel’s foreign minister has described as Ireland’s 'extreme anti-Israel policies.' In May, Israel recalled its ambassador to Dublin after Ireland announced, along with Norway, Spain and Slovenia, it would recognize a Palestinian state. The Irish cabinet last week decided to formally intervene in South Africa’s case against Israel at the International Court of Justice, which accuses Israel of committing genocide in Gaza. Israel denies it. 'We are concerned that a very narrow interpretation of what constitutes genocide leads to a culture of impunity in which the protection of civilians is minimized,' Ireland’s deputy premier and foreign affairs minister, Micheal Martin, said in a statement. Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar's statement on the embassy closure said that 'Ireland has crossed every red line in its relations with Israel.' Irish Prime Minister Simon Harris called the decision to close the embassy 'deeply regrettable.' He added on X: 'I utterly reject the assertion that Ireland is anti-Israel. Ireland is pro-peace, pro-human rights and pro-international law.' Israeli strikes in Gaza kill a journalist and children Israeli forces continued Sunday to pound largely isolated northern Gaza, as the Palestinian death toll in the war approached 45,000. One airstrike hit the Khalil Aweida school in the town of Beit Hanoun and killed at least 15 people, according to nearby Kamal Adwan Hospital where casualties were taken. The dead included two parents and their daughter and a father and his son, the hospital said. In Gaza City, at least 17 people including six women and five children were killed in three airstrikes that hit houses sheltering displaced people, according to Al-Ahli Baptist Hospital. 'We woke up to the strike. I woke up with the rubble on top of me,' said a bandaged Yahia al-Yazji, who grieved for his wife and daughter. 'I found my wife with her head and skull visible, and my daughter’s intestines were gone. My wife was three months pregnant.' His hand rested on a body wrapped in a blanket on the floor. Israel's military in a statement said it struck a 'terrorist cell' in Gaza City and a 'terrorist meeting point' in the Beit Hanoun area. Another Israeli airstrike killed a Palestinian journalist working for Al Jazeera, Ahmed al-Lawh, in central Gaza, a hospital and the Qatari-based TV station said. The strike hit a point for Gaza’s civil defense agency in the urban Nuseirat refugee camp, Al-Awda Hospital said. Also killed were three civil defense workers including the head of the agency in Nuseirat, according to al-Aqsa Martyrs hospital. The civil defense is Gaza's main rescue agency and operates under the Hamas-run government. The war in Gaza began after Hamas and other militants from Gaza stormed southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people and taking well over 200 hostage.

Brazilian President Lula discharged from hospital after surgery to stop brain bleed	SAO PAULO (AP) — Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva was discharged from the hospital Sunday after undergoing surgery to stop a brain bleed. The 79-year-old president spoke alongside doctors in a press conference on Sunday morning in a show that he was doing well following the head surgery. 'I’m here alive, well, with the urge to work. And I’ll tell you something I used to say during the campaign. I’m 79 years old, I have the energy of 30 and the enthusiasm of 20 to build this country,' Lula said. Lula's medical team said the surgery went well and that Lula would be able to walk and hold meetings as he rests in his home in the city of Sao Paulo until Thursday. The leader's doctors said international travel would be out of the question until further notice, but that he'd be able to travel to the country's capital, Brasilia, if all goes well in a medical exam. The president also offered his first comments on Saturday's arrest of Gen. Walter Braga Netto, a former member of President Jair Bolsonaro’s government and his 2022 running mate, in connection with investigations into an alleged coup plot. Lula has largely avoided commenting on the case because of ongoing investigations. 'It is not possible for us to accept disrespect for democracy, disrespect for the constitution. And it is not possible for us to accept that in a generous country like Brazil we have people of high military rank plotting the death of a president, his vice president and a presiding judge of the supreme electoral court,' said Lula. Braga Netto was indicted in November, along with Bolsonaro and 35 others, on charges of plotting a coup to keep Bolsonaro in office after his failed 2022 reelection bid. Prosecutors have not yet filed formal charges against Braga Netto. His arrest was related to allegations of obstructing the collection of evidence, the Federal Police said in a statement.	https://apnews.com/article/brazil-lula-surgery-628cff2dc0c07ccaf003093c4c5e7218	2024-12-15T06:17:33-08:00	
Ukrainian drone hits Russia's Chechnya as Kyiv continues pushback after Moscow bombardment	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — A Ukrainian drone struck a campus belonging to Russia’s National Guard Sunday in the Russian region of Chechnya, as Kyiv continues to strike back after a mass air attack from Moscow. Footage on social media showed a drone swooping low over the Chechen capital, Grozny, some 800 kilometers (500 miles) southeast of the front line in Ukraine, before exploding. No casualties were reported. Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov confirmed that the drone had hit a site belonging to the Akhmat Grozny riot police battalion, and said that two other drones had been shot down by air defenses. Kadyrov pledged revenge on Ukrainian forces and said he had ordered a missile strike against military facilities in Kharkiv in retaliation for the attack. The claim could not be independently verified. Russia’s Defense Ministry said Sunday that it had shot down 15 Ukrainian drones overnight in the country’s Kursk and Belgorod regions, as well as over the Black Sea. It did not mention the Grozny attack. An official in Ukraine’s security service also told the AP on Sunday that Ukrainian intelligence services had conducted a special operation to sever Russia’s logistic fuel supply routes from Ukraine’s annexed Crimea to occupied Zaporizhzhia. The operation, which took place Saturday, destroyed a locomotive and 40 tanker cars, the security official said. A sabotage operation reportedly blew up railway tracks while the train was moving, before HIMARS rocket launch systems joined the attack. 'As a result, a key railway branch used to supply Russian troops was put out of service for an extended period,' said the official, who asked to remain anonymous in order to share sensitive information. Kyiv’s strikes on Russia over the weekend, which also set fire to a major oil terminal on Saturday, follow a mass bombardment across Ukraine by Moscow Friday. Russia fired 93 cruise and ballistic missiles and almost 200 drones at its neighbor, battering Ukraine’s energy infrastructure. Russia’s troops also continue to slowly advance in eastern Ukraine. Washington-based think tank the Institute for the Study of War reported Sunday that geolocated footage placed Russian forces inside the settlement of Kurakhove, which Moscow’s troops had besieged for weeks after surrounding it on three sides. The push compounds further uncertainty as to how the war might unfold next year, with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, who takes office next month, sparking doubt as to whether vital U.S. military support for Kyiv will continue. In an interview published in TIME magazine Thursday, Trump said that he was against allowing Ukraine to hit targets on Russian soil using U.S.-provided weapons. Meanwhile, Russia launched 108 drones across Ukraine overnight into Sunday, the Ukrainian air force said. It said that 56 were shot down by air defenses, while another 49 disappeared from radar after failing to reach their targets. Three more drones returned to Russia, officials said. Gov. Vitalii Kim said that two people were injured in the Ukrainian city of Mykolaiv as a result of the attack, which also damaged local infrastructure. —— Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-grozny-drone-attack-7655bcd300e3e11e28f571a613d59ef0	2024-12-15T05:44:10-08:00	
Tis the season for roasting chestnuts. But in the US, native ones are almost gone	It's been a very long time since vendors sold the American chestnut on city sidewalks. It's no longer the variety whose smell some people associate with Christmastime as it wafts from street carts. Because it's virtually extinct. But memories of the American chestnut's legacy keep resurfacing for the researchers who want to bring it back. They describe its wood that paneled the homes and schoolrooms of their grandparents, or the photographs of men on the street corners of old Baltimore, with hot bags of nuts cooked on charcoal. 'You can feel that connection to a place, and that connection to utility, and the connection to the importance that this tree played in virtually every aspect of the lives of people,' said Sara Fern Fitzsimmons, chief conservation officer with The American Chestnut Foundation, which is working to restore the tree to flourish as it once did. Fitzsimmons said that will likely take a lot longer than many chestnut enthusiasts had hoped. Researchers have hit roadblocks with attempts to breed or genetically modify a version that can withstand the invasive blight that has hammered the species since the early 1900s. If and when they do find the right variety, they'll need to figure out how to plant it and help it thrive in forests that are under pressure from climate change, globalization and development. Once a hallmark of forests from Georgia to New England, American chestnuts now exist mostly as a vast network of root systems underground, sending up shoots. They grow for a time, but the fungal blight takes hold when the trees start maturing. East Asian varieties, like those that introduced the blight in the first place, are immune to the blight, and produce most of the edible chestnuts for fall and winter snacking. Still, American chestnut trees are better suited for timber, they're culturally loved by people all over North America and they used to be an important species for the ecological health of forests, providing a reliable source of nutritious food and shelter for wildlife and humans alike. 'It was really a pretty significant species to lose,' said Amy Brunner, an associate professor at Virginia Tech who works on the tree's genetics. 'The more diversity you lose, the less resilient that forest ecosystem is.' The American Chestnut Foundation, among others, has been trying for decades to breed a hybrid that is mostly American in genetics but with the fungus-fighting traits of the Chinese type. Fitzsimmons said breeders have learned just how difficult that is — blight resistance involves several different genes and it has proven hard to separate them from the traits that distinguish Chinese chestnuts. To speed the process, some scientists have been working on genetically modifying American chestnuts to see if they can boost their immunity that way instead. But progress was delayed by a recent mix-up involving two versions of a genetically modified American chestnut that scientists at State University of New York had hoped could get through the regulatory process as soon as this year. 'It kind of stinks that it happened because now it’s taking a little bit longer than we had hoped,' said Linda McGuigan, a research support specialist at the university. But scientists there and elsewhere are continuing to pursue many avenues. 'I don’t think you will get there, to all you desire, without both,' Brunner said, referring to the two main methods of breeding and genetic modification. Breeding is vital for achieving enough genetic diversity for trees to adapt to a changing world, she said, but added that she thinks some genetic manipulation will be needed to get to enough blight resistance for American chestnuts to stand a chance. Meanwhile, other scientists are working on projects to tackle another big challenge ahead for chestnuts: where to plant them. If a successful tree is cobbled together with genes taken from trees from Tennessee to New York, where would it have the best chance at surviving, given how a warming planet is changing habitat around the world? A team at Virginia Tech published a paper this summer to try to answer that question. They looked at 32 climate variables and compared them to projected future climates, then calculated the shortest distance that regionally specific American chestnuts would have to move to offset warming. The idea was to one day help them survive a new climate while keeping them as close as possible to where they once thrived. 'I don’t think it’s hyperbolic to say it’s revolutionary' for teams at The American Chestnut Foundation, said Fitzsimmons, who contributed data to the project. She said the project will help them better figure out where to collect genes from the immature trees that remain across the country. Tom Kimmerer, a forest scientist who taught at the University of Kentucky, is working on a book about trees including the American chestnut. Kimmerer, who was not involved in the research, called it 'robust and well supported' and 'critically important to the success of the chestnut.' Stacy Clark, a research forester at the U.S. Forest Service, said the findings are useful, but added that they need to be backed up with real-world experiments. 'I think with advancements in genetics, they can probably get pretty fast data off of those field trials. But still, all of that takes time and effort, right?' For now, forest scientists know their work might not pay off in their lifetimes. It's a lesson that became clear for the community when pioneering chestnut restoration experts Bill Powell and Chuck Maynard both died in the past 13 months. McGuigan supported both of their research for years as lab manager at SUNY's college of environmental science and forestry. 'The project moves on, lives on. And we honor their memory,' McGuigan said. 'I want to do something good for the future, for my children.' ___ Follow Melina Walling on X @MelinaWalling and Bluesky @melinawalling.bsky.social. ___ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Russia launches a rescue operation after a storm damages 2 oil tankers in the Kerch Strait	MOSCOW (AP) — Two Russian oil tankers have taken heavy damage amid a storm in the Kerch Strait, spilling oil and sparking an emergency rescue operation, Russian officials told state news outlets Sunday. The Volgoneft-212 tanker, which was carrying a crew of 13 and a cargo of fuel oil, ran aground and had its bow torn away, said Russian state news agency TASS, citing the country’s Emergency Situations Ministry. The damage was caused by severe weather conditions, officials said. A second tanker, the Volgoneft 239, was also damaged in the storm and left drifting in the same area with 14 crewmembers on board, the Emergency Situations Ministry said. The Kerch Strait separates the Russian-occupied Crimean Peninsula from Russia and is an important global shipping route, providing passage from the Sea of Azov to the Black Sea. It has also been a key point of conflict between Russia and Ukraine after Moscow annexed the peninsula from Ukraine in 2014. In 2016, Ukraine took Moscow to the Permanent Court of Arbitration, where it accused Russia of trying to illegally seize control of the area. In 2021, Russia closed the strait for several months.	https://apnews.com/article/russia-kerch-strait-oil-shipping-transport-storm-4eed65f6d8d999b5451d36d414af2e8e	2024-12-15T03:00:48-08:00	
Christians in Syria mark country's transformation with tears as UN envoy urges an end to sanctions	DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) — In churches across long-stifled Syria, Christians marked the first Sunday services since Bashar Assad's ouster in an air of transformation. Some worshippers were in tears. Others clasped their hands in prayer. 'They are promising us that government will be formed soon and, God willing, things will become better because we got rid of the tyrant,' said one worshipper, Jihad Raffoul. 'Today, our prayers are for a new page in Syria’s future,' said another, Suzan Barakat. To help those efforts, the U.N. envoy for Syria called for a quick end to Western sanctions as the country’s new leaders and regional and global powers discuss the way forward. Syria has been under sanctions by the United States, the European Union and others for years as a result of Assad’s brutal response to what began as peaceful anti-government protests in 2011 and spiraled into civil war. The rebel alliance that ousted Assad and sent him into exile in Russia a week ago faces a nation deeply isolated by the sanctions, which compounded Syria’s economic troubles. But other challenges also complicate rebuilding. The new transitional leadership has not laid out a clear vision of how the country will be governed, and the main group behind the offensive remains designated as a terrorist organization by the U.S., which nevertheless has begun making direct contact with it. The U.N. envoy to Syria, Geir Pedersen, told reporters in Damascus that the rebels' stunningly fast offensive should be followed by a rapid international response. 'We can hopefully see a quick end to the sanctions so that we can see really a rallying around building of Syria,' he said. Parts of Syria’s biggest cities are damaged or destroyed by years of fighting. Reconstruction has been stymied largely by the sanctions that aimed to prevent rebuilding of infrastructure and property in government-held areas in the absence of a political solution. The U.N. envoy was meeting with officials from the new interim government set up by the former opposition forces who toppled Assad, led by the Islamic militant group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS. Officials in Washington have indicated that the Biden administration is considering removing the group's terror designation. Over the weekend, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken attended an emergency meeting in Jordan with 12 foreign ministers from the Arab League, Turkey and top officials from the European Union and United Nations on how Syria should be run after a half-century of Assad family rule. They agreed that the new government should respect the rights of minorities and women, prevent terror groups from taking hold, ensure humanitarian aid reaches those in need and secure and destroy any remaining Assad-era chemical weapons. Syria's interim government is set to rule until March, but it has not made clear the process under which a new permanent administration would replace it. Arab foreign ministers have called for U.N.-supervised elections based on a new constitution approved by Syrians. 'We need to get the political process underway that is inclusive of all Syrians,' Pedersen said. 'That process obviously needs to be led by the Syrians themselves.' He also called for ' justice and accountability for crimes' committed during the war, as some families continued to search for the tens of thousands of people that Assad's government had placed in prisons and detention facilities. Many Syrian Christians, who made up 10% of the population before Syria’s civil war, had either fled the country or supported Assad out of fear of Islamist insurgents. Last Sunday's church services were canceled. 'We were scared of the events taking place,' said Ibrahim Shahin, a Catholic church supervisor. But this Sunday, doors reopened and bells rang out. In another sign of Syrians’ yearning for normalcy after the whirlwind of events, schools in Damascus reopened Sunday for the first time since the insurgents marched in the capital. At Nahla Zaidan school in the Mezzah neighborhood, teachers hoisted the three-starred revolutionary flag in place of the former government’s two-starred one. 'Although I think some of them are afraid, they came to build Syria and to live the victories of this country,' said Maysoun Al-Ali, the school director. 'God willing, there will be more development, more security and more construction in this beloved country.' ___ Associated Press writers Abdulrahman Shaheen and Sally Abou AlJoud contributed to this report. ___ Follow the AP’s Syria coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/syria	https://apnews.com/article/syria-assad-sanctions-un-3f0031108d7e58c2343bd6a8fd42254c	2024-12-15T01:30:14-08:00	
At least 11 dead in the French territory of Mayotte as Cyclone Chido causes devastating damage	CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) — At least 11 people have died after Cyclone Chido caused devastating damage in the French territory of Mayotte in the Indian Ocean, France's Interior Ministry said Sunday. The intense tropical cyclone has now made landfall on the east coast of Africa, where aid agencies are warning of more loss of life and severe damage in northern Mozambique. The ministry said it was proving difficult to get a precise tally of the dead and injured in Mayotte amid fears the death toll will increase. A local hospital reported that nine people were in critical condition there and 246 others were injured. The tropical cyclone blew through the southeastern Indian Ocean, also affecting the nearby islands of Comoros and Madagascar. Mayotte was directly in its path and suffered extensive damage on Saturday, officials said. The local prefect said it was the worst cyclone to hit Mayotte in 90 years. French Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau said Saturday night after an emergency meeting in Paris that there were fears that the death toll in Mayotte 'will be high' and the island had been largely devastated. Prime Minister François Bayrou, who took office on Friday, said public infrastructure on Mayotte had been severely damaged or destroyed, including the main hospital and the airport. He said many people living in precarious shacks in slum areas have faced very serious risks. Chido brought winds in excess of 220 kph (136 mph), according to the French weather service, making it a category 4 cyclone, the second strongest on the scale. Mayotte has a population of just over 300,000 spread over two main islands about 800 kilometers (500 miles) off Africa’s east coast. It is France's poorest island and the European Union's poorest territory. In some parts, entire neighborhoods were flattened, while local residents reported many trees had been uprooted and boats had been flipped or sunk. The French Interior Ministry said 1,600 police and gendarmerie officers have been deployed to 'help the population and prevent potential looting.' More than 100 rescuers and firefighters have been deployed in Mayotte from France and the nearby territory of Reunion, and an additional reinforcement of 140 people was due to be sent on Sunday. Supplies were being rushed in on military aircraft and ships. French President Emmanuel Macron said he was closely monitoring the situation, while Pope Francis offered prayers for the victims of the cyclone while on a visit Sunday to the French Mediterranean island of Corsica. Chido continued its eastern trajectory and made landfall early Sunday in Mozambique on the African mainland, where emergency officials had warned that 2.5 million people could be impacted in two northern provinces, Cabo Delgado and Nampula. Landlocked Malawi and Zimbabwe are also preparing to be affected, with both countries warning they might have to evacuate people from low-lying areas because of flooding. In Mozambique, the United Nations Children's Fund said Cabo Delgado province, home to around 2 million people, had been hit hard. 'Many homes, schools and health facilities have been partially or completely destroyed and we are working closely with government to ensure continuity of essential basic services,' UNICEF said. 'While we are doing everything we can, additional support is urgently needed.' UNICEF Mozambique spokesman Guy Taylor said in a video posted by the group from Cabo Delgado's regional capital that alongside the immediate impact of the cyclone, communities now face the prospect of being cut off from schools and health facilities for weeks. December through to March is cyclone season in the southeastern Indian Ocean and southern Africa has been pummeled by a series of strong ones in recent years. Cyclone Idai in 2019 killed more than 1,300 people in Mozambique, Malawi and Zimbabwe. Cyclone Freddy left more than 1,000 dead across several countries last year. The cyclones bring the risk of flooding and landslides, but also stagnant pools of water may later spark deadly outbreaks of the waterborne disease cholera as well as dengue fever and malaria. Studies say the cyclones are getting worse because of climate change. They can leave poor countries in southern Africa, which contribute a tiny amount to global warming, having to deal with large humanitarian crises, underlining their call for more help from rich nations to deal with the impact of climate change. —— Corbet reported from Paris. —— AP Africa news: https://apnews.com/hub/africa	https://apnews.com/article/cyclone-chido-mayotte-deaths-weather-climate-2b49b97217a47e2013dc9021d9324eb5	2024-12-15T01:24:09-08:00	
Pope Francis makes 1st papal visit to France's Corsica awash in expressions of popular piety	AJACCIO, Corsica (AP) — Pope Francis on the first papal visit ever to the French island of Corsica on Sunday called for a dynamic form of laicism, promoting the kind of popular piety that distinguishes the Mediterranean island from secular France as a bridge between religious and civic society. Francis appeared relaxed and energized during the one-day visit, just two days before his 88th birthday, still displaying a faded bruise from a fall a week ago. He frequently deviated from his prepared homily during Mass at the outdoor La Place d’Austerlitz, remarking at one point that he had never seen so many children as in Corsica — except, he added, in East Timor on his recent Asian tour. 'Make children,″ he implored. 'They will be your joy and your consolation in the future.' Earlier, at the close of a Mediterranean conference on popular piety, Papa Francescu, as he is called in Corsican, described a concept of secularity 'that is not static and fixed, but evolving and dynamic,' that can adapt to 'unforeseen situations' and promote cooperation 'between civil and ecclesial authorities.' The pontiff said that expressions of popular piety, including processions and communal prayer of the Holy Rosary 'can nurture constructive citizenship' on the part of Christians. At the same time, he warned against such manifestations being seen only in terms of folklore, or even superstition. The visit to Corsica’s capital Ajaccio, the birthplace of Napoleon, is one of the briefest of his papacy beyond Italy’s borders, just about nine hours on the ground, including a 40-minute visit with French President Emmanuel Macron. Francis met privately with Macron at the airport before flying back to Rome. Francis was joined on the dais by the bishop of Ajaccio, Cardinal Francois-Xavier Bustillo, who organized the conference that brought together some 400 participants from Spain, Sicily, Sardinia and southern France. The two-day meeting examined expressions of faith that often occur outside formal liturgies, such as processions and pilgrimages. Often specific to the places where they are practiced, popular piety in Corsica includes the cult of the Virgin Mary, known locally as the 'Madunnuccia,' which protected the island from the plague in 1656 when it was still under Genoa. Corsica stands out from the rest of secularized France as a particularly devout region, with 92 confraternities, or lay associations dedicated to works of charity or piety, with over 4,000 members. 'It means that there is a beautiful, mature, adult and responsible collaboration between civil authorities, mayors, deputies, senators, officials and religious authorities,’’ Bustillo told The Associated Press ahead of the visit. 'There is no hostility between the two. And that is a very positive aspect because in Corsica there is no ideological hostility.' The visit was awash in signs of popular piety. The pope was greeted by children in traditional garb and was continually serenaded by bands, choruses and singing troupes that are central to Corsican culture from the airport, to the motorcade route, convention center and cathedral. Thousands stood along the roadside to greet the pontiff and more waved from windows. Renè Colombani traveled with 2,000 others by ship from northern Corsica to Ajaccio, on the western coast, to see the pope. 'It is an event that we will not see again in several years. It may be the only time that the pope will come to Corsica. And since we wanted to be a part of it, we have come a long way″ Colombani said. The island, which Genoa ceded to France in 1768, is located closer to the Italian mainland than France. From the conference, the pope traveled to the 17th-century cathedral of Santa Maria Assunta to meet with clergy, stopping along the way at the statue of the Madunnuccia where he lit a devotional candle. The pope celebrated Mass beneath a looming statue of Napoleon Bonaparte, the French emperor whose armies in 1808 annexed the papal states and imprisoned two of Francis’ predecessors — Popes Pius VI and VII — before being excommunicated and eventually defeated on the battlefield. Thousands packed the esplanade where Napoleon is said to have played as a child. Francis met with Macron at the airport before departing for the 50-minute flight back to Rome. They discussed Russia’s war in Ukraine, the Middle East and security issues in Africa's Sahel and Great Lakes regions, Haiti and Sudan, Macron's office said in a statement. Macron welcomed the pope's 'calls for peace, non-violence and respect for human rights,' the statement said. Both Macron and Francis expressed their 'deep concern' regarding the situation in Gaza and called for 'an immediate and lasting ceasefire' and 'the massive delivery of much-needed humanitarian aid,' according to Macron's office. On Syria, they reiterated their wish to see a 'fair and inclusive political transition,' the statement said. Macron presented the pope with two books about Notre Dame Cathedral. The pontiff pointedly did not make the trip to Paris earlier this month for the pomp surrounding the reopening of the Notre Dame Cathedral following the devastating 2019 fire. The visit to Corsica seems far more suited to Francis’ priorities than a grand cathedral reopening, emphasizing the 'church of the peripheries.' It was Francis’ third trip to France, each time avoiding Paris and the protocols that a state visit entails. He visited the port of Marseille in 2023, on an overnight visit to participate in an annual summit of Mediterranean bishops, and went to Strasbourg in 2014 to address the European Parliament and Council of Europe. Corsica is home to more than 340,000 people and has been part of France since 1768. But the island has also seen pro-independence violence and has an influential nationalist movement. Last year, Macron proposed granting it limited autonomy. Given the short flight back to Rome, Francis didn’t hold an airborne press conference en route home, the first time he has skipped the traditional briefing in 47 foreign trips as pope. Francis did come to the back of the plane though to greet reporters and receive a pretend birthday cake. __ Associated Press writers Colleen Barry in Milan and Sylvie Corbet in Paris contributed to this report. __ Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

Bolivia holds a divisive popular vote for its top judges, offering lessons for the region	LA PAZ, Bolivia (AP) — Campaigning for Sunday's judicial election may be strictly forbidden, but look closer on the streets of Bolivia’s capital, La Paz, and you’ll find that some candidates have sneakily plastered their faces on packs of corn puffs and others have slipped subtle slogans into official voting manuals. After all, it’s a popular vote, and even a bit of PR can work wonders when voters know nothing about the dozens of names on their sprawling ballot papers. Bolivia is the only country in the world that holds elections for top judicial posts. Soon Mexico will, too, after former President Andrés Manuel López Obrador pushed through a highly contentious overhaul of the justice system in the face of mass protests. As Bolivia's ex-President Evo Morales did when remaking the judiciary in 2009, López Obrador has championed the overhaul as a way to purge the corrupt elite and boost democracy. But apathetic Bolivian voters say the elections have had the opposite effect, turning their courts from neutral arbiters into political prizes. 'I’ll flip a coin,' said 25-year-old architecture student Marisol Nogales when asked how she would vote on Sunday. It’s never easy to find supporters of Bolivia’s system of electing judges, which, over a decade ago, replaced a nomination system rooted in qualifications and training. Across the world, academics, investors and judges have warned that judicial elections can cement the dominance of the ruling party and gut checks and balances. And across Latin America, from El Salvador to Honduras, experts have characterized politicized judiciaries as profound threats to democracy. In Bolivia, even senior judicial officials struggle to sound positive when asked to defend the election. 'It should be a calm, easy and simple process, but it has become very litigious, very controversial,' Francisco Vargas, the vice president of Bolivia’s electoral tribunal, told The Associated Press from the court in central La Paz. This year in Bolivia, experts find it even harder than usual to praise the system. With the posts up for grabs every six years, Sunday’s vote was supposed to take place in late 2023. But as the deadline approached last year, the Constitutional Court — packed with allies of President Luis Arce — suddenly intervened to push the vote back a year, escalating his power struggle with his former mentor and current rival, Morales, over who will lead their long-dominant leftist party into Bolivia’s 2025 presidential election. Both understand that whoever wins over the Constitutional Court ensures their own political survival. Arce cited the paralysis of their divided party in justifying the vote's delay. Morales' loyalists, who hold a majority in Congress and would have determined the shortlist of judicial candidates, accused Arce of illegally extending the mandates of friendly judges for fear of losing influence over the courts. 'What happened was disorder, the kind that can lead us to a greater conflict,' said Iván Lima, the former Minister of Justice. The Inter-American Court of Human Rights criticized the postponement of elections, raising alarm about its 'potential to undermine the effective functioning of the Bolivian justice system.' Now, after many attempts to derail and further delay the vote, it is finally moving ahead Sunday. But there’s a wrinkle: It's a partial election. Only four out of nine seats on the powerful Constitutional Court are up for grabs. The other five — the majority of sitting judges, as it happens — will stay in their posts. 'The judges have turned the Constitutional Court into a sort of super power,' said Bolivian political analyst Paul Coca. Sunday marks the third time that Bolivia has held judicial elections. If the past two rounds under then-President Morales, in 2011 and 2017, are any indication, turnout will be low. Both times, the majority of Bolivians, outraged or simply baffled by the notion of endorsing unknown judges pre-selected by Morales’ allies with little transparency, voted null or blank. Critics questioned the legitimacy of the elected judges. But they nonetheless shaped the evolution of Bolivian democracy. In 2016, Morales asked Bolivians in a legally binding referendum to decide whether to let him run for a fourth term, in defiance of a two-term limit established in the 2009 Constitution he had backed. When he didn’t get the answer he wanted — a slim majority voted 'no' — his party found a workaround through the pliant Constitutional Court, where judges ruled that to deny Morales another term as president would be to violate his human rights. 'This was his major mistake,' said Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, a former chief justice of the Supreme Court. It was Morales’ decision to run again in 2019 that brought a precipitous end to his remarkable 14-year tenure and ushered in a surreal parade of crises. As allegations of electoral fraud sent angry crowds into the streets, Morales resigned under pressure from the military and went into exile. Five years after coming under fire for allegedly manipulating the courts, Morales now finds himself on the receiving end of the judiciary he overhauled. 'First Evo’s party used the court to challenge the referendum’s results to promote another candidacy. Then Arce’s administration colluded with the same Constitutional Court to delay and reduce judicial elections to favor the self-prorogated judges, who run politics through judicial review,' Veltzé said. Last year, the Constitutional Court endorsed a controversial resolution from the northeastern province of Beni that the government insists blocks Morales from running for president in 2025. Last October, a prosecutor in Bolivia’s southern province of Tarija issued an arrest warrant for Morales after reviving a 2016 statutory rape case against him. And earlier this week, the country’s top criminal court swiftly extradited Morales’ former anti-drug chief to stand trial in the United Staes on charges of cocaine trafficking, despite criticism from legal experts unsatisfied by the court's review of evidence. 'They've been trying to destroy me morally, legally and politically,' Morales told the AP about the legal cases against him. Vargas, the tribunal’s vice president, is quick to insist that Bolivia is not some kind of strange outlier for electing judges by popular vote. The U.S., Switzerland and Japan also hold judicial elections. But, he conceded, not in such a sweeping way as Bolivia does, or as Mexico will. Mexico’s new president, Claudia Sheinbaum, bracing for fallout from the overhaul she inherited, is keen to see how Bolivia’s vote plays out. The National Electoral Institute, the Mexican voting authority, sent a delegation to observe the process in La Paz this weekend, Vargas said. When asked whether he would recommend that Mexico follow Bolivia’s example, Vargas let out a sharp laugh. 'If you want me to tell you my personal opinion,' he said, 'it might cause me some problems.'	https://apnews.com/article/bolivia-judicial-elections-morales-mexico-overhaul-constitution-beba1908c766b982dd90532723062e38	2024-12-14T21:00:51-08:00	
One week into a new Syria, rebels aim for normalcy and Syrians vow not to be silent again	DAMASCUS (AP) — At Damascus’ international airport, the new head of security — one of the rebels who marched across Syria to the capital — arrived with his team. The few maintenance workers who showed up for work huddled around Maj Hamza al-Ahmed, eager to learn what will happen next. They quickly unloaded all the complaints they had been too afraid to express during the rule of President Bashar Assad, which now, inconceivably, is over. They told the bearded fighter they were denied promotions and perks in favor of pro-Assad favorites, and that bosses threatened them with prison for working too slowly. They warned of hardcore Assad supporters among airport staff, ready to return whenever the facility reopens. As Al-Ahmed tried to reassure them, Osama Najm, an engineer, announced: 'This is the first time we talk.' This was the first week of Syria’s transformation after Assad’s unexpected fall. Rebels, suddenly in charge, met a population bursting with emotions: excitement at new freedoms; grief over years of repression; and hopes, expectations and worries about the future. Some were overwhelmed to the point of tears. The transition has been surprisingly smooth. Reports of reprisals, revenge killings and sectarian violence have been minimal. Looting and destruction have been quickly contained, insurgent fighters disciplined. On Saturday, people went about their lives as usual in the capital, Damascus. Only a single van of fighters was seen. There are a million ways it could go wrong. The country is broken and isolated after five decades of Assad family rule. Families have been torn apart by war, former prisoners are traumatized by the brutalities they suffered, tens of thousands of detainees remain missing. The economy is wrecked, poverty is widespread, inflation and unemployment are high. Corruption seeps through daily life. But in this moment of flux, many are ready to feel out the way ahead. At the airport, al-Ahmed told the staffers: 'The new path will have challenges, but that is why we have said Syria is for all and we all have to cooperate.' The rebels have so far said all the right things, Najm said. 'But we will not be silent about anything wrong again.' Idlib comes to Damascus At a torched police station, pictures of Assad were torn down and files destroyed after insurgents entered the city Dec. 8. All Assad-era police and security personnel have vanished. On Saturday, the building was staffed by 10 men serving in the police force of the rebels’ de facto 'salvation government,' which for years governed the rebel enclave of Idlib in Syria's northwest. The rebel policemen watch over the station, dealing with reports of petty thefts and street scuffles. One woman complains that her neighbors sabotaged her power supply. A policeman tells her to wait for courts to start operating again. 'It will take a year to solve problems' he mumbled. The rebels sought to bring order in Damascus by replicating the structure of its governance in Idlib. But there is a problem of scale. One of the policemen estimates the number of rebel police at only around 4,000; half are based in Idlib and the rest are tasked with maintaining security in Damascus and elsewhere. Some experts estimate the insurgents' total fighting force at around 20,000. Right now, the fighters and the public are learning about each other. The fighters drive large SUVs and newer models of vehicles that are out of reach for most residents in Damascus, where they cost 10 times as much because of custom duties and bribes. The fighters carry Turkish lira, long forbidden in government-held areas, rather than the plunging Syrian pound. Most of the bearded fighters hail from conservative, provincial areas. Many are hardline Islamists. The main insurgent force, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, has renounced its al-Qaida past, and its leaders are working to reassure Syria’s religious and ethnic communities that the future will be pluralist and tolerant. But many Syrians remain suspicious. Some fighters sport ribbons with Islamist slogans on their uniforms and not all of them belong to HTS, the most organized group. 'The people we see on the streets, they don’t represent us,' said Hani Zia, a Damascus resident from the southern city of Daraa, where the 2011 anti-Assad uprising began. He was concerned by reports of attacks on minorities and revenge killings. 'We should be fearful,' he said, adding that he worries some insurgents feel superior to other Syrians because of their years of fighting. 'With all due respect to those who sacrificed, we all sacrificed.' Still, fear is not prevalent in Damascus, where many insist they will no longer let themselves be oppressed. Some restaurants have resumed openly serving alcohol, others more discretely to test the mood. At a sidewalk café in the historic Old City's Christian quarter, men were drinking beer when a fighter patrol passed by. The men turned to each other, uncertain, but the fighters did nothing. When a man waving a gun harassed a liquor store elsewhere in the Old City, the rebel police arrested him, one policeman said. Salem Hajjo, a theater teacher who participated in the 2011 protests, said he doesn't agree with the rebels' Islamist views, but is impressed at their experience in running their own affairs. And he expects to have a voice in the new Syria. 'We have never been this at ease,' he said. 'The fear is gone. The rest is up to us.' The fighters make a concerted effort to reassure On the night after Assad’s fall, gunmen roamed the streets, celebrating victory with deafening gunfire. Some security agency buildings were torched. People ransacked the airport's duty free, smashing all the bottles of liquor. The rebels blamed some of this on fleeing government loyalists. The public stayed indoors, peeking out at the newcomers. Shops shut down. Hayat Tahrir al-Sham moved to impose order, ordering a nighttime curfew for three days. It banned celebratory gunfire and moved fighters to protect properties. After a day, people began to emerge. For tens of thousands, their first destination was Assad’s prisons, particularly Saydnaya on the capital’s outskirts, to search for loved ones who disappeared years ago. Few have found any traces. It was wrenching but also unifying. Rebels, some of them also searching, mingled with relatives of the missing in the dark halls of prisons that all had feared for years. During celebrations in the street, gunmen invited children to hop up on their armored vehicles. Insurgents posed for photos with women, some with their hair uncovered. Pro-revolution songs blared from cars. Suddenly shops and walls everywhere are plastered with revolutionary flags and posters of activists killed by Assad’s state. TV stations didn’t miss a beat, flipping from praising Assad to playing revolutionary songs. State media aired the flurry of declarations issued by the new insurgent-led transitional government. The new administration called on people to go back to work and urged Syrian refugees around the world to return to help rebuild. It announced plans to rehabilitate and vet the security forces to prevent the return of 'those with blood on their hands.' Fighters reassured airport staffers — many of them government loyalists — that their homes won’t be attacked, one employee said. But Syria's woes are far from being resolved. While produce prices plunged after Assad’s fall, because merchants no longer needed to pay hefty customs fees and bribes, fuel distribution was badly disrupted, jacking up transportation costs and causing widespread and lengthy blackouts. Officials say they want to reopen the airport as soon as possible and this week maintenance crews inspected a handful of planes on the tarmac. Cleaners removed trash, wrecked furniture and merchandise. One cleaner, who identified himself only as Murad, said he earns the equivalent of $15 a month and has six children to feed, including one with a disability. He dreams of getting a mobile phone. 'We need a long time to clean this up,' he said. ___ Associated Press writer Ghaith Alsayed contributed.	https://apnews.com/article/syria-week-one-transitional-government-c06673aa3317a194619710948264cdf1	2024-12-14T20:04:09-08:00	
Activists release images of foxes at Finnish fur farms to push EU to ban the trade	GENEVA (AP) — A red fox frantically scratches the wires of its small cage. An Arctic fox meanders lazily with a bloody tail. Other furry creatures, some with teary eyes, stare blankly into a light on an activist's video camera. Finnish advocacy group Oikeutta Elaimille, or Justice for Animals, and Humane Society International have released images taken from an 'undercover investigation' at three fur farms in western Finland in late October to highlight the behind-the-scenes realities of the trade. The activists’ incursion came as the European Union, which counts Finland as a member, is awaiting advice in March from the EU agency that oversees animal welfare before deciding in March 2026 whether it should propose a ban on fur farming altogether. FIFUR, a Finnish fur-breeders group, blasted the 'covert filming' of the farms, accusing the intruders of 'breaching strict biosecurity requirements' on farms where operations are 'strictly controlled by national laws and regulations' and where veterinarians monitor animal welfare. Some viewers might ache over the conditions of the cuddly-looking creatures; others might wonder what the big deal is: The industry is — at least for now — legal and regulated. Aside from the animals’ captivity in small cages — with sometimes more than one in a single cage — none of the images shows abuse in progress. No explanation was given for the bright red blood on what looked like an open gash and exposed bone in a single Arctic fox’s tail area. 'These pictures and these intrusions ... it creates a false image of normal lab animal welfare and animal keeping in the farms,' said FIFUR spokesman Olli-Pekka Nissinen, adding that his group believed the initiative to ban fur farming will be rejected. The breeders' group said the fur sector has among the highest welfare standards of any form of animal husbandry, and Nissinen suggested that farmers have little incentive to mistreat them. 'Animal welfare first shows in the animals’ fur and it’s very important for farmers to take care of the animals so that they can have decent incomes.' FIFUR says most of its 442 member farms — as of December last year — are run by family businesses, and nearly all the farms are in the Ostrobothnia region along the Baltic Sea. Finland is the world's largest producer of certified fox pelts, the industry group said. Oikeutta Eläimille spokesman Kristo Muurimaa says the operation involved entering the farms to observe and document the conditions in which the animals are kept and that the photos were taken in compliance with Finnish law. Neither side has announced plans for any legal action. 'Fur has been used by people for a long time, since the Stone Ages basically,' Muurimaa said. 'However, a practice where animals are kept in very small barren cages is not that old. It is a product of modern times where animals are seen just as products.' 'This kind of treatment of animals doesn’t belong to this day. Times have moved on and now it’s time to leave this kind of cruelty behind,' he added. 'Nobody needs fur in modern times. Fur is mostly used as a status symbol by the rich elite in countries like China and Russia.' The 27-country EU, according to its most recent figures, estimates about 1,000 fur farms with roughly 7.7 million animals — including mink, fox and raccoon dogs — are active in the bloc. In neighboring Switzerland, which is not an EU member, a three-month public consultation ended last month on a government proposal to ban the import and sale of furs drawn from the 'mistreatment' of animals. The measure would allow authorities to seize such furs. Activists want the Swiss government to go further, seeking a broader definition of 'mistreatment' and wider range of fur farms affected. The issue, currently low on Switzerland's full referendum calendar, could be put to a public vote in late 2026 at the earliest. Humane Society International, in a statement last month, said tens of millions of animals suffer and die each year in the global fur trade and the 'vast majority of animals killed for their fur are kept in barren battery cages on fur farms.' Finland, the advocacy group said, is one of the last European countries where farming such animals for their fur remains legal — and finger-pointed a number of retail brands that use fox fur from Finland. China is the world's most important export market for furs, followed by South Korea and the Western Europe-North American market, said FIFUR, which counts hundreds of farms in Finland as members. In Europe, as of 2023, Poland and Greece were the biggest producers — almost entirely from mink — while Finland is third, according to a report by the industry association this year. Bird flu and coronavirus outbreaks hit the fur industry hard, notably in Denmark, since 2020, but the trend line in supply has been declining for many years. FIFUR's report showed supply volumes of mink pelts plunged by roughly three-quarters since 2010 — to 12,285 last year — a similar percentage decline to that for mink pelts, which totaled 2,440 in 2023.	https://apnews.com/article/finland-switzerland-fox-fur-trade-european-union-fefd7700d8e416111f6d7e6d49917943	2024-12-14T19:01:12-08:00	
South Korean leaders seek calm after Yoon is impeached	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea’s opposition leader offered Sunday to work with the government to ease the political tumult as officials sought to reassure allies and markets, a day after the opposition-controlled parliament voted to impeach conservative President Yoon Suk Yeol over a short-lived attempt to impose martial law. Liberal Democratic Party leader Lee Jae-myung, whose party holds a majority in the National Assembly, urged the Constitutional Court to rule swiftly on Yoon's impeachment and proposed a special council for policy cooperation between the government and parliament. Yoon's powers have been suspended until the court decides whether to remove him from office or reinstate him. If Yoon is dismissed, a national election to choose his successor must be held within 60 days. Lee, who has led a fierce political offensive against Yoon's embattled government, is seen as the frontrunner to replace him. He lost the 2022 presidential election to Yoon by a razor-thin margin. He told a televised news conference that a swift court ruling would be the only way to 'minimize national confusion and the suffering of people.' The court will meet to discuss the case Monday, and has up to 180 days to rule. But observers say that a court ruling could come faster. In the case of parliamentary impeachments of past presidents — Roh Moo-hyun in 2004 and Park Geun-hye in 2016 — the court spent 63 days and 91 days respectively before determining to reinstate Roh and dismiss Park. Lee also proposed a national council where the government and the National Assembly would work together to stabilize state affairs, and said his party won't seek to impeach Prime Minister Han Duck-soo, a Yoon appointee who's now serving as acting president. 'The Democratic Party will actively cooperate with all parties to stabilize state affairs and restore international trust,' Lee said. 'The National Assembly and government will work together to quickly resolve the crisis that has swept across the Republic of Korea.' It's unclear if Lee's proposed council will be realized. In a meeting with the parliament speaker, who touched upon Lee's idea, Han said he will closely cooperate and communicate with the National Assembly but didn't specifically say whether the government intends to join the council. Kweon Seong-dong, floor leader of the ruling People Power Party, separately criticized Lee's proposal, saying that it’s 'not right' for the opposition party acting like the ruling party. Kweon, a Yoon loyalist, said that his party will use existing PPP-government dialogue channels 'to continue to assume responsibility as the governing party until the end of President Yoon’s term.' The Democratic Party has already used its parliamentary majority to impeach the justice minister and the chief of the national police over the martial law decree, and had previously said it was also considering impeaching the prime minister. Upon assuming his role as acting leader, Han ordered the military to bolster its security posture to prevent North Korea from launching provocations. He also asked the foreign minister to inform other countries that South Korea’s major external policies will remain unchanged, and the finance minister to work to minimize potential negative impacts on the economy from the political turmoil. On Sunday, Han had a phone call with U.S. President Joe Biden, discussing the political situation in South Korea and regional security challenges including North Korea’s nuclear program. Biden expressed his appreciation for the resiliency of democracy in South Korea and reaffirmed 'the ironclad commitment' of the United States, according to both governments. Yoon’s Dec. 3 imposition of martial law, the first of its kind in more than four decades, lasted only six hours, but has caused massive political tumult, halted diplomatic activities and rattled financial markets. Yoon was forced to lift his decree after parliament unanimously voted to overturn it. Yoon sent hundreds of troops and police officers to the parliament in an effort to stop the vote, but they withdrew after the parliament rejected Yoon’s decree. No major violence occurred. Opposition parties have accused Yoon of rebellion, saying a president in South Korea is allowed to declare martial law only during wartime or similar emergencies and would have no right to suspend parliament’s operations even in those cases. Yoon has rejected the charges and vowed to 'fight to the end.' He said the deployment of troops to parliament was aimed at issuing a warning to the Democratic Party, which he called an 'anti-state force' that abused its control of parliament by holding up the government’s budget bill for next year and repeatedly pushing to impeach top officials. Law enforcement institutions are investigating Yoon and others involved in the martial law case over possible rebellion and other allegations. They've arrested Yoon's defense minister and police chief and two other high-level figures. Yoon has immunity from most criminal prosecution as president, but that doesn’t extend to allegations of rebellion or treason. He's been banned from leaving South Korea, but observers doubt that authorities will detain him because of the potential for clashes with his presidential security service. South Korean media reported that prosecutors asked Yoon to appear at a prosecution office for questioning on Sunday but he refused to do so. The reports said prosecutors plan to ask him to appear again. Repeated calls to a prosecutors’ office in Seoul were unanswered. Lee called for authorities to speed up their probes and said that an independent investigation by a special prosecutor should be launched as soon as possible. Last week, the National Assembly passed a law calling for such an investigation.	https://apnews.com/article/south-korea-martial-law-yoon-lee-impeachment-ca583315453be30766372702120f94e7	2024-12-14T17:35:44-08:00	
Trump appoints longtime foreign policy adviser Richard Grenell to serve as special missions envoy	WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) — President-elect Donald Trump announced Saturday that he's picked longtime foreign policy adviser Richard Grenell to serve as an envoy for special missions, tasking him with helping the incoming administration deal with some of the toughest foreign policy challenges. Grenell served as ambassador to Germany during Trump’s first administration, special presidential envoy for Serbia and Kosovo peace negotiations, and did a stint as acting director of national intelligence. He was also a contender to serve as secretary of state, but Trump opted to nominate Florida Sen. Marco Rubio. 'Ric will work in some of the hottest spots around the World, including Venezuela and North Korea,' Trump said in a posting on his social media platform, Truth Social, announcing the appointment. Grenell during Trump's first term developed a reputation for employing a sometimes contentious approach to diplomacy that rankled allies and the foreign policy establishment in Washington. But his style was appreciated by the president-elect who sees value in blunt talk with allies. Grenell remained close to Trump after he left office in 2021, serving at times as a key adviser on foreign policy. He was in the room when Trump met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in September. Grenell has advocated for a peace deal that would preserve Ukraine’s territory while still allowing for 'autonomous regions' where Russia could remain in control. He’s also advised against expanding NATO to include Ukraine, saying — as Trump has — that the alliance shouldn’t grow until current members meet the alliance's defense spending targets. Members of the transatlantic alliance have committed for years to spending 2% of their GDP on defense, but several countries still fall short of the target. He was an early supporter of Trump’s 2024 campaign and held multiple events for the Republican nominee focused on economics and national security. Speaking at the Republican National Convention, Grenell echoed Trump’s mantra that 'it’s time to put America first' on the global stage and argued that China and Russia saw President Joe Biden's administration as weak. Trump raised concerns among some allies during the 2024 campaign when he said he would not defend NATO members that failed to meet defense spending targets, and warned he would 'encourage' Russia 'to do whatever the hell they want' to alliance countries that he considered 'delinquent.' Grenell has downplayed Trump's criticisms of NATO and said the only talk of leaving the alliance altogether 'was really from the media.' 'What we’re saying is, don’t come to the wedding without a gift,' Grenell said. Grenell was part of the Trump campaign's outreach to Arab American voters in Michigan, where the president-elect made gains with a traditionally Democratic constituency despite his history of banning immigration from several majority-Muslim countries. Grenell orchestrated pro-Trump events with Arab American voters, including a May meeting held in Troy, Michigan. A U.S. spokesman at the United Nations during the George W. Bush administration, Grenell, like many other Republicans, has his own history of criticizing Trump before embracing him. Once an adviser to GOP moderates like 2012 presidential nominee Mitt Romney and a supporter of gay marriage, Grenell, who is openly gay, deleted social media posts blasting Trump as 'reckless' and 'dangerous' once the former reality TV star became the Republican nominee in 2016. Trump also announced Saturday that he’s appointing Devin Nunes, the chief executive officer of the president-elect's Truth Social platform, to head a presidential advisory board that will keep tabs on the U.S. intelligence community. Nunes will continue leading Trump Media &amp; Technology Group. Trump is the company’s largest shareholder. The former California lawmaker chaired the House Intelligence Committee and was one of Trump’s closest allies in Congress during the president-elect's first term. ___ Kinnard reported from Columbia, South Carolina.	https://apnews.com/article/richard-grenell-secretary-of-state-trump-5e7410edd659870307a5eba762f8136c	2024-12-14T16:57:03-08:00	
Fighting in eastern Congo between army and rebels intensifies ahead of peace talks Sunday	GOMA, Congo (AP) — Fighting between the Congolese army and the M23 rebel group intensified in eastern Congo in recent days ahead of much anticipated peace talks on Sunday, the army said. Congo's army accused the M23 of killing 12 civilians earlier this week in villages of the Lubero territory in the eastern province of North-Kivu in a statement on Friday. An M23 spokesperson told The Associated Press it denied the accusation, discrediting it as 'propaganda' from Congo's government. M23 is one of about 100 armed groups that have been vying for a foothold in mineral-rich eastern Congo near the border with Rwanda, in a conflict that has created one of the world’s largest humanitarian crises. More than 7 million people have been displaced. Congo and the United Nations accuse Rwanda of backing M23. Rwanda denies the claim, but in February admitted that it has troops and missile systems in eastern Congo to safeguard its security, pointing to a buildup of Congolese forces near the border. U.N. experts estimate there are up to 4,000 Rwandan forces in Congo. Last month, Congo and Rwanda’s foreign ministers agreed on the terms and conditions of the disengagement of Rwandan forces in eastern Congo. In July, Congo signed a ceasefire with M23 that came into effect in August, but fighting has resumed since. Earlier this month, the United States said it was 'gravely concerned' by ceasefire violations by M23 rebels. The intensification of fighting comes as Congo’s President Felix Tshisekedi and Rwanda’s President Paul Kagame are set to meet Sunday in Angola, which has been mediating the conflict. It will be their first official meeting since last year. Aline Kasereka, a mother of six living in Lubero, a town 50 kilometers (30 miles) away from the villages where the fighting took place earlier this week, said the peace talks are urgently needed. 'We are tired of the war, every day we move, we do not know in which country we are anymore,' Kasereka told the AP. 'Our authorities have to sit on the negotiation table and find a solution because we want to return to our normal life,' she added. Henry Pacifique, analyst for the Kivu Security Barometer research project, says he remains pessimistic about the outcome of the summit. 'It seems like Angola is trying to force Congo and Rwanda to participate, while both parties continue to make the other the scapegoat to justify future violations of the agreement,' he said.	https://apnews.com/article/congo-rwanda-m23-ceasefire-angola-d97ae3918051df70d2dd85fd36f729c0	2024-12-14T10:28:54-08:00	
Isak Andic, founder of Spanish fashion brand Mango, dies in accident, aged 71	BARCELONA, Spain (AP) — Isak Andic, the founder of Spanish fashion brand Mango, has died after suffering an accident, the company said on Saturday. He was 71. 'It is with deep regret that we announce the unexpected death of Isak Andic, our non-executive chairman and founder of Mango, in an accident that occurred this Saturday,' Mango CEO Toni Ruiz said in a statement, without providing details. Spanish news agency EFE and other media outlets, including La Vanguardia newspaper, said Andic died following a fall while hiking near Barcelona. Spain’s Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez paid tribute to Andic on social media, lauding his 'hard work and business vision that transformed a Spanish brand into a global fashion leader.' Andic’s family moved from Turkey to Spain when he was young. He opened Mango’s first store in Barcelona in 1984 and over the following decades helped Mango grow into one of Europe’s leading fast fashion makers. Mango has 2,700 stores in 120 markets around the world. It set a company record of 3.1 billion euros ($3.2 billion) in sales in 2023. It is currently expanding in the U.S. and plans to have 65 stores there by the end of 2025.	https://apnews.com/article/mango-founder-isak-andic-dies-bcf47f71f136d574527b7c4e09e30a9f	2024-12-14T10:16:14-08:00	
YouTube singer arrested in Iran after performing an online concert while not wearing a hijab	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Iranian authorities have arrested a female singer who performed a virtual concert on YouTube, a lawyer said. Milad Panahipour, an Iranian lawyer, said Parastoo Ahmady, 27, was arrested in Sari City, capital of the northern province of Mazandaran, on Saturday. On Thursday, the judiciary had filed a case regarding Ahmady’s concert performance, in which she performed wearing a long black sleeveless and collarless dress, but no hijab. She was accompanied by four male musicians. Ahmady had posted her concert on YouTube the day before, saying: 'I am Parastoo, a girl who wants to sing for the people I love. This is a right I could not ignore; singing for the land I love passionately.' The online concert has been viewed more than 1.4 million times. Panahipour told The Associated Press: 'Unfortunately, we do not know the charges against Ms. Ahmady, who arrested her, or her place of detention, but we will follow up on the matter through legal authorities.' He also said two musicians in Ahmady's band — Soheil Faghih Nasiri and Ehsan Beiraghdar — were arrested in Tehran on Saturday. Following the Islamic Revolution in Iran in 1979, women were banned at first from singing altogether, then from singing or dancing solo before mixed-gender audiences. Female vocalists could perform for male audiences only as a part of a chorus. But they are allowed to sing in a hall for female-only audiences. Also based on Iranian and Islamic law, women are not allowed to appear without a hijab in front of men who are not related. In Iran, the hijab — and the all-encompassing black chador worn by some — has long been a political symbol as well, particularly after becoming mandatory in the years following the 1979 Islamic Revolution. For observant Muslim women, the head covering is a sign of piety before God and modesty in front of men outside their families. There were protests across Iran in 2022 following the death of Mahsa Amini, 22, after her arrest by the country’s morality police over allegedly not wearing her hijab. While police became hesitant to strictly enforce the Islamic dress code — possibly to avoid even wider demonstrations and displays of defiance — in recent weeks the authorities' tone has changed.	https://apnews.com/article/iran-female-singer-youtube-arrest-f862c9ef4fc37cd574ec8c71fd4c74f9	2024-12-14T10:13:34-08:00	
Pelosi has hip replacement surgery at a US military hospital in Germany after a fall	WASHINGTON (AP) — Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had hip replacement surgery Saturday at a U.S. military hospital in Germany after falling while at an event in Luxembourg with other members of Congress. Pelosi, 84, 'is well on the mend,' said Ian Krager, a spokesman for the California Democrat, in a statement. Pelosi thanked the staff at Landstuhl Regional Medical Center and the hospital in Luxembourg, where she was also treated, for 'their excellent care and kindness.' She was in Europe with a bipartisan congressional delegation to mark the 80th anniversary of the Battle of the Bulge in World War II. Pelosi tripped and fell while at an event and fractured her hip, according to people familiar with her injury who were not authorized to publicly discuss the matter and spoke on condition of anonymity. Among those on the trip was Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, who posted on social media Friday that he was 'praying for a speedy recovery,' for Pelosi. The two lawmakers were captured holding hands in a group photo that day at the U.S. Embassy in Luxembourg. Pelosi was first elected in 1987. She served as speaker twice, stepped down from her leadership post two years ago but remained in Congress and was reelected to represent her San Francisco district in November. ___ Associated Press writer Farnoush Amiri contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/pelosi-hip-replacement-surgery-fall-germany-b01379d1f1124dcd3cf41c789dae4a58	2024-12-14T09:00:47-08:00	
Women's right activists rally in France ahead of Gisèle Pelicot's rape trial verdict	AVIGNON, France (AP) — Hundreds of people gathered Saturday in the southern French town of Avignon ahead of the verdict in a trial in which dozens of men are accused of raping Gisèle Pelicot while she was drugged and rendered unconscious by her husband. The court is expected to deliver its verdicts by Dec. 20 in the trial of 51 defendants. Last month, prosecutors asked the panel of judges for the maximum possible penalty for aggravated rape — 20 years — against the victim’s now ex-husband, Dominique Pelicot, 72. Gisèle Pelicot, 71, has become an icon for those fighting against sexual violence. She testified during the proceedings about the harrowing events, which have sparked widespread public attention. Outside the courth, demonstrators held placards with messages such as, 'Victims, we believe you, rapists we see you,' and, 'Shame changes sides.' One large banner displayed on a wall read: 'Rape has no nationality.' Elsewhere, activists posted notes with 'Gentle words for Gisèle' on a fence. Activist Marine Thebaud, who is a member of the Family Planning association, said: 'We hope that justice will be up to the acts committed against Gisèle, that impunity will end and that people will be punished. We’re here to show support for all victims of patriarchal violence.' Alain Souberan said he joined the gathering because his partner 'is a convinced feminist who sings in the Avignon feminist choir.' 'Personally, I really support this movement. I think men have their place as supporters too,' he said. The trial, which started in September, has drawn attention beyond France, with Pelicot’s courage in facing her accusers transforming her into a symbol for victims of sexual violence.	https://apnews.com/article/gisele-pelicot-france-rape-trial-protest-646e49f2349f6a82ffc7d93b16858432	2024-12-14T08:46:10-08:00	
Filipino woman on Indonesia death row recalls a stunning last minute reprieve and 'miracle' transfer	YOGYAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) — Filipino death row inmate Mary Jane Fiesta Veloso knelt to pray when officers came to take her to an execution site in May 2015, just a few feet away from her isolation cell on an Indonesian prison island, where a 13-member firing squad was waiting. While she prayed, the Philippines government was wrapping up a lengthy legal battle over her fate. Veloso’s life was ultimately spared — temporarily — by Indonesia’s Attorney General's Office, which issued a stay of execution shortly before Veloso was to be executed with eight other death row inmates. 'Lord, many people there believe that I am guilty, but many people out there believe that I am innocent. Lord, You are the One who knows everything, You knew that I am innocent, so I beg You, please prove that by saving me,' Veloso recalled praying in a tearful interview with The Associated Press at a female prison in Yogyakarta on Tuesday. Duped into becoming a drug courier The reprieve aimed to provide an opportunity for Veloso's testimony to expose how a criminal syndicate duped her into being an unwitting accomplice and courier in drug trafficking. Shock washed over Veloso as a group of officials from the attorney general's office informed her of the stay just as she was being led out to the execution site on Nusakambangan prison island. In tears, she remembered a cocoon she saw the previous night hanging from a tree branch near her cell. 'In the Philippines we believe that if there is a cocoon, there will be a new life,' Veloso said. 'That means I will not be executed because God will give me a new life.' Veloso, now 39, was arrested in 2010 at the airport in the Indonesian ancient city of Yogyakarta, where officials discovered about 2.6 kilograms (5.7 pounds) of heroin hidden in her luggage. The single mother of two sons was convicted and sentenced to death. Veloso has maintained her innocence throughout her 14 years of incarceration. She has spent her time in prison designing Indonesian batik clothing, painting, tailoring and learning interior design and other skills. Veloso was granted a stay of execution because her alleged boss was arrested in the Philippines, and the authorities there requested Indonesian assistance in pursuing a case against her. The woman, who allegedly recruited Veloso to work in Kuala Lumpur, Maria Kristina Sergio, surrendered to police in the Philippines just two days ahead of her scheduled execution. The dramatic turn of events began last month, when in an unusual last-ditch effort to delay Veloso’s death, Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. announced that a deal had been reached for Indonesia to send Veloso home after a decade of pleading from Manila. 'Mary Jane Veloso is coming home,' Marcos said in a statement. 'Arrested in 2010 on drug trafficking charges and sentenced to death, Mary Jane’s case has been a long and difficult journey.' A practical arrangement A 'practical arrangement' between Indonesia and the Philippines was signed on Dec. 6, to send Veloso home, which is expected before Christmas. Although there is no treaty between the countries, Indonesia and the Philippines are both members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and the transfer of convicts in the ASEAN region is in accordance with the bloc’s Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty, said Raul Vasquez, the undersecretary at the Department of Justice of the Philippines, after the signing ceremony. Indonesia’s Yusril Ihza Mahendra, Indonesia’s coordinating minister for law, human rights, immigration and corrections, lauded the transfer agreement as a 'historic milestone' between Indonesia and the Philippines, and part of the new administration of President Prabowo Subianto’s 'good neighbor' policy. Once repatriated, Mahendra said, if the Philippines want to pardon Veloso or grant clemency, 'that is entirely their authority in which we must also respect,' the minister added. The Philippines, Asia’s largest Roman Catholic nation, has abolished the death penalty. ‘Like a miracle’ Veloso described the decision as being 'like a miracle when I have lost all hope.' 'For almost 15 years I was separated from my children and parents, and I could not see my children grow up,' she said, her eyes filled with tears. 'I wish to be given an opportunity to take care of my children and to be close to my parents.' Born in Cabanatuan, a city in Nueva Ecija province, Veloso was the youngest of five siblings of a family who lived in extreme poverty. Her father worked as a seasonal agricultural worker on a sugar cane plantation and her mother collected discarded bottles and plastic to sell to junk shops. Veloso dropped out of school in her first year of high school and married her husband when she was just 16 years old. The couple later separated and she became a single mother to two young sons, forcing her to emigrate to Dubai in 2009 to work as maid. She returned to the Philippines before the end of her two-year contract after an attempted rape by her employer. A year later, Veloso was recruited by Sergio to be employed as a domestic servant in Malaysia but later was shifted to Indonesia. Major drug smuggling hub The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime says Indonesia is a major drug smuggling hub despite having some of the strictest drug laws in the world, in part because international drug syndicates target its young population. Indonesia's last executions were carried out in July 2016, when an Indonesian and three foreigners were shot by firing squad. There are about 530 people on death row in Indonesia, mostly for drug-related crimes, including 96 foreigners, the Ministry of Immigration and Corrections' data showed as of last month. The Indonesian government recently agreed in principle to return five Australian nationals and a French national to their home countries. 'I was not a good Catholic before, and prison has changed my life into a skilled person who has become closer to God,' Veloso said. 'I am ready to build a new life, like a butterfly emerging from a cocoon.' ___ Associated Press writer Niniek Karmini in Jakarta, Indonesia, contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/indonesia-philippines-veloso-interview-prisoner-transfer-0a18931e2d0ef52c1ff8953a07cd5f64	2024-12-14T08:36:48-08:00	
Charles Dickens' characters come alive in a Dutch town enamored with the English author	DEVENTER, Netherlands (AP) — The Dutch city of Deventer transformed Saturday into a pocket of 19th-century England, with 950 people in costumes bringing characters from Charles Dickens’ books to life. Oliver Twist, Ebenezer Scrooge and Miss Havisham were among the characters at hand, mingling with chimney sweepers, livestock and Christmas carol singers in Deventer’s historic center. Onlookers bowed when Queen Victoria passed through. Merchants peddle antiques and gingerbread, while people portraying pickpockets try to avoid being tossed in a mock Marshalsea Prison. The town's link to Dickens is Emmy Strik, who started the weekend-long festival to protest rules against keeping her antique shop open on Sunday. Strik and other shopowners dressed up in the 19th-century England costumes and walked out on the streets. The protest evolved into an annual festival and Strik, now 84, has collected more than 1,000 Dickensian costumes for the event. Organizers enforce the dress code strictly — no clothes or accessories from after the 1800s. Sandra Nieland, playing the queen, described her costume to The Associated Press: 'In her younger years, she was, of course, a beautiful queen. And in her older years, she was mourning her husband, Albert and, well, she was always in black and not (wearing) too much stuff. Just her rings. ... She always wore a lot of rings.' It’s the 32nd edition of the festival, which attracts some 100,000 visitors each year from around the Netherlands and abroad, according to the town organizers. That means big crowds, who line up to enter the narrow streets. Amateur street actor Stef Jongbloed reveled in the festive energy. In addition to specific characters, he said, 'you also have so many people that just dress up just for fun and just walk around here the entire day. Also doing it together is what makes it so amazing.'	https://apnews.com/article/charles-dickens-festival-netherlands-cf900102dffb73f722ae70e99b209360	2024-12-14T08:20:55-08:00	
US officials have been in direct contact with the Syrian rebel group that ousted Assad, Blinken says	AQABA, Jordan (AP) — American officials have been in direct contact with the terrorist-designated rebel group that led the overthrow of Syrian President Bashar Assad, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Saturday. Blinken, speaking at a news conference in Jordan, was the first U.S. official to publicly confirm contacts between the Biden administration and Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, which led a coalition of armed opposition groups that drove Assad from power and into asylum in Russia last weekend. Along with counterparts from eight Arab nations and Turkey and senior officials from the European Union and United Nations, Blinken signed off on a set of principles meant to guide Syria’s transition to a peaceful, nonsectarian and inclusive country. Blinken would not discuss details of the direct contacts with HTS but said it was important for the U.S. to convey messages to the group about its conduct and how it intends to govern in a transition period. 'Yes, we have been in contact with HTS and with other parties,' Blinken said in the port city of Aqaba. He added that 'our message to the Syrian people is this: We want them to succeed and we’re prepared to help them do so.' HTS, once an affiliate of al-Qaida, has been designed as a foreign terrorist organization by the U.S. State Department since 2018. That designation carries severe sanctions, including a ban on the provision of any 'material support' to the group or its members. The sanctions do not, however, legally bar U.S. officials from communicating with designated groups. In an interview Saturday on Syrian television, the group’s leader, Ahmad al-Sharaa, formerly known as Abu Mohammed al-Golani, did not address any direct contact with the United States, but said the new authorities in Damascus are in touch with Western embassies. He also said that 'we don’t intend to enter any conflict because there is general exhaustion in Syria.' HTS has worked to establish security and start a political transition after seizing Damascus and has tried to reassure a public both stunned by Assad’s fall and concerned about extremist jihadis among the rebels. Insurgent leaders say the group has broken with its extremist past. Blinken also stressed that 'the success that we’ve had in ending the territorial caliphate' of the Islamic State group remains 'a critical mission.' And citing the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces, the Kurdish fighters who in recent years drove IS out of large areas of Syria, he called it 'very important at this moment that they continue that role because this is a moment of instability' in which IS 'will seek to regroup and take advantage of.' A joint statement after the meeting of foreign ministers urged all parties to cease hostilities in Syria and expressed support for a locally led transitional political process. It called for preventing the reemergence of extremist groups and ensuring the security and safe destruction of chemical weapons stockpiles. 'We don’t want Syria to fall into chaos,' Jordan’s foreign minister, Ayman Safadi, told journalists. A separate statement by Arab foreign ministers called for U.N.-supervised elections based on a new constitution approved by Syrians. Their statement condemned Israel’s incursion into the buffer zone with Syria and adjacent sites over the past week as a 'heinous occupation' and demanded the withdrawal of Israeli forces. U.S. officials say al-Sharaa has been making welcomed comments about protecting minority and women’s rights but they remain skeptical that he will follow through on them in the long run. On Friday, the rebels and Syria’s unarmed opposition worked to safely turn over to U.S. officials an American man who had been imprisoned by Assad. U.S. officials are continuing their search for Austin Tice, an American journalist who disappeared 12 years ago near Damascus. 'We have impressed upon everyone we’ve been in contact with the importance of helping find Austin Tice and bringing him home,' Blinken said. In other developments: —Turkey reopened its embassy in Damascus, becoming the first country to do so since the end of Assad’s rule. The embassy suspended operations 12 years ago due to insecurity during Syria's civil war. —Al-Sharaa said in the TV interview that 'the pretexts that Israel uses have ended' for its airstrikes that have destroyed much of the Syrian army's assets in recent days. He said 'the Israelis have crossed the rules of engagement' but that the insurgent group is not about to enter a conflict with Israel. —The leader of Lebanon’s Hezbollah militants said the group has lost its military supply line through Syria but that the new authority there might reinstate the route. —A Syrian war monitor and a citizen journalist said gunmen attacked members of a Syrian insurgent group, Failaq al-Sham, in the country’s coastal region, killing or wounding 15 of them on Saturday. That region is home to many members of Assad’s minority Alawite sect. ___ Associated Press writer Bassem Mroue in Beirut contributed.	https://apnews.com/article/blinken-syria-assad-hts-transition-mideast-5fcff887a74dc9ec36e483c0b601a8c2	2024-12-14T06:44:36-08:00	
Ukrainian drones strike Russia as Kyiv reels from consecutive massive air attacks	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukrainian drone strikes on southern Russia killed a 9-year-old boy and set fire to a major oil terminal, officials said Saturday, the day after Moscow launched a massive aerial attack on its neighbor that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said was one of the heaviest bombardments of the country’s energy sector in the nearly three-year war. The boy died when a drone struck his family’s home outside Belgorod, a Russian city near the border with Ukraine, local Gov. Vyacheslav Gladkov reported on Saturday morning on the Telegram messaging app. His mother and 7-month-old sister were hospitalized with injuries, Gladkov said. He posted photos of what he said was the aftermath of the attack, showing a low-rise house with gaping holes in its roof and front wall flanked by mounds of rubble. Elsewhere in southern Russia, Ukrainian drones overnight hit a major oil terminal in the Oryol region, sparking a blaze, Ukraine’s General Staff reported. Photos published by the General Staff and on Russian Telegram news channels showed huge plumes of smoke engulfing the facility, backlit by an orange glow. Oryol Gov. Andrey Klychkov confirmed that a Ukrainian drone strike set fire to a fuel depot. He said later the blaze had been contained and that there were no casualties. Russia’s Defense Ministry on Saturday claimed its forces shot down 37 Ukrainian drones over the country’s south and west the previous night. Russia pummels Ukrainian energy targets The Ukrainian strikes came a day after Russia fired 93 cruise and ballistic missiles and almost 200 drones at its neighbor, further battering Ukraine’s energy infrastructure, around half of which has been destroyed during the war. Rolling electricity blackouts are common and widespread, and Zelenskyy charged Friday that Moscow is 'terrorizing millions of people' with such assaults. According to Ukraine’s air force, Russia kept up its drone attacks on Saturday, launching 132 across Ukrainian territory. Fifty-eight drones were shot down and a further 72 veered off course, likely due to electronic jamming, it said. The Russian Defense Ministry said its forces used long-range precision missiles and drones on 'critically important fuel and energy facilities in Ukraine that ensure the functioning of the military industrial complex.' The strike was in retaliation for Wednesday’s Ukrainian attack using U.S.-supplied the Army Tactical Missile System, or ATACMs, on a Russian air base, it said. Kyiv’s Western allies have provided Ukraine with air defense systems to help it protect critical infrastructure, but Russia has sought to overwhelm the air defenses with combined strikes involving large numbers of missiles and drones called 'swarms.' Russia has held the initiative this year as its military has steadily rammed through Ukrainian defenses in the east in a series of slow but steady offensives. But uncertainty surrounds how the war might unfold next year. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, who takes office next month, has vowed to end the war and has thrown into doubt whether vital U.S. military support for Kyiv will continue. North Koreans reportedly in combat in Kursk Zelenskyy said Saturday that a 'significant number' of North Korean troops were being deployed by Moscow in assaults in Russia’s southern Kursk region, where Ukrainian troops have held on following a stunning cross-border incursion this summer. In a televised address, Zelenskyy said that North Korean soldiers have so far not entered the fight on Ukrainian soil, but claimed they are already taking 'noticeable' losses. Elsewhere, Ukrainian officials reported that Russian shelling on Friday and overnight killed at least two civilians and wounded 14 others in front-line areas Ukraine’s south and northeast. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-drones-strike-attack-b4968f78072239d0d114423337cefd88	2024-12-14T05:09:05-08:00	
Middle East latest: Top diplomats from US, Arab League and Turkey discuss Syria's transition	Top diplomats from the United States, the Arab League and Turkey met in Jordan on Saturday to discuss how to assist Syria ’s transition after the fall of Bashar Assad's government a week ago. No Syrian representatives attended. The collapse of the Assad family’s more than half-century of rule has sparked new fears of instability in a region already shaken by the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza and hostilities between Israel and the Lebanon-based Hezbollah despite a tenuous ceasefire. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said American officials have been in direct contact with the Syrian insurgent group that led the overthrow of Assad’s government, but the group continues to be designated a foreign terrorist organization by the United States and others. The insurgent leader in an interview with Syrian TV didn't mention contact with the U.S., but he warned Israel about the hundreds of airstrikes it has carried out in Syria in the past week. The U.S. is also making a renewed push for a ceasefire in Gaza, where the war has plunged more than 2 million Palestinians into a severe humanitarian crisis. Here's the latest: Gunmen loyal to Assad attack members of a Syrian insurgent group BEIRUT — A Syrian war monitor and a citizen journalist say gunmen attacked members of a Syrian insurgent group in the country’s coastal region, killing or wounding 15 of them Saturday. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said loyalists to former President Bashar Assad killed and wounded members of the Failaq al-Sham group, which took part in the attacks that led to the overthrow of Assad a week ago. The coastal region is home to many members of Assad’s minority Alawite sect. Citizen journalist Taher al-Omar said Failaq al-Sham members were ambushed near the town of Jableh by 'sectarian gunmen.' He said several were killed, without giving details. More Israeli airstrikes in Gaza kill at least 11 DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — Witnesses and medical officials are reporting more Israeli airstrikes in Gaza. Four people were killed late Saturday in an airstrike on a tent in the central city of Deir al-Balah, according to an Associated Press journalist who counted the bodies at Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital. Elsewhere, Palestinian medical officials said an airstrike killed at least seven people, including a woman and her baby, in Gaza City. The strike hit the Majda Wasilla school, which shelters many displaced families, according to Al-Ahli Hospital, which received the bodies. Ataf Saadat, a woman sheltering in the school, said the baby killed was two days old. 'There were those who were burned, and those who were cut up, and the rubble was on top of them,' Saadat said. Israel’s military said it struck Hamas fighters at a command center in a compound previously used as a school. Syria meeting's statement calls for peace, supports political transition A joint statement after a ministerial meeting on Syria's future is calling for all parties to cease hostilities there and expresses support for a locally led transitional political process. The statement was issued Saturday after a meeting in Jordan by several Arab nations, the United States, Turkey, the European Union and others. It called for preventing the reemergence of extremist groups in Syria and ensuring the security and safe destruction of chemical weapons stockpiles. It also expressed full support for Syria’s territorial integrity. A separate statement issued by Arab foreign ministers called for U.N.-supervised elections based on a new constitution approved by Syrians. That statement also condemned Israel’s incursion into the buffer zone with Syria and adjacent sites over the past week as a 'heinous occupation' and demands the withdrawal of Israeli forces. Hezbollah leader says main supply line via Syria has been cut BEIRUT — The leader of Lebanon’s Hezbollah militants says the fall of Bashar Assad in Syria has cut a main supply line for the group but it can find other ways to bring in weapons. Hezbollah was a main backer of Assad and sent thousands of fighters to Syria over the past decade. And for decades, Hezbollah relied on Syria as a channel for weapons from the militant group's main backer, Iran. In his first public comments in the week since Assad’s fall, Hezbollah leader Naim Kassem in a televised speech Saturday said Hezbollah has lost the military supply line through Syria but the new authority there might reinstate the route. Otherwise, he said, 'we might find other ways.' Kassem also said Hezbollah hopes the new authority in Syria will consider Israel an enemy. Head of Syrian insurgents warns Israel about airstrikes but doesn't seek conflict DAMASCUS, Syria — The head of the Syrian insurgent group that led the overthrow of Bashar Assad's government says they are not about to enter a conflict with Israel. But Ahmad al-Sharaa in his first public comments on Israel in the week since Assad's fall said 'the pretexts that Israel uses have ended' for its airstrikes inside Syria in recent days. Al-Sharaa said 'the Israelis have crossed the rules of engagement' in his interview with Syrian TV on Saturday. About 400 Israeli airstrikes in the past days have destroyed much of the Syrian army's assets. Al-Sharaa leads Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS. The excerpts released from his interview did not address contact with the United States, which on Saturday said had been in direct communication with HTS, which it designated a foreign terrorist organization years ago. The HTS leader did say the new authorities in Damascus are in contact with Western embassies, and that authorities have a plan to start reconstruction and development in Syria. He did not give details. He added that the authorities have given Russia — a key backer of Assad — an opportunity to reconsider relations with the Syrian people, and that authorities are not hostile to the people of Iran, another Assad backer. Blinken says U.S. has had direct contact with Syrian rebel group AQABA, Jordan — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken says American officials have been in direct contact with the Syrian rebel group that led the overthrow of President Bashar Assad’s government a week ago, but the group continues to be designated a foreign terrorist organization by the United States and others. Blinken is the first U.S. official to publicly confirm contacts between the Biden administration and Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, which ousted Assad. Speaking at a news conference in Jordan, Blinken would not discuss details of the contacts but said it was important for the U.S. to convey messages to the group about its conduct and how it intends to govern in a transition period. Medical officials say Israeli airstrike kills 10 in Gaza DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — Palestinian medical officials say at least 10 people were killed Saturday in an Israeli airstrike that apparently targeted a municipal meeting in central Gaza. The officials said the strike hit the municipality complex for Deir al-Balah city as officials from central and southern Gaza met to coordinate how to receive vehicles provided by the United Arab Emirates. The complex includes a building used by the Hamas-run interior ministry and is surrounded by a public market, which was crowded when the strike occurred. Among the dead were a mother and her 5-year-old daughter, according to al-Aqsa Martyrs hospital and an AP journalist at the morgue. The dead also include Diab al-Garu, head of the Deir al-Balah municipality, the hospital said. The Israeli military said it struck a Hamas fighter in a compound it said was used to plan attacks. Turkey reopens its embassy in Syria ISTANBUL — Turkey reopened its embassy in Syria on Saturday, becoming the first country to do so since the end of Bashar Assad’s rule last weekend. The Syrian insurgents who overthrew Assad had received vital help from Turkey. The Turkish flag was raised above the compound in Damascus for the first time since diplomatic ties were cut in 2012. The embassy suspended operations 12 years ago due to insecurity during the Syrian civil war. Several countries maintained diplomatic ties with Assad's government during the 13-year conflict, while others reopened their diplomatic missions in recent years as they sought to normalize relations. US Secretary of State Blinken wrapping up regional tour in Jordan AQABA, Jordan — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken says broad consensus exists among regional partners that Syria’s new government must be inclusive, must respect women and minority rights, reject terrorism and secure and destroy suspected Assad-era chemical weapons stockpiles. Blinken is wrapping up a three-country regional tour in Aqaba after visiting Iraq, Turkey and Jordan once already this week. Earlier Saturday in a meeting with U.N. Special Envoy for Syria Geir Pederson, Blinken said he expected to talk about the challenges ahead for Syria and 'our determination to work together to support a Syrian-led transition where the United Nations plays a critical role, particularly when it comes to the provision of assistance, to the protection of minorities.' Pederson agreed, saying: 'What is so critical in Syria is that we see a credible and inclusive political process that brings together all communities in Syria. And the second point is that we need to make sure that state institutions do not collapse, and that we get in humanitarian assistance as quickly as possible. And if we can achieve that, perhaps there is a new opportunity for the Syrian people.' In announcing Saturday’s meetings, the Jordanian Foreign Ministry said the ministers would 'discuss ways to support a comprehensive political process led by Syrians to achieve a transitional process,' which 'ensures the reconstruction of Syrian state institutions, and preserves Syria’s unity, territorial integrity, sovereignty, security, stability, and the rights of all its citizens.'	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-syria-news-14-december-2024-9679866cce4bde8077accd753b0130cd	2024-12-14T03:29:07-08:00	
AP Photos: K-pop light sticks take over protests that fueled impeachment of South Korea's president	Seoul (AP) — K-pop light sticks, Christmas lights and even Santa Claus outfits have taken over daily protests demanding the ouster of South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol following his shocking martial law declaration this month. On Saturday, the country’s parliament voted to impeach Yoon to suspend his powers. The Constitutional Court will determine whether to remove him from office or restore his presidential powers. Yoon's short-lived Dec. 3 order has sparked massive protests, drawing attention to their unique protest culture. Young demonstrators have taken over the streets with their K-pop light sticks, traditionally reserved for music concerts, to voice their dissent and in turn start a new trend in political protesting. The sea of light could be seen outside Seoul’s National Assembly, transforming the usually banker-filled financial district of Yeouido into a sea of lights. Many, seemingly in their 20s and 30s, adorned their clothing with Christmas decorations, Santa Outfit, colorful light sticks, and LED candles. Labor unions and political parties, with politicians and representatives at the front of the rally giving speeches and leading the group, have led the demonstrations. But unlike previous protests, the forefront was left to the young with their light sticks and K-pop songs.	https://apnews.com/article/south-korea-protesters-photo-gallery-yoon-b17f96063a2635ebc87f35ed9ab5ac5b	2024-12-14T00:58:54-08:00	
PEN America condemns the arrest of Iranian activist Reza Khandan	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — PEN America condemned the arrest of Reza Khandan, Iranian activist and husband of leading human rights lawyer Nasrin Sotoudeh, and demanded his immediate release. Karin Deutsch Karlekar, Director of Writers at Risk at the literary and human rights organization said in a statement Friday: 'We are appalled at the arrest of Reza Khandan and urge Iranian authorities to release him immediately. The pro-reform Shagh Daily cited Mahmoud Behzadi Rad, an Iranian lawyer, as saying Khandan was sentenced in 2019 over spreading 'propaganda against the system' and 'collusion against national security' and that authorities arrested him Friday to carry out the sentencing. PEN American said Khandan was sentenced to six years in prison 'for making and distributing buttons protesting Iran’s compulsory hijab laws in January 2019.' Khandan, also a lawyer, was summoned to prison in Feb. 2023, but the order was not enforced at the time, the organization. His wife, Sotoudeh, is renowned for defending activists, opposition politicians and women prosecuted for removing their headscarves. In March 2019, she was sentenced to a total of 38 years and 148 lashes on a range of charges. Since 2023, she has been out on bail. According to PEN America’s 2023 Freedom To Write Index, at least 49 Iranian writers were arrested for their work last year, making Iran the second-highest jailer of writers in the world after China. Iran is also the world’s top jailer of female writers.	https://apnews.com/article/iran-activist-sotoudeh-khandan-pen-america-883f854be8c760e8784e7781f4ab1014	2024-12-13T23:50:59-08:00	
Popular actor in southern India is freed on bail after spending a night in jail in a stampede case	NEW DELHI (AP) — A popular actor in southern India was released from jail on bail on Saturday, a day after he was arrested by police in connection with a stampede that led to the death of a woman at the premiere of his movie earlier this month. A 35-year-old woman died and her 8-year-old son was critically injured in the stampede, which occurred during the screening of Allu Arjun’s release for 'Pushpa 2: The Rule' in southern Telangana state's Hyderabad city on Dec. 4. Arjun was arrested after the woman’s husband filed a case against him, his security team and the theater's management for not informing police of the actor’s plan to attend the screening, which resulted in a larger-than-expected crowd. Police charged the actor, his security team and the theater’s management staff with culpable homicide not amounting to murder. Police have already arrested the theater’s owner and two of his employees in connection with the case. A local court on Friday ordered the actor to spend 14 days in jail, but within hours the Telangana High Court granted him bail. However, the actor had to spend the night in jail because prison authorities did not receive a copy of the bail until late Friday, the Press Trust of India reported. The accident happened after the 41-year-old actor made a surprise appearance at a local theater where the movie was being screened. As his fans surged toward the venue, the theater’s main gate collapsed, resulting in the stampede. The actor did not comment on the police charges or his arrest. But shortly after the accident, Arjun wrote on the social platform X that he was 'heartbroken by the tragic incident.' He later announced financial assistance of $29,000 for the woman’s family and promised to take care of the medical expenses for her injured son. Deadly stampedes are relatively common in India, where large crowds gather in small areas with shoddy infrastructure and few crowd safety measures.	https://apnews.com/article/india-actor-jail-bail-stampede-accident-47aca28ba5b9d123e42547d78553c8da	2024-12-13T21:45:17-08:00	
UN talks fail to reach agreement on dealing with rising risk of global drought	BENGALURU, India (AP) — Despite two weeks of U.N.-sponsored talks in Saudi Arabia’s Riyadh, the participating 197 nations failed to agree early Saturday on a plan to deal with global droughts, made longer and more severe by a warming climate. The biennial talks, known as COP 16 and organized by a UN body that deals with combating desertification and droughts, attempted to create strong global mandates to legally bind and require nations to fund early warning systems and build resilient infrastructure in poorer countries, particularly Africa, which is worst affected by the changes. The United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification released a report earlier this week warning that if global warming trends continue, nearly five billion people — including in most of Europe, parts of the western U.S., Brazil, eastern Asia and central Africa — will be affected by the drying of Earth’s lands by the end of the century, up from a quarter of the world’s population today. The report also said farming was particularly at risk, which can lead to food insecurity for communities worldwide. This is the fourth time UN talks aimed at getting countries to agree to make more headway on tackling biodiversity loss, climate change and plastic pollution have either failed to reach a consensus or delivered disappointing results this year, worrying many nations, particularly the most vulnerable. Nations participating in the Riyadh discussions decided to push the can down the road to the 2026 talks, hosted by Mongolia. 'Parties need more time to agree on what’s the best way forward to address the critical issue of drought,' said Ibrahim Thiaw, the UNCCD chief, speaking at the end of the Riyadh talks. Thiaw said the conference was 'like no other' in the talks' 30-year history. 'We have elevated the land and drought agenda beyond sector-specific discussions, establishing it as a cornerstone of global efforts to address inter-connected challenges such as climate change, biodiversity loss, food insecurity, migration and global security.' Longer-lasting solutions to drought — such as the curbing of climate change — were not a talking point. Host Saudi Arabia has been criticized in the past for stalling progress on curbing emissions from fossil fuels at other negotiations. The Gulf nation is one of the world’s largest oil producers and exporters with the second-largest global oil reserves. Earlier in the conference, hosts Saudi Arabia, a few other countries and international banks pledged $2.15 billion for drought resilience. And the Arab Coordination Group, made up of 10 development banks based in the Middle East, committed $10 billion by 2030 to address degrading land, desertification and drought. The funds are expected to support 80 of the most vulnerable countries prepare for worsening drought conditions. But the U.N. estimates that between 2007 and 2017, droughts will cost $125 billion worldwide. Erika Gomez, lead negotiator from Panama said while a decision on dealing with drought was not reached, significant progress was made in other key issues. 'We have achieved several key milestones, particularly in the growing traction of civil society engagement and the gender decision,' Gomez said. 'Until the very end, parties could not agree on whether or not the new instrument to respond to drought should be legally binding or not,' said Jes Weigelt of European climate think-tank TMG Research who has been tracking the talks. 'I fear, the UNCCD COP 16 has suffered the same fate as the biodiversity and climate COPs this year. It failed to deliver,' he said. ___ Follow Sibi Arasu on X at @sibi123 ___ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Thai police detain 2 suspects after a bomb in a border province killed 3 and injured scores	BANGKOK (AP) — Thai police on Saturday said two suspects were in custody as authorities investigated a bombing in the north that killed at least three people and injured dozens of others. An explosive device was thrown into a crowd during an outdoor performance at an annual festival in Umphang town in Tak province, which borders Myanmar, on Friday just before midnight, according to the Association of the Umphang Rescue Groups. Local police said at least 48 people were injured and that police have not yet pressed charges against the suspects as the investigation is ongoing. Thanathip Sawangsang, a spokesperson for the Defense Ministry, told The Associated Press that local police said there was a fight between rival groups of men before the explosion and that there was no wider security threat. He said the forensic evidence showed that the explosive device was a homemade bomb. Tak province has a heavy military presence in its border areas, including in Umphang. Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra expressed her condolences to the victims and their families, and ordered security personnel and relevant agencies in the area to investigate and help those who have been affected, said government spokesperson Jirayu Houngsap.	https://apnews.com/article/thailand-bomb-tak-suspects-detained-02cdc92a955d9dfe3c425593182738cf	2024-12-13T20:23:54-08:00	
Ex-soccer player Kavelashvili becomes Georgia's president in a blow to country's EU aspirations	TBILISI, Georgia (AP) — Former soccer player Mikheil Kavelashvili became president of Georgia on Saturday, as the ruling party tightened its grip in what the opposition calls a blow to the country’s EU aspirations and a victory for former imperial ruler Russia. Kavelashvili, 53, who was the only candidate on the ballot, easily won the vote given the Georgian Dream party’s control of a 300-seat electoral college that replaced direct presidential elections in 2017. It is made up of members of Parliament, municipal councils and regional legislatures. Georgian Dream retained control of Parliament in the South Caucasus nation in an Oct. 26 election that the opposition alleges was rigged with Moscow’s help. The party has vowed to continue pushing toward EU accession but also wants to 'reset' ties with Russia. Georgia’s outgoing president and main pro-Western parties have boycotted the post-election parliamentary sessions and demanded a rerun of the ballot. In 2008 Russia fought a brief war with Georgia, which led to Moscow’s recognition of two breakaway regions as independent, and an increase in the Russian military presence in South Ossetia and Abkhazia. Critics have accused Georgian Dream — established by Bidzina Ivanishvili, a shadowy billionaire who made his fortune in Russia — of becoming increasingly authoritarian and tilted toward Moscow, accusations the ruling party has denied. The party recently pushed through laws similar to those used by the Kremlin to crack down on freedom of speech and LGBTQ+ rights. Pro-Western Salome Zourabichvili has been president since 2018 and has vowed to stay on after her six-year term ends Monday, describing herself as the only legitimate leader until a new election is held. Georgian Dream's decision last month to suspend talks on their country's bid to join the European Union added to the opposition's outrage and galvanized protests. Who is the outgoing president? Zourabichvili, 72, was born in France to parents with Georgian roots and had a successful career with the French Foreign Ministry before President Mikheil Saakashvili named her Georgia's top diplomat in 2004. Constitutional changes made the president’s job largely ceremonial before Zourabichvili was elected by popular vote with Georgian Dream's support in 2018. She became sharply critical of the ruling party, accusing it of pro-Russia policies, and Georgian Dream unsuccessfully tried to impeach her. 'I remain your president — there is no legitimate parliament and thus no legitimate election or inauguration,' she has declared on the social network X. 'My mandate continues.' Zourabichvili rejects government claims that the opposition was fomenting violence. 'We are not demanding a revolution,' she told The Associated Press. 'We are asking for new elections, but in conditions that will ensure that the will of the people will not be misrepresented or stolen again. 'Georgia has been always resisting Russian influence and will not accept having its vote stolen and its destiny stolen.' Zourabichvili said Saturday’s vote was a 'provocation' and 'a parody' while a leader of one of Georgia’s main opposition parties said it was unconstitutional. Giorgi Vashadze of the Unity National Movement Coalition said Zourabichvili is 'the only legitimate source of power.' Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze said Kavelashvili’s win 'will make a significant contribution to strengthening Georgia’s statehood and our sovereignty, as well as reducing radicalism and so-called polarization.' 'The main mission of the presidential institution is to care for the unity of the nation and society,' said Kobakhidze, a former university professor and later chairman of Georgian Dream. Who's the ruling party presidential candidate? Georgian Dream nominated Kavelashvili — mocked for lacking higher education by Georgia's opposition. Some protesters outside Tbilisi's Parliament building on Saturday morning brought their own university diplomas while others kicked soccer balls. Kavelashvili was a striker in the English Premier League for Manchester City and played for several soccer clubs in the Swiss Super League. He was elected to Parliament in 2016 on the Georgian Dream ticket and in 2022 co-founded the People’s Power political movement, which was allied with Georgian Dream and become known for its strong anti-Western rhetoric. Kavelashvili was one of the authors of a controversial law requiring organizations that receive more than 20% of their funding from abroad to register as 'pursuing the interest of a foreign power,' similar to a Russian law used to discredit organizations critical of the government. The EU, which granted Georgia candidate status in December 2023 on condition that the country meets the bloc’s recommendations, put its accession on hold and cut financial support in June following approval of the 'foreign influence' law. How did opposition protests unfold? Thousands of demonstrators converged on the Parliament building every night after the government announced the suspension of EU accession talks on Nov. 28. Riot police used water cannons and tear gas almost daily to disperse and beat scores of protesters, some of whom threw fireworks at police officers and built barricades on the capital’s central boulevard. Hundreds were detained and over 100 treated for injuries. Several journalists were beaten by police and media workers accused authorities of using thugs to deter people from attending anti-government rallies, which Georgian Dream denies. The crackdown has drawn strong condemnation from the United States and EU officials. French President Emmanuel Macron on Friday, in a video statement in support of the protests, said Georgia’s 'European dream must not be extinguished.' 'Europe does not seek to sow chaos, Europe does not seek to destabilize or subjugate its neighbors,' he said. 'The voice of Georgians must be listened to and respected.' ″(Kavelashvili) is not elected by us. He is controlled by a puppet government, by Bidzina Ivanishvili, by Putin,' protester Sandro Samkharadze said outside Tbilisi’s Parliament building. Another protester waved a sign saying 'We are children of Europe.' Demonstrators vowed the rallies would continue. 'If (the government) wants to go to Russia, they can go to Russia, because we are not going anywhere. We are staying here,' said protester Kato Kalatozishvili. —- Associated Press writer Angela Charlton in Paris contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/georgia-president-zourabichvili-russia-kavelashvili-protests-3a7f5018879c77b6c596d312a163b79c	2024-12-13T20:23:30-08:00	
A diminished Hezbollah is made even weaker by the toppling of Assad in Syria	BEIRUT (AP) — A severely hobbled Hezbollah was in no position to help defend former Syrian President Bashar Assad, a longtime ally, from the lightning-fast insurgency that toppled him. With Assad gone, the militant group based in Lebanon is even weaker. Hezbollah was dealt a major blow during 14 months of war with Israel. The toppling of Assad, who had strong ties to Iran, has now crippled its ability to bounce back by cutting off a vital weapons-smuggling route through Syria. Hezbollah officials are deeply concerned but defiant. 'What is happening in Syria is a major, dangerous and new change, and to know why this happened needs evaluation,' Hassan Fadlallah, a Lebanese lawmaker who represents Hezbollah's political wing, said during a speech at a funeral for militants killed by Israel. 'Whatever is happening in Syria, despite its dangers, will not weaken us.' Analysts say the diminishment of Hezbollah will have big consequences for Lebanon, where for decades it has been a major political player — and for Iran, which has relied on the group as one of several proxy forces projecting power across the Middle East. It is also a game-changer for Israel, whose nemesis on its northern border is now at its most vulnerable point in decades. Ties to Syria influenced the rise and fall of Hezbollah's power The Assad dynasty, which ruled Syria for half a century with an iron fist, played a crucial role in empowering Hezbollah, which was founded in the early 1980s by Iranian advisers who came through Syria. In addition to being a conduit for Iranian weapons, Syria also was a place where Hezbollah trained fighters and manufactured its own weapons. As Hezbollah grew more powerful, it became a force Assad could rely on for protection in times of crisis. Hezbollah sent thousands of fighters to bolster Assad's forces when a civil war broke out in 2011. As insurgents swept across Syria in early December and took the city of Homs — a stone’s throw from a Syrian border town where Hezbollah had a presence — many expected the militants to put up a fierce fight. After all, they did just that in 2013, preventing Assad's opponents from advancing into Damascus. This time, Hezbollah was in disarray. Many of its top officials, including longtime leader Hassan Nasrallah, were killed in Israeli airstrikes. And months of Israeli bombardment destroyed much of its military infrastructure. With Syria's key international allies, Russia and Iran, on the sidelines, Hezbollah withdrew, and Assad was ousted quickly. 'The fall of the regime marks the end of Iran’s arms in Syria and Lebanon,' said Lt. Col. Fares al-Bayoush, a Syrian army defector who fought in the civil war against Assad's forces and Hezbollah until 2017, when he moved to Turkey. Lebanon begins to grapple with Hezbollah's ‘new reality’ In Lebanon, the sapping of Hezbollah's strength has given the army the opportunity to reassert control it had ceded, especially along its southern border. A U.S.-brokered ceasefire between the militant group and Israel states that Hezbollah should have no armed presence along that border and it has led to growing calls within Lebanon for the group's disarmament. 'To Hezbollah, it’s game over,' Samir Geagea, who leads the Christian Lebanese Forces Party, said in a statement on Sunday, hours after insurgents took Damascus. 'Sit with the Lebanese military to end your status as an armed group, and transform yourselves into a political party.' But Hezbollah’s longtime sway in the political arena in Lebanon also faces a major challenge. Many in Lebanon are angry with the group. Critics say Hezbollah violated its promise to use its weapons only to defend Lebanon when it began firing rockets into Israel last year, the day after Hamas — another Iranian-backed group — attacked Israel. Nearly than 4,000 people were killed in Lebanon during the war with Israel, according to the country's health ministry. Entire towns and villages where Hezbollah militants and their supporters lived have been flattened. More than 1 million people have been displaced, and the country's economy — which was in bad shape before the war — is in a deep hole. 'With the (Syrian) regime gone, Hezbollah in Lebanon faces an entirely new reality,' said Firas Maksad, of the Middle East Institute. Maksad said many Lebanese leaders have yet to grasp the magnitude of the change that has taken place. Even some onetime allies of Hezbollah in parliament have begun distancing themselves from the group. Gebran Bassil, a lawmaker who represents the Free Patriotic Movement, Lebanon’s other major Christian party, said Hezbollah's loss of a weapons pipeline from Iran could help Lebanon extract itself from regional conflict. 'Hezbollah should focus on internal affairs and not the wider region,' Bassil, a former ally of Hezbollah, said. It may have no choice but to narrow its ambitions. With the fall of Assad, Iran has lost control of a corridor of land that stretched through Iraq and Syria all the way to the Mediterranean, and which gave it an unimpeded route to supply Hezbollah. 'They can maybe fly in some things and smuggle some things, but that’s not gonna be on the same scale, not even close,' said Aron Lund, a Syria expert with Century International, a New York-based think tank. For Israel, breaking Iran’s regional network has been a major goal, though it is wary over Islamic militants among the insurgents who toppled Assad. Israel on Sunday moved troops into a demilitarized buffer zone with Syria by the Israel-held Golan Heights in what it called a temporary security measure. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called Assad’s fall a 'historic day,' saying it was 'the direct result of our forceful action against Hezbollah and Iran, Assad’s main supporters.'	https://apnews.com/article/lebanon-syria-iran-hezbollah-assad-hts-israel-fadc4fa97f2036a24f821f51e4eb6634	2024-12-13T20:05:49-08:00	
The Detroit area's many Syrians are celebrating Assad's overthrow and planning long-delayed visits	DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) — Nizam Abazid is gleefully planning his first trip in decades to Syria, where he grew up. Rama Alhoussaini was only 6 years old when her family moved to the U.S., but she's excited about the prospect of introducing her three kids to relatives they've never met in person. They are among thousands of Detroit-area Syrian Americans who are celebrating the unexpected overthrow of the Syrian government, which crushed dissent and imprisoned political enemies with impunity during the more than 50-year reign of ousted President Bashar Assad and his father before him. 'As of Saturday night, the Assad regime is no longer in power,' Alhoussaini, 31, said through tears Tuesday at one of the Detroit-area school and day care facilities her family operates. 'And it’s such a surreal moment to even say that out loud, because I never thought that I would see this day.' It may be some time before either visits Syria. Though happy to see Assad go, many Western countries are waiting for the dust to settle before committing to a Syria strategy, including whether it’s safe for the millions who fled the country’s civil war to return. Ahmad al-Sharaa, who led the insurgency that toppled Assad after an astonishing advance that took less than two weeks, has disavowed his group's former ties to al-Qaida and cast himself as a champion of pluralism and tolerance. But the U.S. still labels him a terrorist and warns against any travel to Syria, where the U.S. hasn't had an embassy since 2012, the year after the war started. But for Syrians in the U.S. who have been unable to visit, the overthrow of the Assad government has given them hope that they can safely return, either for good or to visit. 'The end of the regime is the hope for all the Syrian people,' Abazid said this week, days after Assad and his family fled to Russia. Abazid said he could go to Syria whenever, since he holds dual U.S. and Syrian citizenship, but that he'll wait a few months for things there to settle down. Although European leaders have said it's not safe enough yet to allow war-displaced refugees to return to Syria, Abazid said he and his brother aren't concerned. 'When Assad’s forces were in power, my fate would’ve been in jail or beheaded,' Abazid said. 'But now, I will not be worried about that anymore.' Many Syrians who immigrated to the U.S. settled in the Detroit area. Michigan has the largest concentration of Arab Americans of any state and is home to the country's largest Arab-majority city, Dearborn. It also has more than 310,000 residents who are of Middle Eastern or North African descent. As rebel forces seized control of Syria, capping a lightning-quick advance that few thought possible even a month ago, Syrians in and around Detroit — like their counterparts all over the world — followed along in disbelief as reports poured in about one city after another slipping from Assad's grip. When news broke that Assad's government had fallen, celebrations erupted. Abazid, who owns a cellphone business in Dearborn, was born in Daraa, about 60 miles (95 kilometers) south of the Syrian capital, Damascus. He moved to the U.S. in 1984 at age 18, and although he's gone back a few times, he hasn't visited since 1998 because of what he described as 'harassment' by Syrian intelligence. That trip had to be heavily coordinated with U.S. authorities, as he said Syrian authorities took him into custody and detained him for more than six months during a 1990 visit. 'When I was kidnapped from the airport, my family didn’t even know ... what it was about,' he told The Associated Press on Tuesday. 'I still don’t know the reason. I have no idea why I was kidnapped.' Abazid, 59, said his parents have died since that 1998 trip, but his five sisters still live in Syria. Each of his four brothers left Syria during the 1970s and 1980s, including one who hasn't been back since emigrating 53 years ago, shortly after Bashar Assad's father, Hafez al-Assad, rose to power. Alhoussaini, who lives in West Bloomfield Township, said she was born in Damascus and moved to the Detroit area as a young girl, 'mainly because there was nothing left for us in Syria.' She said under the Assad family's rule, her grandfather's land was taken. Authorities detained him for almost a month. Her father was also detained before the family left. 'There never needed to be a reason,' Alhoussaini said. 'My dad was able to return one time, in 2010. And he has not been able to go back to his home country since, mainly because we spoke up against the Assad regime when the revolution started in 2011. And we attended many protests here. We were vocal on social media about it, did many interviews.' But with Bashar Assad gone and Syria in the hands of the rebels, 'We don’t have to be afraid anymore to visit our country,' she said. Her father, 61, is considering making a trip to Syria to see his siblings and visit his parents' graves. Alhoussaini said she and her husband, who is from the northern city of Aleppo, want to take their kids over to visit with family and friends. Alhoussaini’s three sisters, ages 40, 34 and 29, were also born in Syria. But none of them have been back. Now, there is hope and amazement that people in Syria can celebrate in the streets, she said. Alhoussaini said she thinks people who were born and raised in the U.S. won't be able to fully relate, because Americans enjoy a freedom of expression that people in Syria have never had. 'You can say what you want. You can go out into the street and protest whoever you want,' she said. 'You will not be detained for it. You will not be killed for it.'	https://apnews.com/article/detroit-syria-dearborn-assad-6c3777579a708024e703fca3458623e9	2024-12-13T20:05:04-08:00
