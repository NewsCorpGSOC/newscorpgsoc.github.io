AP PHOTOS: Powerful Hurricane Milton destroys homes, shreds stadium roofs apart	Many Florida residents were returning to their homes Thursday after Hurricane Milton pummelled the state, the second major hurricane in two weeks. Millions of people in several counties had been ordered to evacuate earlier this week as Milton approached. In Palmetto, southwest of Tampa, resident Natasha Ducre and her family of seven returned from a government shelter to find their home demolished and unlivable — furniture and other belongings destroyed by heavy rainwater. The roof in her kitchen had collapsed, with debris now carpeting the floor. Their home destroyed, siblings Saboria, 4, and Messiah Tyler, 3, had nowhere to sleep but the backseat of a car. Farther north in St. Petersburg, powerful winds and rain shredded the roof of the Tropicana Field Stadium, home to the Tampa Bay Rays of Major League Baseball, where several stadium workers were taking shelter. The team said it may take weeks to fully assess how much damage was done. Milton slammed into Florida as a Category 3 storm on Wednesday, killing at least 5 people, spawning tornadoes and leaving more than 3 million homes and businesses without power. The state’s central Gulf Coast was hardest hit by the outages, including Hardee, Sarasota, Hillsborough and Manatee counties. The storm came after Hurricane Helene ravaged several southeastern states as a Category 4 storm, killing more than 220 people. ___ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

TD Bank to pay $3 billion in historic money-laundering settlement with the Justice Department	WASHINGTON (AP) — TD Bank will pay approximately $3 billion in a historic settlement with U.S. authorities who said Thursday that the financial institution's lax practices allowed significant money laundering over multiple years. Canada-based TD Bank pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit money laundering, the largest bank in U.S. history to do so, Attorney General Merrick Garland said. 'TD Bank created an environment that allowed financial crime to flourish,' Garland said. 'By making its services convenient for criminals, it became one.' High-level executives were alerted to serious problems with the bank’s anti-money laundering program, but failed to correct them as employees openly joked about how easy it seemed to be for criminals to launder money there, Garland said. The bank is the 10th largest in the United States, and its CEO said the company takes full responsibility and has been cooperating with the investigation. It's been taking steps to fix its U.S. anti-money laundering program, including appointing new leadership and adding hundreds of new specialists, said TD Bank Group CEO Bharat Masrani. 'We know what the issues are, we are fixing them. As we move forward, we’re ensuring that this never happens again,' Masrani said. 'And I’m 100% confident that we get to the other side and emerge even stronger.' The Justice Department said the bank allowed at least three different money laundering networks to move a total of $670 million through TD Bank accounts over a period of several years. The institution became the bank of choice for multiple criminals and money laundering organizations, authorities said. 'From fentanyl and narcotics trafficking, to terrorist financing and human trafficking, TD Bank’s chronic failures provided fertile ground for a host of illicit activity to penetrate our financial system,' said Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Wally Adeyemo. In one case, a man moved more than $470 million in drug proceeds and other illicit funds through TD Bank branches, bribing employees with more than $57,000 in gift cards. He chose TD Bank because it had the 'most permissive policies,' more than once depositing more than $1 million in cash in a single day and then moving the funds out of the bank with checks or wire transfers, Garland said. It continued despite employees expressing concern about what he was doing. There were also piles of cash dumped on a bank’s counters and ATM withdrawals that totaled 40 times to 50 times higher than the daily limits, said Philip Sellinger, U.S. attorney in New Jersey. In a separate scheme, five employees worked with criminal organizations to open and maintain accounts that were used to launder $39 million to Colombia, including drug proceeds, Garland said. There were also multiple red flags in that case, including that the same Venezuelan passports were used to open multiple accounts, but the bank did not identify the problem until one of the employees was arrested. In a third scheme, a money laundering network had accounts for at least five shell companies that moved more than $100 million in illicit funds, but the bank did not file a required suspicious activity report until law enforcement alerted it. The bank's 'long-term, pervasive, and systemic deficiencies' in its policies over a period of nine years allowed such abuses to flourish, prosecutors said. Two dozen people have been prosecuted for involvement in money-laundering schemes, including two TD Bank employees, Garland said. The investigation is ongoing. The bank has also agreed to major restructuring of the corporate compliance program in its U.S. operations, as well as three years of monitoring and five years of probation. ____ Associated Press writer Alanna Durkin Richer contributed to this story.	https://apnews.com/article/td-bank-money-laundering-justice-department-75426a569d40174fd61fa7bc83026176	2024-10-10T08:59:01-07:00	
Donald Trump rolls out tax breaks, but no specifics, for overseas citizens and auto buyers	DETROIT (AP) — Donald Trump on Thursday rolled out more plans for tax breaks without offering details on how they would work or how they'd affect the federal budget. Trump vowed in a speech at the Detroit Economic Club to allow interest on car loans to be deducted from taxes, saying the proposal would 'stimulate massive domestic auto production' and make car ownership more affordable. In a video, also released Thursday, he proposes to grant a key tax break to U.S. citizens living overseas to end so-called double taxation. Trump has offered a series of tax breaks over the last several months to appeal to specific groups he's courting in the election: tipped and hourly workers, Social Security recipients, and now car buyers who have experienced sticker shock as well as Americans who live and vote abroad. In a tight race with Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump is betting that his targeted no-tax pledges will appeal to enough voters in key battlegrounds. But so far, the Republican nominee has been vague about how those tax breaks would work or how he would pay for them — other than promising that his plans to impose sweeping tariffs would bring in new government revenue. Economic analyses of his earlier tax cut ideas estimated they would cost between nearly $6 trillion and $10 trillion over 10 years, depending on which proposals become policy and how they’re implemented. And mainstream economists warn that Trump's tariff plans — and the expected retaliation from targeted countries — would raise prices for Americans, slash more than a percentage point off the U.S. economy by 2026 and make inflation 2 percentage points higher next year than it otherwise would have been. The proposal to make interest on car loans tax deductible is intended to help buyers struggling with the increase in car prices. Since inflation took off in early 2021, the average price of a new car has jumped nearly 18%, though that has fallen compared with a year ago. Used car prices are up 13%. At the same time, the Federal Reserve’s interest rate increases, intended to combat inflation, have pushed auto-loan rates much higher. The average rate on a five-year car loan reached 8.4% in this year’s third quarter, up from 4.5% two years ago, when the Fed’s rate hikes began. Marc Goldwein, senior vice president at the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said a rough estimate of the impact of Trump’s proposals for overseas citizens and auto buyers would be to reduce tax revenues by more than $100 billion over 10 years. If the car-loans proposal does operate like the deduction for mortgage interest, as Trump suggested, then only the one-fifth of taxpayers who itemize their deductions would be able to take advantage of it, Goldwein said. Trump's promise to help U.S. citizens living abroad concerns policies that can require Americans to pay taxes in the country where they reside and to the U.S. government. The U.S. has bilateral agreements with some nations that ease the burden in some cases. The proposal was first released by a group called Republicans Overseas. 'You have to make sure that you are registered and you are going to vote, because I'm going to take very good care of you,' Trump says in the video statement the overseas group's CEO, Solomon Yue, posted to his account on X. 'Once and for all, I'm going to end double taxation on our overseas citizens,' Trump said. 'You've been wanting this for years, and nobody has listened to you. And you deserve it. And I'm going to do it.' The overseas tax breaks could also end up favoring some wealthy citizens, because it could open more opportunities for them to live abroad in low-tax countries and avoid U.S. taxes. Yue praised Trump for his commitment. 'Republicans Overseas has been fighting for the rights of Americans abroad since its inception ten years ago,' Yue said in a statement. 'We have spoken to many politicians over the years, and while they sympathized with the burden of double taxation, very few have been willing to act.' The former president's embrace of U.S citizens living abroad comes after statements lumping those voters in with his unfounded accusations that Democrats plan to commit widespread fraud in the 2024 election. 'The Democrats are talking about how they’re working so hard to get millions of votes from Americans living overseas,' Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform Sept. 23. 'Actually, they are getting ready to CHEAT!' He argued that efforts to make it easier for overseas citizens to vote would 'dilute' the votes of military service members who Trump believes will favor him over Democratic nominee Kamala Harris. 'WATCH! Remember, IF YOU VOTE ILLEGALLY,' he threatened, 'YOU’RE GOING TO JAIL.' Paulina Salzeider, 47, who attended the speech on Thursday, works as a barber and supports Trump’s tax cuts and plan to exclude tips from federal taxes. 'In our business, I mean we depend on tips,' she said. 'In the service industry, the nicer you are, the kinder you are, the friendlier you are, you get rewarded by tips. So I feel that we deserve it.' But Curtis Lyons, a financial adviser from Detroit who is a Democrat and was also at the Thursday event, said he believes Trump’s tax cuts in his first administration did more harm than good and only benefited the wealthier. 'I’m not going to be voting for our guest,' he said. 'I’m just here to see and be entertained.' ___ Barrow reported from Atlanta and Gomez Licon reported from Fort Lauderdale, Fla.

The Latest: Harris visiting Nevada and Arizona while Trump speaks in Michigan	As Florida grapples with the effects of Hurricane Milton, presidential campaigning remains in full swing in battleground states across the U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris will attend a Univision town hall in Las Vegas on Thursday afternoon before going to an evening rally in Phoenix while remaining in close contact with the White House and monitoring federal disaster response efforts. Former President Donald Trump, meanwhile, will speak at the Economic Club of Detroit after holding rallies in Pennsylvania on Wednesday. Even amid the hurricane, however, both the Harris and Trump campaigns are using their travel strategically, trying to increase support with key voting blocs who could decide an election expected to be exceedingly close. Former President Barack Obama is also hitting the campaign trail on Thursday night, making his first appearance for Harris at a rally in Pittsburgh. That begins what the Harris campaign says will be a series of campaign stops Obama will make on the vice president’s behalf. Follow the AP’s Election 2024 coverage at: https://apnews.com/hub/election-2024. Here’s the latest: UAW chief calls Trump the ‘job-killer-in-chief’ The Harris campaign openly challenged Trump’s economic record ahead of the Republican nominee’s Thursday speech in Detroit, part of a broader effort to chip away at the former president’s credibility. On a call with reporters organized by the campaign, Shawn Fain, president of the United Auto Workers, called Trump the 'job-killer-in-chief.' Despite Trump’s promises to bring back factory jobs, Fain said, 'The reality is Trump never brought back squat.' Back in 2000, Michigan had nearly 900,000 factory jobs. That number nearly halved after the 2008 financial crisis, only to then slowly recover 633,900 jobs in 2018. But factory work in Michigan began to slump in 2019 and then plunged during the pandemic, all during Trump’s term. Labor Department data show that manufacturing work in the state still hasn’t fully recovered with there being 604,800 jobs in the sector as of August.	https://apnews.com/article/harris-trump-election-2024-campaign-rallies-f63c268e981712f7f88da6149a476fc7	2024-10-10T06:31:55-07:00	
UN-backed experts say Israel is destroying Gaza's health sector and both sides have tortured people	A U.N. commission on Thursday accused Israel of destroying Gaza's health care system through 'relentless and deliberate attacks' in its yearlong war with Hamas and said that Palestinian prisoners and Israeli hostages have been tortured and sexually abused. The expert panel was commissioned in 2021 by the U.N.-backed Human Rights Council to look into rights violations and abuses in Israel and the Palestinian areas it controls. Led by Navi Pillay, a former U.N. human rights chief, the panel members are independent experts and do not speak for the world body. There was no immediate comment from Israel, which has long accused the U.N. of being biased against it and has not cooperated with the commission. Israeli forces have raided hospitals in Gaza on several occasions, accusing militants of sheltering there. Palestinian medical officials have denied such allegations and accused Israel of recklessly endangering civilians. Hospitals can lose their protection under international law if they are used for military purposes. The report accused Israel of deliberately killing, detaining and torturing Palestinian medical staff, of targeting their vehicles and of restricting permits for medical evacuations from Gaza. It said those amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity. 'Israel must immediately stop its unprecedented wanton destruction of health care facilities in Gaza,' Pillay said in a statement. 'By targeting health care facilities, Israel is targeting the right to health itself with significant long-term detrimental effects on the civilian population.' The commission said children have borne much of the cost of such actions, pointing to attacks on medical facilities offering pediatric and neonatal care. The panel also said it found that thousands of adults and children detained in Gaza had been subjected to 'widespread and systematic abuse, physical and psychological violence, and sexual and gender-based violence.' It said Israeli security forces had raped male detainees, attacked their genitals and forced them to perform humiliating or strenuous acts while stripped naked. It said children who had been detained had returned to Gaza unaccompanied and deeply traumatized. The commission further said the abuse had been institutionalized by Israel's far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir. He has boasted of making conditions in the country's prisons as harsh as possible under Israeli law in what he says is an attempt to deter militant attacks. Israel detained nine soldiers in July over what their defense lawyer said were allegations of sexual abuse of a detainee being held at a shadowy facility where detainees from Gaza have been taken since the start of the war. The lawyer denied the allegations, and their arrest sparked protests by Israeli hard-liners. The commission also said that hostages held by Palestinian militants in Gaza were subjected to physical and sexual violence, forced isolation and threats, and given limited access to water, food and hygiene facilities. It said Palestinian armed groups were also guilty of war crimes and crimes against humanity, and called on them to immediately release all the hostages. Hamas-led militants stormed into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250 others. They are still holding around 100 captives, a third of whom are believed to be dead. Israel's offensive has killed over 42,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities, who do not say how many were fighters but say women and children make up more than half of the fatalities. The war has destroyed large areas of Gaza and displaced around 90% of its population of 2.3 million people. The International Court of Justice is investigating allegations that Israel has committed genocide in Gaza, and the International Criminal Court is considering arrest warrants against Israeli and Hamas leaders. Israel has adamantly denied the accusations and says it abides by international law. ___ Find more of AP’s coverage of the war at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-human-rights-un-c75b4db37aa5ade8466e0daa446ad596	2024-10-10T05:20:50-07:00	
Trump and Harris keep campaigning after Milton hits Florida	WASHINGTON (AP) — Vice President Kamala Harris visits Nevada and Arizona while former President Donald Trump talks economic issues in Michigan, as presidential campaigning continues even with Hurricane Milton hitting Florida. Trump was speaking at the Economic Club of Detroit after holding rallies in Pennsylvania on Wednesday. Harris is attending a Univision town hall in Las Vegas and an evening rally in Phoenix while remaining in close contact with the White House and monitoring federal disaster response efforts. President Joe Biden, who said Milton 'is looking like the storm of the century,' postponed a trip to Germany and Angola to cope with its aftermath. He and Harris were huddling with top officials in the Situation Room to discuss disaster response. Even amid the hurricane, however, both the Harris and Trump campaigns are using their travel strategically, trying to increase support with key voting blocs who could decide an election expected to be exceedingly close. Trump has emphasized picking up votes in heavily Hispanic parts of Pennsylvania, including Reading, where he held a rally Wednesday. Harris is out west as her campaign looks to increase support among Hispanic voters there, especially men. Her campaign began a group this week known as 'Hombres con Harris.' Harris' running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, attended an Hombres kickoff event with Arizona Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego, and actor Jaime Camil in Phoenix on Wednesday. Similar gatherings were held elsewhere in Arizona, as well as in Nevada and Pennsylvania. The group is planning to hold upcoming events at Latino-owned small businesses, union halls, barbecues and community events until Election Day. The Harris campaign has also aimed to reach Hispanic voters who may not be closely following the election by doing things like having Julie Chavez Rodriguez, Harris' campaign manager, attend the recent boxing match between Canelo Alvarez and Edgar Berlanga in Las Vegas, and holding events at churches and elsewhere to mark Mexican Independence Day in September. Harris' campaign also announced last month that it was spending $3 million on Spanish-language radio ads and focusing on sport events like baseball games and boxing matches. Meanwhile, former President Barack Obama is also hitting the campaign trail on Thursday night, making his first appearance for Harris at a rally in Pittsburgh. That begins what the Harris campaign says will be a series of campaign stops Obama will make on the vice president's behalf. Biden spent Monday campaigning in suburban Philadelphia, but has made just one joint appearance with Harris, joining her in Pittsburgh on Labor Day, since he announced he was leaving the race and endorsing her in July. Obama was among the key Democrats who were part of a behind-the-scenes effort to encourage Biden, his former vice president, to drop out. Obama and Harris have also been friends for two decades, since he ran for Senate in Illinois. She campaigned for him when he sought the presidency in 2008.	https://apnews.com/article/trump-harris-nevada-michigan-hispanic-voters-milton-2a9db630d1318e78de91efd2df5a16f0	2024-10-10T04:49:01-07:00	
Colombia’s river guardians battle to protect the Atrato amid threats and abandonment	PAIMADO, Colombia (AP) — Sediment and pebbles are all that’s left on the earth around much of Bernardino Mosquera’s small riverside community in northwest Colombia’s Choco region. Just a year ago, healthy shrubs and trees filled this important biodiversity spot teeming with species native to the land. But then illegal miners arrived, using their heavy machinery to dredge the riverbeds for gold. 'It’s just desert here,' said Mosquera. 'Illegal mining affects the ecosystem in every way … it leads to degraded land. There are no trees. The water sources are drying up, it’s polluted by mercury.' Mosquera is a river guardian, a title bestowed upon him and 13 others. The unpaid guardians serve as the eyes and ears of the Atrato River: They liaise with government institutions on environmental and social issues in the face of aggression from armed groups and hope to reverse the devastation they see along the river. But after eight years, they are increasingly disenchanted by the lack of support from institutions and growing threats from armed groups that control the region. Colombia’s constitutional court declared in 2016 that the Atrato River running alongside this 2,500-person town was so important to life, it would have rights equivalent to a human. The region is home to thousands of species, with 25% of its plant and bird species endemic, according to the United Nations Development Programme. The river's legal status was a first for Latin America, and when the guardians were established. 'It’s an unbreakable marriage between its inhabitants and the rivers,' Mosquera, 62, said. 'That’s why we have to defend the Atrato.' Illegal gold mining has become the fastest-growing criminal economy over the past decade in South America. The boom began in Colombia and Peru and expanded to Ecuador, Venezuela and Brazil. In Choco, illegal mining is rife Paimado, like many towns in the Choco region, is an illegal mining hub firmly in the control of the largest criminal organization in the country, known as Gulf Clan. Early each morning, small wooden boats carry plastic gasoline containers to feed the mining machinery dotted along the Atrato, a river that snakes some 750 kilometers (470 miles) through northern Colombian jungles. Dozens of illegal mines pepper the river between Mosquera’s home in Paimado, which lies on Rio Quito, the Atrato River's main tributary, and the state capital Quibdo. Large wooden rafts propped on stilts reach deep into the riverbed to extract material that is sifted through the machine for gold. Deep inside the banks of the river, another type of mining takes place with heavier machinery. It is here that deforestation is glaringly evident. Drone footage taken by The Associated Press shows large patches of empty land which stretch long behind the riverbanks. 'Many people think that because it looks very green there is no deforestation,' said river guardian and agronomist Maryuri Mosquera, 42. High rates of poverty have pushed many into gold mining, work that destroys land and contaminates their river. That destruction then destroys the local economy, making communities even more dependent on mining. Colombia’s human rights ombudsman’s office said in April the government is failing to protect the river, saying 'there is no evidence of any progress' since the river gained personhood. It called on the environment ministry to comply with the 2016 ruling. In a written response, Colombia’s environment ministry said its Minister Susana Muhamad has been coordinating efforts with the Ministry of Defense 'to protect this important ecosystem.' It added that a program will soon begin to work with the communities to restore the Atrato River basin and its tributaries. A community lifeline destroyed The Atrato River has long been an important source of water, food and transport for its rural, mostly Afro-Colombian residents who built communities on the riverbanks. The tiny village of El Arenal along the Atrato is home to river guardian Juan Carlos Palacios, 33, who says that his role is a triumph for the Black communities who fought for the 2016 ruling. 'It makes me feel very sad when I see machinery pass by continually, without any controls. They arrive on our land and we can’t even say anything, because the miners come along with armed actors,' Palacios said. For most of his life, even sometimes now, Palacios has been involved in artisanal gold mining. A short canoe ride to the other side of the river from El Arenal is his mother, bent over with a hoe and a wooden gold sifting pan. This has been her life since she can remember. 'I think that if I stop doing this, I’ll die quickly, because I’m so used to it,' said Ana Palacios Cuesta with a laugh. 'The dredgers have emptied the whole river, so we hardly get anything anymore.' The tiny amounts of gold sediment she collects are sold in the nearby town of Yuto, or in Quibdo, about 40 minutes away. Mercury and arsenic offer the industrial-scale miners a low-tech solution to extract the gold. But they get pumped into the water, poisoning the river and the surrounding lands. The tactic has been killing marine life, changing the natural flow of the river, and further debilitating some of the most vulnerable communities in the country. Palacios, who has a degree in biology, said fish in the river have been 'highly contaminated' by mercury, which gets passed through fish to humans and can cause damage to vital organs. 'Of course we continue to consume them because we have no other option,' he said. Local women and their children stand in the river to wash their dishes and clothes, something only the most rural and needy communities do nowadays over fear of the water’s contamination. Guardians face violence and threats The guardians have a precarious job in an area controlled largely by rebel and criminal armed groups, like leftist guerrillas the National Liberation Army and Gulf Clan. Mining machinery along the banks are overseen by these groups and miners are forced to pay them protection money — known locally as 'vacuna' — to be allowed to operate freely without becoming targets. 'The act of raising awareness and denouncing the situations that the Atrato basin is experiencing means we face certain risks,' guardian Maryuri Mosquera said, especially her guardian colleagues in more rural areas. Guardian Bernardino Mosquera has a bulletproof vest provided by the state after he got multiple death threats over the years, the last one in March. He has been kidnapped by Gulf Clan and had bullet shells placed under his door on several occasions 'as warnings.' He almost quit. 'But I realized that if we pull out of the process, we are giving them strength ... no one is going to want to say what is happening, you’ll end up riddled with bullets,' Mosquera said as the tropical rain lashed the tin roof of his home. 'We must continue to make the process visible. It’s the only way for them (armed groups) to feel that we too are in the territory. So that stopped me and made me carry on ... And here I am.' ___ Follow Steven Grattan on X: @sjgrattan __ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Palestinian officials say an Israeli strike on a Gaza shelter has killed at least 21 people	DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — An Israeli strike on a school sheltering displaced people in Gaza killed at least 21 people on Thursday, with the toll likely to rise, Palestinian medical officials said. Israel has continued to strike at what it says are militant targets across the Palestinian enclave even as attention has shifted to its war against Hezbollah in Lebanon and rising tensions with Iran. It launched a large-scale air and ground operation against Hamas in northern Gaza earlier this week. The Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital, where the bodies were brought, confirmed the toll from the strike in the central town of Deir al-Balah. It said several other people were wounded in the strike. An Associated Press reporter saw ambulances streaming into the hospital and counted the bodies, many of which arrived in pieces. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military. Witnesses said the strike targeted a makeshift post of the Hamas-run police inside the shelter. Israel has repeatedly attacked schools-turned-shelters in Gaza, accusing militants of hiding out there. Hamas has continued to launch attacks on Israeli forces and fire occasional rockets into Israel more than a year after its Oct. 7 attack ignited the war. Hamas-led militants stormed into Israel and rampaged through army bases and farming communities in that attack, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250 others. They are still holding around 100 captives, a third of whom are believed to be dead. Israel’s offensive has killed over 42,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities, who do not say how many were fighters but say women and children make up more than half of the fatalities. The war has destroyed large areas of Gaza and displaced around 90% of its population of 2.3 million people, often multiple times. ___ Find more of AP’s coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-lebanon-hezbollah-10-10-2024-a5e53cdd4fca30be1909506b5c777922	2024-10-10T00:10:39-07:00

He had been due to present his blueprint at a weekend meeting of Western leaders and defense ministers in Germany, but it has been postponed because U.S. President Joe Biden said he had to stay home to respond to Hurricane Milton’ s landfall in Florida. Zelenskyy said Wednesday he hoped the meeting could be rescheduled soon. The details of Zelenskyy’s plan have been kept quiet but contours have emerged, including the need for fast action on decisions Western allies have been mulling since the full-scale invasion began in 2022. Zelenskyy said Wednesday at a summit in Croatia with leaders of southeastern European states that the plan seeks to strengthen Ukraine 'both geopolitically and on the battlefield' before any kind of dialogue with Russia. 'Weakness of any of our allies will inspire (Russian President Vladimir) Putin,' he said. 'That’s why we’re asking them to strengthen us, in terms of security guarantees, in terms of weapons, in terms of our future after this war. In my view, he (Putin) only understands force.' Kyiv is still awaiting word from Western partners on its repeated requests to use the long-range weapons they provide to hit targets deep inside Russia. While some, including the U.K., are thought to be willing, Biden has held back out of concern it could escalate the conflict. Ukraine’s leader last visited London in July, soon after Starmer’s Labour Party government was elected, when he addressed a meeting of the British Cabinet. Starmer’s spokesman, Dave Pares, said Thursday’s meeting would involve 'broad strategic discussions' on U.K. and allied support for Ukraine during a 'crucial period,' rather than specific decisions.	https://apnews.com/article/ukraine-zelenskyy-europe-allies-c626fb13b60feacfbecf50280bed589b	2024-10-09T23:27:46-07:00	
The Nobel Prize in literature is being awarded in Stockholm	STOCKHOLM (AP) — After three days of Nobel prizes honoring work in the sciences, the literature award is being announced Thursday by the Nobel Committee at the Swedish Academy. The winner will follow Norwegian writer Jon Fosse, who was honored last year for writing in Nynorsk, one of the two official written versions of the Norwegian language, that prize organizers said gives 'voice to the unsayable.' The literature prize has long faced criticism that it is too focused on European and North American writers of style-heavy, story-light prose. It has also been male-dominated, with just 17 women among its 119 laureates. The last woman to win was Annie Ernaux of France, in 2022. Six days of Nobel announcements opened Monday with Americans Victor Ambros and Gary Ruvkun winning the medicine prize. Two founding fathers of machine learning — John Hopfield and Geoffrey Hinton — won the physics prize on Tuesday. On Wednesday, three scientists who discovered powerful techniques to decode and even design novel proteins were awarded the Nobel Prize in chemistry. The Nobel Peace Prize will be announced Friday and the economics award on Oct. 14. The prize carries a cash award of 11 million Swedish kronor ($1 million) from a bequest left by the award’s creator, Swedish inventor Alfred Nobel. The laureates are invited to receive their awards at ceremonies on Dec. 10, the anniversary of Nobel’s death. ___ Corder reported from The Hague, Netherlands.	https://apnews.com/article/nobel-literature-prize-e52fdabe9379d351d744e121218bddc5	2024-10-09T22:33:10-07:00	
Suspected militants shoot police in vehicle in northwest Pakistan, killing 2 officers	PESHAWAR, Pakistan (AP) — Suspected militants riding on a motorcycle opened fire on a vehicle carrying police officers Thursday in a former stronghold of the Pakistani Taliban, killing two of them and wounding two others, police said. The attack happened in Tank, a city in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province bordering Afghanistan, local police official Sher Afzal said. No group has claimed responsibility, but suspicion is likely to fall on the Pakistani Taliban, known as the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan or TTP, who often target security forces. The TTP are outlawed in Pakistan. They are separate from but a close ally of the Afghan Taliban who control neighboring Afghanistan. The latest violence came a day after at least three people were killed in clashes in the northwestern town of Jamrud between police and supporters of a banned right group Pashtun Protection Movement or PTM, which authorities say supports TTP. The government has also barred PTM from holding rallies in the northwest, allegedly because the demonstrations are against the interests of Pakistan. PTM denies backing the Pakistani Taliban, and tension was growing Thursday after the group vowed to resist the ban on their rallies.	https://apnews.com/article/pakistan-police-killed-northwest-0add0e973471aa6ba6c227bd28f56917	2024-10-09T20:59:34-07:00	
Suspected attacks by Yemen's Houthi rebels target ship in Red Sea	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — A series of suspected attacks by Yemen's Houthi rebels targeted a ship on Thursday in the Red Sea, authorities said. The attack comes as the rebels continue to threaten ships moving through the Red Sea, a waterway that once saw $1 trillion in goods move through it a year, over the ongoing conflicts in the Mideast stemming from the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip. A ship in the Red Sea skirting the coast of the East Africa found itself struck first by a projectile that damaged the vessel, but sparked no fire and caused no injuries, the British military's United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations center said. The private security firm Ambrey identified the ship as a Liberian-flagged chemical tanker. At least two more projectiles later fell in the waters around the vessel, which was a distance away from Hodeida, the Houthi-controlled port from which many of the rebels' attacks have been launched. The rebels did not immediately claim the attack. However, it can take them hours or even days to acknowledge their assaults. The Houthis have targeted more than 80 merchant vessels with missiles and drones since the war in Gaza started in October. They seized one vessel and sank two in the campaign that has also killed four sailors. Other missiles and drones have either been intercepted by a U.S.-led coalition in the Red Sea or failed to reach their targets, which have included Western military vessels as well. The rebels maintain that they target ships linked to Israel, the U.S. or the U.K. to force an end to Israel’s campaign against Hamas in Gaza. However, many of the ships attacked have little or no connection to the conflict, including some bound for Iran. In Thursday's attack, Ambrey said it 'assessed the vessel to have a strong affiliation with the Houthi targeting profile,' without elaborating.	https://apnews.com/article/red-sea-attacks-yemen-houthi-rebels-israel-hamas-war-961fbf91e97e071011ad3bea9077511a	2024-10-09T20:28:10-07:00	
AP PHOTOS: Human towers rise skyward in Spain's Catalonia as part of cultural pride	TARRAGONA, Spain (AP) — Dozens of people squeeze together, pressing as tight as they can get. The stronger the foundation they build, the less likely their human tower will collapse. As children and others climb, they create eight, nine, even 10 dizzying stories. They tug on sashes wound around torsos, gritting their teeth to keep their backs straight and their legs from buckling. With maximum concentration, they look into each other’s eyes, seeking further support. The tradition of building human towers, or 'castells' in Catalan, dates to the 18th century and forms an essential part of Catalonia’s culture. 'Colles,' or human tower troupes, compete to build the tallest and most complicated towers at festivals often held in village squares across the region in northeastern Spain. For many Catalans, the towers symbolize the pride they feel for their land, language and history. It means they are in it together and, if united, they are capable of amazing feats. As the tower goes up, the ages come down. Graying hair, receding hairlines and the burliest bodies are seen on the ground floor. The increasingly nimble are tasked with creating the final stages. Young men and women, then teenagers, then children ascend in a spidery climb, their arms interlocked, to the very top. The smallest boy or girl, as young as 5 years old, crowns the tower, reaching some 16 meters high (52 feet). Then, as collective strength wavers, the tower often sways. It undoes itself, with each level sliding down the backs of lower ones. Or the tower crashes on the heads and shoulders below. Injuries aren't common, and children wear helmets. Every two years, the most important competition for human towers is held in Tarragona, an old Roman city on the Mediterranean coast. The 'Concurs de Castells' started in 1932. It now invites the 42 best teams to compete. Newcomers and foreigners alike now take part in this practice that's included in UNESCO's list of Intangible Cultural Heritage. Tomoko Sakamoto is from Japan. She, her husband and their two children participate in a human tower troupe. 'It’s changed my life,' she said. 'I am part of Catalan culture and I am proud.' ___ Iain Sullivan in Madrid and Joseph Wilson in Barcelona contributed.	https://apnews.com/article/human-towers-castells-spain-catalonia-0146da4fd9edc44a681acb3944a81fb3	2024-10-09T20:07:00-07:00	
China seeks deeper economic ties with ASEAN at summit talks as South China Sea disputes lurk	VIENTIANE, Laos (AP) — Chinese Premier Li Qiang called for deeper market integration with Southeast Asia on Thursday during annual summit talks, where concerns over Beijing's aggression in the disputed South China Sea was raised. The 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations' meeting with Li followed recent violent confrontations at sea between China and ASEAN members Philippines and Vietnam, that sparked groiwng unease over China's increasingly assertive actions in the disputed waters. Li didn't mention the row in his opening speech at the summit talks but said intensifying trade relations and creating an 'ultra large-scale market' are keys to economic prosperity. 'The global economy is still seeing a sluggish recovery, protectionism is rising and geopolitical turbulence has brought instability and uncertainty to our development,' Li said. 'Strengthening market coordination and synchronization is an important direction for our further cooperation.' ASEAN and China said they expect to conclude negotiations to upgrade their free trade pact next year. Officials said the expanded pact will cover supply chain connectivity, the digital economy and green economy. Since the two sides signed the pact covering a market of 2 billion people in 2010, ASEAN’s trade with China has leaped from $235.5 billion to $696.7 billion last year. China is ASEAN's No. 1 trading partner and its third-largest source of foreign investment — a key reason why the bloc has been muted in its criticisms of Chinese actions in the South China Sea. ASEAN members Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia and Brunei along with Taiwan have overlapping claims with China, which claims sovereignty over virtually all of the South China Sea. Chinese and Philippine vessels have clashed repeatedly this year, and Vietnam said last week that Chinese forces assaulted its fishermen in the disputed sea. China has also sent patrol vessels to areas that Indonesia and Malaysia claim as exclusive economic zones. Philippines President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. made clear to Li during talks Thursday that ASEAN-China cooperation cannot be separated from the sea dispute, according to an ASEAN official who declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the discussion. The official said Marcos wants to prioritize negotiations on a code of conduct to govern behavior in the sea to ensure peace. Li responded by saying the South China Sea is 'a shared home' and that China has an obligation to protect its sovereignty, the official said. The Philippines, a longtime U.S. ally, has been critical of other ASEAN countries for not doing more to get China to back away. Talks on the code of conduct have been ongoing for years, hampered by sticky issues including disagreements over whether the pact should be binding. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who arrived in Vientiane on Thursday for the meetings, is expected to raise the issue of China’s aggression in the sea, officials said. The U.S. has no claims but it has deployed navy ships and fighter jets to patrol the waterway and promote freedom of navigation and overflight. China has warned the U.S. not to meddle in the disputes. ASEAN leaders, who held a summit among themselves on Wednesday, also separately met with new Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol before convening an ASEAN Plus Three summit along with China. ASEAN elevated its ties with South Korea to a 'comprehensive strategic partnership' at the summit to boost cooperation. Yoon said the partnership will help both sides 'create a new future together.' Ishiba separately pledged to boost Japan-ASEAN relationship by providing patrol vessels and training on maritime law enforcement, strengthening economic security through financial and other support and bolstering cybersecurity. 'Japan shares principles such as freedom, democracy and the rule of law, and would like to create and protect the future together with ASEAN,' he said. The bloc will also hold individual talks with dialogue partners Australia, Canada, India, the U.S. and the United Nations that will culminate in an East Asia Summit of 18 nations including Russia and New Zealand on Friday. Former ASEAN Secretary-General Ong Keng Yong said that despite challenges in addressing disputes in the South China Sea and the Myanmar civil war, ASEAN's central role in the region is undisputable. 'ASEAN and its diplomatic maneuvers have sustained the relative peace and progress of Southeast Asia to date. ASEAN will continue to be useful in that regard. Big powers cannot do what they wish in the region,' said Ong, who is now deputy chairman of the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore. Nearly 6,000 people have been killed and over 3 million displaced in a civil war after the Myanmar army ousted an elected government in 2021. The military has backtracked on an ASEAN peace plan it agreed to in late 2021 and fighting has continued with pro-democracy guerillas and ethnic rebels. Myanmar's top generals have been shut out of ASEAN summits since the military takeover. Thailand will host an informal ASEAN ministerial-level consultation on Myanmar in mid-December as frustration grows in the bloc over the prolonged conflict.	https://apnews.com/article/asean-laos-china-south-china-sea-myanmar-ad1f39ff6d0bc353f07598b06bf214b7	2024-10-09T19:56:59-07:00	
Cambodian fishermen turn to raising eels as Tonle Sap lake runs out of fish	KAMPONG PHLUK, Cambodia (AP) — Em Phat, 53, studies his eel tanks with the intensity of a man gambling with his livelihood. For millennia, fishermen like him have relied on the bounty of the Tonle Sap in Cambodia, Southeast Asia’s largest lake and the epicenter of the world’s most productive inland fishery. But climate change, dams upstream on the Mekong River that sustains the lake, and deforestation in the region have changed everything. There aren't enough fish and living by the lake has become dangerous as storms intensify due to global warming. 'Being a fisherman is hard,' he said. Phat hopes that raising eels — a delicacy in Asian markets like China, Japan and South Korea — will provide a way forward. He raises eels in different tanks: translucent eel eggs bob gently in Small glass aquariums. Voracious glassy larvae swim in plastic tanks. Larger tubs have bicycle tires to provide places for juvenile eels to hide. Raising eels can be profitable but it's risky. Eels are notoriously difficult and expensive to raise. They need constant pure, oxygenated water and special food and are susceptible to diseases. Phat lost many eels when a power cut stopped his oxygen pumps, killing the fish. But he's optimistic about the future. Living on land, instead of on the lake, also means that his wife, Luy Nga, 52, can grow vegetables to eat and sell, so they are making enough money to get by. 'The eels have value and can also be exported to China and other countries in the future,' he said. That fishermen like Phat can no longer rely on the Tonle Sap, literally the 'Great Lake,' for their livelihood reflects how much has changed. The lake used to more than quadruple in size to an area larger than the country of Qatar during the rainy season, inundating native forests and creating the perfect breeding ground for diverse fish to thrive. The 'flood pulse,' a natural process of periodic flooding and droughts in the river system helped make the Mekong Basin the world’s largest freshwater fishery, with nearly 20% of all freshwater fish worldwide caught there, according to the think tank Stimson Center in Washington. More than 3 million people live and fish by the lake: a third of all 17 million Cambodians rely on the fisheries sector and up to 70% of Cambodia’s intake of animal protein is from fish. But dams upstream in China and Laos are cutting the Mekong's flow, weakening that flood pulse. The lakes have been depleted by overfishing and much of the forest surrounding it has been logged or burned for farmland. Cambodian authorities are reluctant to estimate the extent that fish stocks have declined. This year, the flood pulse was delayed by about two months, according to the Mekong Dam Monitor, a research project. In this shattered ecosystem, raising eels or other fish can provide fishermen like Phat with a 'buffer,' said Zeb Hogan, a fish biologist at the University of Nevada who has worked in the region for decades. 'Aquaculture, such as eel farming, is a way for people to take more control over their income source and livelihood,' he said, adding that it also allows them to raise fish that they know will fetch higher prices. Phat is one of more than thousands helped by a program run by the Britain-based nonprofit VSO to boost incomes of people living by Tonle Sap. VSO provides his baby eels and has taught him how to raise them. Eels are in high demand in Cambodia and elsewhere, said Sum Vy, 38, a coordinator at VSO, so they're profitable. When fishermen know how to farm eels and hatch the babies, others can follow. 'Not only can he or she earn the money to support their family, they can share this knowledge and skill with other people,' he said. Expanding aquaculture is helping increase Cambodian exports. Its fish production increased 24-fold in the two decades leading up to 2021 and, unlike its neighbors, most of its fish catch is inland, according to the Food and Agricultural Organization or FAO. Much of it is consumed domestically and exports have grown sluggishly. Earlier this year, the government launched a scheme to improve fish processing technologies and address food safety concerns, hoping to begin exporting more fish to Europe next year. Cambodia has signed trade agreements with China and began shipping frozen eels to Shanghai last year. 'This export will contribute to economic growth, creating jobs for our farmers and fishermen,' Heng Mengty, the export manager of the Cambodian fish exporter told China's official Xinhua news agency. The promised growth can’t come soon enough for Cambodians living in fishing communities around the lake. Some families live in homes that float year round, others on homes built on stilts up to 8-meters-high (26 feet), to keep them above floodwaters during the rainy season. Fishing is the only form of subsistence for many, but signs of decay are evident. Fishing nets catch only very small fish, or worse, nothing at all. Families speak of giant fish that are now rarely seen. The catch is a fraction of what it used to be. Even 10 years ago, Som Lay, a 29-year-old fisherman said, the lake was teeming with fish. But illegal fishing has increased and some families have already given up fishing and are trying to find land where they can grow rice. 'The entire village — my family and others — is facing these difficulties,' he said. ___ Associated Press journalist Sopheng Cheang contributed to this report. ___ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Africans recruited to work in Russia say they were duped into building drones for use in Ukraine	The social media ads promised the young African women a free plane ticket, money and a faraway adventure in Europe. Just complete a computer game and a 100-word Russian vocabulary test. But instead of a work-study program in fields like hospitality and catering, some of them learned only after arriving on the steppes of Russia’s Tatarstan region that they would be toiling in a factory to make weapons of war, assembling thousands of Iranian-designed attack drones to be launched into Ukraine. In interviews with The Associated Press, some of the women complained of long hours under constant surveillance, of broken promises about wages and areas of study, and of working with caustic chemicals that left their skin pockmarked and itching. To fill an urgent labor shortage in wartime Russia, the Kremlin has been recruiting women aged 18-22 from places like Uganda, Rwanda, Kenya, South Sudan, Sierra Leone and Nigeria, as well as the South Asian country of Sri Lanka. The drive is expanding to elsewhere in Asia as well as Latin America. That has put some of Moscow’s key weapons production in the inexperienced hands of about 200 African women who are working alongside Russian vocational students as young as 16 in the plant in Tatarstan’s Alabuga Special Economic Zone, about 1,000 kilometers (600 miles) east of Moscow, according to an AP investigation of the industrial complex. 'I don’t really know how to make drones,' said one African woman who had abandoned a job at home and took the Russian offer. The AP analyzed satellite images of the complex and its internal documents, spoke to a half-dozen African women who ended up there, and tracked down hundreds of videos in the online recruiting program dubbed 'Alabuga Start' to piece together life at the plant. A hopeful journey from Africa leads to ‘a trap’ The woman who agreed to work in Russia excitedly documented her journey, taking selfies at the airport and shooting video of her airline meal and of the in-flight map, focusing on the word 'Europe' and pointing to it with her long, manicured nails. When she arrived in Alabuga, however, she soon learned what she would be doing and realized it was 'a trap.' 'The company is all about making drones. Nothing else,' said the woman, who assembled airframes. 'I regret and I curse the day I started making all those things.' One possible clue about what was in store for the applicants was their vocabulary test that included words like 'factory' and the verbs 'to hook' and 'to unhook.' The workers were under constant surveillance in their dorms and at work, the hours were long and the pay was less than she expected — details corroborated by three other women interviewed by AP, which is not identifying them by name or nationality out of concern for their safety. Factory management apparently tries to discourage the African women from leaving, and although some reportedly have left or found work elsewhere in Russia, AP was unable to verify that independently. A drone factory grows in Tatarstan Russia and Iran signed a $1.7 billion deal in 2022, after President Vladimir Putin invaded neighboring Ukraine, and Moscow began using Iranian imports of the unmanned aerial vehicles, or UAVs, in battle later that year. The Alabuga Special Economic Zone was set up in 2006 to attract businesses and investment to Tatarstan. It expanded rapidly after the invasion and parts switched to military production, adding or renovating new buildings, according to satellite images. Although some private companies still operate there, the plant is referred to as 'Alabuga' in leaked documents that detail contracts between Russia and Iran. The Shahed-136 drones were first shipped disassembled to Russia, but production has shifted to Alabuga and possibly another factory. Alabuga now is Russia's main plant for making the one-way, exploding drones, with plans to produce 6,000 of them a year by 2025, according to the leaked documents and the Washington-based Institute for Science and International Security. That target is now ahead of schedule, with Alabuga building 4,500, said David Albright, a former U.N. weapons inspector who works at the institute. Finding workers was a problem. With unemployment at record lows and many Russians already working in military industries, fighting in Ukraine or having fled abroad, plant officials turned to using vocational students and cheap foreign labor. Alabuga is the only Russian production facility that recruits women from Africa, Asia and South America to make weapons according to experts and the AP investigation. About 90% of the foreign women recruited via the Alabuga Start program work on making drones, particularly the parts 'that don’t require much skill,' he said. Documents leaked last year and verified by Albright and another drone expert detail the workforce growing from just under 900 people in 2023 to plans for over 2,600 in 2025. They show that foreign women largely assemble the drones, use chemicals and paint them. In the first half of this year, 182 women were recruited, largely from Central and East African countries, according to a Facebook page promoting the Alabuga Start program. It also recruits in South America and Asia 'to help ladies to start their career.' Officials held recruiting events in Uganda, and tried to recruit from its orphanages, according to messages on Alabuga's Telegram channel. Russian officials have also visited more than 26 embassies in Moscow to push the program. The campaign gave no reasons why it doesn't seek older women or men, but some analysts suggest officials could believe young women are easier to control. One of the leaked documents shows the assembly lines are segregated and uses a derogatory term referring to the African workers. The factory also draws workers from Alabuga Polytechnic, a nearby vocational boarding school for Russians age 16-18 and Central Asians age 18-22 that bills its graduates as experts in drone production. According to investigative outlets Protokol and Razvorot, some are as young as 15 and have complained of poor working conditions. Surveillance, caustic chemicals — and a Ukrainian attack The foreign workers travel by bus from their living quarters to the factory, passing multiple security checkpoints after a license plate scan, while other vehicles are stopped for more stringent checks, according to the woman who assembles drones. They share dormitories and kitchens that are 'guarded around the clock,' social media posts say. Entry is controlled via facial recognition, and recruits are watched on surveillance cameras. Pets, alcohol and drugs are not allowed. The foreigners receive local SIM cards for their phones upon arrival but are forbidden from bringing them into the factory, which is considered a sensitive military site. One woman said she could only talk to an AP reporter with her manager’s permission, another said her 'messages are monitored,' a third said workers are told not to talk to outsiders about their work, and a fourth said managers encouraged them to inform on co-workers. The airframe worker told AP the recruits are taught how to assemble the drones and coat them with a caustic substance with the consistency of yogurt. Many workers lack protective gear, she said, adding that the chemicals made her face feel like it was being pricked with tiny needles, and 'small holes' appeared on her cheeks, making them itch severely. 'My God, I could scratch myself! I could never get tired of scratching myself,' she said. 'A lot of girls are suffering,' she added. A video shared with AP showed another woman wearing an Alabuga uniform with her face similarly affected. Although AP could not determine what the chemicals were, drone expert Fabian Hinz of the International Institute for Strategic Studies confirmed that caustic substances are used in their manufacture. In addition to dangers from chemicals, the complex itself was hit by a Ukrainian drone in April, injuring at least 12 people. A video it posted on social media showed a Kenyan woman calling the attackers 'barbarians' who 'wanted to intimidate us.' 'They did not succeed,' she said. Workers ‘maltreated like donkeys’ Although one woman said she loved working at Alabuga because she was well-paid and enjoyed meeting new people and experiencing a different culture, most interviewed by AP disagreed about the size of the compensation and suggested that life there did not meet their expectations. The program initially promised recruits $700 a month, but later social media posts put it at 'over $500.' The airframe assembly worker said the cost of their accommodation, airfare, medical care and Russian-language classes were deducted from her salary, and she struggled to pay for basics like bus fare with the remainder. The African women are 'maltreated like donkeys, being slaved,' she said, indicating banking sanctions on Russia made it difficult to send money home. But another factory worker said she was able to send up to $150 a month to her family. Four of the women described long shifts of up to 12 hours, with haphazard days off. Still, two of these who said they worked in the kitchen added they were willing to tolerate the pay if they could support their families. The wages apparently are affecting morale, according to plant documents, with managers urging that the foreign workers be replaced with Russian-speaking staff because 'candidates are refusing the low salary.' Russian and Central Asian students at Alabuga Polytechnic are allowed visits home, social media posts suggest. Independent Russian media reported that these vocational students who want to quit the program have been told they must repay tuition costs. AP contacted the Russian Foreign Ministry and the offices of Tatarstan Gov. Rustam Minnikhanov and Alabuga Special Economic Zone Director General Timur Shagivaleev for a response to the women's complaints but received no reply. Human rights organizations contacted by AP said they were unaware of what was happening at the factory, although it sounded consistent with other actions by Russia. Human Rights Watch said Russia is actively recruiting foreigners from Africa and India to support its war in Ukraine by promising lucrative jobs without fully explaining the nature of the work. Russia’s actions 'could potentially fulfill the criteria of trafficking if the recruitment is fraudulent and the purpose is exploitation,' said Ravina Shamdasani, a spokesperson for the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, noting that Moscow is a party to the U.N. Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime. The AP contacted governments of 22 countries whose citizens Alabuga said it had recruited for the program. Most didn’t answer or said they would look into it. Betty Amongi, Uganda’s Minister for Gender, Labour and Social Development, told AP that her ministry raised concerns with its embassy in Moscow about the Alabuga recruiting effort, particularly over the age of the women, because 'female migrant workers are the most vulnerable category.' The ministry said it wanted to ensure the women 'do not end up in exploitative employment,' and needed to know who would be responsible for the welfare of the Ugandan women while in Russia. Alabuga's Facebook page said 46 Ugandan women were at the complex, although Amongi had said there were none. How accurate are the drones? Bolstered by the foreign recruits, Russia has vastly increased the number of drones it can fire at Ukraine. Nearly 4,000 were launched at Ukraine from the start of the war in February 2022 through 2023, Albright’s organization said. In the first seven months of this year, Russia launched nearly twice that. Although the Alabuga plant's production target is ahead of schedule, there are questions about the quality of the drones and whether manufacturing problems due to the unskilled labor force are causing malfunctions. Some experts also point to Russia’s switching to other materials from the original Iranian design as a sign of problems. An AP analysis of about 2,000 Shahed attacks documented by Ukraine’s military since July 29 shows that about 95% of the drones hit no discernible target. Instead, they fall into Ukraine's rivers and fields, stray into NATO-member Latvia and come down in Russia or ally Belarus. Before July, about 14% of Shaheds hit their targets in Ukraine, according to data analyzed by Albright’s team. The large failure rate could be due to Ukraine's improved air defenses, although Albright said it also could be because of the low-skilled workforce in which 'poor craftsmanship is seeping in,' he said. Another factor could be because Russia is using a Shahed variant that doesn't carry a warhead of 50 kilograms (110 pounds) of explosives. Moscow could be launching these dummy drones to overwhelm air defenses and force Ukraine to waste ammunition, allowing other UAVs to hit targets. Tourism, paintball games and a pitch on TikTok The Alabuga Start recruiting drive relies on a robust social media campaign of slickly edited videos with upbeat music that show African women visiting Tatarstan's cultural sites or playing sports. The videos show them working — smiling while cleaning floors, wearing hard hats while directing cranes, and donning protective equipment to apply paint or chemicals. One video depicts the Polytechnic school students in team-building exercises such as paintball matches, even showing the losing side — labeled as 'fascists' — digging trenches or being shot with the recreational weapons at close range. 'We are taught patriotism. This unites us. We are ready to repel any provocation,' one student says. The videos on Alabuga's social media pages don't mention the plant's role at the heart of Russian drone production, but the Special Economic Zone is more open with Russian media. Konstantin Spiridonov, deputy director of a company that made drones for civilian use before the war, gave a video tour of an Alabuga assembly line in March to a Russian blogger. Pointing out young African women, he did not explicitly link the drones to the war but noted their production is now 'very relevant' for Russia. Alabuga Start's social media pages are filled with comments from Africans begging for work and saying they applied but have yet to receive an answer. The program was promoted by education ministries in Uganda and Ethiopia, as well as in African media that portrays it as a way to make money and learn new skills. Initially advertised as a work-study program, Alabuga Start in recent months is more direct about what it offers foreigners, insisting on newer posts that 'is NOT an educational programme,' although one of them still shows young women in plaid school uniforms. When Sierra Leone Ambassador Mohamed Yongawo visited in May and met with five participants from his country, he appeared to believe it was a study program. 'It would be great if we had 30 students from Sierra Leone studying at Alabuga,' he said afterward. Last month, the Alabuga Start social media site said it was 'excited to announce that our audience has grown significantly!' That could be due to its hiring of influencers, including Bassie, a South African with almost 800,000 TikTok and Instagram followers. She did not respond to an AP request for comment. The program, she said, was an easy way to make money, encouraging followers to share her post with job-seeking friends so they could contact Alabuga. 'Where they lack in labor,' she said, 'that’s where you come in.' ___ Associated Press writers Michael Biesecker in Washington and Jamey Keaten in Geneva contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-drones-shahed-africans-11602ab837f0ff4635926d884b422185	2024-10-09T19:04:51-07:00	
Taiwan celebrates its National Day holiday against background of Chinese threats	TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) — Taiwan celebrated its National Day holiday Thursday against the background of threats from China, which claims the self-governing island republic as its own territory. The celebration marks the establishment of the Republic of China, which overthrew the Qing Dynasty in 1911 and fled to Taiwan as Mao Zedong’s Communists swept to power on the mainland during a civil war in 1949. Taiwan was run under martial law until transitioning to full democracy in the 1980s and 1990s but maintains the original constitution brought from China and the ROC flag. President Lai Ching-te took office in May, continuing the eight-year rule of the Democratic Progressive Party that rejects China’s demand that it recognize Taiwan is a part of China. The Nationalists adhere to a unification stance that recognizes both sides of the Taiwan Strait as a single nation. Thursday's commemorations were to include speeches by Lai and others, performances in front of the Presidential Office Building in Taipei, including an honor guard, military marching band and overflight by military aircraft, but no display of heavy military equipment as seen in years past. Maintaining its military pressure on Taiwan, China's People's Liberation Army sent 15 planes across the median line in the Taiwan Strait, prompting Taiwan to scramble jets, dispatch ships and activate missile systems.	https://apnews.com/article/taiwan-national-day-c40f5a7f16e9cb1c12f936d489de283a	2024-10-09T17:38:52-07:00	
Stock market today: Asian shares rise after Wall Street rally, and China promises a briefing	TOKYO (AP) — Asian shares mostly rose Thursday, as market optimism got a perk from the record highs set on Wall Street. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 edged up 0.4% in morning trading to 39,439.50. Australia's S&amp;P/ASX 200 rose 0.6% to 8,239.10. South Korea's Kospi added 0.3% to 2,601.66. Hong Kong's Hang Seng jumped 2.4% to 21,127.55, after a previous day of wild swings. Earlier in the week, the index dropped more than 9%, recording its worst loss since the global financial crisis of 2008. The Shanghai Composite surged 2.0% to 3,324.61. After surging on hopes for stimulus to prop up the world’s second-largest economy, Chinese stocks slumped earlier this week on disappointment that more isn’t on the way. One plus was the announcement from China’s Finance Ministry it will hold a briefing Saturday that could provide details on planned government moves. 'There’s still a glimmer of hope that Beijing might swoop in with a fiscal stimulus lifeline in October to reignite growth. In short, the market is hanging in the balance, waiting for the next big move,' said Stephen Innes, managing partner at SPI Asset Management. On Wall Street, the S&amp;P 500 rose 0.7% to top the all-time high it had set last week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 431 points, or 1%, to hit its own record, while the Nasdaq composite gained 0.6%. Leading the way were cruise-ship companies, whose customers stand to benefit from the surprisingly strong U.S. job market. Norwegian Cruise Line steamed 10.9% higher after analysts at Citi upgraded its stock and said data suggests growth for the cruise industry 'has real legs' into 2025 and beyond. Carnival rose 7%, and Royal Caribbean Group gained 5.3%. KinderCare Learning rose 8.9% in its debut on the New York Stock Exchange. It has over 2,400 early childhood education centers and before- and after-school sites across the country for kids aged between six weeks and 12 years. They helped offset a 3.4% slump for Boeing. The aerospace giant withdrew a contract offer that would have given striking workers 30% raises over four years following a break down in labor talks. Alphabet also kept the market’s gains in check after the heavyweight stock sank 1.5%. The U.S. Department of Justice is considering asking a federal judge to break up its Google business after its search engine was declared an illegal monopoly. A breakup is one of many possible remedies under review. All told, the S&amp;P 500 rose 40.91 points to 5,792.04. The Dow jumped 431.63 to 42,512.00, and the Nasdaq composite gained 108.70 to 18,291.62. In the oil market, a barrel of Brent crude, the international standard, recovered to rise 34 cents to $73.58 a barrel. It briefly topped $81 early this week. Benchmark U.S. crude gained 34 cents to $76.92 per barrel. Earlier leaps for oil driven by worries about worsening tensions in the Middle East had helped drag the S&amp;P 500 on Monday to its worst loss in a month. In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.07% from 4.01% late Tuesday. Treasury yields have swung recently, first sharply downward through the spring and summer and then turning upward in the last week or so. They’ve followed traders’ expectations for what the Federal Reserve is likely to do with overnight interest rates. The central bank has just begun cutting interest rates from a two-decade high, as it widens its focus to include keeping the economy humming instead of just fighting high inflation. That caused the sharp easing of rates through the summer, but recent reports have shown the U.S. economy remains stronger than expected. In currency trading, the U.S. dollar inched down to 149.15 Japanese yen from 149.16 yen. The euro cost $1.0943, up from $1.0945. ___ AP Business Writer Stan Choe contributed.	https://apnews.com/article/stock-market-china-rates-fed-inflation-eed540f0a4a8ca2016f9163fd4b34855	2024-10-09T17:10:06-07:00	
Turkey's navy starts to evacuate its citizens from Beirut as Israel battles Hezbollah	BEIRUT (AP) — Over 2,000 Turkish citizens and some foreign nationals started boarding a Turkish military ship late Wednesday that brought in aid and will take them out of a country being hit by Israeli airstrikes targeting Hezbollah. Zehra Cibbin, an ethnic Arab from the southeastern Turkish city of Mardin who lives in Beirut with her Lebanese husband, got off a bus packed with the other evacuees, her two children in tow and luggage in hand. 'It’s indescribable. They bombed the street below our house. From that moment on, it was over for me, I said I didn’t want to stay in Beirut anymore,' said Cibbin, 46. Cibbin said they decided to leave Beirut out of fear for their lives, putting no thought into what will happen when they arrive in Turkey. She spoke to The Associated Press before getting in line to board the TCG Bayraktar amphibious landing vessel, which along with the TCG Sancaktar will take on evacuees. They are part of a six-ship convoy including escorts that set sail from the southern Turkish port of Mersin early Wednesday, transported 300 tons of humanitarian supplies, including food, hygiene kits, kitchenware, tents, beds and blankets. Besides the Turkish citizens, people from Bulgaria, Romania and Kazakhstan were among those who applied to evacuate on the ships. Officials did not provide numbers. The Associated Press was the only non-government media invited aboard the ships to cover the evacuation operation. 'Israel’s aggression has severely impacted Lebanon and our brothers here,' said Turkish Ambassador to Lebanon Ali Baris Ulusoy, standing in front of the Bayraktar. 'We are carrying out an operation today with two aims: to provide humanitarian aid to our Lebanese brothers and to ensure the safe return of our citizens who are in a difficult situation.' Ulusoy said. Hundreds lined up before the Bayraktar as Turkish soldiers and sailors checked the evacuees’ passports and their luggage was examined by metal detectors and drug-sniffing dogs before they were allowed to board Another Turkish citizen waiting with her family was Abir Gokcimen, who said she left her extended family and husband in Beirut and hopes the war that spread to Lebanon will end soon. She hopes to come back to Lebanon as soon as the danger passes. The journey back to Mersin is expected to take about 10 hours. Turkey's government plans to organize more sea evacuations if necessary and is contemplating charter flights to repatriate citizens. Hezbollah began firing rockets into northern Israel on Oct. 8, 2023, the day after Hamas’ surprise attack into Israel ignited the war in Gaza. Hezbollah and Hamas are both allied with Iran, and Hezbollah says its attacks are aimed at aiding the Palestinians. Israel has carried out airstrikes in response and the conflict steadily escalated, erupting into a full-fledged war last month. Israel has inflicted a punishing wave of blows against Hezbollah in recent weeks and says it will keep fighting until tens of thousands of displaced Israeli citizens can return to their homes in the north. More than 1,300 people have been killed in Lebanon and over a million displaced since the fighting escalated in mid-September. Earlier on Wednesday, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan ramped up his rhetoric against Israel during his party’s first meeting of the new legislative year, declaring that Turkey 'has more than enough power to thwart expansionist ambitions' of Israel and doubling down on his claims that Israel would target Turkey after Gaza and Lebanon. ___ AP journalist Suzan Fraser contributed from Ankara. ___ Follow AP's coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/mideast-wars	https://apnews.com/article/mideast-wars-turkey-lebanon-israel-evacuations-cea598e62da5a649095d98e13f84a34a	2024-10-09T16:08:19-07:00	
Climate solution: Form Energy secures $405M to speed development of long-awaited 100-hour battery	Form Energy, a company that is beginning to produce a longer-lasting alternative to lithium batteries, hit a milestone Wednesday with an announcement of $405 million in funding. The money will allow Form to speed up manufacturing at its first factory in Weirton, West Virginia and continue research and development. Manufacturing long-duration energy storage at a commercial scale is seen as essential for lowering carbon emissions that are causing climate change, because it makes clean energy available when the sun isn’t shining or the wind isn’t blowing. 'I’m incredibly proud of how far our team has come in scaling our iron-air battery technology,' Mateo Jaramillo, CEO of Form Energy, said via email. Investment company T. Rowe Price led the funding. GE Vernova, a spin-off of General Electric’s energy businesses, and several venture capital firms were also involved. 'With this new funding ... we’re ready to accelerate multi-day battery deployments to meet the rising demand for a cleaner, and more reliable grid. I’m grateful for our team’s hard work and the trust our partners have placed in us as we push toward our mission of building energy storage for a better world.' Lithium batteries typically last four hours. Form is one of many companies pursuing entirely different chemistries. Its batteries use iron, water and air and are able to store energy for 100 hours, meaning if they work at scale, they could bridge a period of several days without sunlight or wind. Iron is also one of the most abundant elements on Earth, which the company says helps make this technology affordable and scalable. In collaboration with Great River Energy, the company broke ground on its first commercial battery installation in Cambridge, Minnesota in August. It's expected to come online in 2025 and will store extra energy that can be used during times of higher electricity demand. Other Form Energy batteries in Minnesota, Colorado and California are expected to come online next year. There are projects in New York, Georgia and Virginia set for 2026. To date, Form Energy has raised more than $1.2 billion from investors. _____ The last line of this story has been corrected to reflect that the $1.2 billion raised so far is only from investors, not from any government entities. ____ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Ratan Tata, the former chairman of Indian conglomerate Tata Sons, dies at age 86	NEW DELHI (AP) — Ratan Tata, a former chairman of Indian conglomerate Tata Sons, died at a Mumbai hospital on Wednesday night. He was 86. Tata Sons chairman N Chandrasekaran confirmed Tata’s death and described him in a statement as his 'friend, mentor, and guide.' He did not provide a cause of death. Tata was admitted this week to the Breach Candy Hospital in south Mumbai, the city where he lived. Soon after he was hospitalized, Tata issued a statement on Monday saying there was no cause for concern regarding his health and he was undergoing checkups for age-related medical conditions. Prime Minister Narendra Modi described Tata as a visionary leader, and a compassionate and an extraordinary human being. 'He provided stable leadership to one of India’s oldest and most prestigious business houses. At the same time, his contribution went far beyond boardrooms,' Modi said on X. 'Tata endeared himself to several people, thanks to his humility, kindness and an unwavering commitment to making our society better,' Modi said in his tributes, referring to his philanthropy work. Industrialist Harsh Goenka called him a 'titan.' Google CEO Sundar Pichai, said Ratan Tata left behind an extraordinary business and philanthropic legacy and he was instrumental in mentoring and developing modern business leadership in India. 'My last meeting with Ratan Tata at Google, we talked about the progress of Waymo and his vision was inspiring to hear,' Pichai said on X. 'He deeply cared about making India better,' he said. Mukesh Ambani, chairman and managing director of Reliance Industries, said, 'It is a very sad day for India and India Inc. Ratan Tata’s passing away is a big loss, not just to the Tata Group, but to every Indian.' 'With him gone, all we can do is to commit to emulating his example,' Anand Mahindra, chairman of the Mahindra Group, said on X. Tata received the Padma Bhushan, one of India’s most distinguished civilian awards, in 2000 and ``Padma Vibhushan' in 2008, Tata Group is a sprawling collection of nearly 100 companies, including the country’s largest automaker, the largest private steel company and a leading outsourcing firm. The companies employ more than 350,000 people worldwide. In June 2008, Tata bought Jaguar and Land Rover from Ford for $2.3 billion. Tata pioneered commercial aviation in India when it launched an airline in 1932 that later became Air India. The government later took it over. Tata Group bought state-owned Air India in 2021. It also started a full-service carrier, Vistara, with Singapore Airlines, but recently merged it with Air India. Tata companies include Tata Steel, Tata Motors, Tata Power and the information technology company Tata Consultancy Services. In 2009, the company surprised the automobile industry by launching Tata Nano, a tiny vehicle with a rear engine costing about 100,000 rupees (then $2,000). Publicized as a 'People’s Car,' it could seat up to five adults. Ratan Tata had said it would provide a 'safe, affordable, all-weather form of transport' to millions of middle- and lower-income Indian consumers. However, due to the low sales of the tiny car, the company stopped its production in 2018. Ratan Tata graduated from Cornell University with a bachelor’s degree in architecture. He joined the Tata group in 1961 and succeeded J.R.D. Tata as chairman of Tata Sons upon the latter’s retirement in 1991. In December 2012, Tata retired as chairman of the Tata Sons. He briefly served as interim chairman beginning Oct. 2016, following the ouster of his successor, Cyrus Mistry. He returned to retirement in 2017 when Natarajan Chandrasekaran was appointed chairman of the Tata Group.	https://apnews.com/article/india-ratan-tata-death-06f48744f603ae3797e4f5df395fdd6d	2024-10-09T10:06:11-07:00

Saudi Arabia loses bid for a seat on UN's premier human rights body	UNITED NATIONS (AP) — Saudi Arabia was defeated for a seat in the U.N.’s premier human rights body Wednesday after a campaign by rights groups urging the world body's members to reject its bid. The 193-member General Assembly elected 18 new members to serve on the 47-nation Human Rights Council, which allocates seats to regional groups to ensure geographical representation. The Geneva-based council reviews the human rights records of all countries periodically, appoints independent investigators to examine and report on issues like torture and situations in countries like North Korea, Iran and Myanmar, and sends fact-finding missions to investigate rights violations, including in Ukraine. It was created in 2006 to replace a human rights commission discredited because of some members’ poor rights records. But the new council soon came to face similar criticism, including that countries sought seats to protect themselves and their allies. This year, the Asia-Pacific group had the only contested slate in the election, with six candidates for five seats. Thailand received 177 votes, Cyprus and Qatar 167 votes, South Korea 161 votes, Marshall Islands 124 votes and Saudi Arabia 117 votes. Before the vote, Louis Charbonneau, U.N. director at Human Rights Watch, called Saudi Arabia 'unfit to serve on the Human Rights Council.' He pointed to the rights group’s documentation of Saudi border guards opening fire and likely killing hundreds of Ethiopian migrants and asylum seekers trying to cross the Yemen-Saudi border in 2022 and 2023, and the lack of accountability for the 2018 killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. 'Governments that commit crimes against humanity or similar atrocities and ensure impunity for those responsible shouldn’t be rewarded with seats on the U.N.’s top human rights body,' Charbonneau said. Saudi Arabia’s U.N. Mission didn't immediately respond to calls and an email seeking comment. A letter sent last year by Saudi Arabia’s mission to the U.N. in Geneva said that it 'categorically refutes' allegations that the kingdom carries out any 'systematic' killings on the border. Human Rights Watch and other groups also criticized other candidates. United Nations Watch in Switzerland, Human Rights Foundation in the United States and the Raoul Wallenberg Center for Human Rights in Canada called for the General Assembly to oppose Qatar, Bolivia, Congo and Ethiopia, declaring them 'unqualified' because of poor rights records. But all the candidates from other regions where there were no contested slates were elected. The 18 countries will serve three-year terms starting on Jan. 1, 2025. The Africa group’s Benin, Congo, Ethiopia, Gambia and Kenya won seats. So did the Latin America and Caribbean group’s candidates Bolivia, Colombia and Mexico and the Central and Eastern Europe group’s candidates, the Czech Republic and North Macedonia. The three candidates for the so-called Western and others group known as WEOG also won easy election — Iceland, Spain and Switzerland — after the United States announced in late September that it wouldn’t seek a second consecutive term. U.S. State Department spokesman Matthew Miller told reporters then that the Biden administration was engaged with its allies 'about the best way to move forward' and said Iceland, Spain and Switzerland would be able to represent American interests and values.	https://apnews.com/article/united-nations-saudi-arabia-human-rights-council-2276e8bce8a1c5de838d250aa968bd64	2024-10-09T08:09:37-07:00	
UN tribunal orders ex-official to repay $58.8 million lost in bad deals while getting perks	UNITED NATIONS (AP) — A U.N. tribunal has ordered a former high-ranking official to repay the United Nations $58.8 million lost in deals he made with a British businessman who showered him with interest-free loans, a Mercedes for his wife and perks for his sons. The three-judge United Nations Dispute Tribunal ruled that evidence 'clearly and convincingly' shows that Vitaly Vanshelboim’s misconduct 'caused massive financial losses' by the U.N. Office for Project Services, which says it provides infrastructure, procurement and project management services and is known as UNOPS. The Geneva-based tribunal said last week that Vanshelboim facilitated multiple financial deals between the U.N. office and British businessman David Kendrick focusing on renewable energy, sustainable housing and the oceans. At the same time, the tribunal said Vanshelboim entered into a series of private arrangements with Kendrick and his businesses stretching back to 2017 — which he never disclosed to the U.N. as required — and 'obtained direct financial and material benefits for himself and his family in the amount of at least $3,133,186.10.' Secretary-General Antonio Guterres 'is pleased by this judgment,' U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said Tuesday. 'The U.N. continues to pursue recovery of the funds through other avenues,' he said. 'We are fully committed to ensuring criminal accountability for crimes that may involve U.N. personnel,' he said, adding it would cooperate with national authorities on any investigations. Dujarric did not elaborate. Vanshelboim's lawyer, George Irving, said in an email Wednesday that his client is appealing the decision, and declined to comment. Emails sent to three companies that the tribunal says are connected to Kendrick were not immediately returned, and his previous lawyers in London said he was no longer a client. Other contact information for Kendrick could not be found. The New York Times first reported the ruling. Vanshelboim, a Ukrainian, had been an assistant secretary-general, serving either as UNOPS deputy executive director or director of its sustainable infrastructure impact investments program. He was fired in January 2023 following an internal investigation. The investments by UNOPS, which lost millions of dollars, became public in 2022 with media reports followed by the resignation of Grete Faremo, a former Norwegian minister of justice and public security, as the head of Copenhagen-based UNOPS. The Dispute Tribunal was ruling on Vanshelboim’s appeal of the fine on his dismissal of 12 months' salary and an order for him to pay the U.N. over $63.6 million in losses incurred from the deals, with his U.N. pension withheld until the sum was paid. The judges ruled that Vanshelboim’s failure to disclose any of his financial dealings with Kendrick constituted 'blatant misconduct' and said he 'committed fraud against the organization by leading it into multiple business partnerships with the Kendrick entities, with which he engaged in undisclosed and unauthorized outside activities.' The judgment said Vanshelboim was tasked with identifying potential partners and that UNOPS allocated money 'with the specific intention to develop projects that would attract private investors.' The judges said Vanshelboim did not disclose that his wife was being paid by Kendrick for services, including helping the businessman locate, purchase and renovate an apartment in Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv. Vanshelboim did not disclose that in July 2017 he entered into a tennis sponsorship agreement with Kendrick for his youngest son. The U.N. said the amount was $1.2 million, which Vanshelboim called 'grossly exaggerated.' Nonetheless, the judges said when Vanshelboim's son was told what Kendrick was going to pay him, he wrote: 'this is insane, how is this possible. I’m not even a good tennis player yet.' In reply, his father wrote part 'of my job is to make insane things happen.' The judgment also revealed that Kendrick granted Vanshelboim 'an interest-free revolving loan facility' for five years, with a limit of $500,000 per year and a total cap of $2 million. It said Vanshelboim used Kendrick’s credit cards for his personal expenses between October 2018 and December 2020. In addition, Kendrick paid for repairs to Vanshelboim's property in Mamaroneck, New York, and for custom furniture and home accessories — half for his apartment in Kyiv and half for his son’s apartment, the judgment said. Vanshelboim also purchased a Mercedes Benz luxury vehicle for his wife with funds from Kendrick and his entities, it said. The tribunal said Vanshelboim 'misled the organization by both omitting his blatant conflict of interest with Mr. Kendrick and 'pushing’ UNOPS to enter into highly risky deals with the Kendrick entities, while minimizing concerns and concealing relevant information.' It said he can be held responsible for $58.8 million, the amount that UNOPS lost, minus nearly $4.83 million in interest and fees that it said were less clear. 'However, he may seek contribution elsewhere from any others deemed responsible as well,' the tribunal said.	https://apnews.com/article/un-official-misconduct-tribunal-ruling-1607271b8999dee627c96d62f095d8e4	2024-10-09T07:13:05-07:00	
The Latest: Hurricane Milton threatens to overshadow presidential campaigning	Hurricane Milton is threatening to overshadow presidential campaigning as it menaces Florida. The storm has already scrambled Donald Trump's schedule. He put off a virtual event Tuesday night focused on health care and postpone a Univision town hall in Miami. He was in Pennsylvania on Wednesday. President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris denounced the misinformation and disinformation surrounding the federal response to Hurricane Helene, which hit last week and killed more than 220 people. Both singled out Trump as driving much of the falsehoods. Harris plans to head to Nevada and Arizona on Thursday. She spent Tuesday in New York taping interviews on ABC’s 'The View,' with radio personality Howard Stern and on 'The Late Show with Stephen Colbert. Follow the AP’s Election 2024 coverage at: https://apnews.com/hub/election-2024. Here’s the latest: Trump talks about Hurricane Milton Trump says he is praying for the people of Florida as Hurricane Milton begins lashing the state. Speaking at a rally in Scranton, Pennsylvania, Trump says he wants to 'send our love to everyone in Florida. They’re going through a big one tonight.' Trump went on to say that he was 'praying for' those in the storm’s path and 'asking God to keep them all safe.' 'I’ve never seen a hurricane like that. So often you know, they talk about it and they talk talk talk because they want you to watch. This is the real deal. This is a bad one,' he said. He added that many of the states expected to be impacted have Republican governors whom he predicted would 'do a phenomenal job.' Walz talks about Hurricane Milton Campaigning in Arizona, where early voting kicked off on Wednesday, Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Walz, talked about Hurricane Milton moving toward Florida and said, 'Those are Americans. Those are our neighbors. Those are our family members. Those are our friends.' Walz, the Minnesota governor, called unifying across party lines in the face of natural disasters 'critical.' 'It’s not about politics. It’s about basic human decency,' Walz said. 'It’s about leadership and character.' Trump insults Harris at Pennsylvania rally Trump is continuing to insult Harris at a rally in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and says he has no interest in stopping, even if turns some voters off. 'I don’t want to be nice,' Trump said at his first of two rallies of the day in the pivotal battleground state. 'You know, somebody said, ‘You should be nicer. Women won’t like it.’ I said, ’I don’t care.' 'The women want safety and the women want to have a country they can be proud of, I think,' he says. Trump, as usual, is casting Harris as 'an incompetent person,' calling her 'grossly incompetent' and 'totally ill-quipped to do the job of being President of the United States' He also criticized the hosts of 'The View,' where Harris appeared on Tuesday. He called one of the women hosts 'dumber than Kamala. She’s a dummy,' he said. 'That is one dumb woman. Sorry. I’m sorry, women, she’s a dummy.' In-person voting has started in Arizona Early in-person voting has started in Arizona, making it the first of this year’s presidential battleground states where all residents can cast a ballot at a traditional polling place ahead of Election Day. The start of in-person voting on Wednesday in the closely contested state also is drawing the presidential tickets. Both campaigns scheduled visits here this week. Each of Arizona’s 15 counties is required to open at least one site for in-person voting, which runs until the Friday before the Nov. 5 general election. In-person voting begins next week in four more presidential swing states — Georgia, Michigan, North Carolina and Nevada. Marjorie Taylor Greene's suggestions that Democrats control the weather is ‘beyond ridiculous,’ Biden says President Joe Biden is calling 'beyond ridiculous' suggestions by a Republican congresswoman that Democrats are controlling the weather, and might even be directing especially strong storms toward conservative parts of the country. During a briefing at the White House on federal preparations for Hurricane Milton, Biden denounced widespread misinformation about the federal assistance that’s available to victims. He called out Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene by name, saying she was suggesting 'the federal government is literally controlling the weather. We’re controlling the weather. It’s beyond ridiculous. It’s gotta stop.' The president referenced Greene’s comments again later in the briefing, calling them 'off the wall.' 'It’s like out of a comic book,' Biden said Biden discusses FEMA's efforts President Joe Biden has told the head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, 'You’re doing a hell of a job.' Biden made the comment to FEMA chief Deanne Criswell during a virtual briefing at the White House with federal authorities bracing for Hurricane Milton’s making landfall in Florida. It was meant as a compliment, but it immediately recalled then-President George W. Bush telling his FEMA director, Michael Brown, 'Brownie, you’re doing a heck of a job.' Bush said that before the extent of the mismanaged federal response to 2005’s Hurricane Katrina had become clear and it later long haunted him. South Dakota kicks 273 people off its voter rolls with voting underway South Dakota’s top elections official has removed hundreds of people from the state’s voter rolls even with voting already underway. Republican Secretary of State Monae Johnson says the move was necessary to defend the integrity of the election. But critics say it violates a federal law and could disenfranchise valid voters who are naturalized U.S. citizens. The American Civil Liberties Union of South Dakota has called for the 273 voters to be reinstated. South Dakota was one of the first states to begin early voting for the November general election. Absentee voting began Sept. 20. Harris warns against price gouging Vice President Kamala Harris warned against jacking up prices on Americans dealing with back-to-back hurricanes. 'Those evacuating before Hurricane Milton or recovering from Hurricane Helene should not be subject to illegal price gouging or fraud — at the pump, airport, or hotel counter,' she said in a statement on Wednesday. Harris said the federal government is tracking allegations and 'will hold those taking advantage of the situation accountable.' President Joe Biden made a similar demand Tuesday. 'I’m calling on the airlines and other companies to provide as much service as possible to accommodate evacuations and not to engage in price gouging, to just do it on the level,' he said at the White House. Biden says Congress needs to step up after Hurricane Helene President Joe Biden says that the destruction from Hurricane Helene is going to cost billions of dollars that victims will need quickly and that 'Congress better be ready to step up to help.' Biden made the comments in excerpts of his interview recorded Tuesday with theGiro. The excerpts were released as Hurricane Milton threatens to unleash new devastation in Florida. Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, who replaced him at the top of the Democratic Election Day ticket, have previously criticized former President Donald Trump, now the Republican nominee, for spreading false information about the federal response to Helene. In the interview excerpts, Biden says that, 'A lot of folks are out there spreading lies about what we are not doing, that things are not going well. That we are not responding.' He responded, 'We’ve been completely responsive, and we’ve been ahead of the game.' Trump schedules rally in New York for end of October Donald Trump is returning to New York in the race’s final stretch, scheduling a rally at the city’s iconic Madison Square Garden stadium. Trump is planning his event for Oct. 27, kicking off the final week of campaigning, according to a campaign official familiar with the plans who spoke on condition of anonymity before a formal announcement. It will be Trump’s second rally in the city he grew up in following a stop in the South Bronx in May. Trump has claimed he believes he can win New York, even though it is an overwhelmingly Democratic state and the city even more so. But such an event is likely to draw outsized media attention. The former president is also campaigning this week in other Democratic states, including California and Colorado. — By Jill Colvin	https://apnews.com/article/harris-trump-election-2024-b635227719e4f237fe74b72ccfef1c26	2024-10-09T05:48:34-07:00	
The death toll in a gang attack on a small Haitian town rises to 115, a local official says	PONT-SONDÉ, Haiti (AP) — The death toll in a brutal gang attack last week on a small town in central Haiti has risen to 115, a local official told The Associated Press on Wednesday. The attack on residents of Pont-Sondé on Oct. 3 was one of the biggest massacres that Haiti has seen in recent history. Myriam Fièvre, mayor of the nearby city of Saint-Marc, said Wednesday that the toll had risen to 115 and would likely keep rising because authorities are still looking for bodies and haven’t been able to access certain areas of the town. 'We are working to make sure that the population is protected,' she said in a phone interview. The U.N. had previously said that at least 70 people were killed last week when the Gran Grif gang invaded the town in the central Artibonite region. The victims included babies, young mothers and the elderly, with the gang approaching Pont-Sondé via canoes to catch residents by surprise, according to a local human rights group. Survivors have questioned why authorities did not do anything to stop the attack since the gang had warned in a video posted on social media that it planned to target Pont-Sondé. A day after the attack, officials replaced the police commissioner who oversees the Artibonite region, which has seen a surge of gang violence in recent years, with at least 20 criminal groups operating in the area, according to the U.N. More than 6,200 survivors have fled Pont-Sondé and temporarily settled in the coastal city of Saint-Marc and surrounding areas. A majority of them are staying with relatives, but more than 750 others have nowhere to go and are sleeping on the floors of a church, a school and a public plaza in Saint-Marc, according to the U.N.’s International Organization for Migration. As Saint-Marc struggles with the sudden influx of people, Fièvre warned that the Gran Grif gang is infiltrating nearby communities after attacking Pont-Sondé. Haiti’s National Human Rights Defense Network has said the gang was angry that a local self-defense group was trying to limit gang activity in Pont-Sondé and prevent it from profiting off a makeshift road toll it had recently established nearby. Gran Grif has about 100 members and has been accused of crimes including murder, rape, robberies and kidnappings. It was formed after former legislator Prophane Victor began arming young men nearly a decade ago to secure his election and control of the area, according to the U.N Victor and the Gran Grif leader, Luckson Elan, were sanctioned by the U.S. last month. Elan also was sanctioned by the U.N. Security Council, which noted that Gran Grif 'is the largest and most powerful' gang in Artibonite, committing nine mass kidnappings from October 2023 to January 2024, including that of 157 people. ___ Sanon reported from Port-au-Prince, Haiti	https://apnews.com/article/haiti-gang-attack-pontsonde-gran-grif-1a45faafb929a605f30af4efd8454aeb	2024-10-09T05:11:29-07:00	
Alfonso Cuarón and Cate Blanchett made a television series. 'Disclaimer' is already a triumph	VENICE, Italy (AP) — 'Disclaimer' pulls the rug out from the audience before they’ve had the chance to get settled. There’s no building of empathy for its central character, Cate Blanchett’s Catherine Ravenscroft. There’s no luxuriating in her banal every day, at work or in her plush London home with her snobbish husband (Sacha Baron Cohen) and directionless, resentful adult son (Kodi Smit-McPhee). All we know at the beginning of the seven-part series, which begins rolling out on Apple TV+ Friday, is that she’s an acclaimed documentary filmmaker who is being feted by Christiane Amanpour. But almost immediately her life starts to spiral when she receives an anonymous, self-published book about a young mother on vacation in Italy with her toddler son that’s shockingly familiar. The woman in the book meets a young man who later drowns while trying to save her son. When the police question her, she denies knowing him and returns to London. It’s a memory that Catherine has long kept buried and secret but has now emerged in spectacularly embarrassing, reputation-destroying fashion along with a batch of intimate, provocative photos that the young man, Jonathan (Louis Partridge) took the night before. 'Disclaimer' throws you into the fire; And like everyone else in the show, from strangers reading the book to Catherine’s husband, you start making assumptions about and judging her. Not even Blanchett was immune reading the script. She wondered: Is this woman awful? 'I was shocked at the layers of judgment that I transposed on the character,' Blanchett said. 'The challenge and agony of playing a character like this is that the crisis happens as soon as you meet her. We know nothing about her, only what people are saying about her.' Told in seven chapters, the psychological thriller comes from Oscar-winning director Alfonso Cuarón who read Renée Knight’s book before he’d even made 'Roma.' The filmmaker had never dabbled in longform before, but soon realized while writing the script that it was the only way to tell it in a satisfying way. Instead of getting hung up on the ins-and-outs of making a television show, he decided he would just do it his way: Like a film, or, rather, seven films. After all, Rainer Werner Fassbinder, David Lynch and Krzysztof Kieślowski had done it too. Cuarón had written Catherine with only Blanchett in mind, an actor he knew had the incredible range and sophistication required by the role. He teased that he was also jealous of his friends Alejandro Iñárritu and Guillermo del Toro, who had already had the privilege of directing (and raving about) her. What he didn’t expect, and was pleasantly surprised about, was her complete and total commitment as a producer, even as the shoot stretched on to nearly a year. 'I enjoy collaboration,' Blanchett said. 'I’m interested in the whole thing. And I think you have to know when you are going to be useful and when you need to just sit back and be quiet.' Sometimes, Cuarón said, he’d be on board with her suggestions. Other times he chose a different path and usually regretted it. But they consulted on everything from the smallest details (like prop placement) to the biggest, including the script and casting Kevin Kline as Stephen Brigstocke, the father of the young man Catherine met so many years ago. He’s recently lost his wife too, has retired from his job and has nothing but time to stew about how his happy life became so tragic. Revenge is on his mind. The series plays with form and storytelling, with flashbacks, different perspectives, timelines and narrators dolling out information. Amanpour at the outset, in what is meant to be complimentary to Catherine, frames the whole thing aptly: 'Beware of narrative and form. Their power can bring us closer to the truth, but they can also be a weapon with a great power to manipulate.' In that spirit, Cuarón’s longtime cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki even suggested bringing in another director of photography, Bruno Delbonnel, to add a different visual element as well. Don’t worry if that sounds like you need a film degree to recognize or appreciate the distinction between a Lubezki or a Delbonnel shot. 'It’s not about noticing,' Cuarón said. 'It’s about the experience and following different narratives. We try to approach each one of these narratives with a different language.' 'Disclaimer' debuted like a film too, at the Venice Film Festival last month. Though the festival often hosts auteur-driven series alongside the feature films, they’re not often discussed in the same breath as the competition slate of Oscar hopefuls. 'Disclaimer' hit differently, though. In a lineup that had all forms of ambitious cinematic fare from modern masters, some were even calling the show 'the best film of the festival.' Audiences were shown episodes one through four one day, and the final three on the next. While Cuarón welcomes viewers to manage their own viewing schedule, whether it’s as they drop on Apple TV+ (two episodes on Oct. 11, two on Oct. 18, and one every Friday following) waiting to watch in two batches, divided up as they were in Venice, isn’t a bad idea either. The main thing, Blanchett and Cuarón agree, is that attention is key. Also, it’s something you might find yourself wanting to watch again after the finale airs on Nov. 8. 'Something we talked about was the hope that people went back and watched it again and have an entirely different perspective on things that we take for granted,' Blanchett said. Cuarón went a step further: 'A second view should give you a completely different reading than the first view.'	https://apnews.com/article/cate-blanchett-alfonso-cuaron-series-disclaimer-dad35604feabca8075575d4137b746a0	2024-10-09T03:50:59-07:00	
Germany's economy is on track to shrink for a second straight year	BERLIN (AP) — Germany's government said Wednesday that the country's economy, Europe's biggest, is on track to shrink for a second consecutive year — underlining the unpopular administration's troubles as it heads into a difficult election year. The new forecast that gross domestic product will shrink by 0.2% this year compares with the government's prediction in April of 0.3% growth and brings it into line with economists, who also have forecast a slight contraction. The German economy shrank by 0.3% in 2023. The government forecast growth of 1.1% next year and 1.6% in 2025. Vice Chancellor Robert Habeck, who is also the economy minister, said that the German economy hasn't seen powerful growth since 2018 as the country's own structural problems have been joined by wider global challenges. 'In the middle of the crises, Germany and Europe are squeezed between China and the U.S., and must learn to assert themselves,' he said in a statement. Habeck argued that the government has tackled many of Germany's homemade problems — securing its energy supply, speeding up planning procedures, trimming bureaucracy and trying to address a shortage of skilled workers. The German Chamber of Commerce and Industry said that such measures need to be implemented quickly and more reforms are required to encourage investment. Its chief executive, Martin Wansleben, said that Germany has only once before had two successive years of recession — in 2002 and 2003, when the government at the time launched a series of welfare state reforms — and that GDP is only half a percentage point above its level before the COVID-19 pandemic. 'There has never yet been such a prolonged phase of weakness in the German economy,' he said. Chancellor Olaf Scholz's three-party coalition government has seen its popularity plunge over nearly three years in office. It has become notorious for constant infighting, for instance over next year's budget. The center-right opposition leads polls before a national election scheduled for September, and the far-right Alternative for Germany also has performed strongly in recent state and European Parliament elections.	https://apnews.com/article/germany-economy-gdp-recession-government-a4d30f2e398d12afbd793d69c5ac76de	2024-10-09T03:35:04-07:00	
Zelenskyy will present his Ukraine 'victory plan' to Western leaders but Biden meeting is postponed	DUBROVNIK, Croatia (AP) — Ukraine's president on Wednesday said he intends to present his 'victory plan' to Western leaders this week, but a weekend meeting to discuss it has been postponed as U.S. President Joe Biden said he had to stay home to respond to Hurricane Milton’ s landfall in Florida. Speaking at a summit in Croatia with leaders of southeastern European states, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he hopes his meeting with Biden at the U.S. Ramstein Air Base in Germany, originally scheduled for Saturday, will be rescheduled soon. That meeting was meant to include about 20 Western leaders and defense ministers. 'We will present our victory plan in detail there, the same as we presented it in the White House,' Zelenskyy said. He added that he now planned to meet with the leaders of Britain, France, Italy and Germany this week to present the plan. Zelenskyy said the plan is about strengthening Ukraine 'both geopolitically and on the battlefield' before any kind of dialogue with Russia. 'Weakness of any of our allies will inspire (Russian President Vladimir) Putin,' he said. 'That’s why we’re asking them to strengthen us, in terms of security guarantees, in terms of weapons, in terms of our future after this war. In my view, he (Putin) only understands force.' The specifics of Zelenskyy’s blueprint have been kept quiet but contours of the plan have emerged, including the need for fast action on decisions Western allies have been mulling since the full-scale invasion began in 2022. Kyiv is still awaiting word from Western partners on its repeated requests to use the long-range weapons they provide to hit targets on Russian soil. Some Balkan states have been providing Ukraine with short-range weapons. At a previous summit with southeast European countries in February, Zelenskyy pleaded for more to repel Russian advances. On Wednesday, Zelenskyy signed an agreement with Croatia on further cooperation, particularly regarding humanitarian aid, demining and war crimes prosecution experience that Croatia has from its own 1991-95 war. Besides Croatia, the summit was being attended by premiers, presidents or foreign ministers from Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Greece, Kosovo, Moldova, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Romania, Serbia, Slovenia and Turkey. Serbia’s President Aleksandar Vucic's government is the only one in Europe that has not imposed sanctions on Russia over its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, although Vucic has repeatedly said that Serbia respects Ukraine’s 'territorial integrity.' Summit participants passed a declaration condemning Russia's aggression against Ukraine and supporting Zelenskyy's peace efforts, Ukraine's membership in NATO and its reconstruction after the war. 'There can be no free, peaceful and prosperous Europe without a free, peaceful and prosperous Ukraine,' the joint declaration said.	https://apnews.com/article/croatia-ukraine-summit-southeast-europe-14888717f7e62179dd5ac9e6dd9274c5	2024-10-09T02:51:10-07:00	
Ukrainian drone strikes another arms depot inside Russia, officials say	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — A Ukrainian drone struck an important arms depot inside Russia, the Ukraine military said Wednesday, three weeks after another drone blasted a major Russian armory and three days after a drone smashed into a key oil terminal in Russia-occupied Crimea. The Tuesday night strike targeted an arsenal in Russia’s Bryansk border region where missiles and artillery munitions were stored, including some that had been delivered by North Korea, a Ukrainian General Staff statement said. Hugely powerful glide bombs that have terrorized civilian areas of Ukraine and bludgeoned Ukrainian army defenses were also kept at the arsenal, located 115 kilometers (70 miles) from the Ukrainian border, and some of the ammunition was stored in the open, it said. 'Striking such arsenals creates serious logistical problems for the Russian army, thus significantly reducing (its) offensive capabilities,' the statement said. Russia is expending enormous amounts of ammunition as it makes its advantage in artillery shells felt on the battlefield in a war of attrition that is approaching its 1,000-day milestone next month. Its slow but relentless drive deeper into Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region is stretching Ukraine’s resources just as some of Kyiv’s key Western partners are being distracted by domestic concerns and Middle East wars. Ukraine is building up its own arms industry, and authorities have identified drones as an important aspect of that. 'Among the key areas identified are drones for our army, and this should be a supply that not only constantly increases in volume, but also evolves and develops in line with the demands of war,' Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a video address late Tuesday about weapons production. The Russian military has also improved its drones’ capabilities and expanded their use. Russian drones targeted Ukraine’s southern Odesa region for the third night in a row on Tuesday, injuring five people, regional Gov. Oleh Kiper said. However, Ukraine’s air defenses have proved resilient against drones. The Ukrainian air force said Wednesday it shot down 21 out of 22 drones that Russia launched over three Ukrainian regions. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-drone-arms-depot-bryansk-096d0ddf453a9000623a91b29c735e3c	2024-10-09T01:31:46-07:00	
An American once imprisoned in Russia is sentenced in absentia as Ukraine mercenary	MOSCOW (AP) — An American who spent three years behind bars in Russia before being released in a prisoner exchange has been convicted in absentia for fighting as a mercenary in Ukraine, Russia's Investigative Committee said Wednesday. The committee, Russia's primary criminal investigation authority, said in a statement that Trevor Reed was sentenced by a Russian court to 14 1/2 years in prison. Reed was injured in the fighting in eastern Ukraine in 2023 and treated in Germany. His whereabouts at the time of the sentencing were not immediately known. Reed, a former US Marine, was arrested in Moscow in 2019 for allegedly assaulting a police officer while heavily intoxicated. Russian authorities claimed he had grabbed the steering wheel of the police vehicle taking him to a so-called 'drunk tank.' However, police did not produce video evidence from the vehicle's camera and Reed's girlfriend, who was following in a separate car, said she did not see the vehicle swerve. The then-US ambassador, John Sullivan, said the evidence against Reed in the trial was so preposterous that 'even the judge laughed.' Reed was sentenced to nine years in prison. He was released in April 2022 in exchange for Russian drug smuggler Konstantin Yaroshenko. He reportedly joined the Ukraine military as a foreign fighter in November 2022. The announcement of Reed's conviction came two days after a Moscow court convicted 72-year-old American Stephen Hubbard of fighting in Ukraine as a mercenary and sentenced him to nearly seven years. Hubbard was captured by Russia about two months after the Febrruary 2022 start of full-scale fighting in Ukraine.	https://apnews.com/article/ukraine-trevor-reed-russia-389dccc3c8f557bc9c598e29d1429773	2024-10-09T01:05:32-07:00	
Israeli offensive in hard-hit northern Gaza kills dozens and threatens hospitals	DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — A large-scale Israeli operation in northern Gaza has killed dozens of people and threatens to shut down three hospitals over a year into the war with Hamas, Palestinian officials and residents said Wednesday. Heavy fighting was underway in Jabaliya, where Israeli forces have carried out several major operations over the course of the war and then returned as militants regroup. The entire north, including Gaza City, has suffered heavy destruction and has been largely isolated by Israeli forces since late last year. The continuing cycle of destruction and death in Gaza, unleashed by Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack on southern Israel, comes as Israel expands a weeklong ground offensive against Hezbollah in Lebanon and considers a major retaliatory strike on Iran. A rocket fired from Lebanon killed two people in the northern Israeli town of Kiryat Shmona, and another six people were wounded in a series of stabbings in the city of Hadera on Wednesday, which Israeli police described as a militant attack. Police said the attacker was 'neutralized,' indicating he was killed. Hezbollah claimed the strike on Kiryat Shmona, saying it targeted 'a gathering of enemy forces' with a rocket salvo. Ofir Yehezkeli, the town's acting mayor, said the two people killed were a couple who were walking their dogs when a rocket fell near them. Residents of Jabaliya, an urban refugee camp dating back to the 1948 war surrounding Israel's creation, said thousands of people have been trapped in their homes since the operation began Sunday, as Israeli jets and drones buzz overhead and troops battle militants in the streets. 'It’s like hell. We can’t get out,' said Mohamed Awda, who lives with his parents and six siblings. He said there were three bodies in the street outside his home that could not be retrieved because of the fighting. 'The quadcopters are everywhere, and they fire at anyone. You can’t even open the window,' he told The Associated Press by phone, speaking over the sound of explosions. Dozens have been killed and survivors fear displacement Gaza's Health Ministry said it recovered 40 bodies from Jabaliya from Sunday until Tuesday, and another 14 from communities farther north. There are likely more bodies under rubble and in areas that can't be accessed, it said. An airstrike in Jabaliya early Wednesday killed at least nine people, including two women and two children, according to Al-Ahly Hospital, which received the bodies. Strikes in central Gaza killed another nine people, including three children, according to Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir al-Balah. Residents of Jabaliya fear Israel’s aim is to depopulate the north and turn it into a closed military zone or a Jewish settlement. Israel has blocked all roads except for the main highway leading south from Jabaliya, according to residents. The U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees said it was evacuating seven schools that were being used as shelters and that only two of eight water wells in the camp are still functioning. 'We are concerned about the displacement to the south,' Ahmed Qamar, who lives in Jabaliya with his wife, children and parents, said in a text message. 'People here say clearly that they will die here in northern Gaza and and won’t go to southern Gaza.' Hospitals are under threat Fadel Naeem, the director of Al-Ahly Hospital in Gaza City, said it had received dozens of wounded people and bodies from the north. 'We declared a state of emergency, suspended scheduled surgeries, and discharged patients whose conditions are stable,' told AP in a text message. Israel’s offensive has gutted Gaza’s health sector, forcing most of its hospitals to shut down and leaving the rest only partially functioning. Naeem said three hospitals farther north — Kamal Adwan, Awda and the Indonesian Hospital - have become almost inaccessible because of the fighting. The Gaza Health Ministry says the Israeli army has ordered all three to evacuate staff and patients. Meanwhile, no humanitarian aid has entered the north since Oct. 1, according to U.N. data. The Israeli military did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the hospitals or the apparent suspension of aid delivery in the north. Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, the military spokesperson, said late Tuesday that Israeli forces were operating in Jabaliya to 'prevent Hamas' regrouping efforts' and had killed around 100 militants, without providing evidence. Israel says it only targets militants and blames civilian deaths on Hamas because it fights in residential areas. Israel ordered the wholesale evacuation of northern Gaza, including Gaza City, in the opening weeks of the war, but hundreds of thousands of people are believed to have remained there. Israel reiterated those instructions over the weekend, telling people to flee south to an expanded humanitarian zone where hundreds of thousands are already crammed into squalid tent camps. The war began just over a year ago, when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250. They still hold around 100 hostages, a third of whom are believed to be dead. Israel's offensive has killed over 42,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not say how many were fighters. It has said women and children make up over half of the dead. The offensive has also caused staggering destruction across the territory and displaced around 90% of the population of 2.3 million people, often multiple times. Israel warns Lebanon it could end up like Gaza Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to keep fighting until 'total victory' over Hamas and the return of all the captives. On Tuesday, he warned that Lebanon would meet the same fate as Gaza if its people did not rise up against Hezbollah, which began firing rockets into Israel after the initial Hamas attack. That set in motion a cycle of escalation that ignited a full-scale war last month. 'You have an opportunity to save Lebanon before it falls into the abyss of a long war that will lead to destruction and suffering like we see in Gaza,' Netanyahu said, addressing the Lebanese people. An Israeli strike killed four people and wounded another 10 at a hotel sheltering displaced people in the southern Lebanese town of Wardaniyeh on Wednesday, according to Lebanon's Health Ministry. An Associated Press reporter in a nearby town heard two sonic booms from Israeli jets before the strike. Plumes of smoke rose from the building after the explosion. In recent weeks Israel has waged a heavy air campaign across large parts of Lebanon, targeting what it says are Hezbollah rocket launchers and other militant sites. A series of strikes killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and most of his top commanders. So far, ground operations appear to be focused on a narrow strip along the border, but Israel has warned people to evacuate dozens of cities and towns, many of them north of a buffer zone declared by the United Nations after the 2006 war between Israel and Hezbollah. Hezbollah's acting leader, Sheikh Naim Kassem, said in a televised statement Tuesday that the group has replaced its slain commanders and was preventing Israeli ground forces from advancing. The militants have extended their rocket fire deeper into Israel, disrupting life but causing few casualties. The Israeli military said Wednesday that Hezbollah has fired more than 12,000 rockets, missiles and drones at Israel since the start of the hostilities last year. Israel is meanwhile considering options for a strike on Iran that could potentially escalate the war on yet another front. Iran, which supports Hezbollah and Hamas, launched a wave of some 180 ballistic missiles at Israel last week in retaliation for the killing of top militants from both groups. ___ Magdy reported from Cairo.

Nobel Prize in chemistry awarded to 3 scientists for work on proteins, building blocks of life	STOCKHOLM (AP) — Three scientists who discovered powerful techniques to predict and even design novel proteins — the building blocks of life — were awarded the Nobel Prize in chemistry on Wednesday. Their work used advanced technologies, including machine learning, and holds the potential to transform how new drugs are made. The prize was awarded to David Baker, who works at the University of Washington in Seattle, and to Demis Hassabis and John Jumper, who both work at Google DeepMind, a British-American artificial intelligence research laboratory based in London. Heiner Linke, chair of the Nobel Committee for Chemistry, said the award honored research that unraveled long-standing scientific mysteries. 'That was actually called a grand challenge in chemistry, and in particular in biochemistry, for decades. So, it’s that breakthrough that gets awarded today,' he said. What is the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for? Proteins are complex molecules with thousands of atoms that twist, turn, loop and spiral in a countless array of shapes. The shape of a protein determines its biological function. For decades, scientists have dreamed of being able to efficiently design and build new proteins. Baker, whose work has received funding from the National Institutes of Health since the 1990s, created a computer program called Rosetta that helped analyze information about existing proteins in comprehensive databases in order to build new proteins that don't exist in nature. 'It seems that you can almost construct any type of protein now with this technology,' said Johan Åqvist of the Nobel committee. Hassabis and Jumper created an artificial intelligence model that has been able to predict the structure of virtually all the 200 million proteins that researchers have identified, the committee added. The duo 'managed to crack the code. With skillful use of artificial intelligence, they made it possible to predict the complex structure of essentially any known protein in nature,' Linke said. Why this work matters? The ability to custom design new proteins — and better understand existing proteins — could enable researchers to create new kinds of medicines and vaccines. It could also allow scientists to design new enzymes to break down plastics or other waste materials, and to design fine-tuned sensors for hazardous materials. 'I think there’s fantastic prospects for making better medicines — medicines that are smarter, that only work in the right time and place in the body,' Baker told The Associated Press. One example is a potential nasal spray that could slow or stop the rapid spread of specific viruses, such as COVID-19, he said. Another is a medicine to disrupt the cascade of symptoms known as cytokine storm. 'That was always the holy grail. If you could figure out how protein sequences folded into their particular structures, then it might be possible to design protein sequences to fold into previously never seen structures that might be useful for us,' said Jon Lorsh of the NIH. Baker said Hassabis and Jumper's artificial intelligence work gave his team a huge boost. 'The breakthroughs made by Demis and John on protein structure prediction really highlighted to us the power that AI could have. And that led us to apply these AI methods to protein design and that has greatly increased the power and accuracy,' he said. How the winners reacted Baker told the AP he found out he won the Nobel during the early hours of the morning alongside his wife, who immediately started screaming. 'So it was a little deafening, too,' he said. Hassabis said in a statement that 'receiving the Nobel Prize is the honor of a lifetime.' One of Britain’s leading tech figures, he co-founded the AI research lab DeepMind in 2010, which was later acquired by Google. DeepMind’s breakthroughs include developing an AI system that mastered the Chinese game of Go and was able to defeat the game’s human world champion much faster than expected. Jumper said in the same statement that it was an honor to be 'recognized for delivering on the long promise of computational biology to help us understand the protein world and to inform the incredible work of experimental biologists.' 'It is a key demonstration that AI will make science faster and ultimately help to understand disease and develop therapeutics,' Jumper said. More about the Nobels Baker gets half of the prize money of 11 million Swedish Kronor ($1 million) while Hassabis and Jumper share the other half. It’s the second Nobel prize that has gone to someone with links to Google. Physics prize winner Geoffrey Hinton also previously worked at the tech company, but later quit so he could speak more freely about the potential dangers of artificial intelligence. Last year, the chemistry award went to three scientists for their work on quantum dots — tiny particles just a few nanometers in diameter that can release very bright colored light and whose applications in everyday life include electronics and medical imaging. Six days of Nobel announcements opened Monday with Americans Victor Ambros and Gary Ruvkun winning the medicine prize. Two founding fathers of machine learning — Hinton and John Hopfield — won the physics prize. The awards continue with the literature prize on Thursday. The Nobel Peace Prize will be announced Friday and the economics award on Oct. 14. The prize money comes from a bequest left by the award’s creator, Swedish inventor Alfred Nobel. The laureates are invited to receive their awards at ceremonies on Dec. 10, the anniversary of Nobel’s death. ___ Corder reported from The Hague, Netherlands, and Larson reported from Washington, D.C.

Middle East latest: Dozens killed as Israeli troops pound central and northern Gaza	Israel’s bombardment of central and northern Gaza has killed dozens of people and trapped thousands in their homes, Palestinian officials said Wednesday, as the death toll in the yearlong war passed 42,000. Gaza’s Health Ministry said it recovered 40 bodies from Jabaliya from Sunday until Tuesday, and another 14 from communities farther north. The toll is likely higher as there are bodies buried under the rubble and in areas that can’t be accessed, it said. Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, the military spokesperson, said that Israeli forces were operating in Jabaliya to prevent Hamas from regrouping and had killed about 100 militants, without providing evidence. Israel says it only targets militants and blames civilian deaths on Hamas because it fights in residential areas. A year ago, Hamas-led militants blew holes in Israel’s security fence and stormed into army bases and farming communities, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting another 250. They are still holding about 100 captives inside Gaza, a third of whom are believed to be dead. Israel is now at war with Hamas in Gaza and its ally Hezbollah in Lebanon, which began firing rockets at Israel on Oct. 8, 2023. ___ Here is the latest: Airstrike kills 5 Lebanese Civil Defense paramedics, officials say BEIRUT — An Israeli airstrike hit a Lebanese Civil Defense center in the town of Dardghaya in southern Lebanon, killing five members stationed there Wednesday, civil defense spokesperson Elie Khairallah told The Associated Press. The Lebanese Health Ministry also confirmed the news in a statement, saying Israel has 'renewed its targeting of rescue and ambulance crews tonight, disregarding international laws, norms and humanitarian conventions.' There was no immediate statement from the Israeli military. Among the victims was Abdullah Al-Moussawi, head of the Tyre regional civil defense center, Khairallah said. The health ministry said teams continued to search for survivors in the rubble. Before Wednesday’s strike, six civil defense members had been killed since last October, Khairallah said. As of last Thursday, the health ministry reported that more than 100 paramedics had been killed by Israeli airstrikes since last October and 225 wounded, with significant damage to emergency infrastructure, including 128 ambulances and fire trucks destroyed, as well as damage to nine hospitals and 45 medical centers. Just last week, Al-Moussawi, spoke with the Associated Press, saying the Israeli airstrikes had made his team increasingly nervous, but that they were hopeful that the international protection guaranteed to medics would extend to them as well. 'We put international protection (tag) on our vehicles along with the (national) Civil Defense flag and we wear the yellow vests,' he said. Video shows what appears to be Israeli soldiers raising flag in Lebanon TEL AVIV, Israel — Video verified by The Associated Press shows what appears to be a group of Israeli soldiers raising an Israeli flag in a village in southern Lebanon. In the video, which appears to have been filmed in Maroun A-Ras, three soldiers are seen hoisting a flag atop a pile of debris. A soldier off camera speaks in Hebrew and refers to the nearby Israeli village of Avivim. It was not clear when the video was recorded. Israeli troops have been operating in Maroun a-Ras, where they have taken up positions inside a public garden on the edge of the village. The video follows other similar acts that took place throughout Israel’s ground offensive in Gaza. The Israeli military had no immediate comment. Israeli strike on Iran would be ‘lethal,’ defense minister says JERUSALEM — Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said Wednesday that an Israeli strike on Iran in response to its recent missile attack would be 'lethal' and 'surprising.' 'Our attack will be lethal, precise and above all surprising. They will not understand what happened and how it happened,' Gallant said during a speech to Israeli troops. Iran fired dozens of missiles at Israel last week in an escalation of the conflict between the two countries. Israel has vowed to respond to the missile attack but has not outlined what this retaliation would entail. The ballistic missile attack came weeks after Israel’s military intensified its airstrikes across Lebanon wiping out the majority of Hezbollah’s high ranking commanders including its leader, Hassan Nasrallah. In July, a strike in Tehran assassinated Hamas’ political leader, Ismael Haniyeh, and Iran blamed Israel. Israel has not confirmed or denied it was behind his killing. Iran is the main sponsor of the Lebanese militant group and Hamas in Gaza. Third Brazilian repatriation flight leaves Beirut RIO DE JANEIRO — Brazil’s third repatriation plane left Beirut for Brazil on Wednesday, carrying 218 passengers including 11 infants, as well as five pets, according to a statement from Brazil’s foreign ministry. The flight is set to land in Sao Paulo on Thursday morning local time after a stop to refuel in Lisbon. The Brazilian government has evacuated 674 people and 11 pets from Lebanon in five days, the foreign ministry said. The aircraft also delivered Brazil’s second donation of health supplies to Lebanon. About 21,000 Brazilians live in Lebanon, which is home to the largest community of Brazilians in the Middle East. Two Brazilian adolescents have been killed by Israeli bombardments in Lebanon. Biden and Netanyahu have first phone conversation in weeks WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday held their first call in seven weeks, a conversation that comes as Israel expands its ground incursion into Lebanon and considers how to respond to Iran’s recent ballistic missile attack. Vice President Kamala Harris joined the call, according to the White House. Meanwhile, Netanyahu’s office confirmed that the prime minister had recently spoken with former President Donald Trump. The Republican, who is the midst of a close White House race against Harris, called Netanyahu last week and 'congratulated him on the intense and determined operations that Israel carried out against Hezbollah,' according to Netanyahu’s office. 22 killed and 80 wounded in past 24 hours, Lebanon's health ministry says BEIRUT — Lebanon’s crisis response unit announced Wednesday that 22 people were killed and 80 wounded in the past 24 hours, raising the total toll over the past year of conflict between Israel and Hezbollah to 2,141 killed and 10,099 wounded, according to Lebanese Health Ministry. The report also recorded 70 airstrikes and incidents of shelling in the past day, mostly concentrated in southern Lebanon, the southern suburbs of Beirut and the Bekaa Valley. Some 1,000 centers — including educational complexes, vocational institutes, universities and other institutions — are sheltering 185,400 people displaced by the Israeli offensive in Lebanon, the report said. Half of those displaced are housed in facilities concentrated in Beirut and Mount Lebanon. Among these shelters, 807 have reached full capacity. Overall, the total number of displaced individuals in Lebanon stands at 1.2 million. Additionally, 15,000 displaced individuals have received medical treatment and medication. Despite a major border crossing between Lebanon and Syria being out of commission after an Israeli strike hit the road last week, crowds have continued to flow across the border seeking relative safety in Syria. Between Sept. 23 and Wednesday, Lebanese General Security recorded 311,034 Syrian citizens and 108,672 Lebanese citizens crossing into Syria, the report said. Palestinian militants killed by Israeli forces in West Bank, officials say JERUSALEM — The Palestinian Health Ministry said four Palestinians were killed by Israeli forces in the northern West Bank city of Nablus on Wednesday. A militant group later said the slain men were its fighters. Commenting on the incident, the Israeli police said its forces killed five militants, including a local commander in Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade, an armed offshoot of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas’ Fatah party. The Associated Press was not immediately able to reconcile the conflicting death tolls. The military said the slain men were planning attacks against Israeli troops and civilians. Violence has surged in the West Bank since the Israel-Hamas war erupted 12 months ago. Over that time, more than 740 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli fire in the West Bank according to the Palestinian Health Ministry. Nablus and other northern cities have seen some of the territory’s worst violence. Palestinian journalist killed and another wounded in a Gaza airstrike JERUSALEM — A Palestinian journalist was killed and at least one other injured in an Israeli airstrike in northern Gaza on Wednesday, Palestinian health authorities said. Mohammed Tanani, a cameraman working with the Hamas-affiliated Al-Aqsa TV station, was killed in a blast at Abu Shrekh roundabout in the Jabaliya area, the Palestinian Red Crescent and Hamas-affiliated outlet said. Another Palestinian reporter from the TV station was wounded, the network said. The Committee to Protect Journalists, a media freedom organization, say 128 journalists have been killed since the Israel-Hamas war erupted last October. They include 123 Palestinian, two Israeli and three Lebanese media workers. 2 killed in a rocket attack on northern Israel TEL AVIV, Israel — Israeli first responders say a man and a woman were killed by a rocket fired from Lebanon. The Magen David Adom rescue service said the two were killed Wednesday when a rocket struck the northern town of Kiryat Shmona. Lebanon’s Hezbollah militant group has fired hundreds of rockets into Israel in recent days as Israel has ramped up its airstrikes in Lebanon and pushed ahead with a ground incursion. Most of the rockets have been intercepted or landed in open areas, but the barrages have grown more intense and have reached deeper into Israel, disrupting daily life. Hezbollah began firing rockets, missiles and drones into Israel after Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023 attack from Gaza into Israel ignited the war. Hezbollah and Hamas are both allied with Iran, and Hezbollah said the attacks were in support of the Palestinians. Israel retaliated with airstrikes, and the conflict escalated into a full-blown war last month. At least 4 killed in an Israeli strike in southern Lebanon BEIRUT — The Lebanese Health Ministry said at least four people were killed in an Israeli strike on a hotel-turned-shelter for displaced people in southern Lebanon. Ten others were wounded in the strike that hit the building in Wardaniyeh in Lebanon’s Chouf province. An Associated Press reporter in a nearby town heard two sonic booms and an explosion from Israeli jets before the strike, followed by plumes of black and white smoke rising from the building. At least 6 people stabbed and wounded in an attack in northern Israel TEL AVIV, Israel — At least six people were stabbed and wounded in northern Israel in what police say was a militant attack. Police said the assailant stabbed people in multiple locations in the northern city of Hadera on Wednesday before fleeing on a motorbike. Police said they shot and 'neutralized' the attacker, later clarifying that he was arrested. They did not provide the name or nationality of the assailant. Five of the people who were attacked were in critical or severe condition, while the sixth was moderately wounded, according to the nearby Hillel Yaffe Medical Center. Palestinians have carried out scores of stabbing, shooting and car-ramming attacks against Israelis in recent years, and tensions have spiked over the war in Gaza. Philippine president orders preparations for evacuation from Lebanon MANILA, Philippines — Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. ordered government agencies Wednesday to prepare to evacuate Filipinos 'by whatever means' from Lebanon. Marcos held a virtual meeting with key Cabinet members while attending a summit of Southeast Asia leaders in Laos, underscoring the urgency as Israel intensified attacks against the militant group Hezbollah. 'We are now going to evacuate our people by whatever means — by air, or by sea,' Marcos said, adding that any ship to be used has to be positioned near Beirut so Filipinos could immediately leave. About 11,000 Filipinos live and work in Lebanon, including many house helpers, but Philippine Foreign Affairs officials say many are hesitant to leave their jobs. Only about 171 Filipinos in Lebanon were ready for immediate repatriation, they said. Turkish navy ships bring humanitarian aid to Beirut and evacuate citizens BEIRUT — Turkish navy ships docked at a port in Beirut on Wednesday as a part of a mission to bring humanitarian aid to Lebanon and evacuate Turkish citizens. Two of the ships, which can accommodate up to 2,000 passengers, were carrying up to 300 tons of humanitarian aid consisting of food, tents and blankets, according to a statement from the Turkish Defense Ministry. Rear Adm. Nihat Baran, commander of the evacuation mission, said the trip was ordered by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan 'to ensure that our citizens living in Lebanon are transferred to Turkey safely.' Citizens of Bulgaria, Romania and Kazakhstan also applied for the evacuation, the ministry said. The two ships are part of a larger six-vessel convoy that departed the southern port of Mersin early Wednesday. The Turkish Foreign Ministry said additional evacuations would be organized if necessary. Gaza death toll passes 42,000 Gaza’s Health Ministry says the Palestinian death toll from the war in Gaza has passed 42,000. The ministry does not differentiate between fighters and civilians in its count, but has said women and children make up more than half of those killed. It said Wednesday that 42,010 Palestinians have been killed and 97,720 wounded since the start of the war, which was ignited by Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023 attack into Israel. German police close pro-Palestinian protest camp Greta Thunberg planned to visit BERLIN — German police say they dissolved a pro-Palestinian protest camp in the western city of Dortmund after organizers told them that Swedish activist Greta Thunberg was planning to visit the camp. Dortmund police said late Tuesday the decision was made, among other reasons, because Thunberg’s appearance would probably have drawn more people to the protest camp than originally permitted. The dismantling of the camp, which had been in existence for months, was accepted without resistance, police said. Seven protesters were present at the camp on Tuesday, but Thunberg did not appear, German news agency dpa reported. On Monday, Thunberg participated in a pro-Palestinian protest in Berlin. 18 dead after Israeli strikes in Gaza DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — Palestinian officials say Israeli strikes in central and northern Gaza killed at least 18 people, including five children and two women. Two strikes hit tents for displaced people in the urban Nuseirat and Bureij refugee camps in central Gaza early Wednesday. The bodies of nine people, including three children, were brought to the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in the nearby town of Deir al-Balah. An Associated Press journalist saw the bodies at the morgue. In northern Gaza, an Israeli strike hit a family home in the Jabaliya refugee camp, killing at least nine people, according to the Civil Defense, a rescue agency operating under the Hamas-run government. The dead were taken to the Al-Ahly Hospital, which said two women and two children were among those killed. Footage shared by the Civil Defense showed first responders recovering dead bodies and body parts from under the rubble. Israel launched an air and ground operation earlier this week in Jabaliya, a densely populated urban refugee camp dating back to the 1948 war surrounding Israel’s creation. Israel has carried out several previous operations in Jabaliya, and its forces have repeatedly returned to other areas of Gaza after militants have regrouped.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hezbollah-hamas-latest-mideast-9-october-2024-753c6e5ca57cd79c248fede09283ba33	2024-10-08T22:19:10-07:00	
Ishiba dissolves Japan's lower house to set up an Oct. 27 parliamentary election	TOKYO (AP) — Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba dissolved Japan's lower house of parliament Wednesday to set up an Oct. 27 snap election and seek a mandate from voters for his 9-day-old government. Ishiba took office last week as Fumio Kishida resigned after leading the governing Liberal Democratic Party for three years as it was dogged by corruption scandals. With the early election, Ishiba is seeking to secure a majority in the lower house for his governing party while he is still fresh and before the congratulatory mood fades. The move has been criticized as prioritizing an election rather than policies and for allowing little debate. But Japan's opposition has remained too fractured to push the governing party out of power. Ishiba announced his plans for an election even before he won the party leadership vote and became prime minister. His Cabinet planned later Wednesday to formally announce the election date and the start of campaigning next Tuesday. Ishiba and his Cabinet will stay in office until they win the election and are reappointed. The speaker of the house, Fukushiro Nukaga, announced the dissolution of the lower, more powerful of the two parliamentary chambers at a plenary session. All 465 lawmakers stood up, cheered 'banzai' and rushed out of the assembly room. 'We will act fairly and squarely in order to win the people’s endorsement for the current administration,' Ishiba told reporters. 'Even while the lower house is dissolved the Japanese government must fully function' in tackling national security, disaster response and deflation, he said. 'We will devote all our body and soul for the people.' Ishiba planned to explain the election plans at a news conference late Wednesday, just before heading to Laos to make his diplomatic debut at the Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit. Opposition leaders have criticized him for rushing to hold an election allowing only three days of parliamentary debate on his policies and before achieving any results. Even though opposition parties are too fractured to topple the governing party's almost uninterrupted postwar rule, the first public support ratings for Ishiba as prime minister were only about 50% or even lower, the lowest levels for a new leader, according to Japanese media. Ishiba is increasingly seen as backpedaling on a number of proposals he previously advocated so as not to create controversy ahead of the election. In his first policy speech at parliament Friday, he did not touch on his goal of establishing a stronger regional military framework and a more equal Japan-U.S. security alliance, a dual surname option for married couples, and other issues seen as controversial or opposed by conservatives within the governing party. Ishiba is unaffiliated with factions led and controlled by party heavyweights, which some experts say could make his tenure as party leader unstable. None of his Cabinet ministers is from the late Shinzo Abe’s faction that has been linked to damaging misconduct. He also plans to not endorse some members of the Abe faction in the upcoming election to show his determination for cleaner politics. Opponents have said that’s still too lax, but Ishiba is getting backlash within the party for being too strict. ___ Follow AP’s Asia-Pacific coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/asia-pacific	https://apnews.com/article/japan-politics-ishiba-pariament-dissolution-election-6e7ffd74ff17e263b8aea1283f0afbe8	2024-10-08T22:07:19-07:00	
A kitchen staffed by trans women is a refuge for Mexico City’s LGBTQ+ community	MEXICO CITY (AP) — Karolina Long Tain González Rodríguez plops another corn cake into the piping hot oil of a large pan. As she grabs a set of tongs to flip them one by one, she yells across the kitchen realizing she’s pressed for time. 'We open in 15 minutes!' she shouts over the cumbia music playing in the background. At Casa Lleca, an LGBTQ+ shelter in Mexico City’s Peralvillo neighborhood, a community kitchen was founded two months ago to provide employment opportunities to transgender women — and serve surrounding residents in the area. As González, 36, reaches over for more of the corn cakes to fry, Thalia Trejo busies herself stuffing shredded pork into small masses of dough. While they've only worked together for a short time, González says she runs a kitchen based on mutual respect and communication. 'We know how to talk to each other… and we know how to find a solution. We’re a really united trans community, we’re really understanding,' she said. The community kitchen was born after Casa Lleca received approval from city authorities to open through a social welfare program, as many trans women in the shelter were having trouble finding work. Casa Lleca's founder and human rights activist Victoria Sámano, 30, had brought up the idea to González, who came from a culinary background. 'She (Victoria) saw the opportunity to employ our friends who arrived unhoused and gave them dignified work,' González said. Much of the funding for the kitchen came from the women themselves, who purchased appliances, chairs and tables to create an authentic dining experience. González, a native of Puerto Escondido, Oaxaca, arrived at Casa Lleca seven months ago seeking refuge and a fresh start as a trans woman. She had studied cooking in middle and high school, but then dropped out, and after working in a kitchen in Oaxaca, she left for Mexico City to begin her transition. Once in the capital, she was recommended to a plastic surgeon who gave her faulty breast implants and, after one of them ruptured, he refused to give her a warranty — or operate her again. That's when she said her life began to spiral. 'I acquired lots of bad vices, lots of bad habits, and that took me to a lot of dark places,' she recalled. 'But God always has a plan for us.' When she arrived at Casa Lleca, things began to turn around. Sámano approached her after noticing her active involvement in the shelter and strong work ethic. She thought González could be a good fit to lead the kitchen. Along with her other helpers, González runs a tight crew. All kitchen employees are up by 7 a.m. to bathe and drink coffee. They start cooking at 8:30 a.m. and prepare for customers’ arrival at 1 p.m. For González, the kitchen has become a safe space where she can also use all of her culinary knowledge. 'Now that I found this kitchen, this project and this rhythm of life, I’ve found a way to fulfill my dreams as a young person,' she said. Though the kitchen initially began as an idea to serve and employ their community, as soon as it opened, residents in the surrounding neighborhood started to flock in. Out in front of Casa Lleca, Sámano guides customers into the small dining room set up for the community kitchen. Etched onto a whiteboard hung on a steel door, the menu reads in big black letters, 'chicharrón gorditas, soup, beans and dessert.' A full meal for only 11 pesos (about 50 cents). They cook lunch for up to 150 people a day, including workers like 31-year-old Alan Olivares, who has become a regular. Olivares, a cleaner who works in the nearby Cuauhtemoc neighborhood, has been eating at the kitchen for the past couple of weeks. 'In addition to saving some money, the food is delicious,' he said, adding that he was happy to see the shelter thriving in its new business. 'Mexico needs to have a more open mind, we’re all human and it’s part of our diversity,' he said. Sámano founded Casa Lleca in 2020, right in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic, in an effort to help LGBTQ+ folks and sex workers who were unhoused or at risk of losing their homes. As hotels remained shut down, many had been left without a home or workplace. She said many of the shelters that were opened by the government at that time didn’t know how to address the needs of the LGBTQ+ community. 'When they arrive in these spaces, they are often violated or discriminated against,' said Sámano. 'In part by other residents, but (also) by the staff who don’t know where to place them because of their gender identity.' 'One day, when we leave this place, we’re going to say ‘thank you, Casa Lleca’ for showing me how to live,' said González. 'Thank you for showing me new progress in my life.' Still, many trans individuals like González are not given the space and support to embrace who they are, and are often vulnerable to dangerous situations. Mexico’s trans community continues to face challenges, and transgender individuals continue to be killed, sparking protests and anger. So far this year, 36 trans people have been killed in Mexico, according to an August report from the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights. Some progress has been made. At least 20 Mexican states have passed legislation to protect trans people. Mexico City in July passed the Paola Buenrostro law, named after a trans woman and sex worker killed in 2016, making transfemicides a crime punished by a prison sentence of up to 70 years. Sámano believes adopting laws to support trans individuals is crucial. She points at laws passed recently in Spain and Colombia that cover everything, from access to medical services to labor protections for trans people. '(These laws) address many areas of life for a trans person, and put emphasis on the tools for them to overcome and — in some cases — to survive,' said Sámano. For residents of Casa Lleca, the community kitchen has also helped to raise awareness about who they are and what role they play in the neighborhood. 'Now that they’ve tried the food, and they saw we opened the kitchen with a really nice atmosphere, people started to approach us,' said González. 'How should I refer to you all? They ask… ‘We’re trans women,’ I would tell them. People have been really accepting.' ____ Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america	https://apnews.com/article/mexico-city-trans-women-community-lgbtq-3f5aecc86dd8e5843374d2abe8f73dbf	2024-10-08T19:04:44-07:00	
Climate change boosted Helene's deadly rain and wind and scientists say same is likely for Milton	Human-caused climate change boosted a devastating Hurricane Helene 's rainfall by about 10% and intensified its winds by about 11%, scientists said in a new flash study released just as a strengthening Hurricane Milton threatens the Florida coast less than two weeks later. The warming climate boosted Helene's wind speeds by about 13 miles per hour (20.92 kilometers per hour), and made the high sea temperatures that fueled the storm 200 to 500 times more likely, World Weather Attribution calculated Wednesday from Europe. Ocean temperatures in the Gulf of Mexico were about 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit (2 degrees Celsius) above average, WWA said. 'Hurricane Helene and the storms that were happening in the region anyway have all been amplified by the fact that the air is warmer and can hold more moisture, which meant that the rainfall totals — which, even without climate change, would have been incredibly high given the circumstances — were even higher,' Ben Clarke, a study co-author and a climate researcher at Imperial College London, said in an interview. Milton will likely be similarly juiced, the authors said. The scientists warned that continued burning of fossil fuels will lead to more hurricanes like Helene, with 'unimaginable' floods well inland, not just on coasts. Many of those who died in Helene fell victim to massive inland flooding, rather than high winds. Helene made landfall in Florida with record storm surge 15 feet (4.57 meters) high and catastrophic sustained winds reaching 140 miles per hour (225.31 kilometers per hour), pummeling Georgia, the Carolinas, Tennessee and Virginia. It decimated remote towns throughout the Appalachians, left millions without power, cellular service and supplies and killed over 230 people. Search crews in the days following continued to look for bodies. Helene was the deadliest hurricane to hit the mainland U.S. since Katrina in 2005. Helene dumped more than 40 trillion gallons of rain — an unprecedented amount of water — onto the region, meteorologists estimated. That rainfall would have been much less intense if humans hadn’t warmed the climate, according to WWA, an international scientist collaborative that runs rapid climate attribution studies. 'When you start talking about the volumes involved, when you add even just a few percent on top of that, it makes it even much more destructive,' Clarke said. Hurricanes as intense as Helene were once expected every 130 years on average, but today are about 2.5 times more likely in the region, the scientists calculated. The WWA launched in 2015 to assess the extent which extreme weather events could be attributed to climate change. The organization’s rapid studies aren’t peer-reviewed but use peer-reviewed methods. The team of scientists tested the influence of climate change on Helene by analyzing weather data and climate models including the Imperial College Storm Model, the Climate Shift Index for oceans and the standard WWA approach, which compares an actual event with what might have been expected in a world that hasn't warmed about 1.3 degrees Celsius since pre-industrial times. A separate analysis of Helene last week by Department of Energy Lawrence Berkeley National Lab scientists determined that climate change caused 50% more rainfall in some parts of Georgia and the Carolinas, and that observed rainfall was 'made up to 20 times more likely in these areas because of global warming.' That study was also not peer-reviewed but used a method published in a study about Hurricane Harvey. Kim Cobb, director of the Institute at Brown for Environment and Society, wasn't involved in either study. She said there are uncertainties in exactly how much climate change is supercharging storms like Helene, but 'we know that it’s increasing the power and devastation of these storms.' She said Helene and Milton should serve 'as a wake up call' for emergency preparedness, resilience planning and the increased use of fossil fuels. 'Going forward, additional warming that we know will occur over the next 10 or 20 years will even worsen the statistics of hurricanes,' she said, 'and we will break new records.' Analysis is already indicating climate change made possible the warmed sea temperatures that also rapidly intensified Milton. Clarke said the two massive storms in quick succession illustrates the potential future of climate change if humans don't stop it. 'As we go into the future and our results show this as well, we still have control over what trajectory this goes in as to what risks we face in the future, what costs we pay in the future,' he said. 'That just hinges on how we change our energy systems and how many more fossil fuels we burn.' ___ Read more of AP’s climate coverage at http://www.apnews.com/climate-and-environment ___ Alexa St. John is an Associated Press climate solutions reporter.

Trump has long blasted China's trade practices. His 'God Bless the USA' Bibles were printed there	WASHINGTON (AP) — Thousands of copies of Donald Trump’s 'God Bless the USA' Bible were printed in a country that the former president has repeatedly accused of stealing American jobs and engaging in unfair trade practices — China. Global trade records reviewed by The Associated Press show a printing company in China’s eastern city of Hangzhou shipped close to 120,000 of the Bibles to the United States between early February and late March. The estimated value of the three separate shipments was $342,000, or less than $3 per Bible, according to databases that use customs data to track exports and imports. The minimum price for the Trump-backed Bible is $59.99, putting the potential sales revenue at about $7 million. The Trump Bible’s connection to China, which has not been previously reported, reveals a deep divide between the former president’s harsh anti-China rhetoric and his rush to cash in while campaigning. The Trump campaign did not respond to emails and calls seeking comment. Trump says his Bibles would help America The largest and most recent load of 70,000 copies of Trump’s Bible arrived by container vessel at the Port of Los Angeles on March 28, two days after Trump announced in a video posted on his Truth Social platform that he’d partnered with country singer Lee Greenwood to hawk the Bibles. In the video, Trump blended religion with his campaign message as he urged viewers to buy the Bible, inspired by Greenwood’s ballad, 'God Bless the USA.' The Bible includes copies of the U.S. Constitution, Declaration of Independence, Bill of Rights and Pledge of Allegiance. 'This Bible is a reminder that the biggest thing we have to bring back in America, and to make America great again, is our religion, Trump said. Judeo-Christian values, he added, are 'under attack, perhaps as never before.' Trump didn’t say where the 'God Bless the USA' Bibles are printed, or what they cost; a copy hand-signed by the former president sells for $1,000. Trump also didn't disclose how much he earns per sale. A version of the $59.99 Bible memorializes the July 13 assassination attempt on the former president in Pennsylvania. Trump’s name is on the cover above the phrase, 'The Day God Intervened.' The wording appears to have been stamped on after the Bible was produced. Trump said Saturday his would-be assassin did not succeed 'by the hand of providence and the grace of God.' The Bibles are sold exclusively through a website that states it is not affiliated with any political campaign nor is it owned or controlled by Trump. A photo posted on the website shows Trump sitting at his desk in the Oval Office with Greenwood standing beside him. In another photo, the former president smiles broadly while holding a copy of the Bible. Trump's name and image are licensed The website states that Trump’s name and image are used under a paid license from CIC Ventures, a company Trump reported owning in his most recent financial disclosure. CIC Ventures earned $300,000 in Bible sales royalties, according to the disclosure. It’s unclear what period that covers or how much Trump received in additional payments since the disclosure was released in August. AP received no response to questions sent to an email on the Bible website and to a publicist for Greenwood. For years, Trump has castigated Beijing as an obstacle to America’s economic success, slapping hefty tariffs on Chinese imports while president and threatening even more stringent measures if he’s elected again. He blamed China for the COVID-19 outbreak and recently suggested, without evidence, that thousands of Chinese immigrants are flooding the U.S. to build an 'army' and attack America. But Trump also has an eye on his personal finances. Pitching Bibles is one of a dizzying number of for-profit ventures he’s launched or promoted, including diamond-encrusted watches, sneakers, photo books, cryptocurrency and digital trading cards. The web of enterprises has stoked conflict of interest concerns. Selling products at prices that exceed their value may be considered a campaign contribution, said Claire Finkelstein, founder of the nonpartisan Center for Ethics and the Rule of Law and a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania. 'You have to assume that everything that the individual does is being done as a candidate and so that any money that flows through to him benefits him as a candidate,' Finkelstein said. 'Suppose Vladimir Putin were to buy a Trump watch. Is that a campaign finance violation? I would think so.' Selling Bibles, she added, 'strikes me as a profoundly problematic mixing of religion and state.' Potential conflicts of interest As president, Trump would be in a position to influence policies and markets to benefit businesses in which he and his family have financial stakes. While president, his administration exempted Bibles and other religious texts from tariffs imposed on billions of dollars of Chinese goods. There’s a potentially lucrative opportunity for Trump to sell 55,000 of the 'God Bless the USA' Bibles to Oklahoma after the state’s top education official ordered public schools to incorporate Scripture into lessons for grades 5 through 12. Oklahoma plans to spend $3 million on Bibles that initially matched Trump’s edition: a King James Version that contains the U.S. founding documents. The request was revised Monday to allow the U.S. historical documents to be bound with the Bible or provided separately. Oklahoma’s Department of Education did not answer AP’s questions about whether the Bibles must be printed in the United States or if any department officials have discussed the proposal with Trump or his representatives. 'There are hundreds of Bible publishers and we expect a robust competition for this proposal,' said department spokesman Dan Isett. Chinese printing company confirms shipments China is one of the world’s leading producers of Bibles, so it’s not unusual for the Trump-endorsed version to be printed there. The first delivery of Trump Bibles was labeled 'God Bless USA,' according to the information from the Panjiva and Import Genius databases. The other two were described as 'Bibles.' All the books were shipped by New Ade Cultural Media, a printing company in Hangzhou that describes itself as a 'custom Bible book manufacturer.' They were sent to Freedom Park Design, a company in Alabama that databases identified as the importer of the Bibles. Tammy Tang, a sales representative for New Ade, told AP all three shipments were 'God Bless the USA' Bibles. She said New Ade received the orders via the WhatsApp messaging service and confirmed they were from Freedom Park Design. The books were printed on presses near the company’s Hangzhou office, she said. Tang did not disclose the sales price or other details, citing customer confidentiality. 'They didn’t come to meet us,' Tang said by telephone. 'We just do the production.' She declined further comment and referred interview requests to Freedom Park Design. Freedom Park Design was incorporated in Florida on March 1, according to business registration records. An aspiring country singer named Jared Ashley is the company’s president. He also co-founded 16 Creative, a digital marketing firm that uses the same Gulf Shores address and processes online orders for branded merchandise sold by entertainers and authors. Ashley hung up on a reporter who called to ask about the Bibles. Greenwood is a client of 16 Creative, according to the firm’s website. He launched the American-flag emblazoned Bible in 2021. His song, 'God Bless the USA,' was released 40 years ago and is a staple at Trump rallies. Greenwood has also appeared at the former president’s campaign events. Critics call Trump Bible a ‘toxic mix’ The King James Version used in the Trump Bible is in the public domain. Greenwood had initially planned to use the best-selling New International Version licensed in North America by HarperCollins Christian Publishing. But the publisher abandoned the arrangement amid pressure from religious scholars and authors who denounced the merger of Scripture and government documents as a 'toxic mix' that would fuel Christian nationalism sentiments in evangelical churches. Christian nationalism is a movement that fuses American and Christian values, symbols and identity and seeks to privilege Christianity in public life. Christian nationalists are likely to believe the U.S. Constitution was inspired by God and that the federal government should declare the U.S. a Christian nation. Other critics called the Trump Bible blasphemous. 'Taking what has long been understood as a global message religiously and stamping it with the flag of one nation is the type of thing that for centuries theologians would call heresy,' said Brian Kaylor, a Baptist minister and president of the Christian media company Word&amp;Way. ‘Love of money’ Tim Wildsmith, a Baptist minister who reviews Bibles on his YouTube channel, said he quickly noticed the signs of a cheaply made book when his 'God Bless the USA' Bible arrived wrapped in plastic inside a padded mailer. It had a faux leather cover, and words were jammed together on the pages, making it hard to read. He also found sticky pages that ripped when pulled apart, and there was no copyright page or information about who printed the Bible, or where. 'I was shocked by how poor the quality of it was,' Wildsmith said. 'It says to me that it’s more about the love of money than it is the love of our country.' ___ Kang reported from Beijing.

Mozambique votes for president and the ruling party could extend its 49 years in power	MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) — Mozambique is voting for a new president on Wednesday in an election that is expected to extend the ruling party's 49 years in power since the southern African nation gained independence from Portugal in 1975. Daniel Chapo, 47, is the candidate for the ruling Front for the Liberation of Mozambique, or Frelimo, seeking to succeed President Filipe Nyusi, who has served a maximum two terms. Analysts say the strongest challenge to Chapo and Frelimo's dominance will likely come from 50-year-old independent Venancio Mondlane. People also will vote for the makeup of Parliament and for provincial governors in a country of some 33 million people that went through a bloody, 15-year civil war that ended in 1992, and more recently has been shaken by an ongoing violent jihadist insurgency in the north. Ending that insurgency and bringing stability to Cabo Delgado province — where 1.3 million fled their homes and more than half remain displaced — is a pledge by both leading candidates, while poverty, youth unemployment and government corruption are top issues for voters. 'I am still selling biscuits at a vegetable market here in Maputo to take care of my two children,' said 35-year-old Felicidade Simao. 'My husband is unemployed and we are struggling. I want the best for my children and the winner of this election must make the dream of a better life in the future.' Polls opened at 7 a.m. local time and vote-counting is due to start right after polls close in the one-day election. Preliminary results from some areas are expected from Thursday, and the full results must be delivered to the Constitutional Council within 15 days of polls closing to be validated and formally declared. Around 17 million people are registered to vote. The credibility of the election will be under scrutiny, with the leftist Frelimo party accused of ballot-stuffing and falsifying results in previous votes, including last year's local elections, where it was declared the winner in 64 out of 65 municipalities. Frelimo has consistently denied the accusations of election tampering. Teams of regional and international election observers are in Mozambique, including from the European Union. Frelimo effectively established a one-party state following independence and fought a civil war against the Mozambique National Resistance, or Renamo, for a decade and a half. The country, where Portuguese remains the official language, held its first elections in 1994, two years after a peace agreement. Renamo is also contesting this election, with party leader Ossufo Momade, a military commander in the civil war, its candidate for president. The former rebel group has seen its popularity wane, while the peace between Frelimo and Renamo has been fragile, with an outbreak of more fighting in 2013. Momade and outgoing leader Nyusi signed another peace deal in 2019. But tensions remain, especially between the two political parties that were once at war with each other. The independent Mondlane, who broke away from Renamo, has focused his campaign on young Mozambicans frustrated with poverty and unemployment. The country boasts a long coastline of picturesque beaches on the Indian Ocean, but that vulnerable area has been battered by cyclones in recent years. A drought this year in the southern African region has left more than a million Mozambicans impacted by hunger. Meanwhile, it emerged in 2016 that government officials and others had embezzled more than $2 billion in foreign loans that were kept secret, sending the economy into a crisis from which it is still recovering. 'All Mozambicans have high hopes from the new president,' said 69-year-old Baptista Antonio, who was one of the first to vote at an elementary school in the capital, Maputo, a port city on the east coast of Africa. 'I was born during the colonial era and saw many transformations of the country from wars to development and all I can say is it’s a work in progress. There are many challenges ahead.' Mondlane was aligned with a coalition of opposition parties, but they were barred from contesting the election, which raised accusations against Frelimo of attempting to control the election. Mondlane is now supported by a new party called Podemos, which means 'we can' in Portuguese. While Mondlane, a former banker, represents a fresh challenge to Frelimo, most analysts expect the ruling party to remain in power. It was declared the winner with more than 70% of the vote in national elections five years ago. The Pangea risk company, which provides security and investment advice on developing countries, said Chapo's election has been 'carefully stage managed' by Frelimo. Chapo worked as a radio announcer and television presenter before becoming a law professor. He was the governor of southern Inhambane province — Mozambique's flagship tourism region — but was a surprise winner of an internal party vote in May to become Frelimo's presidential candidate. Chapo would be Mozambique's first leader born after independence if he wins. ___ AP Africa news: https://apnews.com/hub/africa	https://apnews.com/article/mozambique-election-president-frelimo-chapo-bdcef382aa0462bfdbe8d89ca284b241	2024-10-08T15:31:55-07:00	
Military board substantiates misconduct but declines to fire Marine who adopted Afghan orphan	CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) — A U.S. Marine whose adoption of an Afghan war orphan has spurred a yearslong legal battle and raised alarms at the highest levels of government will remain on active duty. A three-member panel of Marines said Tuesday that while Maj. Joshua Mast acted in a way unbecoming of an officer in his zealous quest to bring home the baby girl, it did not warrant his separation from the military. Lawyers for the Marine Corps argued Mast abused his position, disregarded orders of his superiors and mishandled classified information in his fight over the child who was found orphaned on the battlefield in rural Afghanistan in 2019. The board found that the government provided enough evidence to substantiate some of the bases for misconduct, including misuse of a government computer. Mast was cleared of allegations he made false official statements and failed to obey an order or regulation. Mast and his wife, Stephanie, then lived in rural Fluvanna County, Virginia. They persuaded a judge there to grant them an adoption of the child, even though she remained in Afghanistan as the government there tracked down her extended family and reunited her with them. Mast helped the family flee Afghanistan after the Taliban took over in 2021. Once in the U.S., Mast used the adoption papers to get the federal government to take the child from her Afghan relatives and give her to him. She has remained with his family ever since. A five-day board of inquiry hearing held partially behind closed doors at the Marine Forces Special Operations Command at Camp Lejeune was administrative, not criminal, and intended to determine whether Mast was fit to remain in the military. The worst outcome Mast might have faced was an other-than-honorable discharge. Mast, 41, who now lives in Hampstead, North Carolina, denied the allegations against him, insisting he never disobeyed orders but was encouraged by his supervisors, and was simply upholding the code of the Marine Corps by working tirelessly to ensure the girl was safe. At the front of the room, he set up poster-sized photos of the child as a baby at Afghanistan’s Bagram Airfield and as a smiling toddler in North Carolina. But because the board substantiated misconduct, a report will be entered into Mast's file, which could affect promotions and assignments, the Marines said Tuesday. The board’s report will be sent up the ladder to the Secretary of the Navy, who will close the case against Mast. The child’s fate, however, remains in limbo. The Afghan couple who raised the child for 18 months in Afghanistan is seeking to have Mast’s adoption of her undone. The Department of Justice has intervened and contended that Mast lied to the Virginia court and federal officials to justify taking the girl, and his actions threaten America’s standing around the world. The State Department said in a statement Tuesday that its decision to work with the Afghan government and International Committee of the Red Cross to reunite the child with her Afghan relatives 'was consistent with international law and U.S. policy to take appropriate steps to facilitate the reunion of families separated during armed conflict.' The department said it has insisted that Virginia courts return the child to the Afghan family. The Virginia Court of Appeals ruled earlier this year that the adoption should have never been granted. The case is stalled at the state Supreme Court. Lawyers for the Afghan couple did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Much of the government’s case in the hearing was held in secret because lawyers were presenting classified information. Everyone present in the nondescript conference room was dressed identically in camouflage. And Mast chose to make an unsworn statement in a closed session, which meant he was not subject to cross-examination. But his wife, Stephanie, testified publicly, offering rare insight into the couple’s motivation for working so vigorously to bring the child into their home. The Masts have long declined to talk to The Associated Press about their actions and the Virginia court file remains sealed. The Masts, as well as the Afghan couple, are now barred from speaking to the media about the state court case. Stephanie Mast wept as she described her husband’s decision to work to bring the girl back to the United States as exemplary of his commitment to Marine Corps values. 'It was very much an American response,' she said. 'We value human life. As Marines, you serve and protect.' The deciding panel of two lieutenant colonels and a colonel was allowed to ask questions, and one asked Stephanie Mast why she and her husband continued to try to adopt the girl even after she had been reunited with relatives in Afghanistan. They noted that multiple high-ranking officials, including then-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and a federal judge, told them to stop. When she responded that getting the child to the United States was their highest priority, the board asked whether the assumption that a child would be better off in the U.S. rather than Afghanistan was a product of Western bias. 'They have a survival mentality,' she said of Afghans. 'We believe in life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. And we wanted her to have that.' ___ Galofaro reported from Louisville, Kentucky, and Mendoza from San Francisco.

This camp provides a safe space for kids to learn and play after Hurricane Helene	BREVARD, N.C. (AP) — The Weissmans still have much to do to recover from Hurricane Helene flooding their home last month. They need to chase down private insurance claims and fill out applications for the Small Business Administration and the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Because the storm killed power to western North Carolina, they worry about mold. The storm also wrecked Max Weissman's office, leaving the 45-year-old therapist with nowhere to meet patients. And it leveled the building that housed the tea company where his wife, Aviva Weissman, worked. But the Weissmans haven’t had time to deal with any of that because like all parents their utmost priority is their children. Schools have been closed since the storm and their son Avi, 11, helped Max bleach the basement last week. Aviva briefly took their 7-year-old daughter Reyna to stay with family in South Carolina before returning home. Like all children, both now need a routine, and to play. On Monday morning, Weissman took Avi and Reyna to a free, pop-up day camp where dozens of kids were making bracelets, drawing, and playing oversized games of Jenga and Connect Four in a large playroom. Outside, girls bounced through a hopscotch court as a fierce basketball game heated up behind them. The camp is hosted by the the L.A.-based nonprofit Project:Camp. As storms become more frequent and severe, the organization is increasingly traveling to disaster-affected communities to set up spaces where kids can process the disruption and devastation of a disaster while their parents start the long recovery process. 'I feel pretty guilty telling them all the time, ‘I’ve never dealt with this,’' said Weissman. '‘This is the first time we’re dealing with a pandemic. This is the first time we’re dealing with a flood.’ And I feel like it just keeps on.' He lingered outside the playroom, anxiously peering through the window to check on the kids as he responded to messages from his patients. The Brevard camp opened Monday and will run until Friday. Schools here are expected to open next week. Project:Camp is talking with nearby communities about where to set up next. Schools can’t reopen until water is restored. For some counties, it’s still unclear when that can happen. As of Tuesday, 15 school districts and the majority of the 21 charter schools in the region were closed, according to the state’s Department of Public Instruction. Three districts are set to resume classes Wednesday, with more to follow next week. With Hurricane Milton approaching Florida, Project:Camp was also preparing for the possibility it would be needed there, too. 'It’s always been the case that there’s a lack of this,' said Dr. Irwin Redlener, founding director of the National Center for Disaster Preparedness at Columbia University and an adjunct professor of pediatrics at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. 'As quickly as possible, we have to begin reestablishing some level of post-disaster normalcy for children ... The necessity for play should not be understated,' he said. Project:Camp volunteers are trained in trauma recovery. Kids participate in gratitude circles, refocusing them on positive thoughts, and do mental and emotional checks, or 'Me' checks, where they rate how they feel and learn to assess their own wellbeing. They also just have fun. 'Camp is an inherently therapeutic space for kids,' said Henry Meier, director of external affairs at the organization and leader of the Brevard pop-up. 'They process through play, they process with their peers. So just having a space that they recognize, that they feel safe and comfortable in, is the best environment for them right now.' On Tuesday morning, the Weissmans returned to Project:Camp. Max looked more relaxed. He’d gotten some things done, and the power was supposed to return that day. When he'd picked up the kids the evening before, Reyna told him it was the 'best camp ever.' Avi said it was ok, but that was enough for Max. 'In 11-year-old language,' he said. 'That means it was fantastic.' ___ This story has been updated to correct that a majority of the charter schools in the western North Carolina region were closed as of Tuesday, not all. ___ Associated Press writer Gary D.

Musk's X to be reinstated in Brazil after complying with Supreme Court demands	SAO PAULO (AP) — The Brazilian Supreme Court's Justice Alexandre de Moraes on Tuesday authorized the restoration of social media platform X´s service in Brazil, over a month after its nationwide shutdown, according to a court document that was made public. Elon Musk’s X was blocked on Aug. 30 in the highly online country of 213 million people — and one of X’s biggest markets, with estimates of its user base ranging from 20 to 40 million. De Moraes ordered the shutdown after a monthslong dispute with Musk over free speech, far-right accounts and misinformation. Musk had disparaged de Moraes, calling him an authoritarian and a censor, even though his rulings, including X’s suspension, were repeatedly upheld by his peers. Despite Musk's public bravado, X ultimately complied with all of de Moraes' demands. They included blocking certain accounts from the platform, paying outstanding fines and naming a legal representative in the country. Failure to do the latter had triggered the suspension. 'The resumption of (X)’s activities on national territory was conditioned, solely, on full compliance with Brazilian laws and absolute observance of the Judiciary's decisions, out of respect for national sovereignty,' de Moraes said in the court document. 'X is proud to return to Brazil,' the company said in a statement posted on its Global Government Affairs account. 'Giving tens of millions of Brazilians access to our indispensable platform was paramount throughout this entire process. We will continue to defend freedom of speech, within the boundaries of the law, everywhere we operate.' Just two days before the ban, on Aug. 28, X said it was removing all its remaining staff in Brazil 'effective immediately,' saying de Moraes had threatened with arrest its legal representative in the country, Rachel de Oliveira Villa Nova Conceição, if X did not comply with orders to block accounts. Brazilian law requires foreign companies to have a local legal representative to receive notifications of court decisions and swiftly take any requisite action — particularly, in X’s case, the takedown of accounts. Conceição was first named X’s legal representative in April and resigned four months later. The company named her to the same job on Sept. 20, according to the public filing with the Sao Paulo commercial registry. In an apparent effort to shield Conceição from potential violations by X — and risking arrest — a clause has been written into Conceição’s new representation agreement that she must follow Brazilian law and court decisions, and that any legal responsibility she assumes on X’s behalf requires prior instruction from the company in writing, according to the company’s filing. Conceição works for BR4Business, a business services firm. Its two-page website provides no insight into its operations or staff. 'Something great is on its way,' the top of the site’s main page reads in English. Its other page is an extensive privacy policy. At three of its listed Sao Paulo offices, receptionists told the AP that the company’s offices are empty and employees work remotely. Neither Conceição nor BR4Business returned multiple phone calls and emails from the AP. There is nothing illegal or suspect about using a company like BR4Business for legal representation, but it shows that X is doing the bare minimum to operate in the country, said Fabio de Sa e Silva, a lawyer and associate professor of International and Brazilian Studies at the University of Oklahoma. 'It doesn’t demonstrate an intention to truly engage with the country. Take Meta, for example, and Google. They have an office, a government relations department, precisely to interact with public authorities and discuss Brazil’s regulatory policies concerning their businesses,' Silva added. Indeed, it is rare for an established, influential company such as X to have only a legal representative, said Carlos Affonso Souza, a lawyer and director of the Institute for Technology and Society, a Rio-based think tank. And that could be problematic going forward. 'The concern now is what comes next and how X, once back in operation, will manage to meet the demands of the market and local authorities without creating new tensions,' he said. Some of Brazilian X’s users have migrated to other platforms, such as Meta’s Threads and, primarily, Bluesky. It’s unclear how many of them will return to X. In a statement to the AP, Bluesky reported that it now has 10.6 million users and continues to see strong growth in Brazil. Bluesky has appointed a legal representative in the South American country. Brazil was not the first country to ban X — far from it — but such a drastic step has generally been limited to authoritarian regimes. The platform and its former incarnation, Twitter, have been banned in Russia, China, Iran, Myanmar, North Korea, Venezuela and Turkmenistan. Other countries, such as Pakistan, Turkey and Egypt, have also temporarily suspended X before, usually to quell dissent and unrest. X’s dustup with Brazil has some parallels to the company’s dealings with the Indian government three years ago, back when it was still called Twitter and before Musk purchased it for $44 billion. In 2021, India threatened to arrest employees of Twitter (as well as Meta’s Facebook and WhatsApp), for not complying with the government’s requests to take down posts related to farmers’ protests that rocked the country. Musk’s decision to reverse course in Brazil after publicly criticizing de Moraes isn’t surprising, said Matteo Ceurvels, research firm Emarketer’s analyst for Latin America and Spain. 'The move was pragmatic, likely driven by the economic consequences of losing access to millions of users in its third-largest market worldwide, along with the millions of dollars in associated advertising revenue,' Ceurvels said. 'Although X may not be a top priority for most advertisers in Brazil, the platform needs them more than they need it.' ___ Ortutay reported from San Francisco	https://apnews.com/article/brazil-x-elon-musk-supreme-court-de-moraes-e32c4b4171e78cbe8994f53713a922f7	2024-10-08T11:33:12-07:00	
As Israel plots to strike Iran, its choices range from symbolic to severe	JERUSALEM (AP) — Israel has promised to retaliate for Iran’s massive missile attack last week. How it does so involves great risk, and could have major repercussions for the archenemies, the Middle East and the world. Israel's options range from symbolic strikes on military targets to crippling attacks on Iran's vital oil industry or its secretive and heavily fortified nuclear program. The intensity and timing of any retaliatory strike was expected to top the agenda of a planned meeting this week at the Pentagon between Israel’s defense minister and his U.S. counterpart. But late Tuesday, the Pentagon said the meeting was abruptly postponed. In a sign of possible disagreement over the right approach, President Joe Biden has already urged Israel not to hit Iran's nuclear program and discouraged it from hitting the oil industry. The Associated Press spoke to two former Israeli prime ministers and other experts to explore Israel’s options. There is broad consensus that Israel must strike back, but deep disagreement over the best way to do so. 'The question is not whether Israel will retaliate or respond,' former Prime Minister Ehud Olmert told AP. 'The question is which way.' Why is Israel threatening Iran? Israel and Iran have been involved in a bitter shadow war for years — primarily through Israel’s battles against Iranian-backed militant groups across the region. Israel also has been suspected of killing Iranian nuclear scientists and carrying out attacks on Iranian nuclear facilities, but it rarely acknowledges involvement. Direct clashes have been rare. But things changed after Hamas attacked Israel from the Gaza Strip on Oct. 7, 2023, and Hezbollah began firing rockets at Israel the following day. Both groups receive support from Iran. In April, Iran fired over 300 drones and missiles toward Israel after accusing it of killing two Iranian generals in a diplomatic compound in Syria. Nearly all of the missiles malfunctioned or were intercepted, and Israel responded with a limited strike that signaled it did not want any further escalation. After last week’s Iranian attack, Israel signaled its next response would be different. Iran said the barrage of at least 180 ballistic missiles was to avenge a series of Israeli strikes against its close allies, Hamas and Hezbollah, including the assassination of the group’s longtime leader. Although the missiles caused little damage or casualties, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Iran had made a 'big mistake and it will pay for it.' Members of his hard-line coalition have called for a harsh response. What options does Israel have? Israel has a broad range of choices of targets – from Iranian government buildings and military bases to sensitive oil installations to heavily fortified nuclear facilities hidden deep below ground. Israel accuses Iran of developing nuclear weapons — a charge Iran denies. Striking anywhere in Iran is a logistical challenge for Israel. Warplanes would need to fly over 1,500 kilometers (about 1,000 miles) to their target, requiring a complicated midair refueling operation, potentially over hostile skies. Any strike would also mean confronting Iran’s Russian-made air-defense systems. 'Remember that Iran is 1,500, 1,600 kilometers (about 1,000 miles) away from Israel, and you have countries in between — Jordan, Iraq, Saudi Arabia. Some are friends. Some are foes,' said Yoel Guzansky, a senior researcher at the Institute for National Security Studies in Tel Aviv and a former adviser on Iranian affairs on Israel's National Security Council. 'You don’t want to embarrass your friends. You don’t want to get hostile fire from other countries,' he said. Olmert, who served as prime minister from 2006 to 2009, said Israel is more than capable of coping with these challenges. 'We have the capabilities,' he said. 'I’m not certain it would be wise and responsible to expose them.' Even if Israel has the means, there are diplomatic considerations. A strike on the oil sector, Iran’s economic backbone, or on the nuclear program would almost certainly guarantee an Iranian response and raise the risk of further escalation. Such strikes could rattle global oil markets and shake the U.S. economy on the eve of a presidential election. They also could risk Iranian retaliation not only against Israel, but against American troops stationed in the region or Gulf Arab countries aligned with the West. 'Unlike Lebanon and Gaza, every Israeli attack on Iran has international and global repercussions,' said Menahem Merhavy, an Iran expert at Hebrew University in Jerusalem. So how will Israel respond? Former leaders are divided on what path Israel should choose. Olmert said a strike on multiple military targets, spread across Iran’s vast territory, would be more than enough to send a message. The goal, he said, is to show that Israel can strike anywhere and anytime. 'That’s precisely what deterrence is all about,' he said. Olmert said hitting Iran’s oil sector would be an unnecessary escalation that invites a response, and that striking the nuclear program is not worth the risk. Not only would it trigger Iranian retaliation, but the odds of success are uncertain, he said. 'Trying to attack the nuclear program will be a mistake,' he said. Another former prime minister, Yair Lapid, believes Israel should strike Iran’s oil industry infrastructure. 'That is the most painful target for the Iranian regime,' Lapid, who served as premier in 2022, said in a written response to a question from The Associated Press. 'Iran’s ballistic missile attack against Israel must be met with a forceful response,' he said, adding that Iran must understand 'there is a high cost to its regional aggression.' In an interview with the Israeli news site Ynet, Lapid said a strike on Iran’s nuclear facilities should only be done as part of an international coalition in coordination with the United States. Lapid’s predecessor as prime minister and former governing partner, Naftali Bennett, takes an even tougher line, saying now is the time for Israel to bomb the Iranian nuclear project. Bennett said in a video posted on social media Tuesday that Iran and its allies have been weakened, and that Israel has a rare chance to deliver a decisive blow to Iran’s leadership, economy and nuclear program. 'We must not settle for Iranian military bases or noisy-yet-meaningless actions that are meant only to deliver a message,' Bennett said. 'The time for messages is over.' Olmert, however, said he hopes cooler heads will prevail. 'What do we want to achieve and how far do we want to go and how arrogant do we want to be?' he said. His advice: 'Try to be smart.' ___ Associated Press reporters Julia Frankel, Melanie Lidman and Jon Gambrell in Jerusalem, contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-iran-nuclear-hezbollah-hamas-missile-retaliation-0184e79d4ee5ec012960e0b24ddae102	2024-10-08T10:49:09-07:00	
Dominican Republic starts mass deportations of Haitians and expels nearly 11,000 in a week	SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) — The Dominican Republic said Tuesday it has deported or repatriated nearly 11,000 Haitians in the past week, fulfilling a pledge to do so weekly as neighboring Haiti scrambles to handle the influx while besieged by gang violence and poverty. The Dominican government announced last week that it would deport up to 10,000 Haitians a week, citing an 'excess' of immigrants as relations between the countries that share the island of Hispaniola continue to sour. These are the largest such deportations in recent history there. The announcement prompted Haitian officials to request an emergency meeting at the Organization of American States, where Haitian permanent representative Gandy Thomas called the deportations 'a strategy of ethnic cleansing' and 'a discriminatory campaign against Haitians due to their nationality and color of their skin.' Thomas called for dialogue and a 'respectful solution,' saying the deportations will 'worsen the fragility of our infrastructure while the deportees will arrive with no support, no resources and no ties to their community.' At least half a million Haitians live in the Dominican Republic, according to human rights groups. Activists say the deportations put the lives of thousands at risk. A U.N.-backed mission led by Kenyan police that began earlier this year to try to quell gang violence is facing a lack of funds and personnel. 'There are a great number of armed groups that are just like birds of prey waiting to swoop down and take advantage of these people,' said Sam Guillaume with Haiti’s Support Group for Returnees and Refugees. Guillaume accused Dominican authorities of 'hunting down' Haitians, asserting that some are extorted, raped or held in jail with no water or food and subjected to beatings or tear gas 'if they dare say boo.' Radhafil Rodríguez, adviser to the OAS' Dominican Republic mission, said the government rejected accusations of mistreatment and would take any complaint 'very seriously' and investigate it. He said Haiti's crisis is disproportionately affecting the Dominican Republic, asserting that migrants are overwhelming schools, clinics and hospitals. Rodríguez said his country stands in solidarity with the people of Haiti during their crisis but added that no one can expect it to halt deportations. Both Rodríguez and Thomas called for dialogue as officials in Haiti urgently met to talk about the deportations and established a working group to handle the influx of migrants and their needs. 'The forced and mass deportation of our Haitian compatriots from the Dominican Republic is a violation of the fundamental principles of human dignity,' Haitian Prime Minister Garry Conille wrote on social media platform X on Tuesday. The mass deportations have led to an increase in abandoned children across the Dominican Republic, warned activist William Charpentier, coordinator for the Dominican-based National Coalition for Migrations and Refugees. 'They take their parents, or one of the parents, and leave the children behind, even while they’re in school,' he said. Charpentier called the deportations 'a type of persecution against Black people, against everything they presume to be Haitian.' He said even people with legal documents are being detained and deported, a practice that activists say has occurred in previous years. Allegations of extortion have surged. Ocicle Batista, a 45-year-old Haitian migrant who sells avocados in the capital, Santo Domingo, accused soldiers of demanding $230 to $330 to avoid deportations 'even when they have their papers in hand,' she said of migrants. 'We come here to work,' she said. Luis Rafael Lee Ballester, the Dominican Republic’s migration director, said human rights are being respected and that a proportional use of force is used when migrants are arrested. He said those with documents were detained because they did not have 'reliable identification' to justify their presence in the country. From Oct. 1-7, 7,591 people were deported and 3,323 repatriated, according to the government, which said all were Haitian. ___ Coto reported from San Juan, Puerto Rico.	https://apnews.com/article/dominican-republic-deportations-haiti-0e46f10ca79a34d05f9ff0cf5e00a971	2024-10-08T10:24:45-07:00	
Kenya’s parliament overwhelmingly votes to impeach the country's deputy president	NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) — Kenya's lawmakers approved a motion Tuesday to impeach the country's deputy president, following daylong discussions and after Rigathi Gachagua appeared in parliament to defend himself against several charges, including allegations that he supported anti-government protests in June. The motion was approved by a 281-44 vote in favor of impeachment, well above the 117 votes constitutionally required. The motion now goes to the parliament’s upper house, which will debate the matter and also hold a vote. For impeachment to be final, it will need the additional backing of two thirds of senators in the upper house. It's not clear when that vote will take place. Under Kenya's constitution, the removal from office is automatic if approved by both chambers, though Gachagua can challenge the action in court — something he has said he would do. The deputy president is also accused of being involved in corruption and other irregularities. He denies all the charges against him. The debate surrounding his fate has extended beyond parliament — supporters and opponents of the motion clashed last week in public forums after the ruling alliance brought the motion before parliament. In his speech, Gachagua declared that he was 'undergoing a political process' and asked legislators to make their decision 'without intimidation and coercion.' On Monday, the deputy president had said he believed the motion had the president’s blessings. President William Ruto has yet to publicly comment about the impeachment but is on record in the earlier days of his presidency saying he would not publicly humiliate his deputy, alluding to the troubled relationship he had with his predecessor, Uhuru Kenyatta, during their second term in office. On Sunday during a prayer meeting at his residence, Gachagua implored Ruto, legislators and Kenyans to forgive him for any wrongdoing during his tenure. He clarified that statement on Monday, saying it was not an admission of guilt and dismissed rumors that he would resign. Gachagua told lawmakers Tuesday that some of the properties listed in the impeachment motion as his belonged to his late brother. He also defended renovation expenditures for his official residence, saying it was in a state of disrepair and needed to be 'dignified.'	https://apnews.com/article/kenya-deputy-president-impeached-02d46fc2c8470549520620ce14a1e9b9	2024-10-08T10:24:40-07:00	
Survivors of massacre in small Haitian town where 70 died point finger at government	PONT-SONDÉ, Haiti (AP) — Angry whispers have broken the heavy silence that fell over Pont-Sondé just days after a vicious gang attack left more than 70 dead, marking one of Haiti’s biggest massacres in recent history. The whispering came from a handful of people that remained in the small town in central Haiti after Thursday's assault. They huddled by the roadside, stood under leafy trees or milled around the lone cemetery. All of them blamed the government for the assault by the Gran Grif gang, created after a former legislator armed young men nearly a decade ago to secure his election and control of the area. 'I have to thank the government, because the gangs are killing people and kids cannot go to school,' said Lunoir Jean Chavanne, the town’s morgue driver. He lost three relatives, including a 14-year-old boy and a beloved uncle who was a priest of the Vodou religion. Like others, Chavanne questioned why authorities didn’t do anything to stop the attack by Gran Grif, considered one of Haiti’s cruelest gangs. 'They’ve been announcing that they were coming a number of times on social media,' he said. A tragic message Pont-Sondé was once a bustling community with a thriving marketplace located near the mighty Artibonite River, Haiti’s longest. It’s the same river that gang members used to their advantage the night of the attack, plying its rich brown waters with canoes so as not to alert anyone about their presence. They killed babies, older people and entire families. Among the victims was the nephew of 58-year-old Elvens François, who was preparing to bury him on Tuesday. He recalled how he was carrying a plastic bag with his belongings as he prepared to flee his house when three men gripping automatic weapons surrounded him. One held François from the back while the other two gang members faced him. 'They attacked me, cornered me and took everything from me,' he said, tears in his eyes. He doesn’t know why he was spared. François’ nephew will be buried near a mass grave at Pont-Sondé’s lone cemetery, where an 83-year-old caretaker serves as the lone witness to most burials since the attack, with the relatives of victims either dead or having joined the more than 6,200 people who fled to the nearby coastal city of Saint-Marc for safety. On Tuesday, the caretaker pointed to the recent graves he dug, noting none of their relatives were able to attend the burials. They are the most recent victims of a surge of gang violence to hit the Artibonite region in recent years, although the magnitude of Thursday’s attack shocked many. 'This is the most terrifying massacre in decades in Haiti,' said Romain Le Cour, senior expert on Haiti for the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime. 'It’s definitely a show of force.' Such massacres were limited to the capital of Port-au-Prince, of which 80% is controlled by gangs and is now being patrolled by Kenyan police leading a U.N.-backed mission struggling with a lack of funds and personnel. The attack poses additional challenges to authorities already struggling with gang violence in the capital, Le Cour said. 'It’s a very, very tragic message and challenge sent to the authorities and the international community,' he said. ‘I’m left with nothing' Gone is the chatter of street vendors and the rumbling of small, colorful buses known as tap-taps crowded with passengers. The only noises now are the angry whispering, the shovel hitting the dirt at the cemetery and the occasional motorcycle carrying a coffin. The handful of people who stayed behind now carry machetes, walking past walls pocked with bullet holes and floors smeared with blood. 'Young men in the area were fighting back,' Chavanne said, referring to a local self-defense group known as 'The Coalition' that was trying to keep the Gran Grif gang at bay. 'This is how we were able to resist.' But it was those very efforts that sparked the attack, according to Haiti’s National Human Rights Defense Network. The human rights group said in a report that Gran Grif was angry that the self-defense group was trying to limit gang activity and prevent it from profiting off a makeshift road toll it had recently established nearby. 'The night that they invaded, there was nothing that they were able to do,' Chavanne said of the self-defense group. The leader of Gran Grif, Luckson Elan, was recently sanctioned by the U.N. Security Council and the U.S. government. Also sanctioned was Prophane Victor, the former legislator that the U.N. accused of arming young men in the Artibonite region. Chavanne and others questioned what police plan to do now. 'Four days later, the gang is still threatening people on social media, saying that they’re coming back to finish them,' he said. 'And now, I’m left with nothing in my hands, just dead family members.' ___ Dánica Coto reported from San Juan, Puerto Rico.

Restorers complete work on the canopy covering St. Peter's main altar ahead of the 2025 Jubilee	VATICAN CITY (AP) — Restorers put the finishing touches Tuesday on the ornate canopy covering the main altar in St. Peter’s Basilica, which has been covered in scaffolding for months during the first renovation of Baroque architect and sculptor Gian Lorenzo Bernini’s masterpiece in more than 250 years. Journalists were allowed a bird’s eye view of the 29-meter canopy, or baldachin, on Tuesday, climbing the scaffolding to observe where workers have buffed the intricate surface of the bronze and wood canopy. During the renovation, workers for the Fabbrica di San Pietro, which maintains the basilica, discovered bits of the baldachin’s history, including a forgotten bit of sandwich and nuts that could be over 200 years old, a 17th Century shopping list including tomatoes and bread, and most telling: the sole of a child’s shoe. The sole explains the tradition of using children 'suspended on a rope and go and clean the most difficult areas,' said engineer Alberto Capitanucci. The making of the scaffolding was key to the success of the work, as it needed to allow workers access 'to every point of the canopy with reasonable ease,' he said. 'The wood has proven to be in excellent condition, which is the element that we expected to be the most delicate,’’ he said. When the scaffolding is removed on Oct. 27, Capitanucci said visitors can expect to be dazzled by the sheen of restored gold plate, and the leather effect that was achieved through the restoration of the bronze. The work was completed with an eye on the upcoming Jubilee year, which Pope Francis will inaugurate in December. The structure, which is positioned over the basilica’s main altar to provide a ceremonial covering for the tomb of St. Peter underneath, was completed from the 1620s to 1630s on Pope Urban VIII commission of Baroque architect and sculptor Gian Lorenzo Bernini. It is considered one of the most complicated multi-material artworks of all time, with marble, bronze, wood, gold, and iron. Numerous craftsmen and artists, including master architect Francesco Borromini, contributed to its completion. ___ Silvia Stellaci contributed to this report. ___ Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

Authorities in Belarus open new criminal probes against scores of opposition activists	TALLINN, Estonia (AP) — Belarusian authorities said Tuesday that they have launched new criminal investigations against dozens of opposition activists, part of a sweeping crackdown on dissent ahead of next year's presidential vote, in which the country's authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko intends to seek a seventh term. He has already been in power for more than 30 years. After Lukashenko's previous re-election in 2020, which was seen at home and abroad as rigged, he responded to a wave of mass protests with brutal repressions that saw more than 65,000 people detained. About 1,300 are currently held behind bars as political prisoners, according to the Viasna human rights group, including the group’s founder and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Ales Bialiatski. The Investigative Committee, Belarus’ top state criminal investigation agency, announced Tuesday that it has opened new criminal inquiries against 22 opposition activists on charges of their alleged involvement in a 'conspiracy to seize power' and against 23 others who are accused of creating an 'extremist group' for their activities. The activists, most of whom have fled Belarus, have been slapped with confiscation of their apartments and other assets and will face up to 12 years in prison if convicted. The new criminal investigations follow the activists’ move to launch a new effort to coordinate the opposition activities ahead of next year’s presidential vote and set the stage for future democratic reforms. In August, Belarusian opposition activists also staged rallies in several countries. Hundreds of thousands have fled the country amid the brutal crackdown on protests after the 2020 election. Viasna said that at least 66 opposition activists, who have returned to Belarus, have been convicted and sentenced on politically motivated charges. Some others have been sent to psychiatric hospitals for mandatory treatment.	https://apnews.com/article/belarus-opposition-lukashenko-crackdown-6d6a4ba59fff5dd32782141e5c897089	2024-10-08T08:25:11-07:00	
Mexico's president lays out a plan to combat cartel violence. But it looks like more of the same	MEXICO CITY (AP) — Mexico’s new president laid out a plan Tuesday to combat drug cartel violence, but analysts say it appears to be largely a continuation of previous policy. President Claudia Sheinbaum said that she plans to increase intelligence and investigative work, but her main focus will apparently remain the 'hugs, not bullets' approach used by her predecessor. Sheinbaum took over last week from her mentor, former President Andres Manuel López Obrador, who largely failed in his own plan to bring down Mexico’s homicide rate. López Obrador refused to confront the cartels, instead relying on the armed forces and appeals to gangs to keep the peace. 'There is a continuity in the militarization of public safety,' Mexican security analyst David Saucedo said. 'There will also be a continuation of social programs to try to prevent youths from being recruited by organized crime.' Sheinbaum's top security official, Omar García Harfuch, said that 'we will continue with the strategy begun in the administration of President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, to give priority attention to the poorest families.' Mike Vigil, a former head of the DEA’s foreign operations, said that the new plan appears to be 'more of the same.' In 2023, Mexico had a homicide rate of about 24 per 100,000 inhabitants, more than four times higher than the U.S. rate. But officials said that they were also worried about extortion, a crime that the cartels have increasingly turned to along with migrant smuggling, to supplement their income. Sheinbaum blamed the killings in Guanajuato, the state with the highest number of homicides in Mexico, on low wages. 'Clearly, in Guanajuato there is a development model that has failed,' she said. But Saucedo said that poverty doesn't explain it. Guanajuato is an industrial and farming hub where drug use is relatively high, but it also has rail and highway links that cartels are fighting over, because they are used to move drugs toward the border with the United States. 'According to that logic, the entire country would have the same problem, because there are low wages in the whole country,' Saucedo said. In the last weeks of López Obrador's presidency, Mexico's Congress formally handed the National Guard over to the control of the Defense Department. The 120,000-member force was originally supposed to be under civilian command, but had already been largely trained and recruited by the army. The shortcomings of that militarized approach is evident in provincial cities and towns, where the National Guard performs set-piece patrols and establishes security cordons like soldiers, but do little on-the-street investigative work like police, arrest relatively few people and build even fewer criminal cases. Inhabitants of rural areas say National Guard officers often refuse to leave their bases until they get orders from headquarters, even if crimes are being committed outside. And a good part of the National Guard's force is currently assigned to rounding up migrants before they reach the U.S. border, not fighting crime. García Harfuch pledged Tuesday to have the guard function more as a police force, though that is not their training. He pledged to create a sort of national security academy to train law enforcement, and establish an office to integrate intelligence on the gangs gathered by the army, navy and federal investigators. 'The need is to convert the intelligence the country has, into investigations,' said García Harfuch, who formerly served as Mexico City's police chief. Sheinbaum faces an ongoing problem, as illustrated by the killing last week of the mayor of Chilpancingo, the capital of southern Guerrero state. The mayor's head was apparently severed and left on the roof of a pickup truck in the gang-dominated city. And violence in the northern state of Sinaloa has heated up intensely after two top Sinaloa cartel capos flew to the United States in July, where they were detained. The two capos were from different factions of the cartel, and the idea that one of the capos forced the other onto the plane has sparked infighting. So far this year, from January to August, homicides were down 10.7% from their peak in the same period of 2018, but that year was an outlier because of cartel turf battles. The 2024 figures on homicides in the first eight months of the year were 8.6% higher than they were in 2017, under López Obrador's predecessor, Enrique Peña Nieto.	https://apnews.com/article/mexico-president-sheinbaum-cartel-violence-strategy-d7c03d1bdfd3985f58b1f5a935c564af	2024-10-08T07:50:37-07:00	
Woodward book reveals Trump's calls with Putin and Biden's private remarks on Obama and Netanyahu	WASHINGTON (AP) — Donald Trump has had as many as seven private phone calls with Vladimir Putin since leaving office and secretly sent the Russian president COVID-19 test machines during the height of the pandemic, Bob Woodward reported in his new book, 'War.' The revelations were made in the famed Watergate reporter's latest book, which also details President Joe Biden's frustrations with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman 's assortment of burner phones. The Associated Press obtained an early copy of the book, which is due out next week. Steven Cheung, Trump's communications director, denied the accounts in the book. 'None of these made up stories by Bob Woodward are true and are the work of a truly demented and deranged man who suffers from a debilitating case of Trump Derangement Syndrome,' Cheung said in a statement. Trump had previously spoken to Woodward for the journalist's 2021 book, 'Rage.' Trump later sued over it, claiming Woodward never had permission to publicly release recordings of their interviews for the book. The publisher and Woodward denied his allegations. Here is more from the new book: Trump has had multiple calls with Putin since his White House term ended Woodward reports that Trump asked an aide to leave his office at his Florida resort, Mar-a-Lago, so that the former president could have a private call with Putin in early 2024. The aide, whom Woodward doesn’t name, said there have been multiple calls between Trump and Putin since Trump left office, perhaps as many as seven, according to the book, though it does not detail what they discussed. Trump senior adviser and longtime aide Jason Miller told Woodward that he had not heard Trump was having calls with Putin and said, 'I'd push back on that.' But Miller also said, according to the book, 'I’m sure they’d know how to get in touch with each other.' Trump's relationship with Putin has been scrutinized since his 2016 campaign for president, when he memorably called on Russia to find and make public missing emails deleted by Hillary Clinton, his Democratic opponent. 'Russia, if you’re listening, I hope you’re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing,' he said. U.S. intelligence agencies later determined that Russia had meddled in the 2016 election to help Trump, though an investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller found no conspiracy between the Trump team and Russia. In 2018, Trump publicly questioned that finding following an in-person meeting with Putin in Helsinki. In recent years, Trump has criticized U.S. support for Ukraine as it fights off Russia’s invasion. He has said Ukraine should have made concessions to Putin before Russia invaded in 2022. He also previously touted his good relationship with Putin and called the Russian leader 'pretty smart' for invading Ukraine. Trump sent COVID-19 test machines to Putin for his personal use Woodward reports that Trump sent Putin COVID-19 test machines for his personal use as the virus began spreading in 2020. Putin told Trump not to tell anyone because people would be mad at Trump over it, but Trump said he didn’t care if anyone knew, according to the book. Trump ended up agreeing not to tell anyone. The book doesn’t specify when the machines were sent but describes it as being when the virus spread rapidly through Russia. It was previously reported by The Associated Press and other agencies that Trump’s administration in May 2020 sent ventilators and other equipment to several countries, including Russia. Vice President Kamala Harris, in an interview Tuesday with radio host Howard Stern, accused Trump of giving the machines to a 'murderous dictator' at a time when 'everyone was scrambling' to get tests. 'This person who wants to be president again, who secretly is helping out an an adversary while the American people are dying by the hundreds every day,' said Harris, the Democratic presidential candidate. Biden's anger at Netanyahu has boiled over in private The book also details Biden’s complicated relationship with Netanyahu as well as private moments when the president has been fed up with him over the Israel-Hamas war. Biden’s 'frustrations and distrust' of Netanyahu 'erupted' this past spring, Woodward writes. The president privately unleashed a profanity-laden tirade, calling him a 'son of a bitch' and a 'bad f——— guy,' according to the book. Biden said he felt, in Woodward’s accounting, that Netanyahu 'had been lying to him regularly.' With Netanyahu 'continuing to say he was going to kill every last member of Hamas.' Woodward wrote, 'Biden had told him that was impossible, threatening both privately and publicly to withhold offensive U.S. weapons shipment.' Biden and Netanyahu have long been acquainted, although their relationship has not been known to be close or overly friendly. Last week, Biden said he didn’t know whether the Israeli leader was holding up a Mideast peace deal in order to influence the outcome of the 2024 U.S. presidential election. Asked about the book's reporting, White House spokesperson Emilie Simons told reporters Tuesday that 'The commitment that we have to the state of Israel is ironclad.' Simons, when pressed on the details, said she wouldn't comment on every anecdote that may come out in reporting. She added of Biden and Netanyahu: 'They have a long-term relationship. They have a very honest and direct relationship, and I don’t have a comment on those specific anecdotes.' Biden criticized Obama's handling of the Russian invasion of Crimea The book details Biden’s criticism late last year of President Barack Obama’s handling of Putin’s earlier invasion of Ukraine, when Russia seized Crimea and a section of the Donbas in 2014, at a time when Biden was serving as the Democrat’s vice president. 'They f----- up in 2014,' Woodward wrote that Biden said to a close friend in December, blaming the lack of action for Putin’s actions in Ukraine. 'Barack never took Putin seriously.' Biden was angry while speaking to the friend and said they 'never should have let Putin just walk in there' in 2014 and that the U.S. 'did nothing.' Biden regrets choosing Garland as attorney general Woodward reports Biden was privately furious with Attorney General Merrick Garland for appointing a special counsel to investigate Biden’s son Hunter in a tax-and-gun prosecution. 'Should never have picked Garland,' Biden told an associate, according to Woodward. The journalist did not name the associate. Hunter Biden was convicted in June on federal gun charges and faces sentencing in federal court in Delaware in December. He pleaded guilty to federal tax charges in California and is also set to be sentenced in that case in December. Graham says going to Mar-a-Lago is ‘a little bit like going to North Korea’ One of Trump’s longest-term allies, South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, blamed Trump’s ongoing false claims that the 2020 election was rigged to a cult of personality in which the former president’s ensconcement at Mar-a-Lago and circle of aides and advisers 'constantly feed this narrative,' according to the book. The weekend after Russia invaded Ukraine, Graham was with Trump at Mar-a-Lago, which the senator characterized as 'a little bit like going to North Korea.' Graham added that 'everybody stands up and claps every time Trump comes in.' On politics, Woodward wrote that Graham’s counsel was part of what persuaded Trump to run again for the presidency. In March, during one of his many visits to the Middle East since Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, Graham told Woodward that he had been meeting with the Saudi crown prince when Graham suggested they call Trump. From 'a bag containing about 50 burner phones,' Prince Mohammed 'pulled out one labeled ‘TRUMP 45.’' On another trip, Woodward wrote, the Saudi leader retrieved another burner phone, 'this time labeled JAKE SULLIVAN ' when the men called Biden’s national security adviser. ___ Price reported from New York.

The Latest: Harris continues media blitz with 3 more national interviews	Vice President Kamala Harris is continuing her media tour Tuesday with three more interviews for national audiences, with Election Day now just four weeks away. The Democratic presidential nominee was scheduled to appear in New York with the women of 'The View,' speak with radio host Howard Stern, and tape a show with late-night comedian Stephen Colbert. The trio of appearances comes after Harris granted interviews to CBS’ '60 Minutes,' which aired Monday night, and Anderson's Cooper’s podcast, which was released Sunday. The blitz comes after Harris has largely avoided interviews since replacing President Joe Biden at the top of the Democratic ticket. Long past the midway point of her unexpected presidential campaign and with voting already underway, Harris is still introducing herself to Americans who will determine her fate in this year’s presidential election. Follow the AP’s Election 2024 coverage at: https://apnews.com/hub/election-2024. Here’s the latest: Woodward's book details Trump's post-presidency calls with Putin Bob Woodward writes in his new book 'War' that former President Donald Trump has had as many as seven private phone calls with Vladimir Putin since leaving office and that he secretly sent the Russian president COVID-19 test machines in 2020. Woodward reports that Trump asked an aide to leave his office at Mar-a-Lago so that the former president could have a private call with Putin in early 2024. Woodward also reports that Putin told Trump not to tell anyone about sending him COVID-19 test machines. Trump’s communications director Steven Cheung said the book was filled with 'made up stories.' Harris, in an interview Tuesday with radio host Howard Stern, accused Trump of giving the machines to a 'murderous dictator' at a time when 'everyone was scrambling' to get tests. 'This person who wants to be president again, who secretly is helping out an an adversary while the American people are dying by the hundreds every day,' the Democratic presidential candidate. The Associated Press obtained an early copy of the book, which is due out next week. Poll shows Harris faring well and Trump faring poorly with Black voters Black registered voters have an overwhelmingly positive view of Harris, according to a recent poll from the AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. About 7 in 10 Black voters have a somewhat or very favorable view of Harris, with few differences between Black men and women voters on how they view the Democratic candidate. Black voters’ opinions of Trump, by contrast, were overwhelmingly negative, underscoring the challenges he faces as he seeks to erode Harris’ support among Black men. But the poll also found that despite this dramatic gap in views, many Black voters don’t see Harris as a candidate who will set the country on a better trajectory or make a substantial difference in their own lives. Jill Biden to launch 5-day campaign tour for Harris campaign Jill Biden will return to the campaign trail this week on a tour of battleground states to help boost the Harris-Walz campaign. Harris’ campaign and the White House announced Tuesday that the first lady will depart Friday on a five-day, five-state swing with stops in Arizona, Nevada, Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. The appearances will mark the first lady’s return to campaigning. She had campaigned extensively for her husband, President Joe Biden, when he was running for reelection. But she pulled back after Biden folded his campaign and endorsed Harris to replace him on the Democratic ticket. With four weeks to go until Election Day, Harris’ campaign said the first lady will be urging people to get out and vote. The campaign noted that early voting is set to start Wednesday in Arizona and that mail ballots are going out in the five states that Jill Biden will be visiting. Democratic senators take different approaches on Biden as he campaigns in swing states President Joe Biden is campaigning through two key swing states, but two Democratic senators locked in competitive reelection battles are taking markedly different approaches to the the outgoing president. Biden will be fully embraced by Democratic Sen. Bob Casey when he participates in a private campaign fundraiser in suburban Philadelphia for the senior Pennsylvania senator. But in Milwaukee, where Biden is spotlighting his administration’s efforts to replace the nation’s toxic lead pipes, incumbent Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin will be conspicuously absent. Biden has spent scant time on the campaign trail since ending his reelection effort in July. That makes his stops in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin — two tightly contested states that Harris and Trump see as crucial — all the more notable. But as Biden makes a quick swing through the key states, two Democratic senators locked in competitive reelection battles are taking markedly different approaches to the outgoing president, whose approval ratings in a significant swath of the country remain in the pits. Casey’s and Baldwin’s races are also seen as must-wins for Democrats who are trying to maintain their razor-tight control of the Senate. Trump speaks in Florida as Hurricane Milton approaches Trump spoke at Trump International Doral in Miami, headlining a memorial service for the attack on Oct. 7, 2023, against Israel, telling his audience the threat of Hurricane Milton wouldn't have kept him away. 'I think I’m the only person who flew into Florida today,' Trump said at the outset of his remarks. 'I wouldn’t have missed it, regardless.' Milton, a Category 5 hurricane, could come ashore Wednesday in the Tampa Bay region. Trump said he had never heard of a Category 5 hurricane hitting land. However, hurricanes Andrew and Michael in Florida were Category 5, the latter of which struck during his administration. Biden spoke with DeSantis about hurricane preparation President Joe Biden has spoken with Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis to discuss preparations in Florida for the approaching Hurricane Milton and ongoing recovery efforts from the devastation caused by Hurricane Helene. The White House confirmed the president’s call with the governor after Harris earlier on Monday accused DeSantis of 'playing political games' and engaging in 'political gamesmanship' over the federal response to Helene. Biden, according to the White House, asked DeSantis 'to call him directly if there is anything that can be done to further support the response and recovery efforts.' Harris’ office suggested earlier that DeSantis was dodging Harris, saying she reached out to the governor last week but the two never spoke. DeSantis said that he 'didn’t know that she had called' and 'they didn’t call me.' Biden also spoke on Monday with Tampa Mayor Jane Castor and received a detailed briefing from National Weather Service Director Ken Graham on the expected impact Milton will cause. Graham stressed during the briefing that people in the storm’s path should evacuate now while there’s time to do so.	https://apnews.com/article/harris-trump-election-2024-831fd5c5a53476639c664234b1dafe3b	2024-10-08T06:16:52-07:00

Blinken heads to Asia this week for a summit of regional leaders	WASHINGTON (AP) — Secretary of State Antony Blinken will make his 19th trip in office to Asia this week when he leads the U.S. delegation to a meeting of East Asian leaders in Laos. The State Department said Tuesday that Blinken would fill in for President Joe Biden at the annual East Asia Summit, hosted by the chair of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. Blinken will travel to Laos’ capital, Vientiane, for meetings on Thursday and Friday before returning home. He had been due to join Biden in Germany and Angola over the weekend but the White House announced that the president was postponing his travel due to the severe hurricane weather in the U.S. Frayed relations with China, particularly over Beijing's increasing assertiveness in the South China Sea regarding territorial disputes with its smaller neighbors, will be a major agenda item for Blinken, said Dan Kritenbrink, the top U.S. diplomat for Asia. Blinken late last month met with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly in New York, but Kritenbrink could not say if Blinken plans to hold separate meetings in Laos with Chinese officials. China will be represented at the summit by Premier Li Qiang. 'A number of (China)-related issues are likely to come up in the context of the ASEAN meetings, including the situation in the South China Sea and China’s continuing to take a number of escalatory and irresponsible steps designed to coerce and pressure many in the South China Sea claimants,' Kritenbrink said. 'Our channels of communication with (China) remain open, and we’ll continue to focus, as we always have, on not just defending U.S. national interests and those of our allies, but also to managing responsibly our competition with China,' he said.	https://apnews.com/article/blinken-laos-china-east-asia-summit-2e39cff49881c0cf2aba06264bcefdca	2024-10-08T05:13:36-07:00	
Manitoba's train is a lifeline for many towns. Now tourists are also discovering the route	The setting sun backlights a pristine panoply of pines of different sizes and species. Far northern Canadian countryside rolls by at a leisurely pace of a train ride, viewed through an upper deck glass-enclosed of a special observation car. Waves of green and brown in slightly varying shades sweep by. There’s no working Wi-Fi to interrupt with emails or social media demanding attention. It's mesmerizing and calming. Two or three hours pass peacefully without notice. Now repeat. Repeat again. And again. Two hours becomes two days. To get between Churchill, Manitoba, Canada — the polar bear and beluga whale capital of the world and a tourist hot spot for northern adventure tourism — and Winnipeg, Manitoba, there are only two options: A $1,100 one-way plane flight that takes two-and-a-half hours or a scenic 45-hour to 49-hour much cheaper train ride. It's a $200 train ride like few others from the glass ceiling of the observation car Canada’s VIA railroad bills it as a 'scenic adventure.' It starts with a vista of the tree-less but not quite barren tundra, then powers through hours of tall forests. They eventually give way to more manicured cropland with the occasional animal, even a herd of elk. Sunset glimmers off a lake. When night comes it holds the hope of a Northern Lights sighting stretching all around. If there are no glimmering auroras, there's a special beauty in the pitch black outside with only the lights of the train interrupting. And it goes on for 1,697 kilometers (1,054 miles). There are 10 listed stops enroute with some only for a few minutes and others a few hours. It's Churchill's connection to the rest of the world While it's promoted for tourism, the train is actually a lifeline for the town of Churchill. The community has roads inside town and for a few miles to the outskirts, but no roads go to other cities. So it's expensive flying or an overnight train ride at a more reasonable price tag. The semi-weekly trains bring tourists, residents, mail, food, fuel and other necessities. From May 2017 to October 2018, part of the rail line washed out because of storms and poor maintenance, stranding an entire community. Staples had to be delivered by air and propane fuel was brought in by ship through the Hudson Bay. Prices in town skyrocketed and lawsuits were filed over who was responsible for the repair costs. 'We had no rail service for about 18 months meaning Churchilleans couldn’t go out by rail to visit their families in other parts of Manitoba,' Churchill Mayor Mike Spence said. 'It was devastating.' The town and some First Nations in the area took over the rail line and it’s back to operating. Spence said with the community pouring tens of millions of dollars into repairs the lines should stay open even as the world's weather gets more extreme. It's a very long ride Sleeper berths are available on the train, along with shower cubicles the size of those in a New York hotel room, but for those traveling more cheaply or booking late, there are standard seats in the cabin. The seats recline — mostly. But it's not full laying down. Food is also limited. There is a small galley below the observation deck. It has some food, heated by a microwave. The train does serve beer, but limited brands. Frequent commuters and those who do their research know to bring their own snacks on board, and make the most of the restaurants at longer stops in towns on route. Stations along the way vary greatly: In Dauphin, passengers wait outside an historic brick station built in 1912, but in Wabowden, a single yellow sign nailed to a pole near the track that reads 'Muster Point' alerts passengers to the stop. For residents of smaller communities along the route, the train provides the only connection to other parts of Manitoba. At Thompson, passengers are better connected — and fed Many ride the train weekly, traveling to and from Thompson. At about 13,600 residents, it’s the biggest community the train stops at, besides Winnipeg, with amenities like big-box stores and restaurants. Thompson — just under halfway between Churchill and Winnipeg — is where many Churchill residents train journey ends. Residents said they often keep cars in Thompson, take the train there and then drive to Winnipeg. They can shave 17 hours off the trip that way, they said. All but two dozen passengers got off at Thompson, the closest bigger community connected to the rest of Manitoba by road. First Nation communities line the route After leaving Thompson, the train heads to remote First Nation communities on both sides of the route. And though the journey distance-wise is short, it takes hours by train, with many passengers passing the time playing cards and chatting with each other in the dining car. The town of Pas, a longer stop on the route, includes a bar right by the station. But the train's porter warned passengers off it, saying it was a rather rough establishment. She knew because she has been there. In Thicket Portage, population around 150, residents gather to meet their rides back to town at the stop, a small wooden shack near the tracks. Here, they unload their luggage and other goods, food, diapers and other staples. The train also ventured into a different zone in eastern Saskatchewan and the cute downtown of Canora, which strangely wasn’t on the train schedule for stops. As the train heads further south, the landscape changes, the northern forest giving way to crop fields and livestock as the route approaches Winnipeg in southern Manitoba. And finally, after 49 hours, the train pulls into Winnipeg. This glimpse into the beautiful monotony of vast stretches of untouched trees and tan tundra is a trip of a lifetime, which — for some passengers at least — seemed to last that long. ___ Read more of AP’s climate coverage at http://www.apnews.com/climate-and-environment ___ Follow Seth Borenstein and Joshua Bickel on X at @borenbears and @Joshuabickel ______ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Who is Naim Kassem, the acting leader of Hezbollah?	BEIRUT (AP) — Sheikh Naim Kassem has been the acting head of Hezbollah since its longtime leader Hassan Nasrallah was killed as part of an Israeli offensive that has taken out many of the Lebanese militant group’s senior officials. Kassem made a defiant televised speech Tuesday, claiming that the group's military capabilities are intact and Israelis will only suffer further as fighting continues. Like Nasrallah, Kassem is one of the founding members of the Shiite political party and armed group, but he is widely seen as lacking the former leader’s charisma and oratory skills. Still, the white-turbaned cleric with a gray beard has often been the public face of the group. After Nasrallah went underground out of fear of being assassinated by Israel, appearing only in televised speeches, Kassem continued to show up at rallies and ceremonies, and he has sat for interviews with foreign journalists. Mohanad Hage Ali, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Middle East Center think tank who researches Hezbollah, said that Kassem is perceived by many as 'more extreme' than Nasrallah, at least in his public statements. In practice, however, his power within the group was limited under Nasrallah. Hashem Safieddine, a cousin of Nasrallah who oversees the group’s political affairs — not Kassem — was generally regarded as the leader's heir apparent. But no announcement has been made, and Safieddine has not appeared publicly or made any public statements since Nasrallah’s death. Kassem has been sanctioned by the United States, which considers Hezbollah a terrorist group. He was born in the town of Kfar Fila in southern Lebanon and studied chemistry at the Lebanese University before working for several years as a chemistry teacher. At the same time, he pursued religious studies and participated in founding the Lebanese Union for Muslim Students, an organization that aimed to promote religious adherence among students. In the 1970s, Kassem joined the Movement of the Dispossessed, a political organization founded by Imam Moussa Sadr that pushed for greater representation for Lebanon’s historically overlooked and impoverished Shiite community. The group morphed into the Amal movement, one of the main armed groups in Lebanon’s civil war, and now a powerful political party. He then joined the nascent Hezbollah, formed with support from Iran after Israel invaded Lebanon in 1982 and occupied the country’s southern region. From 1991, he served as deputy secretary-general of the group, initially under Nasrallah’s predecessor, Abbas Mousawi, who was killed by an Israeli helicopter attack in 1992.	https://apnews.com/article/naim-kassem-hezbollah-hassan-nasrallah-90b79db6df55ff3cb77877a7c65790fd	2024-10-08T04:15:49-07:00	
MI5 spy chief says Russia and Iran are behind a 'staggering' rise in deadly plots	LONDON (AP) — Britain is facing a 'staggering rise' in assassination attempts on U.K. soil by Russia and Iran, as the hostile states recruit criminals to 'do their dirty work' for them, the head of the U.K.’s domestic intelligence agency said Tuesday. MI5 director Ken McCallum said his agents and police have tackled 20 Tehran-backed plots since 2022 and warned that Iran could expand its targets in the U.K. if Israel attacks in response to Iran’s missile barrage. The spy chief said the widening conflicts in the Middle East raise the risk 'of an increase in – or broadening of – Iranian state aggression in the U.K.' In a rare public speech setting out the major threats to the U.K. from both hostile states and terror groups, McCallum said there also is a risk that Israel’s conflicts with Iran-backed militant groups -- Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthis in Yemen - could trigger terror attacks in the U.K. The Middle East crisis has not translated 'at scale into terrorist violence' in Britain, he said, but hostile states, individual attackers and a revived Islamic State group combine to create 'the most complex and interconnected threat environment we’ve ever seen.' The number of state-threat investigations undertaken by MI5 has risen by 48% in the past year, with Iran, Russia and, China the main perpetrators, McCallum told journalists at the U.K.’s counterterrorism command center in London McCallum said that since the death of Mahsa Amini, who died in Iranian police custody in September 2022 after being detained for allegedly violating the Islamic republic’s mandatory headscarf law, 'we’ve seen plot after plot here in the U.K., at an unprecedented pace and scale.' He said MI5 and the police have responded to 20 potentially lethal Iran-backed plots since January 2022, an increase of a third on the figure of 15 the government gave at the end of January. McCallum said Russia’s military intelligence agency was trying to use 'arson, sabotage and more' to create 'mayhem' on the streets of Britain and other European countries. Both Russia and Iran often turn to criminals, 'from international drug traffickers to low-level crooks,' to carry out attacks, he said, The U.K.’s official terror threat level stands at 'substantial,' the middle of a five-point scale, meaning an attack is likely, and since 2017 MI5 and the police have disrupted 43 late-stage terror plots. While about three-quarters of terror plots stem from Islamic extremist ideology and a quarter from the extreme right, he said those labels 'don’t fully reflect the dizzying range of beliefs and ideologies we see,' drawn from a soup of 'online hatred, conspiracy theories and disinformation,' McCallum said. He also said there was worrying signs that the Islamic State group is back, despite the collapse of its self-declared caliphate in Iraq and Syria. McCallum said that 'after a few years of being pinned well back, they’ve resumed efforts to export terrorism.' 'The first 20 years of my career here were crammed full of terrorist threats,' McCallum said. 'We now face those alongside state-backed assassination and sabotage plots, against the backdrop of a major European land war.'	https://apnews.com/article/uk-intelligence-mi5-threats-russia-iran-936d7c24d303ffea41f6b1cef7c7b814	2024-10-08T03:30:58-07:00	
Small town in Thailand hold mass cremation for 23 who died in a school trip bus fire	LAN SAK, Thailand (AP) — Mourners wept and monks prayed at a cremation ceremony Tuesday in a small town in central Thailand for 23 young students and teachers who died in last week’s bus fire on a school field trip. A large cremation site was set up close to the temple in Lan Sak town whose compound hosts the school that was attended by the victims. Several furnaces with tall chimneys were erected, with floral adornments placed in front of them. Six teachers and 39 elementary and junior high school students were on the bus when it caught fire on Oct. 1 on a highway in Pathum Thani, a northern suburb of Bangkok. It spread so quickly that only 22 people were able to escape. After forensic work in Bangkok made positive identifications of the badly burnt bodies, the victims' remains were were returned to their hometown for funeral rites that began last week. The tragedy sparked national outrage over insufficient safety procedures and pushed the authorities to take immediate legal action. Police arrested the driver of the bus for alleged reckless driving and announced they were charging the woman in whose name the bus was registered with negligence causing death. Transport officials were being scrutinized after information emerged that the bus had passed an inspection about four months before the fire. In the wake of the accident, investigators found that the bus was fitted with 11 natural gas canisters although it had a permit for only six. Officials have said that the bus, which was more than 50 years old, had been modified to run on CNG — compressed natural gas — which is often used especially by commercial vehicles to save money. Police They believe that a gas tube from one of the canisters had come loose, with sparks then setting the leaking gas on fire. The more than 13,000 buses running on CNG were ordered inspected within 60 days, while the Education Ministry suspended school study trips in the meantime. Tuesday’s cremation in Uthai Thai province was held under the sponsorship of King Maha Vajiralongkorn, who sent the head of his Privy Council, former army chief and prime minister Surayud Chulanont, to represent him.	https://apnews.com/article/thailand-bus-fire-cremation-d549dd09b10e525b434f4dc3d4840d91	2024-10-08T03:03:04-07:00	
Japan prosecutors will not appeal acquittal of world's longest death-row inmate in retrial	TOKYO (AP) — Japanese prosecutors said Tuesday they will not appeal the acquittal of the world’s longest-serving death-row inmate in a retrial last month, bringing closure to the 1966 murder case after more than a half-century of legal battles. Prosecutor-general Naomi Unemoto said the prosecution decided not to appeal the Shizuoka District Court decision that found Iwao Hakamada not guilty in a retrial 58 years after his arrest, saying: 'We feel sorry for putting him in a legally unstable situation for an extremely long time.' Hakamada, an 88-year-old former boxer, was found not guilty on Oct. 26 by the Shizuoka court, which concluded that police and prosecutors collaborated in fabricating and planting evidence against him. The court said he was forced into confession by violent, hourslong interrogations. The top prosecutors’ decision to not appeal two days before the Oct. 10 deadline finalizes Hakamada’s acquittal by the district court. 'I’m delighted that we finally resolved this. Case closed,' his 91-year-old sister Hideko Hakamada told reporters after getting a phone call from her lawyer about the prosecutors’ decision. 'I kind of knew this was going to happen,' Hakamada said, with a laugh. Unemoto, in a statement on the Supreme Public Prosecutors Office website, also apologized for Hakamada's decades-long unstable legal situation amid a lengthy court process and pledged to investigate why the retrial took so long. Hakamada was convicted of murder in the 1966 killing of an executive and three of his family members and setting fire to their home in central Japan. He was sentenced to death in 1968 but was not executed, due to the lengthy appeal and retrial process in Japan’s notoriously slow-paced justice system. Hakamada became the fifth death row inmate to be found not guilty in a retrial in postwar Japan, where prosecutors have a more than 99% conviction rate and retrials are extremely rare. He spent more than 45 years on death row, making him the world’s longest-serving death-row inmate, according to Amnesty International. With Tuesday’s settlement of the retrial ruling, Hakamada is now entitled to receive government compensation of up to about 200 million yen ($1.4 million). His lawyer Hideyo Ogawa has said his defense team is considering filing a damage suit against the government and the Shizuoka prefecture over the collaboration of prosecutors and police in fabricating evidence, despite knowing it could send Hakamada to the gallows.	https://apnews.com/article/japan-hakamada-acquittal-retrial-death-penalty-prosecution-2e4f2930c6f73f398676e27caceb40b0	2024-10-08T02:54:47-07:00	
Biggest Kashmir party opposed to India's stripping of region's autonomy wins most seats in election	SRINAGAR, India (AP) — Kashmir’s biggest political party opposed to India's stripping of the region's semi-autonomy won the most seats in a local election, official data showed Tuesday, in a vote seen as a referendum against the move by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government. National Conference, or NC, won 42 seats, mainly from the Kashmir Valley, the heartland of the anti-India rebellion, according to the data. Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party secured 29 seats, all from the Hindu-dominated areas of Jammu. India’s main opposition Congress party, which fought the election in alliance with the NC, succeeded in six constituencies. 'People have supported us more than our expectations. Now our efforts will be to prove that we are worth these votes,' Omar Abdullah, the NC leader and the region’s former chief minister, told reporters in the main city of Srinagar. His father and president of the party, Farooq Abdullah, said that the mandate was to run the region without 'police raj (rule)' and try freeing people from jails. 'Media will be free,' he said. 'People have given their mandate, they have proven that they don’t accept the decision that was taken on August 5,' he added referring to India's move in Aug. 2019. The vote will allow Kashmir to have its own truncated government and a regional legislature, called an assembly, rather than being directly under New Delhi’s rule. However, there will be a limited transition of power from New Delhi to the assembly as Kashmir will remain a 'union territory' — directly controlled by the federal government — with India’s Parliament as its main legislator. Kashmir’s statehood must be restored for the new government to have powers similar to other states of India. Hundreds of the NC workers gathered outside counting centers and at the homes of the winning candidates to celebrate the party’s victory. It was the first such vote in a decade and the first since Modi’s Hindu nationalist government scrapped the Muslim-majority region’s long-held semi-autonomy in 2019. The unprecedented move downgraded and divided the former state into two centrally governed union territories, Ladakh and Jammu-Kashmir. Both are ruled directly by New Delhi through its appointed administrators along with unelected bureaucrats and security setup. The move — which largely resonated in India and among Modi supporters — was mostly opposed in Kashmir as an assault on its identity and autonomy amid fears that it would pave the way for demographic changes in the region. The region has since been on edge with civil liberties curbed and media gagged. India and Pakistan each administer a part of Kashmir, but both claim the territory in its entirety. The nuclear-armed rivals have fought two of their three wars over the territory since they gained independence from British colonial rule in 1947. Authorities tallied votes as thousands of additional police and paramilitary soldiers patrolled roads and guarded 28 counting centers. Nearly 8.9 million people were eligible to vote in the election, which began on Sept. 18 and concluded on Oct. 1. The overall turnout was 64% across the three phases, according to official data. In the region’s legislature, five seats are appointed and 90 elected, so a party or coalition would need at least 48 of the 95 total seats to form a government. The alliance of the National Conference and the Congress have 48 seats combined. Authorities have said the election will bring democracy to the region after decades of strife, but many locals viewed the vote as an opportunity not only to elect their own representatives but also to register their protest against the 2019 changes. Except for the BJP, most parties who contested the election campaigned on promises to reverse the 2019 changes and address key issues like rising unemployment and inflation. The Congress party favored restoring the region’s statehood. The BJP has also stated that it will restore statehood, but has not told when it would do. The BJP has vowed to block any move aimed at undoing most of the 2019 changes but promised to help in the region’s economic development. Meanwhile, Modi’s BJP appears to be heading for a victory in the northern state of Haryana, bordering New Delhi, which it has ruled for 10 years, leading in 50 constituencies and the Congress in 35 out of 90. The BJP has so far won 18 seats and is leading in 32 constituencies while the Congress has won 15 seats and is leading in 20, according to the Election Commission of India. A victory would give the BJP a record third five-year term in the state. The voting trend in Haryana state is a surprise since most exit polls had predicted an easy victory for the Congress party. Kashmir's last assembly election was held in 2014, after which the BJP for the first time ruled in a coalition with the local Peoples Democratic Party. But the government collapsed in 2018 after the BJP withdrew from the coalition. Polls in the past have been marked with violence, boycotts and vote-rigging, even though India called them a victory over separatism. Militants in the Indian-controlled portion of Kashmir have been fighting New Delhi’s rule since 1989. Many Muslim Kashmiris support the rebels’ goal of uniting the territory, either under Pakistani rule or as an independent country. India insists the Kashmir militancy is Pakistan-sponsored terrorism. Pakistan denies the charge, and many Kashmiris consider it a legitimate freedom struggle. Tens of thousands of civilians, rebels and government forces have been killed in the conflict. ___ Associated Press Writer Ashok Sharma in New Delhi contributed to this report. ___ Follow AP’s Asia-Pacific coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/asia-pacific	https://apnews.com/article/kashmir-india-election-assembly-modi-1d2531f3f1951bffe7cd2c13d49b0c60	2024-10-08T02:41:31-07:00	
FIFA bans Italian player Curto for 10 games for discrimination toward South Korean opponent	ZURICH (AP) — FIFA banned Italian soccer player Marco Curto for 10 games for making a discriminatory remark at South Korea forward Hee Chan Hwang in a preseason game between Como and Wolverhampton. The 25-year-old Curto also must do 'community services and undergo training and education with an organization approved by FIFA,' soccer’s governing body said in a statement on Tuesday. Como defended Curto after the game in July, claiming the remark that Hwang 'thinks he’s Jackie Chan' was not intended to be derogatory. Hwang reported the incident during the second half, leading to angry responses from his teammates, including Daniel Podence. The Portuguese forward was sent off for punching a Como player. The South Korea Football Association filed a formal complaint to FIFA, which notified Curto of his disciplinary ban late Monday. 'The player Marco Curto was found responsible for discriminatory behavior and sanctioned with a 10-match suspension,' FIFA said. Curto has since been loaned by top-tier Como to Serie B club Cesena and is set to miss five league games through Nov. 10. FIFA said it deferred five games of the ban for a probationary period of two years. FIFA this year urged all 211 of its member federations to take a coordinated approach to prosecuting incidents of alleged racism and discrimination. ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer	https://apnews.com/article/fifa-discrimination-como-curto-f15f287e3fa8cbb97cefd59536b069de	2024-10-08T01:56:22-07:00	
France tightens steps to prevent one of Osama bin Laden's sons from returning	PARIS (AP) — France’s interior minister said Tuesday he has taken additional steps against any effort by one of the sons of al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden to return to France. Omar bin Laden had been living in France’s Normandy region but left the country in October 2023 after French authorities withdrew his residency papers and ordered him out, the Interior Ministry said. At the time, authorities also barred him from returning to France for two years, the ministry added. In a post Tuesday on the social media platform X, French Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau said he imposed an additional ban to ensure that Omar bin Laden 'will not be able to return to France for any reason whatsoever.' French daily Le Parisien reported that Omar bin Laden now lives in Qatar. It said he had previously been living since 2016 in the Orne region of Normandy with his British wife and had been working as an artist. The newspaper said that last week he lost a legal battle to overturn the ban on him returning to France. Retailleau said French authorities had ordered him out of the country for social media posts deemed sympathetic of terrorism. His father Osama bin Laden, mastermind of the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks, was killed in a U.S. commando operation by U.S. Navy SEALs in 2011 in Pakistan.	https://apnews.com/article/france-alqaida-bin-laden-government-normandy-d51c5862a2ac8054a41c6cf432a3eb12	2024-10-08T01:28:07-07:00	
Water gushes through sand dunes after a rare rainfall in the Sahara desert	RABAT, Morocco (AP) — A rare deluge of rainfall left blue lagoons of water amid the palm trees and sand dunes of the Sahara desert, nourishing some of its driest regions with more water than they had seen in decades. Southeastern Morocco's desert is among the most arid places in the world and rarely experiences rain in late summer. The Moroccan government said two days of rainfall in September exceeded yearly averages in several areas that see less than 250 millimeters (10 inches) annually, including Tata, one of the areas hit hardest. In Tagounite, a village about 450 kilometers (280 miles) south of the capital, Rabat, more than 100 millimeters (3.9 inches) was recorded in a 24-hour period. The storms left striking images of water gushing through the Saharan sands amid castles and desert flora. NASA satellites showed water rushing in to fill Lake Iriqui, a famous lake bed between Zagora and Tata that had been dry for 50 years. In desert communities frequented by tourists, 4x4s motored through the puddles and residents surveyed the scene in awe. 'It’s been 30 to 50 years since we’ve had this much rain in such a short space of time,' said Houssine Youabeb of Morocco's General Directorate of Meteorology. Such rains, which meteorologists are calling an extratropical storm, may change the course of the region's weather in months and years to come as the air retains more moisture, causing more evaporation and drawing more storms, Youabeb said. Six consecutive years of drought have posed challenges for much of Morocco, forcing farmers to leave fields fallow and cities and villages to ration water. The bounty of rainfall will likely help refill the large groundwater aquifers beneath the desert that are relied upon to supply water in desert communities. The region's dammed reservoirs reported refilling at record rates throughout September. However, it's unclear how far September's rains will go toward alleviating drought. Water gushing through the sands and oases left more than 20 dead in Morocco and Algeria and damaged farmers' harvests, forcing the government to allocate emergency relief funds, including in some areas affected by last year's earthquake. ___ Ahmed reported from Bamako, Mali.	https://apnews.com/article/sahara-flooding-oasis-rain-morocco-2b6c28d2487a0ef370aff60775d0245d	2024-10-08T01:25:24-07:00	
Hezbollah leader says more Israelis will be displaced as the militants extend their rocket fire	BEIRUT (AP) — Hezbollah’s acting leader said Tuesday that even more Israelis will be displaced as the militant group extends its rocket fire deeper into Israel, in a defiant televised statement marking the anniversary of fighting that escalated into war last month. Sheikh Naim Kassem, the acting leader of Hezbollah, said its military capabilities are still intact and that it has replaced all of its senior commanders after weeks of heavy Israeli airstrikes across large parts of Lebanon, including targeted strikes that killed much of its top command in a matter of days. He also said Israeli forces have not been able to advance after launching a ground incursion into Lebanon last week. The Israeli military said a fourth division is now taking part in the incursion, which has expanded to the west, but operations still appear to be confined to a narrow strip along the border. The Israeli military says it has dismantled militant infrastructure along the border and killed hundreds of Hezbollah fighters. On Tuesday, it said a strike in Beirut had killed Suhail Husseini, who it described as a senior commander responsible overseeing logistics, budget and management of the militant group. There was no immediate comment from Hezbollah, and no way to confirm battlefield claims made by either side. In Gaza, meanwhile, heavy fighting was underway Tuesday between Israeli ground forces and Palestinian militants in the isolated north, where Israel has ordered another full-scale evacuation in recent days. Hezbollah says it has ‘no vacant posts’ 'We are firing hundreds of rockets and dozens of drones. A large number of settlements and cities are under the fire of the resistance,' Kassem said in a video address, speaking from an undisclosed location. 'Our capabilities are fine and our fighters are deployed along the frontlines.' He said Hezbollah's top leadership was directing the war and that the commanders killed by Israel have been replaced. 'We have no vacant posts,' he added. He said that Hezbollah will name a new leader to succeed Hassan Nasrallah, who was killed in an Israeli airstrike in a bunker in Beirut last month, 'but the circumstances are difficult because of the war.' The Israeli army said 85 projectiles were launched from Lebanon toward northern Israel on Tuesday. Israel’s aerial defense intercepted most of the rockets, the military said. A 70-year-old woman was moderately wounded by shrapnel and Israeli media aired footage of what appeared to be minor damage to buildings near the coastal city of Haifa. The military also said that it struck Hezbollah targets in the southern Beirut suburbs, known as the Dahiyeh, where the militant group is headquartered. Hezbollah began firing rockets into northern Israel on Oct. 8, 2023, the day after Hamas' surprise attack into Israel ignited the war in Gaza. Hezbollah and Hamas are both allied with Iran, and Hezbollah says its attacks are aimed at aiding the Palestinians. Israel has carried out airstrikes in response and the conflict steadily escalated, erupting into a full-fledged war last month. The Lebanese militant group has said it will stop the attacks if there is a cease-fire in Gaza, but months of diplomatic efforts on that front have repeatedly stalled. Rocket fire intensifies as Israel steps up strikes Israel has inflicted a punishing wave of blows against Hezbollah in recent weeks and says it will keep fighting until tens of thousands of displaced Israeli citizens can return to their homes in the north. More than 1,300 people have been killed in Lebanon and over a million displaced since the fighting escalated in mid-September. Since then, Hezbollah has extended its rocket fire into central Israel, setting off air raid sirens in the country's commercial hub of Tel Aviv. Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen have also launched missiles that reached central Israel. Most of the projectiles have been intercepted or fallen in open areas, disrupting life in Israel while causing few casualties and little property damage. Last, week Iran launched its own barrage of some 180 ballistic missiles at Israel, in what it said was a response to the killing of Nasrallah, an Iranian general who was with him at the time and Ismail Haniyeh, the top leader of Hamas, who was killed in an explosion in Iran's capital in July. Israel has vowed to respond to the missile attack, without saying when or how. Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant is in Washington this week to meet with Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin. The Biden administration says it is opposed to an Israeli attack on Iran's nuclear facilities, which could escalate regional tensions even further. Heavy fighting and evacuation orders in Gaza Northern Gaza, where heavy fighting raged Tuesday, was the first target of Israel’s ground offensive. Entire neighborhoods have been reduced to rubble and Israeli troops have largely isolated the region — which includes Gaza City — since last October, when up to a million people fled to the south following Israeli evacuation orders. Hundreds of thousands have remained in the north despite the harsh conditions, leading Israel to order another total evacuation in recent days. Israel has barred residents from returning to the north. Israeli forces are battling Hamas militants in Jabaliya, a densely populated urban refugee camp dating back to the 1948 war surrounding Israel’s creation. Palestinian residents said Israeli warplanes and artillery were pounding Jabaliya as well as Beit Hanoun and Beit Lahiya, towns near the border. The Israeli military said it killed around 20 militants in airstrikes and ground fighting in Jabaliya. It said troops located a large quantity of weapons, including grenades and rifles. The nearby Kamal Adwan Hospital said at least 15 people, including two women and four children, were killed Tuesday in the fighting in Jabaliya. It said the dead included four people who were trying to retrieve bodies. 'The situation is extremely difficult. The bombing and explosions haven’t stopped,' said Mahmoud Abu Shehatah, a Jabaliya resident. 'It’s like the first days of the war.' The war began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250. Israel’s retaliatory offensive has killed around 42,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities. They do not say how many were fighters, but say women and children make up more than half of all fatalities. ___ Goldenberg reported from Jerusalem.

Pioneers in artificial intelligence win the Nobel Prize in physics	STOCKHOLM (AP) — Two pioneers of artificial intelligence – John Hopfield and Geoffrey Hinton – won the Nobel Prize in physics Tuesday for helping create the building blocks of machine learning that is revolutionizing the way we work and live but also creates new threats to humanity, one of the winners said. Hinton, who is known as the Godfather of artificial intelligence, is a citizen of Canada and Britain who works at the University of Toronto, and Hopfield is an American working at Princeton. 'These two gentlemen were really the pioneers,' said Nobel physics committee member Mark Pearce. 'They ... did the fundamental work, based on physical understanding which has led to the revolution we see today in machine learning and artificial intelligence.' The artificial neural networks they pioneered are used throughout science and medicine and 'have also become part of our daily lives, for instance in facial recognition and language translation,' said Ellen Moons, a member of the Nobel committee at the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. Hinton predicted that AI will end up having a 'huge influence' on civilization, bringing improvements in productivity and health care. 'It would be comparable with the Industrial Revolution,' he said in an open call with reporters and officials of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. 'Instead of exceeding people in physical strength, it’s going to exceed people in intellectual ability. We have no experience of what it’s like to have things smarter than us. And it’s going to be wonderful in many respects,' Hinton said. 'But we also have to worry about a number of possible bad consequences, particularly the threat of these things getting out of control.' The Nobel committee that honored the science behind machine learning and AI also mentioned fears about its possible flipside. Moons said that while it has 'enormous benefits, its rapid development has also raised concerns about our future. Collectively, humans carry the responsibility for using this new technology in a safe and ethical way for the greatest benefit of humankind.' Hinton shares those concerns. He quit a role at Google so he could more freely speak about the dangers of the technology he helped create. 'I am worried that the overall consequence of this might be systems more intelligent than us that eventually take control,' Hinton said. On Tuesday, he said he was shocked at the honor. 'I’m flabbergasted. I had, no idea this would happen,' he said when reached by the Nobel committee on the phone. He said he was at a cheap hotel with no internet. There was no immediate reaction from Hopfield. Hinton, now 76, in the 1980s helped develop a technique known as backpropagation that has been instrumental in training machines how to 'learn' by fine-tuning errors until they disappear. It’s similar to the way a student learns from a teacher with an initial solution graded and flaws identified and returned to be fixed and repaired. This process continues until the answer matches the network’s version of reality. His team at the University of Toronto later wowed peers by using a neural network to win the prestigious ImageNet computer vision competition in 2012. That win spawned a flurry of copycats, giving birth to the rise of modern AI. Hinton and fellow AI scientists Yoshua Bengio and Yann LeCun won computer science’s top prize, the Turing Award, in 2019. 'For a long time, people thought what the three of us were doing was nonsense,' Hinton told The Associated Press in 2019. 'They thought we were very misguided and what we were doing was a very surprising thing for apparently intelligent people to waste their time on. My message to young researchers is, don’t be put off if everyone tells you what are doing is silly.' And Hinton himself uses machine learning in his daily life. 'Whenever I want to know the answer to anything, I just go and ask GPT4,' Hinton said at the Nobel announcement. 'I don’t totally trust it because it can hallucinate, but on almost everything it's a not very good expert. And that’s very useful.' 'Twenty years ago, I think people would have happily agreed that systems with the ability of GPT-4 or (Google’s) Gemini had achieved general intelligence comparable to that of humans,' Hinton told the AP this spring. 'Being able to answer more or less any question in a sensible way would have passed the test. But now that AI can do that, people want to change the test.' Hopfield, 91, created an associative memory that can store and reconstruct images and other types of patterns in data, the Nobel committee said. 'What fascinates me most is still this question of how mind comes from machine,' Hopfield said in a video posted online by The Franklin Institute after it awarded him a physics prize in 2019. Hinton used Hopfield's network as the foundation for a new network that uses a different method, known as the Boltzmann machine, that the committee said can learn to recognise characteristic elements in a given type of data. Six days of Nobel announcements opened Monday with Americans Victor Ambros and Gary Ruvkun winning the medicine prize for their discovery of tiny bits of genetic material that serve as on and off switches inside cells that help control what the cells do and when they do it. If scientists can better understand how they work and how to manipulate them, it could one day lead to powerful treatments for diseases like cancer. The physics prize carries a cash award of 11 million Swedish kronor ($1 million) from a bequest left by the award's creator, Swedish inventor Alfred Nobel. The laureates are invited to receive their awards at ceremonies on Dec. 10, the anniversary of Nobel’s death. Nobel announcements continue with the chemistry physics prize on Wednesday and literature on Thursday. The Nobel Peace Prize will be announced Friday and the economics award on Oct. 14. ___ Corder reported from The Hague, Netherlands and Borenstein reported from Washington.

France's fragile new government faces a no-confidence vote as far right offers critical support	PARIS (AP) — France’s minority government is expected to survive a no-confidence vote on Tuesday in a test for new conservative Prime Minister Michel Barnier, forced to rely on the far right’s good will to be able to stay in power. It comes as Barnier's fragile government faces a major challenge to get a budget for next year approved with no majority at parliament. Following June-July parliamentary elections, the National Assembly, France’s powerful lower house of parliament, is divided into three major blocs: the New Popular Front, Macron’s centrist allies and the far-right National Rally party. None of them won an outright majority. The no-confidence motion was brought by 192 lawmakers of a left-wing coalition, the New Popular Front, composed of the hard-left France Unbowed, Socialists, Greens and Communists. It needs 289 votes to pass. The far-right National Rally group, which counts 125 lawmakers, has said it would abstain from voting a no-confidence motion for now. Far-right leader Marine Le Pen, herself a lawmaker, said she decided to 'give a chance' to the government. Barnier’s cabinet is mostly composed of members of his Republicans party and centrists from French President Emmanuel Macron’s alliance who altogether count just over 200 lawmakers. Left-wing lawmakers denounced the choice of Barnier as prime minister as they were not given a chance to form a minority government, despite securing the most seats at the National Assembly. This government 'is a denial of the result of the most recent legislative elections,' the motion read.	https://apnews.com/article/france-minority-government-no-confidence-vote-7fa8b612dc28ab33cfeec526a21cce0c	2024-10-07T22:36:39-07:00	
Netflix series explores women's dreams in the body-slamming world of Japanese pro wrestling	TOKYO (AP) — 'The Queen of Villains' is a typical coming-of-age tale about a young woman’s road to empowerment and self-discovery — except it all takes place in the body-slamming, arm-twisting world of Japanese professional wrestling. The Netflix series, which began airing last month, tells the story of Dump Matsumoto, a real-life wrestling legend from the 1980s who grew up poor with a father who was often absent or abusive. Matsumoto grew up angry, she said, and went on to create in her wrestling persona a ferocious, almost camp villain character, known in the sport as a 'heel,' complete with outlandish Kabuki-like facial makeup, chains, sticks and a grotesque scowl. She loomed large as a symbol of fearless and defiant womanhood. 'I gave it my all to be evil,' Matsumoto said. A hefty woman with a friendly smile, Matsumoto makes a point even now to adamantly deny that she was ever a nice person or acknowledge that many people in Japan, especially women, love her. 'I still beat people up in matches. I stuck forks in them and made them bleed,' she said, adding, 'All the people who pretend to be good are the truly evil ones.' 'The Queen of Villains' follows the friendship between Matsumoto and Chigusa Nagayo of the popular wrestling tag team known as the Crush Gals. Nagayo served as an adviser, trainer and choreographer for the series’ dramatized wrestling scenes. Japanese professional wrestling fans still talk about the matches between Matsumoto and the Crush Gals, including the ones they fought in the U.S. The actresses in the series spent two years training for their roles. They gained weight and muscle, and learned techniques like the 'giant swing,' in which a wrestler grabs her opponent’s legs and moves in a dizzying circle, or the 'flying knee kick,' which involves a jump and kick to the body while airborne. The trick in professional wrestling is to execute the punches and body slams convincingly but in a controlled way to avoid serious injuries. A wrestler also must know how to fall properly. One key fight scene took a month to film as the actors went over each move, again and again. 'Dump played a role to be hated by the entire nation,' said Yuriyan Retriever, a professional comedian who stars as Matsumoto in the series. 'Previously, there was a limit, maybe even unintentionally, beyond which I couldn’t go. But when I played Dump, all those emotions had to come out and be expressed,' she said. She felt like she was no longer playing a role, she said, but that she had become Dump Matsumoto. 'It’s frightening to be hated, and I don’t think anyone wants to be hated,' Retriever said. 'When I finished a cut, I was crying. And my body was shaking. I can’t express it in words, but I understood all the pressures Dump must have felt.' The series not only presents a women-beating-the-odds story against a backdrop of sexism and abusive management but it also captures the postwar period of the Showa-era in a way that feels authentic. The scenes used thousands of extras, many of them serious wrestling fans. Some viewers say the real-life wrestling was more intense than the dramatized version in the new series. Rionne McAvoy, an Australian filmmaker who as a professional wrestler was hit with a stick by Matsumoto, said: 'The actors often fail to capture the intensity, grit and charisma required for these roles.' But for most viewers, it’s real enough and heartbreaking. 'This is an eternal but emotional story portraying ordinary girls who passionately pursued a dream, found friendship and also themselves,' director Kazuya Shiraishi said. 'It gave me a chance to reflect on my own 15-year filmmaking career, what I truly want to be, what kind of films I want to make. I just wanted to tell their story, which is also everyone’s story.' ___ Yuri Kageyama is on X: https://x.com/yurikageyama	https://apnews.com/article/netflix-japan-wrestling-matsumoto-women-entertainment-ad6bc62a6bda08470b0d84381520d87c	2024-10-07T20:39:18-07:00	
Mozambique's presidential election: Here's what to know	MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) — Mozambicans are expected to turn out in large numbers on Wednesday for an election that will choose a successor to President Filipe Nyusi after his two terms. Close to 17 million voters in the southern African nation of 31 million people are registered to vote for the next president along with 250 members of parliament and provincial assemblies. While the ruling Front for the Liberation of Mozambique, or Frelimo, is widely expected to retain power, at least four candidates have been campaigning to bring change to a country which faces a yearslong jihadist insurgency in its north and whose long Indian Ocean coastline is vulnerable to extreme climate conditions like flooding. Over 1.3 million people have been forced to flee their homes due to the insurgency, while millions more have faced severe food shortages due to drought. The local elections held in Mozambique a year ago were marred by allegations of vote-rigging and fraud, sparking violent protests in the capital, Maputo, and surrounding areas. This time, concerns have been muted. Here's what to know about Wednesday's vote: Who is running? The ruling Frelimo party, which has been in power since independence from Portugal in 1975, has fielded David Chapo as its presidential candidate. The 47-year-old Chapo is a former governor of the southern province of Inhambane, a strong driver of the country's tourism economy. Chapo is expected to face the most competition from 50-year-old Venacio Mondlane, a banker and forestry engineer who runs as an independent candidate under the slogan 'Save Mozambique, this country’s ours' and has drawn large crowds. Mondlane is backed by the Optimistic Party for the Development of Mozambique, or Podemos, set up by dissidents from the ruling party. He ran as a mayoral candidate in local elections last year, and his supporters alleged that he won but was robbed. The Democratic Movement of Mozambique has fielded Lutero Simango. His party was created in 2008, breaking away from the rebel group-turned-opposition party Mozambique National Resistance, or Renamo. Simango's party resonates with youth because of its policies on inequality and jobs. Renamo is represented by Ossufo Momade, who became the party's head after the death of the charismatic Afonso Dhlakama, a former rebel leader who died in 2018. What are the issues? Mozambique has been fighting an Islamic State-affiliated group that has launched attacks on communities in the northern province of Cabo Delgado since 2017, including beheadings. Around 600,000 of the 1.3 million people who fled have since returned home, many to shattered communities where houses, markets, churches, schools and health facilities have been destroyed, the United Nations said earlier this year. The candidates have promised to address development issues exacerbated by the insurgency, including the halting of a crucial gas project by French energy company TotalEnergies in northern Mozambique as a result of the extremist rebel insurgency there. Mozambique also faces high levels of unemployment and hunger, exacerbated by El Nino-induced severe drought. According to the U.N. World Food Program, 1.3 million people face severe food shortages. The ruling Frelimo party has been tainted by corruption scandals, including the so-called 'tuna bond' scandal in which former finance minister Manuel Chang was jailed earlier this year for taking payoffs to arrange secret loan guarantees for government-controlled fishing companies. The loans were plundered, and Mozambique ended up with $2 billion in 'hidden debt,' spurring a financial crisis as the International Monetary Fund halted financial support. When will we know the election winner? There is just one day of voting and counting starts immediately, with partial results announced as they trickle in. Official results will be announced by the National Election Commission after 15 days and subsequently validated by the Constitutional Council. Any party may file objections with the council, which will decide whether they have merit. ___ Magome reported from Johannesburg. ___ Follow AP's Africa coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/africa	https://apnews.com/article/mozambique-elections-president-nyusi-insurgency-climate-explainer-35d66b57f691671c343185dc5c493dd7	2024-10-07T19:10:35-07:00	
Israel's strikes are shifting the power balance in the Middle East, with US support	WASHINGTON (AP) — Israeli military strikes are targeting Iran's armed allies across a nearly 2,000-mile stretch of the Middle East and threatening Iran itself. The efforts raise the possibility of an end to two decades of Iranian ascendancy in the region, to which the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq inadvertently gave rise. In Washington, Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, and Arab capitals, opponents and supporters of Israel's offensive are offering clashing ideas about what the U.S. should do next, as its ally racks up tactical successes against Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthis in Yemen and presses its yearlong campaign to crush Hamas in Gaza. Israel should get all the support it needs from the United States until Iran's government 'follows other dictatorships of the past into the dustbin of history,' said Richard Goldberg, a senior adviser at Washington's conservative-leaning Foundation for the Defense of Democracies — calls echoed by some Israeli political figures. Going further, Yoel Guzansky, a former senior staffer at Israel’s National Security Council, called for the Biden administration to join Israel in direct attacks in Iran. That would send 'the right message to the Iranians — ‘Don’t mess with us,’'' Guzansky said. Critics, however, highlight lessons from the U.S. military campaign in Iraq and toppling of Saddam Hussein, when President George W. Bush ignored Arab warnings that the Iraqi dictator was the region's indispensable counterbalance to Iranian influence. They caution against racking up military victories without adequately considering the risks, end goals or plans for what comes next, and warn of unintended consequences. Ultimately, Israel 'will be in a situation where it can only protect itself by perpetual war,' said Vali Nasr, who was an adviser to the Obama administration. Now a professor at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, or SAIS, he has been one of the leading documenters of the rise of Iranian regional influence since the U.S. invasion of Iraq. With Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu giving limited weight to Biden administration calls for restraint, the United States and its partners in the Middle East are 'at the mercy of how far Bibi Netanyahu will push it,' Nasr said, referring to the Israeli leader by his nickname. 'It's as if we hadn't learned the lessons, or the folly, of that experiment ... in Iraq in 2003 about reshaping the Middle East order,' said Randa Slim, a fellow at SAIS and researcher at the Washington-based Middle East Institute. Advocates of Israel’s campaign hope for the weakening of Iran and its armed proxies that attack the U.S., Israel and their partners, oppress civil society and increasingly are teaming up with Russia and other Western adversaries. Opponents warn that military action without resolving the grievances of Palestinians and others risks endless and destabilizing cycles of war, insurgency and extremist violence, and Middle East governments growing more repressive to try to control the situation. And there’s the threat that Iran develops nuclear weapons to try to ensure its survival. Before the Israeli strikes on Hezbollah, Iranian leaders concerned about Israel’s offensives had made clear that they were interested in returning to negotiations with the U.S. on their nuclear program and claimed interest in improved relations overall. In just weeks, Israeli airstrikes and intelligence operations have devastated the leadership, ranks and arsenals of Lebanon-based Hezbollah — which had been one of the Middle East’s most powerful fighting forces and Iran's overseas bulwark against attacks on Iranian territory — and hit oil infrastructure of Yemen's Iran-allied Houthis. A year of Israeli airstrikes in Gaza appears to have reduced the leadership of Iranian-allied Hamas to a few survivors hiding in underground tunnels. However, Israeli forces again engaged in heavy fighting there this week, and Hamas was able to fire rockets at Tel Aviv in a surprising show of enduring strength on the Oct. 7 anniversary of the militant group's attack on Israel, which started the war. Anticipated Israeli counterstrikes on Iran could accelerate regional shifts in power. The response would follow Iran launching ballistic missiles at Israel last week in retaliation for killings of Hezbollah and Hamas leaders. It also could escalate the risk of all-out regional war that U.S. President Joe Biden — and decades of previous administrations — worked to avert. The expansion of Israeli attacks since late last month has sidelined mediation by the U.S., Egypt and Qatar for a cease-fire and hostage release deal in Gaza. U.S. leaders say Israel did not warn them before striking Hezbollah leaders in Lebanon but have defended the surge in attacks, while still pressing for peace. Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, said in an interview with CBS' '60 Minutes' aired Monday that the U.S. was dedicated to supplying Israel with the military aid needed to protect itself but would keep pushing to end the conflict. 'We’re not going to stop in terms of putting that pressure on Israel and in the region, including Arab leaders,' she said. Israel’s expanded strikes raise for many what is the tempting prospect of weakening Iran’s anti-Western, anti-Israel alliance with like-minded armed groups in Lebanon, Iraq, Syria and Yemen to governments in Russia and North Korea. Called the 'Axis of Resistance,' Iran's military alliances grew — regionally, then globally — after the U.S. invasion of Iraq removed Saddam, who had fought an eight-year war against Iran's ambitious clerical regime. Advocates of the U.S. invasion of Iraq, and overthrow of Saddam, said correctly that an Iraqi democracy would take hold. But the unintended effects of the U.S. intervention were even bigger, including the rise of Iran's Axis of Resistance and new extremist groups, including the Islamic State. 'An emboldened and expansionist Iran appears to be the only victor' of the 2003 Iraq war, notes a U.S. Army review of lessons learned. 'Two decades ago, who could have seen a day when Iran was supporting Russia with arms? The reason is because of its increased influence' after the U.S. overthrow of Saddam, said Ihsan Alshimary, professor of political science at Baghdad University. Even more than in 2003, global leaders are offering little clear idea on how the shifts in power that Israel’s military is putting in motion will end — for Iran, Israel, the Middle East at large, and the United States. Iran and its allies are being weakened, said Goldberg, at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies. So is U.S. influence as it appears to be dragged along by Israel, Nasr said. The conflict could end up hurting Israel if it bogs down in a ground war in Lebanon, for example, said Mehran Kamrava, a professor and Middle East expert at Georgetown University in Qatar. After four decades of deep animosity between Israeli and Iranian leaders, 'the cold war between them has turned into a hot war. And this is significantly changing — is bound to change — the strategic landscape in the Middle East,' he said. 'We are certainly at the precipice of change,' Kamrava said. But 'the direction and nature of that change is very hard to predict at this stage.' ___ AP reporters Julia Frankel in Jerusalem and Qassim Abdul-Zahra in Baghdad contributed.	https://apnews.com/article/iran-israel-middle-east-war-united-states-36d7c0bbc35964ed6ac9d21de17c632a	2024-10-07T19:05:55-07:00	
Stock market today: Wall Street claws back some of its losses	U.S. stocks are clawing back some of their losses from the day before as falling oil prices release some of the pressure that’s built up on the market. The S&amp;P 500 was 0.5% higher in early trading Tuesday and pulling closer to its all-time high set early last week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 130 points, or 0.3%, and nearing its own record. The Nasdaq composite was 0.5% higher. Markets around the world sank following scary swings in China, as euphoria about possible stimulus for the world’s second-largest economy gave way to disappointment. THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP’s earlier story follows below. Wall Street pushed higher early Tuesday even though Hong Kong's Hang Seng market plunged more than 9% after Beijing refrained from major spending initiatives as China's economy slows. Futures for the S&amp;P 500 rose 0.4% before the bell, while futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average inched up 0.2%. Rising bond yields, which sent stocks tumbling on Monday, stabilized early Tuesday and oil prices fell after five straight days of gains. U.S. stocks are hovering near record territory out of relief that interest rates are finally heading back down now that the Federal Reserve has widened its focus to include keeping the economy humming instead of just fighting high inflation. When Treasury bonds, which are seen as the safest possible investments, are paying more in interest, investors become less inclined to pay very high prices for stocks and other riskier investments. For investors, it is difficult to ignore that a 10-year Treasury is paying a 4.03% yield, up from 3.62% three weeks ago. The yield on the two-year Treasury, which more closely tracks expectations for the Fed, ticked down to 3.98% on Tuesday after jumping to 3.99% a day earlier. Treasury yields may also be feeling upward push from the recent jump in oil prices. Crude prices have been surging on fears that worsening tensions in the Middle East could ultimately disrupt the global flow of oil. Benchmark U.S. crude slipped $1.62 to $75.52. It had gained 3.7% on Monday and is up nearly 11% in October. Brent crude, the international standard, shed $1.68 to $79.25 per barrel. It had also jumped 3.7% Monday. With earning season kicking off, PepsiCo shares fell 1% after it lowered its organic revenue forecast for the year. U.S. consumers continue to pull back on buying its snacks and drinks after years of price increases. DocuSign jumped 5.6% after S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices announced the electronic document signing company would join the S&amp;P MidCap 400. DocuSign will replace MDU Resources, which will be bumped down to the S&amp;P SmallCap 600 after announcing last week that it was spinning off its construction services subsidiary, Everus Construction Group. In Asia, the Hang Seng index lost 9.4% to close at 20,926.79. Technology and China-related shares led the decline. Shares initially soared 10% in Shanghai on Tuesday but then slid back a bit as details of economic stimulus plans from officials in Beijing fell short of what investors were hoping for. The Shanghai Composite index closed 4.6% higher, at 3,489.78. In Shenzhen, Japan’s smaller market, the main index gained 8.9%. Hong Kong shares had logged strong gains over the past week while markets in mainland China were closed for a weeklong holiday and reopened Tuesday. The advances were fueled by recent announcements of Beijing's plans for more support for the economy and for financial markets. 'China’s markets rally has hit a wall, leaving investors deflated. The reopening surge from the week-long holiday barely had time to gather steam before fizzling out, and now the once-thrilled bulls are licking their wounds,' Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management said in a commentary. Shares in food delivery company Meituan tumbled 15.5% while e-commerce giant Alibaba sank 8.8%. It's rival JD.com plunged 11.9%. In other Asian trading, Tokyo's Nikkei 225 index lost 1% to 38,937.54. as the dollar fell to 147.79 Japanese yen from 148.18 yen. A stronger yen tends to pull share prices lower since it hurts profits of heavyweight export manufacturers. The Kospi in Seoul declined 0.6% to 2,594.36. Australia's S&amp;P/ASX 200 dropped 0.4% to 8,176.90. In early European trading, Germany’s DAX lost 0.2%, the CAC 40 in Paris shed 0.6% and London's FTSE 100 declined 1.1%. The euro rose a touch to $1.0979 from $1.0977. ___ AP Business Writer Zen Soo in Hong Kong contributed.	https://apnews.com/article/stocks-markets-treasury-china-rates-c1c41b35ddbb4fd0bf93ee93df1f1a2c	2024-10-07T18:45:23-07:00	
Votes are being counted in the election for a truncated government in Indian-controlled Kashmir	SRINAGAR, India (AP) — Votes were being counted Tuesday in the recent election for a largely powerless local government in Indian-controlled Kashmir, the first since Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government stripped the disputed region of its special status five years ago. Thousands of additional police and paramilitary soldiers patrolled roads and guarded 28 counting centers as officials tallied votes. A final result was expected to be declared later Tuesday by the region’s electoral office. Nearly 8.9 million people were eligible to vote in the election that began on Sept. 18 and concluded on Oct. 1. The overall turnout was 64% across the three phases, according to official data. It was first such vote in a decade and the first since Modi’s Hindu nationalist government scrapped the Muslim-majority region’s long-held semi-autonomy in 2019. The unprecedented move downgraded and divided the former state into two centrally governed union territories, Ladakh and Jammu-Kashmir. Both are ruled directly by New Delhi through its appointed administrators along with unelected bureaucrats and security setup. The move — which largely resonated in India and among Modi supporters — was mostly opposed in Kashmir as an assault on its identity and autonomy amid fears that it would pave way for demographic changes in the region. The region has since been on edge with civil liberties curbed and media gagged. India and Pakistan each administer a part of Kashmir, but both claim the territory in its entirety. The nuclear-armed rivals have fought two of their three wars over the territory since they gained independence from British colonial rule in 1947. Early results may give an indication of the vote's direction. However, exit polls by major television channels in last two days projected the regional National Conference emerging as a single largest party followed by the Modi’s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party. Such mandate is likely to be seen as a referendum against Modi's 2019 move. The National Conference fought the election in alliance with India’s main opposition Congress party. Their coalition may still need support of some seats to form the government, that is likely to come from Peoples Democratic Party, another Kashmiri group. Five seats are appointed and 90 elected, so a party or coalition would need at least 48 of the 95 total seats to form a government. The vote will allow Kashmir to have its own truncated government and a regional legislature, called an assembly, rather than being directly under New Delhi’s rule. However, there will be a limited transition of power from New Delhi to the assembly as Kashmir will remain a 'union territory' — directly controlled by the federal government — with India’s Parliament as its main legislator. Kashmir’s statehood must be restored for the new government to have powers similar to other states of India. The region’s last assembly election was held in 2014, after which the BJP for the first time ruled in a coalition with the local Peoples Democratic Party. But the government collapsed in 2018, after the BJP withdrew from the coalition. Polls in the past have been marked with violence, boycotts and vote-rigging, even though India called them a victory over separatism. Militants in the Indian-controlled portion of Kashmir have been fighting New Delhi’s rule since 1989. Many Muslim Kashmiris support the rebels’ goal of uniting the territory, either under Pakistani rule or as an independent country. India insists the Kashmir militancy is Pakistan-sponsored terrorism. Pakistan denies the charge, and many Kashmiris consider it a legitimate freedom struggle. Tens of thousands of civilians, rebels and government forces have been killed in the conflict. ___ This version has corrected that there are 95 seats, 90 of them elected and five appointed, and 48 would be a majority. ___ Follow AP's Asia-Pacific coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/asia-pacific	https://apnews.com/article/kashmir-election-india-counting-votes-5590ef6cd2810cb16308f6efcdea23f4	2024-10-07T18:18:55-07:00	
No evidence of major fuel spill on Samoan reef where New Zealand navy ship sank	WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — Divers and marine experts found no evidence of a major fuel spill on a Samoan reef Tuesday after a New Zealand navy ship ran aground and sank, Samoa's deputy prime minister said. All 75 people on board the HMNZS Manawanui evacuated safely as the boat foundered about a mile off the coast of Upolu, Samoa, early Sunday. The ship was one of only nine in New Zealand’s navy and was the first the country lost at sea since World War II. Samoan Deputy Prime Minister Tuala Tevaga Iosefo Ponifasio had earlier said a fuel spill was 'highly probable.' But he said Tuesday there was no evidence of oil spilling onto the reefs, ashore and nearby area, except for 'small leakages of oil coming from the vessel.' That had been contained using specialized equipment, Ponifasio said in a statement. The vessel's passengers — including civilian scientists and foreign military personnel — left the vessel on life boats in 'challenging conditions' and darkness, New Zealand’s Chief of Navy Rear Admiral Garin Golding told reporters. It took five hours for the first survivors to reach land, he said. One person was treated in a hospital for minor injuries and has been discharged, the military said. Up to 17 others sustained cuts, bruises or suspected concussions. An Air Force plane carrying 72 people from the ship landed at an air base in Auckland on Monday night. New Zealand will hold a court of inquiry into the loss of the ship. The cause of the accident is not known, but Defense Minister Judith Collins told 1News on Monday that she had been told a loss of power to the vessel had led to its grounding. The specialist dive and hydrographic vessel had been in service for New Zealand since 2019, but was 20 years old and had previously belonged to Norway, Collins said. It was surveying a reef off the coast of Upolu, Samoa’s most populous island, when it ran aground on the reef and began taking on water. Photos and videos taken from the shore appeared to show the ship listing before disappearing completely below the waves, with a large plume of smoke rising where it sank. Manu Percival, a surfing tour guide who works in the area where the ship sank, told The Associated Press by phone that oil was not visible from the ship but debris had littered the water and shoreline, and locals were not gathering shellfish as they normally did. It was too soon to know if the 'fragile' reef ecosystem had been damaged, he said. Ponifasio said marine scientists were testing water samples from nearby beaches for any traces of oil. The military said the ship, purchased for $100 million NZ dollars ($61 million) in 2018, was not covered by replacement insurance. The state of New Zealand’s aging military hardware has prompted warnings from the defense agency, which in a March report described the navy as 'extremely fragile,' with ships idle due to problems retaining the staff needed to service and maintain them. Of the navy’s eight remaining ships, five are currently operational. Golding said the HMNZS Manawanui underwent a maintenance period before the deployment. The ship’s captain was an experienced commander who had worked on the vessel for two years, he said. ___ Follow AP's Asia-Pacific coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/asia-pacific	https://apnews.com/article/samoa-new-zealand-navy-ship-sinks-efca9775d80b63eaa31a81df434176e7	2024-10-07T17:25:39-07:00	
Lore Segal, esteemed Austrian American writer who fled the Nazis as a child, dies at 96	NEW YORK (AP) — Lore Segal, an esteemed Viennese American author and translator whose gift for words helped her family escape from the Nazis and who later drew upon her experiences as a Jewish refugee and immigrant for such fiction as 'Other People's Houses' and 'Her First American,' died Monday at 96. Segal, a longtime resident of Manhattan's Upper West Side, died in her apartment after a brief illness, her publisher Melville House said in a statement. After settling in the U.S. in 1951, Segal wrote novels, short stories, essays and children's books and translated the Bible and Grimms' fairy tales, which featured illustrations by her friend Maurice Sendak. Her life — filtered through memory and imagination — was her greatest muse. 'Other People's Houses,' released in 1964 and originally serialized in the New Yorker, closely followed her childhood in Austria, her years in foster care in London during World War II and her arrival in New York, where the growing familiarity with the city’s sights and sounds — 'charged thus upon the air' — makes the 'alien into a citizen.' 'Her First American' continued her early experiences in the U.S., while 'Lucinella' was a comic novella inspired by her time in the 1970s at the Yaddo artist retreat in upstate New York. Segal, who taught at Columbia University, Princeton University and several other schools, satirized academic life in 'Shakespeare's Kitchen.' In 2019, she compiled her fiction and nonfiction in the anthology 'The Journal I Did Not Keep,' in which she summarized the importance and imperfection of recapturing the past. 'I believe that the act of remembering and telling the story of what he remember will always be to some extent fatal to the thing remembered,' she wrote. 'So what really happened?' Her many admirers included such author-critics as Cynthia Ozick, Vivian Gornick and Alfred Kazin. In 2008, she was a Pulitzer Prize finalist for her novel 'Shakespeare’s Kitchen.' The American Academy of Arts and Letters inducted her in 2023. Gornick would cite her 'ironic intelligence' and 'gift for detachment.' In her fiction, Segal set a tone that was even, objective and occasionally cutting, like her description of an artist in 'Lucinella' who 'tends to mumble her words inside her mouth, so as to keep the option of eating them.' She could also be intimate and familiar, with such recurring characters as her alter ego Ilka, a Viennese refugee; and Carter Bayoux, a Black intellectual with whom Ilka has an affair in 'Her First American.' Her narratives were often sustained through passages of overheard conversation, whether at a literary cocktail party in Harlem or a gathering of faculty members in Connecticut. Several stories in her 2023 collection 'Ladies' Lunch' were structured around the midday meals of friends in advanced old age who share memories, regrets, fears and everyday concerns. 'I like writing dialogue,' she told the online publication The Millions in 2019. 'I like it better than explaining. I’d rather have a character develop and express him or herself through dialogue than explaining what they’re thinking. It’s a preference. I like how we discover and uncover ourselves through dialogue. I tell my students, you see any two people together, walk behind them, listen, get the tone of their voice.' Besides her books, Segal wrote for The New York Times, The New Republic, the Forward and other publications. The children's story 'When Mole Lost His Glasses,' with drawings by Sergio Ruzzier, was adapted into an educational video featuring Spike Lee and then-New York Knick Stephon Marbury. Segal married the literary editor David Segal in 1961 and had two children. Her husband died of a heart attack in 1970. She was born Lore Groszmann in Vienna in 1928, and grew up in a prosperous neighborhood until the Nazis annexed the country a decade later and antisemitism drove her family to ship her off on the Kindertransport to London, a time Segal and her mother would discuss in Mark Jonathan Harris’ Academy Award-winning documentary 'Into the Arms of Strangers.' Separation somehow empowered her. Inquisitive and often impulsive, she wrote so many letters to British authorities that they granted her parents the rare privilege of letting them join her in London, where they worked as domestic servants. Lore stayed with a series of families, including one whose incomprehension of her past inspired her first real storytelling. 'It seemed to me they had no idea of what it was like to live in Vienna under Hitler,' Segal told The Associated Press in 2011. 'They were asking me questions that didn’t seem to be relevant. They had some profound lack of information. So I got hold of one of those little exercise books, homework books. I filled the 36 pages in German with the story, which is essentially the story of ‘Other People’s Houses.’' After the war, Segal graduated from the University of London’s Bedford College and lived briefly in the Dominican Republic — where other family members had settled — until allowed in the United States. Before becoming a writer, she discovered the various careers she was not meant for: She was a 'bad file clerk,' a 'bad secretary' and 'pretty bad textile designer.' Writing, at first, also didn't seem to work because she believed she had nothing to say. She had never been in love and thought 'no big things' had happened to her, not even during the war. Her breakthrough came in a class at the New School for Social Research in New York. 'After the class we all kept meeting and doing our own creative writing class,' Segal told the AP. 'And somebody said to me, ‘How did you get to America?’ And I began to tell the stories. And there was that experience, of people listening. It was lovely. Nobody had ever done that. Most people don’t have that experience, their story being valued.'	https://apnews.com/article/lore-segal-dies-a1a1ba9ff4954c83a8f14fbf297b789b	2024-10-07T12:56:46-07:00	
Tunisia's President Saied wins landslide reelection after cracking down on opponents	TUNIS, Tunisia (AP) — Tunisia’s President Kais Saied won a landslide reelection victory in results announced Monday after a campaign season that saw his opponents jailed alongside journalists, activists and attorneys. The North African country’s Independent High Authority for Elections, known as ISIE, said Monday evening that Saied had won 90.7% of the vote. Saied's closest challenger, businessman Ayachi Zammel, won 7.4% of the vote after sitting behind for the majority of campaign season facing multiple prison sentences for election-related crimes. University of Tunis law professor Sghayer Zakraoui said the results were reminiscent of Tunisia under President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, who ruled the country for more than 20 years before becoming the first dictator toppled in the Arab Spring uprisings. Saied received a larger vote share than Ben Ali did in 2009, two years before fleeing the country amid protests. 'We’re heading for totalitarian, even dictatorial power,' Zakraoui told The Associated Press. Election officials reported 28.8% voter turnout — a significantly smaller showing than the first round of the country's two other post-Arab Spring elections and an indication of apathy plaguing the country's 9.7 million eligible voters. The turnout and Saied's margin of victory reflected how his supporters participated in Sunday’s race while the majority of his detractors chose to boycott. Fewer Tunisians voted for Saied in this year's race than in the second round of his first election. 'He will re-enter office undermined rather than empowered by these elections,' Tarek Megerisi, a senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations, wrote on X. Yet the president and his supporters hailed the result as an endorsement of his efforts to transform Tunisia, eliminate corruption and redistribute power away from the country's reviled political class, including both those in power before the Arab Spring and those who entered politics immediately after. 'We’re going to cleanse the country of all the corrupt and schemers,' Saied said at his campaign headquarters on Sunday after exit polls showed him with a massive lead. Such remarks echoed those he has made throughout his tenure, in which he used overtly populist appeals to accuse his detractors of being part of foreign or domestic plots to undermine Tunisia. As the president and his supporters celebrated, his detractors pledged to keep opposing his rule. Amri Sofien, a freelance filmmaker, said after she heard that Saied had trounced his two opponents so substantially she thought political turmoil and protests wouldn't die down. 'It’s possible that after 20 years our kids will protest on Avenue Habib Bourguiba to tell him to get out,' she said, referring to the capital's main thoroughfare. 'There is no hope in this country.' It was Tunisia’s third presidential race since the 2011 Arab Spring, when protests for 'bread, freedom and dignity' led to Ben Ali's ouster and paved the way for the country's transition into a multiparty democracy. In the years that followed, Tunisia enshrined a new constitution, created a Truth and Dignity Commission to bring justice to citizens tortured under the former regime and saw its leading civil society groups win the Nobel Peace Prize for brokering political compromise. But its new leaders were unable to buoy its flailing economy and quickly became unpopular amid constant political infighting and episodes of terrorism and political violence. Amid that backdrop, Saied — then 61, a political outsider and a populist — won his first term in 2019. As the economy continued to struggle, he began dismantling Tunisia's new democratic institutions midway through his tenure. In July 2021, he declared a state of emergency, suspended parliament and rewrote the constitution to consolidate the power of the presidency — a series of actions his detractors likened to a coup. In the years that followed, voter turnout plummeted in the parliamentary and local elections. Authorities unleashed a wave of repression on the country’s once-vibrant civil society. In 2023, some of his most prominent opponents from across the political spectrum were thrown in prison, including right-wing leader Abir Moussi and Islamist Rached Ghannouchi, the co-founder of the party Ennahda and former speaker of Tunisia’s parliament. Dozens of others were imprisoned on charges including inciting disorder, undermining state security and violating a controversial anti-fake news law critics say has been used to stifle dissent. The pace of the arrests picked up earlier this year, when authorities began targeting additional lawyers, journalists, activists, migrants from sub-Saharan Africa and the former head of the post-Arab Spring Truth and Dignity Commission. 'The authorities seemed to see subversion everywhere,' said Michael Ayari, senior analyst for Algeria &amp; Tunisia at the International Crisis Group. Dozens of candidates had expressed interest in challenging the president, and 17 submitted preliminary paperwork to run in Sunday’s race. However, members of the election commission approved only the three. Upon publication of the final list of candidates, Zammel was promptly jailed. The role of the commission and its members, all of whom are appointed by the president, came under scrutiny during the campaign season. They defied court rulings ordering them to reinstate three candidates they had previously rejected. The parliament subsequently passed a law stripping power from the administrative courts.	https://apnews.com/article/tunisia-kais-saied-wins-reelection-landslide-55f379cf7ecc2a996a8586e9f7a67b98	2024-10-07T09:29:05-07:00	
Florence Pugh and Andrew Garfield on living through 'We Live in Time'	TORONTO (AP) — In 'We Live in Time,' Florence Pugh and Andrew Garfield act an entire life of a relationship — a gamut of dating, falling in love, having a child and reckoning with cancer. So when Garfield recently went on a six-day retreat in the woods without his phone, one of his first texts was to his co-star. 'I came out and I sent Florence a message. I just felt compelled,' Garfield says. 'When you reconnect with yourself, you reconnect with a bunch of stuff that matters to you. And I was just like, man, I haven’t let Florence know for a few months how much this film and this time with her meant to me.' 'We Live in Time,' directed by John Crowley ( 'Brooklyn,' 'The Goldfinch') and penned by playwright Nick Payne, is the kind of movie that provokes an emotional response, including for its two stars. In playing their characters, Almut and Tobias, across a decade of time, 'We Live in Time' poignantly condenses, and remixes into a non-linear narrative, a wide spectrum of life. Right alongside each other are sex and heartbreak, stolen moments and life-changing ones, birth and death. It was enough to go through together as actors that Pugh and Garfield, when they spoke the morning of the film’s premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival last month, were still mourning it. 'I’ve never had this happen before in this way. We’ve literally spent the last two days trying to unpack it and everybody wants us to unpack it. And we don’t know,' says Pugh. 'When we finished the movie, every scene that got closer and closer to the end, it became harder and harder to process that we weren’t going to be able to do it anymore.' As two of the most in-demand actors of their generation, Pugh, 28, and Garfield, 41, have transformed themselves into all kinds of roles. They have donned Marvel costumes and joined period ensembles. Pugh was memorably outfitted in an elaborate flower dress for 'Midsommar.' But 'We Live in Time,' which A24 opens in theaters Friday, is a particularly unadorned view of two of the best actors working. It’s the first film in which Garfield has used his real voice. 'They’re two very beautiful creatures to look at, and have looked fantastically beautiful on screen — and do look very beautiful in this, by the way, just not in a glammed-up, aspirational fashion,' says Crowley. 'They’re also both British actors who have made significant inroads in American cinema, and to some eyes, people might only know them from that. To have them speak in their own accents allowed those roles to fall back much closer to them.' Chemistry can be a tricky thing to pin down. Crowley, whose 2007 film 'Boy A' was Garfield’s feature film debut, cast Garfield first. After that came Pugh. Crowley prefers to keep dress rehearsals subdued in order to save the energy for shooting. But there were, he says, 'flickers of something very special' between them. 'Much like two championship tennis players warming up, they couldn’t not once in a while hit the ball in an extraordinary way and have the other person hit it back,' says Crowley. In an interview together, the connection between Garfield and Pugh was abundantly clear. Their reaction to the meme that sprung from the movie's first image (in which a carousel horse appeared to be their uninvited co-star), was, itself, a viral video that hinted at their natural comic patter. But whatever chemistry is, Garfield is more inclined to attribute it to staying present as actors. 'You can’t predict it. I knew Florence was a magnificent actor. But that’s all I knew. I didn’t know whether we’d work together well. Neither of us did,' Garfield says. 'But for me, honestly, it exceeded my expectations. It’s an incomparable thing. There’s no way of comparing my experience with Florence with any other experience I’ve had. 'I said this to Florence last night, I was like, ‘It’s weirdly, in a way, one performance. It’s like we’re stitched together.’' For Pugh, chemistry is about showing up with the right intentions. 'We were willing and wanting to do that for each other,' says Pugh. 'There’s plenty of times when you’re willing to do it and someone isn’t. And that’s also fine because you can also create your own chemistry with yourself, I suppose. 'But it’s so much more hard work and much less fun,' adds Garfield, smiling. 'Just like self-pleasure.' In some ways, Garfield and Pugh were living alongside 'We Live in Time' and experiencing some of its chapters of life with their characters, albeit from different perspectives. When Almut is diagnosed with late-stage ovarian cancer, she is forced to make difficult decisions that weigh having children with her ambition as a chef. 'If you want to be successful, if you want to actually give your career a good crack at it, you’re going to be running through the time that is most optimum for having children,' says Pugh. 'It’s stuff that I’m now having to figure out since we made the movie, since the movie’s coming out. It’s for all ages of women that are trying to navigate this unbelievably tricky dilemma.' Some of the challenges faced by Almut and Tobias were deeply familiar to the actors. Garfield’s mother died of cancer in 2019. Others took more imagination. Neither Garfield or Pugh have children, but a lengthy birth scene, in a gas station bathroom, is the movie’s most show-stopping moment. To experience Almut’s cancer treatment, Pugh was convinced she needed to cut her hair. Crowley filmed Garfield cutting Pugh's hair for the scene. 'I wanted this to be gone now so I knew how she feels in these scenes that I’ve read in the script and thought about, but that I can’t imagine how she felt yet,' Pugh says, pointing at her hair. 'I loved that day. It was a very powerful day.' The experience has left both actors trying to hold onto something from 'We Live in Time.' Garfield began the interview by opening up a book, offering a poem and then reading aloud Kabir’s 'To Be a Slave of Intensity.' 'Just to remind myself that I’m a person, I guess,' he explains. 'And because this film is about being as vitality alive as humanly possible. I think it’s really hard to remember how to do that sometimes — a lot of the time. In fact, it’s all set up against us doing it. So we need practices to keep us in touch with that.' If 'We Live in Time' is ultimately about making peace with the fleeting nature of all that’s precious, and trying to appreciate those moments when they’re happening, Garfield is doing his best to carry on that mentality and be grateful for the time he and Pugh had together. 'Every relationship is sacred. Every deep intimacy is sacred,' Garfield says. 'And I think it’s such an amazing thing and a brave thing to do to actually address it and go: This is over now. We’re ending this now — much like Tobias and Alma have to do. So I think it all becomes life, art, imitation, whichever way around.'	https://apnews.com/article/florence-pugh-andrew-garfield-we-live-time-9468f8be87b273576b8efd71aa0dd80d	2024-10-07T09:22:28-07:00	
Thousands survived a brutal gang attack in Haiti that killed 70. Now they face an uncertain future	PONT-SONDÉ, Haiti (AP) — Under the cover of night, dozens of gang members crept toward the small town of Pont-Sondé in central Haiti armed with knives and assault rifles as families slept. The gang had traveled from nearby Savien in vehicles they ditched halfway through the trip, climbing into canoes for the last stretch for a quiet approach. Gunfire and screams woke the town. Those not shot dead were stabbed. Fires consumed homes. 'They tried to murder everyone,' said Jina Joseph, who survived. The Gran Grif gang killed babies and young mothers, older people and entire families, angry that a self-defense group had tried to limit gang activity in Pont-Sondé and prevent it from making money off a makeshift toll it had recently established on a nearby road. The gang escaped by foot through nearby rice fields after Thursday's attack, leaving more than 70 bodies strewn through the town. It was the biggest massacre that Haiti’s once peaceful central region had seen in recent history. Thousands now face an uncertain future, stripped of their jobs, homes and families. Jameson Fermilus, who had crouched in a corridor next to his house as smoke and gunfire filled the air, later joined more than 6,000 other survivors who walked for hours, seeking safety. 'We don’t know what we are going to do,' said another who joined them, 60-year-old Sonise Morino. 'We have nowhere to go.' HUNGRY, THIRSTY AND HOMELESS Thousands walked west to the coastal city of Saint-Marc. Days after the massacre, a crowd of men, women and children gathered around a Good Samaritan standing atop his car distributing food and drink. The newly homeless crowded into a church, a school and a public plaza shaded by trees. Those lucky enough to receive food sat on a dusty curb and ate. At night, they curled up on concrete floors and tried to sleep. 'These deaths are unimaginable,' Mayor Myriam Fièvre said as she met with survivors. A majority of the 6,270 people left homeless have found temporary shelter with relatives who live nearby, according to the U.N.’s International Organization for Migration. But more than 750 others have nowhere to go, joining the over 700,000 people already left homeless in recent years by gang violence across Haiti. Inside the school serving as a temporary shelter, one mother leaned against a chalkboard, slowly patting the back of her sleeping baby as she stared into the distance. ‘A MESSAGE SENT’ Massacres of the Pont-Sondé magnitude were once unheard of in Haiti’s central region despite a recent increase in gang violence. Such massacres had been reported only in the capital of Port-au-Prince, 80% of which is under gang control. But things changed when former legislator Prophane Victor began arming young men nearly a decade ago to secure his election and control the area. That led to the creation of the Gran Grif gang, which controls Savien, Pont-Sondé and other places in the Artibonite region, according to the U.N. Victor and the Gran Grif leader, Luckson Elan, were sanctioned by the U.S. last month. Elan also was sanctioned by the U.N. Security Council, which noted that Gran Grif 'is the largest and most powerful' gang in Artibonite, committing nine mass kidnappings from October 2023 to January 2024, including that of 157 people. During that time, Elan killed a woman for refusing to have sex with him, the U.N. said. The gang, whose name means 'Big Claw,' also has some of the highest levels of child recruitment in Haiti, according to the U.N. Gran Grif is one of at least 20 criminal groups that operate in Artibonite, where much of Haiti’s rice and other crops are produced. More than 22,000 people have been forced to flee in recent years as gunmen target farmers and steal crops and livestock, according to the U.N., which has called authorities' response 'inadequate and inconsistent.' In an interview Monday, Romain Le Cour, senior expert on Haiti for the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime, said he worried about the effects last week's massacre might have on other gangs despite a new U.N.-backed mission operating in Haiti. 'It’s a message sent: That they’re more powerful than the others and that they’re ready to use brutal force against the people to make sure that their territorial power and economic control remain untouched,' he said. Le Cour noted that Haitian National Police and the mission led by Kenyan police are struggling as they operate in Port-au-Prince alone. 'It’s going to be even harder to open multiple battlefronts,' he said. 'It’s a massive challenge for the government right now.' Since the massacre, Haiti’s government has deployed armored vehicles, elite police officers and medical supplies to Pont-Sondé and Saint-Marc and Prime Minister Garry Conille visited the lone hospital, overwhelmed with injured patients. On Monday morning, police were still trying to access areas of Pont-Sondé while members of the self-defense group who remained in the town declined to talk. The normally bustling main street remained largely empty. Gunfire rang out in the distance. ___ Coto reported from San Juan, Puerto Rico.	https://apnews.com/article/haiti-gang-attack-pontsonde-3611fcb55c88ec2b213ab8f8c5f4ec1b	2024-10-07T08:32:27-07:00	
Chagos islanders displaced for a US military base protest a deal on their future made without them	LONDON (AP) — Islanders who were forced to leave their remote Indian Ocean home to make way for a U.S. military base half a century ago protested outside the U.K. Parliament on Monday against a deal they say has decided their homeland’s fate without them. The British government announced last week that it is handing the Chagos Islands to Mauritius under an agreement that will see the American naval and bomber base stay on one of the islands, Diego Garcia. Opponents accuse the government of surrendering sovereignty over a British territory. And the deal has left displaced residents uncertain whether they can go home. 'They announced a deal without even consulting us, which is at the center of all this tragedy,' said Frankie Bontemps, who called the U.K.-Mauritius agreement 'history repeating itself.' 'They have a deal which is suitable for them, best for them, of course. And what about the people? What about the people that they ignored like 65 years ago?' The Chagos Islands, a tropical archipelago just south of the equator off the tip of India, have been under British control since 1814. They have been known as the British Indian Ocean Territory since 1965 when they were split off from Mauritius, a then-U.K. colony that gained independence three years later. Britain evicted as many as 2,000 people from the islands in the 1960s and 1970s so the U.S. military could build the Diego Garcia base, which has supported U.S. military operations from Vietnam to Iraq and Afghanistan. In 2008, the U.S. acknowledged it also had been used for clandestine rendition flights of terror suspects. Many of the islanders resettled in Britain and fought unsuccessfully in U.K. courts to return home. Their cause has garnered international support, notably among African nations and within the United Nations. In a non-binding 2019 opinion, the International Court of Justice ruled that the U.K. had unlawfully carved up Mauritius when it agreed to end colonial rule in the late 1960s. The U.N. General Assembly followed that opinion with a resolution demanding that Britain end its 'colonial administration' of the Chagos Islands and return them to Mauritius. Britain’s newly elected Labour government says that without the deal the status of the military base would be under threat from legal challenges. Foreign Secretary David Lammy said the new government 'inherited unfinished business' from the previous Conservative administration, which began negotiations with Mauritius in 2022. 'The status quo was not sustainable,' Lammy told lawmakers in the House of Commons. 'A binding judgement against the U.K. seemed inevitable.' Under the agreement, the U.K. will retain sovereignty of Diego Garcia for an initial period of 99 years, paying Mauritius an undisclosed rent. U.S. President Joe Biden welcomed the deal, saying it 'secures the effective operation of the joint facility on Diego Garcia into the next century.' But Britain’s Conservative opposition said the decision to hand over a piece of U.K. territory sets a worrying precedent for other far-flung possessions including Gibraltar, which is claimed by Spain, and the Falkland Islands, claimed by Argentina. The government strongly denies that. Starmer spokesman Dave Pares said Monday that 'British sovereignty of Gibraltar and the Falkland Islands is not up for negotiation.' The agreement will create a resettlement fund for displaced Chagossians aimed at letting them move back to the islands – apart from Diego Garcia. The U.K. says details of any returns are now the responsibility of Mauritius. 'They shouldn’t have made this deal without asking us what we wanted,' said Jemmy Simon, whose grandparents were expelled from the Chagos Islands. 'It might just be another island to them. It might just be a military base for them. It might just be keeping everybody else safe. But to us, it is home.' ___ Associated Press journalist Kwiyeon Ha contributed to this story.	https://apnews.com/article/chagos-britain-mauritius-american-base-diego-garcia-c5816d6b5cf79dedf4fc6b37376298f8	2024-10-07T07:36:09-07:00	
Pro-Palestinian protesters pitch encampment outside Jewish Democrat's Ohio home	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) — Masked pro-Palestinian demonstrators escalated their harassment of a Jewish congressman on the eve of Monday’s anniversary of the Oct. 7 attack, pitching an encampment outside Ohio Democratic Rep. Greg Landsman ’s Cincinnati residence. Landsman said Monday that the protesters arrived outside his home early Sunday. By evening, they set up tents, cots and sleeping bags in the road and spent the night harassing him and his family members, forcing them to secure a police escort in order to enter and exit safely, the congressman said. 'On the eve of the one-year anniversary of the October 7th terror attacks, when Jews were brutally murdered and kidnapped, these people came to the home of a Jewish family at night, dressed in all black and fully masked,' Landsman said in a statement. He said that he and his daughter would be forced to navigate the encampment in order to attend an Oct. 7 service later Monday. The group Midwest Direct Action 4 Pali! shared a video of the demonstration on Instagram. The video showed masked participants in black marching down the street in front of Landsman's home. Their faces were obscured as they carried white bundles that resembled shrouded bodies and brandished banners representing the numbers in the death toll. The group remained on site Monday, Landman's office said. 'On the eve of the one year mark since the beginning of the genocide in Palestine, local activists in Cincinnati have gathered outside Congressman Greg Landsman’s house to denounce his votes to conceal the death toll and continue funding mass murder in Gaza,' the group said in its post. 'We mark in solemn vigil that we will not rest until the genocide is over and Palestine is free.' Mike Madanat, a spokesman for the group, told The Associated Press that it's unclear how long they would remain at Landsman's home and that they have no intention of leaving anytime soon. Madanat noted that these types of decisions are something they work out 'day to day.' He said the activists involved are members of various groups but are all 'Cincinnati taxpayers' who have joined this action due to the Democrat being 'silent to our calls, post cards and attendance in town halls.' Madanat said the activists realize they are in a residential community and are doing everything they can to respect Landsman's neighbors and the area, including by speaking daily with local police and residents to ensure their actions remain legal. 'This is not and never been something to do with religion,' Madanat said. 'It is strictly about the death toll,' the congressman's 'support of that, the violence and the displacement.' It's not the first time Landsman and his district have been targeted since the conflict began. Just a month into the conflict, protestors placed a poster outside a building near Landsman's district office with his photo and the phrase 'This Ken supports genocide,' alongside other inflammatory language. In July, Landsman toured the Covedale Cemetery Complex in Cincinnati, where 176 Jewish gravestones had been toppled. ___________________ Associated Press writer Bruce Shipkowski contributed reporting from Toms River, New Jersey.	https://apnews.com/article/mideast-war-gaza-hamas-anniversary-ohio-greg-landsman-protest-israel-biden-c89db986dbfdb82e22205375dbec3778	2024-10-07T07:18:36-07:00	
Will global soccer be reshaped after EU's top court issued a major ruling in Lassana Diarra case?	The global soccer transfer market, worth more than $10 billion each season, is facing a revolutionary overhaul or a nuanced evolution following last week's ruling by the European Court of Justice in the Lassana Diarra case. By ruling that some FIFA regulations on player transfers are contrary to EU legislation relating to competition and freedom of movement, the bloc's top court has paved the way for deep changes in the sport's economy. Here is a look at the key elements of the case and the possible impact of the landmark ruling. Who is Lassana Diarra? Lassana Diarra is a former much-traveled footballer whose career saw him play for prestigious clubs such as Chelsea, Paris Saint-Germain and Real Madrid. He represented France 34 times. At one point in his career, Diarra moved to the Russian league. It’s a dispute with Lokomotiv Moscow that triggered the legal case examined by the European Court of Justice (ECJ). How did we get there? Diarra signed a four-year contract with Lokomotiv in 2013. The deal was terminated a year later after he was unhappy with alleged pay cuts. Lokomotiv applied to the FIFA dispute resolution chamber for compensation and the player submitted a counterclaim seeking compensation for unpaid wages. The Court of Arbitration for Sport found the Russian club terminated the contract 'with just cause' and the player had to pay 10.5 million euros ($11.2 million). Diarra said his search for a new team was hampered by FIFA rules stipulating that any new club would be jointly responsible with him for paying compensation to Lokomotiv. Why does the court believe FIFA rules are in breach of EU law? Free movement is a fundamental right of workers in the European Union within the single market. On that basis, the EU’s top court said that the FIFA rules, including the one that resulted in the refusal to provide Diarra with an international transfer certificate (ITC) for a move to Charleroi, restricted his freedom of movement. The court also found that FIFA regulations breached the bloc’s competition law because they aim at restricting and preventing 'cross-border competition which could be pursued by all clubs established in the European Union.' What is the next legal step? The ECJ ruling will now be referred back to the appeal court in Mons, Belgium, which will rule on the Diarra case. This could take years rather than months. Although FIFA said it was satisfied 'that the legality of key principles of the transfer system have been reconfirmed,' Diarra’s lawyers claimed 'total victory.' The judges in Luxembourg acknowledged having stability in player rosters and regularity in competitions are legitimate objectives for FIFA, but that rules must be applied proportionally. Is the Diarra ruling comparable to Bosman? Some analysts have compared it to the ECJ’s 1995 decision on Belgian Jean-Marc Bosman. That ruling removed restrictions placed on foreign EU footballers within national leagues and allowed players in the bloc to move to another club for free when their contracts ended. Those principles had an obviously wider focus than the narrower scope of Diarra, about terminating a contract for cause. For now, the decision on Diarra does not change how the transfer market functions. But many legal experts believe that the ruling will ultimately have major effects on the sport’s economy. 'The decision essentially says the current system is too restrictive and so will have to change,' said Ian Giles, a partner at Norton Rose Fulbright law firm. 'It’s entirely possible this means players will feel they can now break contracts and sign on with new clubs, without the selling club being able to hold them or demand significant transfer fees. This will likely result in reduced transfer fees and more economic power for players — but over time things will have to stabilize to allow clubs to remain economically viable.' It took more than five years after the Bosman ruling for updated FIFA transfer rules to be published in 2001. Some of those debates then will now be revisited. Effect on the European soccer industry A major reset of transfer fee values can seriously affect many smaller market clubs. Bosman already accelerated gaps in wealth and competitive balance across European soccer, which is increasingly dominated by a small group of clubs. They can lure free-agent players with higher signing bonuses and salaries – money that previously would be more widely distributed via transfer fees. Spending by super-wealthy clubs can still reward smaller ones who excel at investing time and expertise in scouting and developing local and global talent: Ajax, Brighton, Genk in Belgium, which nurtured Kevin De Bruyne, Thibaut Courtois and Leandro Trossard. The influential European Club Association, which represents more than 700 teams, sees potential threats to the industry’s health in the fallout from Diarra. Transfer fees and payments to clubs from former players being sold later in their career 'are an efficient and effective means of wealth distribution from bigger clubs to smaller ones,' the ECA noted. Lawfare against FIFA The soccer industry is increasingly a game being played by lawyers in courts and government offices. FIFA is being challenged in several legal arenas, in part because it works (Diarra, Super League, agents regulations ). There is also a growing perception FIFA does not listen before launching projects and that pro-transparency reforms demanded and passed a decade ago are in decline. Within hours of the Diarra ruling Friday, the group of domestic leagues and player unions announced a news conference in Brussels for Oct. 14 to explain their filing to the European Commission. The complaint on competition law grounds argues FIFA adds new and bigger tournaments to the congested calendar without proper consultation. European Leagues and FIFPRO once had a seat at FIFA’s Football Stakeholders Committee that was a key forum for debate, including on the transfer market. FIFA paused the panel in 2021 and soon its president Gianni Infantino pushed for playing World Cups every two years. The idea was resisted by a widespread backlash. The leagues group says the Diarra ruling shows how representation at FIFA is 'becoming legally essential.' FIFA had indicated before Friday it would consult widely on transfer market reforms it believes can focus on specific issues raised by Diarra, rather than a total overhaul. Diarra’s lawyer Jean-Louis Dupont — who also represented Bosman 30 years ago — sees a bigger picture. He appeared to be recruiting for a wider suit against FIFA by claiming 'all professional players have been affected by these illegal rules' and could now seek compensation. ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer	https://apnews.com/article/soccer-diarra-case-explainer-transfers-5cca63020ecd634172e6ba8ef7cda705	2024-10-07T06:23:18-07:00	
Trump and Harris mark somber anniversary of Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack on Israel	FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) — Former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris are marking the first anniversary of the deadliest attack on Jews since the Holocaust as the presidential candidates approach the final weeks of the campaign during a widening conflict in the Middle East. Trump will speak before Jewish community leaders at one of his Florida resorts in the Miami suburb of Doral. Harris will briefly speak to journalists and plant a pomegranate tree with her husband on the grounds of the Vice President’s residence in honor of the 1,200 people, including 46 U.S. citizens, who were killed by Hamas-led militants in the Oct. 7 attack last year. Harris’ husband Doug Emhoff, who is Jewish, will recite a prayer at an event to commemorate the anniversary with the American Jewish Committee. Trump has blamed both Harris and President Joe Biden for the war, arguing their administration empowered Iran, and tried to take advantage of some of the divisions within the Democratic Party with progressives protesting Israel’s military campaign, which has killed more than 41,000 Palestinians. Some of his statements on Israel overlook his association with people who spew antisemitic rhetoric such as far-right activist Nick Fuentes and rapper Ye, formerly known as Kanye West. Trump has also repeatedly said that Jewish voters who vote for Democrats 'should have their head examined' and recently said that if he loses the presidential election to Harris on Nov. 5 'the Jewish people would really have a lot to do with that.' In an excerpt released from an interview with CBS’ '60 Minutes' that will air Monday night, Harris appeared to avoid answering a question about whether Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is considered 'a real close ally,' and said that 'The better question is: Do we have an important alliance between the American people and the Israeli people? And the answer to that question is yes.' Trump’s own relations with Netanyahu have been rocky. They soured after the Israeli prime minister became one of the first world leaders to congratulate President Joe Biden for his 2020 victory, which Trump continues to deny. A few days after the Oct. 7 attack last year, Trump publicly criticized Netanyahu and said he 'was not prepared' for the deadly incursion from Gaza on Oct. 7. Trump said Netanyahu had let the U.S. down just before the U.S. killed top Iranian general Qassem Soleimani in 2020. Since then, the two have met to talk about a cease-fire deal for Gaza. Halie Soifer, head of the Jewish Democratic Council of America, said the conflict in the Middle East — including fighting with Hezbollah and Iran — has left Jewish voters 'with a sense of vulnerability and concern for Israel’s future.' Soifer previously advised Harris on national security issues. But she says Harris has been consistent with the message of commitment to Israel’s defense for the last year, and said Harris and Biden have directed U.S. forces to shoot down Iranian missiles targeting Israel on multiple occasions. ___ Megerian reported from Washington.	https://apnews.com/article/trump-harris-oct-7-hamas-israel-78ba85f87ea89fa93c6537f77ca81b25	2024-10-07T05:06:03-07:00	
The Latest: New analysis says both Trump and Harris' plans would increase the deficit	No one is likely to be happy with the projected higher deficits laid out in a new analysis of Kamala Harris’ and Donald Trump’s economic plans. The analysis released Monday by the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget suggests a Harris presidency could increase the national debt over 10 years by $3.5 trillion. The same analysis says former President Trump’s ideas could heap another $7.5 trillion onto the debt and possibly as much as $15.2 trillion. Follow the AP’s Election 2024 coverage at: https://apnews.com/hub/election-2024. Here’s the latest: For US adversaries, Election Day won’t mean the end to efforts to influence Americans Soon, the ballots will be cast, the polls will close and a campaign marked by assassination attempts, animosity and anxiety will come to an end. But for U.S. adversaries, the work to meddle with American democracy may be entering its most critical phase. Despite all the attention on efforts to spread disinformation in the months before the Nov. 5 election, the hours and days immediately after voting ends could offer foreign adversaries like Russia, Iran and China or domestic extremist groups the best chance to mess with America’s decision. That’s when Americans will go online to see the latest results or share their opinions as the votes are tabulated. And that’s when a fuzzy photo or AI-generated video of supposed vote tampering could do its most damage, potentially transforming online outrage into real-world action before authorities have time to investigate the facts. It’s a threat taken seriously by intelligence analysts, elected officials and tech executives, who say that while there’s already been a steady buildup of disinformation and influence operations, the worst may be yet to come. Many Republicans are skeptical of Turning Point’s ability to get out the vote Turning Point’s representatives have made two things clear in meetings with state and local Republican leaders — Donald Trump has blessed their conservative organization to help lead his get-out-the-vote effort, and local party officials ought to use the group’s new voter mobilization app. Both prospects terrify fellow Republicans. Soaring to prominence after Trump’s unexpected 2016 win, Turning Point earned a reputation for hosting glitzy events, cultivating hard-right influencers and raising prodigious sums of money while enriching the group’s leaders. They’ve had far less success helping Republicans win, especially in their adopted home state of Arizona. Now the organization has leveraged its ties to Trump to expand its influence in a way that could be potentially lucrative. Turning Point has sought to lead an effort to remake the GOP’s get-out-the-vote effort based on the theory that there are thousands of Trump supporters who rarely vote but could be persuaded to in this year’s election. And they are pitching their new mobile app as vital to this effort’s success.	https://apnews.com/article/harris-trump-vance-walz-election-81a24ac1389f5d7a83d064f9e6d358d2	2024-10-07T04:03:58-07:00	
A top official with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz's party quits, a year before the national election	BERLIN (AP) — A top official with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz's party announced his resignation on Monday, citing health problems, a year before an election in which the center-left Social Democrats face an uphill struggle, Kevin Kühnert, 35, has been the Social Democrats' general secretary — the party official responsible for day-to-day political strategy — since late 2021. Scholz led the party to a narrow win in that year's national election. But its poll ratings have dropped sharply since then as the chancellor's coalition with the environmentalist Greens and the pro-business Free Democrats has developed a reputation for constant infighting. Kühnert is a former head of the party's youth organization and was a leader of an unsuccessful campaign in early 2018 against the Social Democrats joining conservative then Chancellor Angela Merkel's final coalition government. In a letter to party members shared on his Instagram feed Monday, Kühnert noted that he had said recently that everyone in the party 'must and will surpass themselves' in the campaign for the next national election, scheduled for September 2025. 'I myself cannot surpass myself at the moment, because unfortunately I am not healthy,' he wrote, without offering details. 'For the foreseeable future, I need the energy that is necessary for my officer and an election campaign to get healthy again. So I am drawing the consequences.' Kühnert said he had informed the party's co-leaders, Saskia Esken and Lars Klingbeil, that he was stepping down on Monday. There was no immediate word on his successor. Kühnert's departure is the second significant personnel change in the governing parties in recent weeks. The two co-leaders of the Greens announced on Sept. 25 that they would step down after the latest in a string of disappointing election results. Their successors will be elected next month. The Social Democrats finished behind the conservative opposition Union bloc and the far-right Alternative for Germany in the European Parliament election in June and also saw dismal results in two of three state elections last month in eastern Germany.	https://apnews.com/article/germany-scholz-party-social-democrats-resignation-498879bf631edf88a94807a71cce6bb4	2024-10-07T03:35:08-07:00	
Ex-Philippine President Duterte to run as mayor despite his drug killings legacy	MANILA, Philippines (AP) — The Philippines's former President Rodrigo Duterte registered Monday to run for mayor of his southern home city despite his notorious legacy over his brutal anti-drugs crackdown that the International Criminal Court is investigating as a possible crime against humanity. Duterte, 79, filed his papers before the Election Commission in Davao city, where he had served as mayor for about two decades before winning the presidency in 2016. His son — incumbent Davao city Mayor Sebastian Duterte — would run as his vice-mayor in next year’s mid-term elections, officials said. More than 6,000 people, mostly poor drug suspects, were killed under a massive police-enforced crackdown against illegal drugs that Duterte oversaw when he was president, according to government pronouncements. But human rights groups say the death toll is considerably higher and should include many unsolved killings by motorcycle-riding gunmen, who may have been deployed by police. Duterte has denied condoning extrajudicial killings of drug suspects, although he has openly threatened suspects with death and has ordered police to shoot suspects who dangerously resist arrest. Despite his administration’s massive crackdown against illegal drugs, Duterte acknowledged that drugs remained a major problem. During his presidential campaign, he vowed to eradicate the drug problem in three to six months but said after winning the presidency that he underestimated the enormity of the problem. Duterte withdrew the Philippines from the ICC in 2019, in a move critics said was an attempt to evade accountability. The ICC prosecutor said the court still has jurisdiction over alleged crimes, while the Philippines was still a member of the court. When Duterte’s turbulent presidential term ended in 2022, he said he would retire from politics, but he has walked back on his public pronouncements multiple times. His daughter, current Vice President Sara Duterte, said in June that her father and two brothers were planning to run for seats in the 24-member Senate. But the former president told reporters in Davao city on Saturday that his frail health could not withstand the rigors of a campaign for any national position. Duterte has remained popular after stepping down from the presidency, but human rights groups and his political opponents would likely campaign hard to block his return to politics. He and his family have also been at odds with his successor, President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., whom he has publicly reviled as a weak leader and a drug addict. Marcos has laughed off Duterte’s allegations and shot back at Duterte as a user of fentanyl, a powerful opioid. Sara Duterte resigned from her posts of education secretary and head of an anti-insurgency body under the Marcos administration in July. It was the latest sign her alliance with Marcos has floundered over key differences, including the Marcos administration’s high-profile pushback against China’s increasingly aggressive actions in the disputed South China Sea. Marcos has strengthened his country’s treaty alliance with the U.S. as his country’s territorial disputes with China flared alarmingly since last year. During his presidency, Duterte nurtured cozy ties with Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian leader Vladimir Putin while lambasting the security policies of the United States and other Western governments.	https://apnews.com/article/philippines-duterte-mayor-election-davao-2607694be5e3fb6a725ace2ef31b9e6a	2024-10-07T03:13:27-07:00

Countries around the world commemorate the anniversary of Hamas attack on Israel	BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) — Vigils, commemorations and acts of remembrance were planned across the world on Monday to mark one year since the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel as world leaders called for an end to antisemitism and the release of Israeli hostages. Last year's surprise cross-border attack, which killed about 1,200 people, caught Israel unprepared on a major Jewish holiday, shattering Israelis’ sense of security and leaving many countries, already on edge over Russia's war in Ukraine, facing the prospect of another major conflict in the Middle East. The nations of Europe, home to many Jewish and Muslim communities, have sought to tamp down both antisemitic and anti-Muslim sentiment in the wake of the Hamas attack and Israel’s subsequent war against the militants in Gaza, which has killed over 41,000 people and displaced around 1.9 million in the embattled coastal territory. The Vatican marked the anniversary of the attacks by taking up a collection for the people of Gaza and publishing a letter from Pope Francis to Catholics in the region, expressing his solidarity. Francis made no mention of Israel, Hamas or the hostages in the letter dated Oct. 7. He referred to the 'fuse of hatred' being ignited one year ago and the spiral of violence that has ensued, insisting that what is needed is dialogue and peace. 'I am with you, the people of Gaza, long embattled and in dire straits. You are in my thoughts and prayers daily,' he wrote. After some comments that upset Israel early on in the conflict, Francis has usually tried to strike an even tone. But he recently suggested Israel was using disproportionate and 'immoral' force in Lebanon and Gaza. He said he was particularly close to those who have been forced to flee their homes to find refuge from bombing, to the mothers weeping over their dead children and those 'who are afraid to look up for fear of fire raining down from the skies.' The German chancellery in Berlin was adorned with a yellow ribbon commemorating the Israeli hostages taken by Hamas, around 100 of whom remain in captivity, with many of them feared dead. The names of the people killed and kidnapped in the attack on Israel were read out in front of the Brandenburg Gate starting at 5:29 a.m. local time in Germany, when Hamas’ onslaught began a year ago. Chancellor Olaf Scholz said to Germany’s 'dear friends in Israel' that 'we feel with you … we stand beside you.' But he also pointed to the suffering of Palestinians in Gaza and said 'the daily experience of violence and hunger is not a basis on which good things can grow.' Scholz said in an address to a conference in Hamburg that Germany is pressing for a cease-fire and the release of the hostages and 'for a political process, even if it is further away than ever.' He said the aim must be a two-state solution that is only possible if a wider conflagration in the region is prevented, adding that Hezbollah and Iran must cease their attacks on Israel. Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni, who has voiced strong support for Israel, commemorated the Oct. 7 anniversary by visiting the main synagogue in Rome and reaffirming Israel’s right to defend itself. She denounced the 'latent and rampant antisemitism' she said has arisen since the Hamas attack, citing in particular pro-Palestinian protests in Italy this past weekend, some of which turned violent. While asserting Israel’s lights to live safely within its borders, Meloni insisted it respect international law and lamented the devastation unleashed by Israeli forces in Gaza. She said Palestinians in Gaza had been 'victims twice over: first of Hamas’ cynicism, which uses them as human shields, and then of Israeli military operations.' French President Emmanuel Macron took to social media Monday to mark the anniversary of the Hamas attacks. 'The pain remains, as vivid as it was a year ago. The pain of the Israeli people. Ours. The pain of wounded humanity,' he said. 'We do not forget the victims, the hostages, or the families with broken hearts from absence or waiting. I send them our fraternal thoughts,' Macron wrote on the social media platform X. He was later expected to receive in Paris some of the family members of hostages held by Hamas. French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot attended a memorial service at the site of the Nova music festival, in Re’im, Israel, where hundreds were killed. Speaking to the families of victims, he expressed France’s support in the face of 'the worst antisemitic massacre in our history since the Holocaust.' 'The joyful dawn of what should have been a day of celebration was suddenly torn apart by unspeakable horror,' he said. In Poland's capital, the Jewish community paid tribute to Alex Dancyg, a Polish-born Yad Vashem historian who was abducted from the Nir Oz kibbutz on Oct. 7 and killed by Hamas. He was remembered as a man who worked for reconciliation and understanding between Poles and Jews, and between Israelis and Palestinians. In Australia, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese attended a vigil in Melbourne, where he walked with members of the Jewish community and lawmakers from across party lines. Thousands attended the vigil. Earlier in the morning, Albanese said the day carried 'terrible pain,' and that his government 'unequivocally' condemned Hamas’ actions. 'Since the atrocities of October 7, Jewish Australians have felt the cold shadows of antisemitism reaching into the present day, and as a nation we say never again,' he said. 'We unequivocally condemn all prejudice and hatred.' In Sydney, opposition leader Peter Dutton — who has vehemently decried Australia’s acceptance of Palestinian refugees — arrived to cheers at a vigil also attended by thousands at which he reiterated his party’s support for Israel. Dutton’s remarks to the crowd echoed those he made earlier Monday, in which he said the Oct. 7 attack 'awoke and exposed an antisemitic rot afflicting Western democracies.' 'Israel has every right to defend its territory and its people from existential threats,' he said. Hundreds of people gathered amid a heavy police presence Monday night at Sydney town hall for a vigil for Palestinian lives lost in the conflict. Thousands of pro-Palestinian protesters had rallied across Australia’s cities on Sunday. In Pakistan's largest city of Karachi, school children took part in a rally on Monday organized by the Pakistan Markazi Muslim League party to protest Israeli airstrikes in the Middle East and show solidarity with Palestinian people living in Gaza and Lebanon. Japanese officials expressed condolences to the Israelis who lost family members in the Hamas attacks, renewing their condemnation of terrorism and demanding the immediate release of all hostages. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi told reporters that Japan is seriously concerned about the continuing critical humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip, and urged all parties including Israel to comply with international humanitarian law and work toward a cease-fire. ___ Associated Press writers Geir Moulson in Berlin, Diane Jeantet in Paris, Nicole Winfield in Rome, Mari Yamaguchi in Tokyo, Vanessa Gera in Warsaw and Charlotte Graham-McLay in Wellington, New Zealand, contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/hamas-attack-israel-anniversary-protests-b8f7428b707f2cf4300405feca0b570e	2024-10-07T02:07:58-07:00	
Ukraine strikes a Russian oil hub as Zelenskyy says the war is in 'a very important phase'	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukraine’s military said it struck a major oil terminal Monday in Crimea that provides fuel for Russia’s war effort as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the war has entered a key phase. Both sides are facing the issue of how to sustain their costly war of attrition — a conflict that started with Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and that shows no signs of a resolution. Ukraine’s General Staff said on social media that the oil terminal in Feodosia, on the south coast of the Russia-occupied Crimea Peninsula, has been supplying the Russian army with fuel and that the strike was part of an ongoing effort to 'undermine the military and economic potential of the Russian Federation.' Russian-installed authorities in the city of Feodosia on the coast of the Black Sea reported a fire at the terminal on Monday morning but did not say what might have caused it. Ukraine has increasingly targeted rear areas that are essential for Russia’s onslaught, now deep into its third year. It has developed long-range drones that have hit oil depots and refineries as well as armories. Ukraine's aim is to impair Russia’s ability to support its front-line units, especially in the eastern Donetsk region where the main Russian battlefield effort is stretching weary Ukrainian forces. Kyiv is still awaiting word from its Western partners on its repeated requests to use the long-range weapons they provide to hit targets on Russian soil. Developments on that question could come next weekend at Ramstein Air Base in Germany, when defense leaders from the 50-plus partner nations that coordinate military aid to Ukraine are due to meet. The conflict has largely been a war of attrition, which requires large amounts of ammunition. Late on Sunday, Zelenskyy said the war is in 'a very important phase' as the Ukrainian army works hard to hold the bigger Russian forces at bay in the east while also holding ground in Russia’s Kursk border region, which it captured two months ago. Ukraine needs to 'put pressure on Russia in the way that’s necessary for Russia to realize that the war will gain them nothing,' Zelenskyy said in a video statement. 'We will continue to apply even greater pressure on Russia — because only through strength can we bring peace closer,' he added. Meanwhile, Russia fired six missiles of various types and 74 Shahed drones at Ukraine overnight, Ukraine’s air force said. Missile debris fell in three districts of Kyiv, causing minor damage to civilian infrastructure and starting a fire, Mayor Vitalii Klitschko said. He said nobody was hurt. Three missile fragments fell on a kindergarten, he said without elaborating. The acting head of the Communications Department of Ukraine’s Air Force, Yurii Ihnat, said that two of the hypersonic Kinzhal missiles that were shot down over the Kyiv region were aimed at the capital city. 'Despite the fact that it’s getting harder, despite (Russia's) improvements and the use of new tactics, today we have two shoot-downs,' Ihnat said. Despite Ukraine’s high interception rates, some weapons still get through. 'They are learning from their mistakes and from our mistakes. They are improving their technology so that we are able to shoot down fewer of them,' Ihnat told AP. Russia’s Defense Ministry said it shot down almost two dozen Ukrainian drones overnight. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-crimea-oil-terminal-1d78b9819d1c4680a3f1ab8b34a24a6a	2024-10-07T00:50:12-07:00	
Russian court sentences a 72-year-old American to nearly 7 years in prison for fighting in Ukraine	MOSCOW (AP) — A Russian court on Monday sentenced a 72-year-old American in a closed trial to nearly seven years in prison for allegedly fighting as a mercenary in Ukraine. Prosecutors said Stephen Hubbard signed a contract with the Ukrainian military after Russia sent troops into Ukraine in February 2022 and he fought alongside them until being captured two months later. He was sentenced to six years and 10 months in a general-security prison. Prosecutors had called for a sentence of seven years in a maximum-security prison. Hubbard, from the state of Michigan, is the first American known to have been convicted on charges of fighting as a mercenary in the Ukrainian conflict. The charges carried a potential sentence of 15 years, but prosecutors asked that his age be taken into account along with his admission of guilt, Russian news reports said. Arrests of Americans have become increasingly common in Russia in recent years. Concern has risen that Russia could be targeting U.S. nationals for arrest to use later as bargaining chips in talks to bring back Russians convicted of crimes in the U.S. and Europe. Also on Monday, a court in the city of Voronezh sentenced American Robert Gilman to seven years and 1 month for allegedly assaulting law enforcement officers while serving a sentence for another assault. According to Russian news reports, Gilman was arrested in 2022 for causing a disturbance while intoxicated on a passenger train and then assaulted a police officer while in custody. He is serving a 3 1/2-year sentence on that charge.

The Nobel Prize in medicine opens 6 days of award announcements	STOCKHOLM (AP) — The Nobel prizes award season begins Monday with the announcement by a panel at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm of the winner of this year's medicine award. Last year, the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine went to Hungarian-American Katalin Karikó and American Drew Weissman for discoveries that enabled the creation of mRNA vaccines against COVID-19 that were critical in slowing the pandemic. The medicine prize has been awarded 114 times to a total of 227 laureates — the title given to winners. Only 13 women have won been awarded the prize that carries a cash award of 11 million Swedish kronor ($1 million) from a bequest left by the prize’s creator, Swedish inventor Alfred Nobel. The laureates are invited to receive their awards at ceremonies on Dec. 10, the anniversary of Nobel’s death. Nobel announcements continue with the physics prize on Tuesday, chemistry on Wednesday and literature on Thursday. The Nobel Peace Prize will be announced Friday and the economics award on Oct. 14. ___ Corder reported from The Hague, Netherlands.	https://apnews.com/article/nobel-medicine-dc84622d7a15317bc83e873d3f9a2dbf	2024-10-06T22:14:52-07:00	
Former Singapore Cabinet minister starts 1-year sentence for receiving illegal gifts	KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) — A former Singaporean Cabinet minister began a one-year prison term Monday for receiving illegal gifts after saying he would not appeal his sentence in the rare criminal case involving a government minister in the Asian financial hub. Former Transport Minister S. Iswaran said it was important to him that prosecutors reduced two corruption charges to charges of receiving illegal gifts at the start of the trial last month. Iswaran had pleaded guilty to one count of obstructing justice and four of accepting gifts from two businessmen with whom he had official business. His sentence of 12 months in prison exceeded what the defense and prosecution had requested, but the court agreed to let him start serving the sentence Monday. 'I will not be appealing the sentence handed down by the Court,' Iswaran said in a statement on social media. 'I accept that as a minister, what I did was wrong under section 165 (of the Penal Code). I accept full responsibility for my actions and apologise unreservedly to all Singaporeans.' With his prison term, he said he hoped he and his family can put 'the pain and anguish behind us, move forward and rebuild our lives together.' Singapor e’s ministers are among the world’s best paid, and the case has embarrassed the ruling People’s Action Party, which prides itself on clean governance. The last Cabinet minister charged with graft was Wee Toon Boon, who was found guilty in 1975 and jailed for accepting gifts in exchange for helping a businessperson. Another Cabinet minister was investigated for graft in 1986, but died before charges were filed. A day after Iswaran's sentence last week, a Malaysian hotelier who brought Formula One to Singapore was charged Friday for allegedly obstructing justice and abetting Iswaran's wrongdoings. Ong Beng Seng did not indicate how he would plead to the charges, and his case has been adjourned until next month. The second businessman will not be charged. Ong, a Malaysian businessman based in Singapore, is the managing director of Hotel Properties Limited, which owns 38 hotels and resorts in 17 countries. He is known for bringing Formula 1 to Singapore in 2008, and holds the rights to the Grand Prix night race in the city-state.	https://apnews.com/article/singapore-minister-corruption-sentence-d94a33a68654ef1ee6903483d4d4cf6e	2024-10-06T21:53:39-07:00	
A Pakistani separatist group claims bombing that killed 2 Chinese near Karachi airport	KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) — A Pakistani separatist group claimed responsibility for a late night bombing that targeted a convoy with Chinese nationals outside the country's largest airport, killing two workers from China and wounding eight people, officials and the insurgent group said Monday. The attack by the Baloch Liberation Army outside the airport in the southern port city of Karachi was the latest deadly assault on Chinese here and came a week before Pakistan is to host a summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, a security grouping founded by China and Russia to counter Western alliances. The explosion, which the BLA said was the work of a suicide bomber, also raised questions about the ability of Pakistani forces to secure high-profile events or foreigners in the country. Among the wounded were also police officers who were escorting the Chinese convoy when the attack happened. Initially, Pakistani authorities gave conflicting details and said the explosion may have been from an oil tanker but police later confirmed it was a bomb attack. Pakistani news channels broadcast videos of flames engulfing cars and a thick column of smoke rising from the scene. Troops and police cordoned off the area. On Monday, counterterrorism officials were investigating how the attacker reached Karachi, Pakistan's largest city. The spokesman for the separatist group, Junaid Baloch, said Monday that one of their suicide bombers targeted the convoy of Chinese engineers and investors as they left the airport. The Baloch Liberation Army is mainly based in the restive southwestern Balochistan province but it has also attacked foreigners and security forces in other parts of Pakistan in recent years. The Chinese Embassy in Islamabad said Chinese staffers working at the Port Qasim Electric Power Company — a coal-powered power plant that's a joint China-Pakistan venture — were in the convoy when it came under attack around 11 p.m. on Sunday. Two Chinese nationals were killed and one was wounded, the embassy said and added, without elaborating, that there were also Pakistani casualties. Pakistani security officials say a police bomb disposal unit in Sindh province, where Karachi is the capital, had cleared the road outside the airport ahead of the movement of the Chinese convoy, which was being escorted by police and security officials in several vehicles. However, the road had not been blocked to avoid inconvenience for residents and travelers going to or from the airport, the officials said, speaking to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity to discuss security details. Pakistan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs denounced the bombing, saying it was a 'heinous terrorist attack near Karachi airport.' It said another Chinese was injured in the attack. 'We extend our deepest condolences and sympathies to the families of the victims, both Chinese and Pakistani, and offer prayers for the swift recovery of the injured,' said the ministry in a statement. 'We remain resolute in bringing to justice those responsible for this cowardly attack.' Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said he was shocked and saddened, describing the attackers as 'enemies of Pakistan' and promising the perpetrators would be punished. 'I strongly condemn this heinous act and offer my heartfelt condolences to the Chinese leadership &amp; the people of China, particularly the families of the victims,' he wrote on the social media platform X. 'Pakistan stands committed to safeguarding our Chinese friends,' he added. 'We will leave no stone unturned to ensure their security &amp; well-being.' Authorities estimate that the BLA, which Pakistan and the United States have designated a terrorist organization, has around 3,000 fighters. It regularly targets Pakistani security forces but has also in the past attacked Chinese nationals. According to Abdullah Khan, a senior defense analyst and managing director of the Islamabad-based Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies, BLA has preferred attacks on 'moving targets' but its ability to launch high-profile attacks has increased in recent years. More BLA attacks around the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit next week cannot be ruled out, Khan told The Associated Press. Port Qasim Electric Power Company is owned by PowerChina Resource Ltd, a subsidiary of Power Construction Corporation of China whose spokesperson, Geng Xingqiang, said the company 'is in the middle of making arrangements to actively deal with the incident.' Pakistan hosts thousands of Chinese workers as part of Beijing’s multibillion-dollar Belt and Road Initiative, which is building major infrastructure projects. The outlawed BLA has long waged an insurgency seeking independence and has repeatedly warned against any Chinese working in Balochistan. The Sunday night attack followed deadly attacks in August that killed more than 50 people in Balochistan. Sharif at the time said the attackers sought to harm Chinese-funded development projects. The oil- and mineral-rich Balochistan is Pakistan’s largest but also least populated province. It is also a hub for the country’s ethnic Baloch minority whose members say they face discrimination and exploitation by the central government. Along with separatist groups, Islamic militants also operate in the province. In 2018, the BLA stormed the Chinese Consulate in Karachi, triggering an intense hourlong shootout that killed two Pakistani civilians and two police officers. All three assailants were also killed. In March, in northwestern Pakistan, a suicide bombing killed five Chinese engineers and their Pakistani driver as they headed to the Dasu Dam, the country's biggest hydropower project. In April, five Japanese workers were unharmed when a suicide bomber targeted their van as they were on their wat to a factory in Karachi. One bystander was killed. In July 2021, at least nine Chinese nationals working on a dam and four Pakistanis were killed when a suicide bomber targeted their bus in northwestern Pakistan. Local authorities first said it was a road accident but Beijing insisted it was a bombing, which Islamabad later confirmed. In 2022, three Chinese teachers and their Pakistani driver were killed when an explosion ripped through their van at the University of Karachi campus. ___ Ahmed reported from Islamabad.

Middle East latest: Palestinian militants in Gaza fire 4 rockets into Israel as mourners mark Oct 7	Palestinian militants in Gaza fired four rockets into Israel on Monday as mourners marked the anniversary of the Oct. 7 attack, without disrupting a nearby ceremony. Hamas also said it attacked Israeli forces in different parts of Gaza. The Israeli military said three rockets were intercepted and a fourth fell in an open area. There were no reports of casualties or damage. The military said it launched a wave of artillery and airstrikes overnight and into Monday to thwart what it said was an imminent attack. It said it targeted Hamas launch posts and underground militant infrastructure. The fighting on the anniversary underscored the militants’ resilience in the face of a devastating Israeli offensive that has killed around 42,000 Palestinians, according to local medical officials. It has also destroyed large areas of Gaza and displaced around 90% of its population. Hamas-led militants blew holes in Israel’s security fence and stormed into nearby army bases and farming communities in a surprise attack one year ago, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting another 250. They are still holding around 100 captives inside Gaza, a third of whom are believed to be dead. Israel is now at war with Hamas in Gaza and its ally Hezbollah in Lebanon. It has also vowed to strike Iran in response to a ballistic missile attack on Israel last week. ___ Here is The Latest: Group representing families of hostages announces death of captive TEL AVIV, Israel — A group representing the families of Israeli hostages announced on Monday the death of a captive whose body is still being held in Gaza. The Hostages and Families Forum said Idan Shtivi, 28, was captured from the Nova music festival on Oct. 7. He was thought to have been taken alive. Israeli media reported that he was killed that day and his body was taken into Gaza. It was not immediately clear how Shtivi’s death became apparent, but in previous such announcements, the Israeli military has discovered evidence indicating a hostage’s death. The announcement of Shtivi’s death comes as Israelis are marking one year since Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack, where militants killed 1,200 people and kidnapped 250 others. About 100 remain in captivity, although more than a third of those are said to be dead. Hundreds gather at Nova music festival site to remember Oct 7 victims RE’IM, Israel — Hundreds of families and friends of people killed at the Nova music festival gathered Monday at the site of the attack, where nearly 400 were gunned down during Hamas’ Oct. 7 assault. Families gathered around photos of their loved ones, which were arranged in a semicircle around what was the DJ stage. Many lit candles and added mementos or photos, crying and embracing. Overhead, army helicopters circled and constant booms echoed across the area, causing many to flinch. 'We can’t understand how a year has passed,' said Shimon Busika, whose son, Yarden, 25, was killed at the festival. 'It’s the most natural place to be, to be here for this moment of silence,' he said. Busika said it took them a long time, piecing together testimony from other survivors, to understand what happened in Yarden’s last moments. They now know he was killed around 9:20 near a yellow container at the festival where many others were killed, and they will hold a second minute of silence there at the moment he was killed. The last sounds of the trance track that was playing at the Nova site on Oct. 7 one year ago stopped abruptly, as hundreds of family members and friends of the more than 300 victims stood in a moment of silence. One woman’s piercing wail broke the silence as booms echoed from the fighting in Gaza, just a few kilometers (miles) away. 20 Indonesians who were evacuated from Lebanon arrive in Jakarta JAKARTA, Indonesia — Twenty Indonesian nationals and a Lebanese evacuated from Lebanon arrived in Jakarta on a commercial flight early Monday and will likely be followed by 20 more in the afternoon, officials said. President Joko Widodo has called to prioritize the evacuation of Indonesians in Lebanon as hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah escalate and fears of a wider regional war in the Middle East grow. 'I have directed the foreign affairs minister to take immediate action to ensure the safety and protection of our citizens and expedite their evacuation,' Widodo said last week. Indonesia’s Embassy in Beirut had prepared evacuation procedures for citizens as part of its contingency planning since August. The Embassy evacuated 25 Indonesian citizens who returned safely to Indonesia last month, said Judha Nugraha, Director of Indonesian Citizen Protection at the Foreign Affairs Ministry. There are 116 registered Indonesian citizens in Lebanon, most of them students, migrant workers and people married to Lebanese nationals. Many of them have chosen to remain there for various reasons, Nugraha said. Australian PM Albanese condemns Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on Israel CANBERRA, Australia — Australia’s Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said in a statement Monday that the day carried 'terrible pain' and his government 'unequivocally' condemned Hamas' attack on Israel a year ago. Hamas militants stormed from the blockaded Gaza Strip into nearby Israeli towns on Oct. 7 a year ago, killing dozens and abducting others in an unprecedented surprise attack. Albanese said that since the attack, Jewish Australians have 'felt the cold shadows of antisemitism reaching into the present day — and as a nation we say never again.' 'We unequivocally condemn all prejudice and hatred. There is no place in Australia for discrimination against people of any faith,' Albanese said. He added that 'every innocent life matters' and the number of civilians killed in the conflict was 'a devastating tragedy.' 'Today we reflect on the truth of our shared humanity, of the hope that peace is possible, and the belief that it belongs to all people,' Albanese said. New Israeli strikes hit Beirut suburbs as Hezbollah claims blasts in Israel's Haifa BEIRUT — A new round of airstrikes hit Beirut suburbs late Sunday as Israel intensified its bombardment of northern Gaza and southern Lebanon. Palestinian officials said a strike on a mosque in Gaza killed at least 19 people. Rocket sirens and blasts were heard in Haifa in northern Israel late Sunday, and Hezbollah claimed the attack. Israel’s military said at least five projectiles were identified coming from Lebanon and 'fallen projectiles' were found in the area. The military showed what appeared to be rubble along a street. The Magen David Adom ambulance service said it was treating a teen with shrapnel injuries to the head and a man who fell from a window due to a blast. A year after Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack, Israel has opened a new front in Lebanon against Hezbollah, which has traded fire with Israel along the border since the war in Gaza began. Israel also has vowed to strike Iran after a ballistic missile attack on Israel last week.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hezbollah-hamas-latest-mideast-7-october-2024-d3d272d83e70d420ba547dbd7e09ef52	2024-10-06T20:45:39-07:00	
South Korean woman sues government and adoption agency after her kidnapped daughter was sent abroad	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — A 70-year-old South Korean woman sued her government, an adoption agency, and an orphanage Monday over the adoption of her daughter, who was sent to the United States in 1976, months after she was kidnapped at age 4. The damage suit filed by Han Tae-soon, whose story was part of an Associated Press investigation published last month, could ignite further debate on the dubious child-gathering practices and widespread falsification of paperwork that tarnished South Korea’s adoption program, which annually sent thousands of kids to the West during the 1970-80s. It was the first known case of a Korean birth parent suing for damages against the government and an adoption agency over the wrongful adoption of their child, said Kim Soo-jung, one of the lawyers representing Han. Han searched for her daughter, Laurie Bender, for more than 40 years before they reunited through DNA testing in 2019. Speaking to reporters in front of the Seoul Central District Court, Han argued that the South Korean government was responsible for failing to prevent the adoption of Bender. Han had reported to police that her daughter was missing and desperately searched for her, frequently visiting police stations, government offices and adoption agencies and even going on Korean media. She had her daughter's picture displayed everywhere — in subway stations, on lamp posts, on bags of snacks that advertised missing children, the Korean version of American milk cartons. Han accuses Holt Children’s Services, South Korea’s biggest adoption agency, of facilitating Bender’s adoption without checking her background. Her lawyers said the Jechon Children’s Home made no effort to find the parents after Bender was placed at the facility by police in May 1975, a day after Han reported her as missing. In her adoption papers, Bender, named Shin Gyeong-ha at birth, is described as an abandoned orphan with no known parents. Under a new Korean name made by the orphanage, Baik Kyong Hwa, she was sent to the United States in February 1976. 'For 44 years, I wandered and searched for my child, but the joy of meeting her was only momentary and now I am in so much pain because we can’t communicate in the same language,' Han said, fighting back tears. 'It turns out they didn’t make an effort to find her clearly existing parents and instead disguised her as an orphan for adoption abroad. I want the government and Holt to explain to us how this happened.' Kim, the lawyer, said the government is at fault for the botched child search that led to Bender’s adoption, saying she could have easily been found if missing child information was properly shared between police stations or if officers had tried to search orphanages. 'While the state bears the large responsibility for not fulfilling its duty to help find missing children and reunite them with their families, we also believe that the (orphanage) and adoption agency cannot be spared from responsibility as well,' Kim said. 'We suspect that these child protection institutions failed to carry out their ethical obligation to help find the child’s parents, even when the child was saying (she) had a family and had parents.' Jeon Min Kyeong, another lawyer representing Han, said she is seeking about 600 million won ($445,000) in damages. The lawsuit lists Han, her husband and two of her younger children as plaintiffs, but not Bender, Jeon said. South Korea’s Justice Ministry, which represents the government in lawsuits, and Holt didn’t immediately comment on the suit. In an earlier interview with AP, Bender said she was approached by a strange woman while playing near her home in the city of Cheongju. She remembers the woman saying her family didn’t want her any more because Han had another baby. Distraught, Bender went with the woman, who, after taking her on a train ride, deserted her in Jechon, a city 50 miles away. After failing to find her daughter for four decades, Han registered her DNA with a nonprofit group called 325 Kamra, which helps Korean adoptees reunite with their families through genetic information. In the United States, Bender took a DNA test because her own daughter was curious about their heritage and 325 Kamra connected them in 2019. Just weeks after finding her mother, Bender and her daughter flew to Korea to meet Han. Recognizing Bender immediately, Han ran to her, screaming, moaning, running her fingers through Bender’s hair. 'It’s like a hole in your heart has been healed, you finally feel like a complete person,' Bender said. 'It’s like you’ve been living a fake life and everything you know is not true.' The AP investigation, which was also documented by Frontline (PBS), described how the South Korean government, Western nations and adoption agencies worked in tandem to place around 200,000 Korean children in the United States and other Western nations, despite years of evidence that children were being procured through dubious or dishonest means. Western nations ignored these problems and sometimes pressured South Korea to keep the kids coming as they focused on satisfying their huge domestic demands for babies. In 2019, Adam Crapser became the first Korean adoptee to sue the South Korean government and an adoption agency for damages, accusing them of mishandling his adoption to the United States, where he faced legal troubles after surviving an abusive childhood before being deported in 2016. After four years of hearings, the Seoul Central District Court last year ordered Crapser’s adoption agency, Holt, to pay him 100 million won ($74,000) in damages for failing to inform his adopters they needed to take separate steps to obtain his citizenship after his adoption was approved by a state court. However, the court dismissed Crapser’s accusations against the Korean government over alleged monitoring and due diligence failures. The case is now with the Seoul High Court after both Crapser and Holt appealed. ___ AP writer Claire Galofaro in Louisville, Kentucky, contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/south-korea-adoption-lawsuit-children-holt-593945988001c509943e5c6266885878	2024-10-06T20:42:05-07:00	
Today in History: October 7, surprise attacks spark Israel-Hamas War	Today is Monday, Oct. 7, the 281st day of 2024. There are 85 days left in the year. Today in history: On Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas-led militants launched air and ground attacks on Israel, killing nearly 1,200 and taking more than 250 hostages. The attacks, followed hours later by Israeli counterattacks, marked the beginning of the current Israel-Hamas War.

In 1985, Palestinian gunmen hijacked the Italian cruise ship Achille Lauro (ah-KEE’-leh LOW’-roh) in the Mediterranean Sea. The hijackers shot and killed Leon Klinghoffer, a Jewish American tourist in a wheelchair, and pushed him overboard, before surrendering on Oct. 9. In 1992, trade representatives of the United States, Canada and Mexico initialed the North American Free Trade Agreement during a ceremony in San Antonio, Texas, in the presence of President George H.W. Bush, Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney and Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari. In 1998, Matthew Shepard, a gay college student, was beaten and left tied to a wooden fencepost outside of Laramie, Wyoming; he died five days later. Russell Henderson and Aaron McKinney are serving life sentences for Shepard’s murder.

Takeaways from AP's report on the destruction in Gaza a year into the war	Israel's yearlong offensive against Hamas, launched in response to the militant group's Oct. 7 attack into Israel, has killed tens of thousands of Palestinians and caused staggering destruction across the Gaza Strip that could take decades to rebuild. Hundreds of thousands of people are crammed into squalid tent camps with no homes to return to, even if there is a cease-fire. The mountains of rubble alone, laced with human remains, unexploded ordnance and other hazardous materials, could take years to remove. Israel blames the destruction on Hamas. Its Oct. 7 attack on Israel — in which some 1,200 people were killed and around 250 taken hostage — ignited the war. Hamas embedded much of its military infrastructure, including hundreds of kilometers (miles) of tunnels, in densely populated areas where some of the heaviest battles were fought. The fighting left roughly a quarter of all structures in Gaza destroyed or severely damaged, according to a U.N. assessment in September based on satellite footage. It said around 66% of structures, including more than 227,000 housing units, had sustained at least some damage. Here's a look at the main takeaways from an AP interactive report looking at the scope of the devastation. Tens of thousands were killed Israel's offensive has killed over 41,000 Palestinians in Gaza and wounded more than 96,000, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. It does not say how many were fighters, but says women and children make up more than half of those killed. It also says the toll may be higher as thousands of bodies remain buried under rubble or in areas that are inaccessible to medical teams. Israel says it has killed over 17,000 militants, but has not provided evidence. Over 720 Israeli soldiers have been killed since Oct. 7, including in the attack itself, the war in Gaza and the conflict with Lebanon's Hezbollah militant group. Hundreds of thousands displaced The U.N. estimates that around 90% of Gaza's population of 2.3 million people have been displaced, often multiple times. Israeli evacuation orders now cover around 90% of the territory. Schools have been turned into shelters, and hundreds of thousands have crammed into sprawling tent camps along the coast. The Shelter Cluster, an international coalition of aid providers led by the Norwegian Refugee Council, says it has struggled to bring in basic supplies because of Israeli restrictions, the ongoing fighting and the breakdown of law and order in Gaza. It estimates that some 900.000 people are in need of tents and bedding. Critical infrastructure has been destroyed The war has gutted Gaza's infrastructure, which was already in bad shape after a 16-year blockade imposed by Israel and Egypt when Hamas seized power in 2007. The U.N. says the war has damaged or destroyed over 92% of Gaza's main roads and more than 84% of its health facilities. It estimates nearly 70% of Gaza’s water and sanitation plants have been destroyed or damaged. That includes all five of the territory’s wastewater treatment facilities, plus desalination plants, sewage pumping stations, wells and reservoirs. The breakdown of water infrastructure has flooded the streets with sewage in many areas, contributing to the spread of disease among a population weakened by widespread hunger. Mountains of rubble will take years to remove Where houses, shops and office buildings once stood, there are now giant drifts of rubble laced with human remains, hazardous substances and unexploded munitions. The U.N. estimates the war has left some 40 million tons of debris and rubble in Gaza, enough to fill New York’s Central Park to a depth of eight meters (about 25 feet). It could take up to 15 years and nearly $650 million to clear it all away, it said. Rebuilding could take decades The World Bank estimated $18.5 billion in damage in Gaza from just the first three months of the war, before several major Israeli operations. That figure is nearly equivalent to the combined economic output of the West Bank and Gaza in 2022. Wealthy Arab countries like Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have said they are only willing to contribute to Gaza’s reconstruction as part of a postwar settlement that creates a path to a Palestinian state. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has ruled that out, saying he won’t allow Hamas or even the Western-backed Palestinian Authority to govern Gaza. He has said Israel will maintain open-ended security control and delegate civilian affairs to local Palestinians. But none are known to have volunteered, and Hamas has threatened to kill anyone who aids the occupation. Israel allowed construction materials in before the war, but the system was subject to heavy restrictions and delays. The Shelter Cluster estimates that it would take 40 years to rebuild all of Gaza’s destroyed homes under that system. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Gaza at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war	https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-anniversary-destruction-takeaways-a1ae8d316633fd7d1f3fe24cc527a2ee	2024-10-06T19:59:45-07:00	
How farmers in Burundi banded together to get fair prices for avocados	KAYANZA, Burundi (AP) — Farmers in a remote part of Burundi know to look for a truck parked by a highway when it is time to sell their avocados. They materialize from villages and form a crowd around the vehicle, watching closely as crews weigh and load the crated fruits. Such roadside exchanges, repeated regularly during peak harvest season, long provided a ready market for smallholder avocado growers in a country that’s sometimes ranked as the world’s poorest. But the transactions now promise real earnings thanks in part to the intervention of the national government and farmers’ cooperatives that worked to set terms for foreign avocado dealers. Just a year ago, farmers selling their avocados to the transporters earned 10 cents per kilogram (2.2 pounds), far less than the price for a small bottle of water. These days, they get roughly 70 cents for the same quantity, a meaningful increase for people who mainly farm to feed their families. A major change in the trade is that payments in U.S. currency now go into the bank accounts of cooperatives that pay their members directly almost as soon as the avocado haulers leave. Acting as intermediaries, groups such as Green Gold Burundi, which has its headquarters in the northern province of Kayanza and represents 200,000 farmers nationwide, say they are better positioned than individual growers to stem exploitation. The participation of the cooperatives is an important step toward regulating the country's avocado exports, said Ferdinand Habimana, vice president of Green Gold Burundi’s administrative board. Although the government is promoting avocado farming to diversify exports, avocados grown in Burundi are yet to be trademarked as coming from there, he said. 'So it is legally done now, but what we are developing now is that the (avocados) can reach the final destination as avocados taken from Burundi,' said Habimana, speaking of his group’s dealings with exporters in Tanzania and elsewhere in East Africa. Zacharie Munezero, who oversees quality management for Green Gold Burundi, acknowledged that the 70 cents farmers earn for a kilogram of avocados is still insufficient when exporters can fetch between $3 and $5 for the same quantity in international markets. Avocados are cheap in many parts of sub-Saharan Africa, where they can be purchased from farmers in bulk for almost nothing. In Burundi, avocados became more widely cultivated after the country's former leader, Pierre Nkurunziza, started extolling the fruit in 2007 as a source of nutrition and income. Many households that don’t produce the varieties favored by exporters usually look after at least one avocado plant of the local variety known to Burundians as 'amapeter,' in remembrance of Nkurunziza, who died in 2020. But while coffee and tea exports – Burundi’s traditional sources of much-needed foreign currency – have long been coordinated, the trade in Burundian avocados has remained unregulated, according to farmer representatives and a trade official. They said that avocado exports could be as profitable for the country as coffee if the government asserted its rule-making authority. Desirable measures include guaranteeing a minimum price for farmers, stopping foreign traders from dealing directly with farmers, and encouraging widespread cultivation of the Hass avocados favored by European consumers, they said. Burundi 'cannot rely only on coffee and tea,' Onesime Niyukuri, an adviser in the foreign trade department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said of the country's limited exports. If avocado dealers from elsewhere in East Africa 'can come and buy at a price that is already set by the government, there is no problem,' he said. The government ramped up its efforts to organize avocado exports earlier this year as dollar shortages fueled sporadic shortages of sugar and other goods. Under new regulations, which require foreign dealers to register with local authorities, exporters must submit copies of their supply contracts and specify market destinations for Burundian avocados, according to the Ministry of Trade, Transport, Industry and Tourism. Burundi aims to export more than 10 million tonnes (11 million tons) of avocados each year by 2030, said Niyukuri, citing the government’s strategic plan. Recent figures on Burundi’s foreign exchange earnings from the avocado crop were not readily available. The government’s target is to plant 50,000 avocado trees in each of Burundi’s 17 provinces. Local authorities in provinces such as Kayanza want each household to own at least 10 trees producing exportable avocados. That includes the Mexican variety Fuerte and especially Hass avocado, the most commercially successful variety globally. The fruit, which has dark bumpy skin and bright yellow-green flesh, takes more than two weeks to ripen and can survive several days in transit. Burundi, a small mountainous country about the size of Maryland, is home to 13 million people. Annual income per capita was $199 in 2023, among the lowest globally, and nearly 65% of the population lives below the poverty line, according to World Bank figures. Agriculture is the main economic activity, and many people in rural provinces such as Kayanza mostly grow the potatoes and vegetables they will consume through the year. For some, including those with a few avocado trees in their compounds, the pear-shaped green fruit has proven a surprisingly reliable source of income. Eric Nsabimana, a farmer in Kayanza, recalled starting as an avocado grower in response to the campaign of former leader Nkurunziza. Some farmers, feeling forced into planting avocados, uprooted the seedlings the government gave them and now rue the missed opportunity, Nsabimana said. 'The people who didn’t plant, they regret,' he said. Nsabimana, who anticipates making more than $6,000 a year selling avocados now that the price is higher, said he used his earnings to acquire five more hectares (12.4 acres) of land now planted with 500 avocado trees. Habimana, the senior official with Green Gold Burundi, said his group moved to mobilize avocado farmers for better rewards after it realized at the beginning of the year they were being exploited by foreign traders. One day in January, he followed a truck transporting Burundian avocados to neighboring Tanzania, believing the cargo was destined for consumption in the region. When he saw the avocados getting washed, weighed and packed in the town of Njombe, he realized the goods were bound for another export market abroad. 'There was another destination somewhere else, not in Njombe,' Nsabimana said. When he returned to Kayanza, Green Gold Burundi prioritized plans to register avocado farmers in a way that eliminated middlemen and guaranteed a reasonable price for farmers. The cooperative pays taxes and keeps a cut of avocado proceeds to sustain operations that include providing members with seedlings and organic manure. Munezero, the cooperative's quality management official, said that while the price of avocados 'is still a problem,' his group is 'focusing on capacity building' and encouraging residents to plant more avocado trees. Green Gold Burundi has distributed millions of seedlings in the past year, finding enthusiasm among farmers eager to join the avocado bandwagon. Even growers with only a few backyard Hass plants said they increasingly see avocado as a cash crop. 'Avocados mean dollars to us,' one such grower, Samuel Niyinyibutsa, said, adding that he knows some Kayanza residents who feel 'left behind' when they see others collect payments for their produce. 'But they still have time,' Niyinyibutsa said. 'They can be awakened and start planting avocados because avocado can do well to them as it is doing well to us.' ___ The Associated Press receives financial support for global health and development coverage in Africa from the Gates Foundation.

Stock market today: Asian shares climb after blockbuster US jobs report	Asian shares advanced Monday after a surprisingly strong U.S. jobs report raised optimism about the economy, sparking a rally on Wall Street. U.S. futures slipped and oil prices also fell. Japan's Nikkei 225 index gained 1.8% to 39,332.74 after the yen sank against the U.S. dollar. The Japanese currency has bounced on speculation over the central bank's plans for interest rates since Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba took office last week. Lower interest rates tend to boost prices of shares and other asset, and both Ishiba and the central bank governor suggested no hikes were likely soon. Nintendo gained 5% following reports that a Saudi wealth fund was planning to increase its investment in the Kyoto, Japan-based video game maker. In a policy speech on Friday, Ishiba said he wants to see salary increases that outpace inflation and that he will promote investment to create 'a virtuous cycle of growth and distribution.' He promised economic support for low-income households and measures for regional revitalization and disaster resilience. But he offered no major new initiatives, and his initial public support ratings are around 50% or lower, relatively low for a new leader, according to Japanese media. He plans to dissolve parliament on Wednesday for an election on Oct. 27. After gaining briefly against the dollar, the yen fell back late last week. Early Monday, the dollar was trading at 148.45 yen, down from 148.72 late Friday. Elsewhere in Asia, Hong Kong's Hang Seng index rose 1.1% to 22,977.97, and the Kospi in Seoul surged 1.3% to 2,602.23. Taiwan's Taiex gained 1.8%. Mainland Chinese markets reopen from a weeklong holiday on Tuesday, and the government said it plans to explain details of plans for economic stimulus at a morning news conference in Beijing. Before the Oct. 1 National Day holiday began, announcements of policies aimed at reviving the ailing property market pushed share benchmarks sharply higher and this week could bring more volatility. 'More fiscal stimulus to stabilize the property market and restructure local government debts, and structural reforms to address the over-capacity and deflation issues are needed to turn around the economy,' B of A Securities said in a research note, pointing to continued declines in home sales, housing prices and credit growth. On Friday, the S&amp;P 500 climbed 0.9% and got close to its all-time high set on Monday, closing at 5,751.07. The Dow gained 0.8% to 42,352.75, and the Nasdaq climbed 1.2% to 18,137.85. Leading the way were banks, airlines, cruise-ship operators and other companies whose profits can benefit the most from a stronger economy where people are working and better able to pay for things. Norwegian Cruise Line steamed 4.9% higher, JPMorgan Chase rose 3.5% and the small companies in the Russell 2000 index gained 1.5%. Worries over tensions in the Middle East still are casting a shadow, having pushed oil prices sharply higher as the world waits to see how Israel will respond to an Oct. 1 missile attack by Iran. But U.S. benchmark crude oil slipped 19 cents to $74.19 per barrel early Monday, while Brent crude, the international standard, lost 29 cents to $77.76 per barrel. Treasury yields soared Friday after the U.S. government said employers added 254,000 more jobs to their payrolls last month than they cut. That was an acceleration from August’s hiring pace of 159,000 and blew past economists’ forecasts. Recent encouraging data on the economy have raised hopes that the job market will hold up after the Fed pressed the brakes on the economy through higher rates in order to stamp out high inflation. The Fed has begun cutting interest rates and Friday’s jobs report was so strong traders are now forecasting it will not deliver another half-point interest rate cut before the end of the year after doing so in September. In other dealings early Monday, the euro was unchanged at $1.0967.	https://apnews.com/article/stocks-markets-rates-japan-oil-24925e5840a2491fbc1acc07543bc37d	2024-10-06T19:43:36-07:00	
Gaza is in ruins after Israel's yearlong offensive. Rebuilding may take decades	The Gaza Strip is in ruins. There are hills of rubble where apartment blocks stood, and pools of sewage-tainted water spreading disease. City streets have been churned into dirt canyons and, in many places, the air is filled with the stench of unrecovered corpses. Israel’s yearlong offensive against Hamas, one of the deadliest and most destructive in recent history, has killed more than 41,000 people, a little over half of them women and children, according to local health officials. With no end in sight to the war and no plan for the day after, it is impossible to say when – or even if – anything will be rebuilt. Even after the fighting stops, hundreds of thousands of people could be stuck living in squalid tent camps for years. Experts say reconstruction could take decades. 'This war is destruction and misery. It would make the stones cry out,' said Shifaa Hejjo, a 60-year-old housewife living in a tent pitched on land where her home once stood. 'Whoever sees Gaza ... It will make them cry.' Israel blames the destruction on Hamas. Its Oct. 7 attack on Israel — in which some 1,200 people were killed and around 250 taken hostage — ignited the war. Israel says Hamas embedded much of its military infrastructure, including hundreds of kilometers (miles) of tunnels, in densely populated areas where some of the heaviest battles were fought. The fighting left roughly a quarter of all structures in Gaza destroyed or severely damaged, according to a U.N. assessment in September based on satellite footage. It said around 66% of structures, including more than 227,000 housing units, had sustained at least some damage. If there's a cease-fire, around half of all families 'have nowhere to go back to,' said Alison Ely, a Gaza-based coordinator with the Shelter Cluster, an international coalition of aid providers led by the Norwegian Refugee Council. The devastation in Gaza rivals front-line towns in Ukraine Almost as many buildings have been destroyed or damaged in Gaza as in all of Ukraine after its first two years of war with Russia, according to Corey Scher and Jamon Van Den Hoek, U.S.-based researchers who use satellite radar to document the wars' devastation. To put that into perspective: Gaza is less than half the size of Ukraine's capital, Kyiv. The amount of destruction in central and southern Gaza alone, Scher said, is roughly equivalent to what was lost in the front-line town of Bakhmut, the scene of one of the deadliest battles in the Ukraine war and where Russian forces destroyed nearly every building in their path to force Ukrainian troops to withdraw. The destruction in northern Gaza is even worse, he said. Gaza’s water and sanitation system has collapsed. More than 80% of its health facilities — and even more of its roads — are damaged or destroyed. 'I can’t think of any parallel, in terms of the severity of damage, for an enclave or a country or a people,' Scher said. At the end of January, the World Bank estimated $18.5 billion of damage — nearly the combined economic output of the West Bank and Gaza in 2022. That was before some intensely destructive Israeli ground operations, including in the southern border city of Rafah. ’I couldn’t tell where people’s homes were’ When Israeli ground forces pushed into the southern city of Khan Younis in January, Shifaa Hejjo and her family fled their four-story home with only the clothes they were wearing. They spent months in various tent camps before she decided to return – and the sight brought her to tears. Her entire neighborhood had been destroyed, her former home and the roads leading to it lost in a sea of rubble. 'I didn’t recognize it,' she said. 'I couldn’t tell where people’s homes were.' Around 90% of Gaza’s 2.3 million people have been displaced by the war, often multiple times, according to U.N. estimates. Hundreds of thousands have crowded into sprawling tent camps near the coast with no electricity, running water or toilets. Hunger is widespread. Hejjo lived in a tent in the courtyard of a hospital. Before that, she was in Muwasi, the main tent camp in southern Gaza. 'It smelled bad,' she said. 'There were diseases spreading.' She said her husband, who was suffering from liver disease, was broken-hearted when he heard their home had been destroyed and he died shortly thereafter. She was among the first to return after Israeli forces withdrew in April. Her neighbors stayed away, fearful they would find bodies or unexploded bombs. But for her it was still home. 'It is better to live in my home, where I lived for 37 years, even though it is destroyed,' she said. Hejjo and her children dug through the rubble with shovels and their bare hands, going brick by brick and saving whatever could be reused. Torn clothes were used to feed cooking fires. Rats had crept in, and swarms of mosquitoes hovered over the ruins. There was broken glass everywhere. They set up a tent fortified by corrugated metal sheeting and some bricks salvaged from her destroyed home. A light drizzle wet their clothes as they slept. U.N. agencies say unemployment has soared to around 80% — up from nearly 50% before the war — and that almost the entire population is living in poverty. Even those with means would find it nearly impossible to import construction materials because of Israeli restrictions, ongoing fighting and the breakdown of law and order. There are mountains of rubble, little water and no electricity The first obstacle to any significant rebuilding is the rubble – mountains of it. Where houses, shops and office buildings once stood, there are now giant drifts of rubble laced with human remains, hazardous substances and unexploded munitions. The U.N. estimates the war has left some 40 million tons of debris and rubble in Gaza, enough to fill New York’s Central Park to a depth of eight meters (about 25 feet). It could take up to 15 years and nearly $650 million to clear it all away, it said. There’s also the question of where to dispose of it: The U.N. estimates about five square kilometers (about two square miles) of land would be needed, which will be hard to come by in the small and densely populated territory. It isn’t just homes that were destroyed, but also critical infrastructure. The U.N. estimates nearly 70% of Gaza’s water and sanitation plants have been destroyed or damaged. That includes all five of the territory’s wastewater treatment facilities, plus desalination plants, sewage pumping stations, wells and reservoirs. The employees who once managed municipal water and waste systems have been displaced, and some killed. And fuel shortages have made it difficult to keep operating facilities that are still intact. The international charity Oxfam said it applied in December for a permit to bring in desalination units, and pipes to repair water infrastructure. It took three months for Israel to approve the shipment, but it still has not entered Gaza, Oxfam said. The destruction of sewage networks has left streets flooded with putrid water, hastening the spread of disease. There has been no central power in Gaza since the opening days of the war, when its sole power plant was forced to shut down for lack of fuel, and more than half of the territory's electrical grid has been destroyed, according to the World Bank. Can Gaza be rebuilt? Wealthy Arab countries like Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have said they are only willing to contribute to Gaza’s reconstruction as part of a postwar settlement that creates a path to a Palestinian state. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has ruled that out, saying he won’t allow Hamas or even the Western-backed Palestinian Authority to govern Gaza. He has said Israel will maintain open-ended security control and delegate civilian affairs to local Palestinians. But none are known to have volunteered, and Hamas has threatened to kill anyone who aids the occupation. Rebuilding Gaza would also require the import of massive amounts of construction supplies and heavy equipment, which Israel is unlikely to allow as long as there’s a potential for Hamas to rebuild its militant infrastructure. In any case, Gaza has only a small number of crossings with limited capacity. The Israeli military body that coordinates civilian affairs in Gaza says it does not restrict the entry of civilian supplies and allows so-called dual-use items that could also be used for military purposes. Israel allowed some construction materials in before the war under what was known as the Gaza Reconstruction Mechanism, but it was subject to heavy restrictions and delays. The Shelter Cluster estimates that it would take 40 years to rebuild all of Gaza’s destroyed homes under that setup. For now, aid providers are struggling just to bring in enough basic tents because of the limited number of trucks going into Gaza and the challenges of delivering aid. Efforts to bring in more robust temporary housing are still in the early stages, and no one has even tried to bring in construction materials, according to Ely. In September, the Shelter Cluster estimated 900,000 people were still in need of tents, bedding and other items to prepare for the region's typically cold and rainy winters. ___ El Deeb reported from Beirut. ___ Follow AP’s coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/mideast-wars	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-anniversary-palestinians-gaza-destruction-6b41ad9f64887228e90793705dd379a7	2024-10-06T19:27:05-07:00	
A year after the Hamas attack shattered this Israeli community, going home still feels impossible	KFAR AZA, Israel (AP) — On a sun-dappled day in Kibbutz Kfar Aza, Liora Eilon stood at the spot where her son was killed. She stooped to pick a figurine from the pile of belongings scattered around an abandoned home nearby. 'Every time we come here, Tal leaves us a little message,' the 71-year-old said, turning over the plastic soldier in her hands. It has been a year since Hamas militants stormed into this community within sight of the border fence surrounding Gaza. Eilon's 46-year-old son, Tal, who was the Kfar Aza civilian defense commander, was killed in the early moments of the attack, as he ran to the kibbutz armory to grab a weapon. Now living in a university dormitory in Israel’s north, Liora Eilon wonders if she’ll ever return home to this place, seared into Israeli history for that day of mass death, when the militants killed some 1,200 people in southern communities and took about 250 others hostage. The attack sparked an ongoing Israeli campaign in Gaza that has killed more than 41,600 Palestinians and laid waste to much of the territory. 'How can I trust the government who abandoned me here, who betrayed me, promised me that my family was safe here?' she said. 'The government wants us to go back to Kfar Aza, but I need more to feel safe.' Only about 50 of Kfar Aza’s 1,000 residents have returned. They live among the skeletons of houses burned by explosives, riddled with bullet holes or reduced to rubble by tank shells during the battle that raged for days. The others are scattered in dorms and hotels further north. The Associated Press spoke to a dozen residents who shared feelings of extreme vulnerability to future attack and deep misgivings about Israel’s military and government, and the Palestinians on the other side of the fence. Some wondered whether such a scarred place could ever be lived in at all. 'Are we going to live inside a memorial? Are we going to see a plaque every few meters, he was killed here and he was killed here?' asked Zohar Shpack, 58, who has returned and serves in the civilian defense squad. 'I don’t know yet.' ‘It’s still the seventh of October’ The seasons have spun by since Oct. 7. Relatively untended, Kfar Aza’s orchards have borne new fruit. With few to harvest, soldiers guarding the community have their pick from loads of fresh avocadoes. The land still holds traces of the day. On trees hung with fresh pomegranates, some of last year’s fruit remains, charred and black like used grenades. Gardener Rafael Friedman says he still finds teeth and bones in the soil when he rakes back the overgrowth — likely remnants of Hamas militants killed in the fighting. Kfar Aza has always been a close-knit place. It takes just 15 minutes to walk from one end to the other, past neighborhoods, orchards and a soccer pitch. Many residents grew up here and raised families alongside each other. Now photos of slain young people, couples killed together and hostages are posted everywhere. During the day, former residents like Eilon guide tours, hold memorials and see familiar faces. When night falls, most disappear to hotel rooms to the north. Every Friday, survivors gather on Shachar Schnorman’s porch for dinner, filling the kibbutz with the rare sound of laughter. 'It’s the only place where people can talk about the seventh and all the people at the table understand exactly what they are talking about,' Schnorman said. 'We do whatever we can to try to build community, to try to show ... that people can live here,' he said. The government says it will rebuild. Meanwhile, it's constructing pre-fabricated houses for residents in another kibbutz, Ruhama, about 15 kilometers (10 miles) away. After two years there, they say authorities want them to return to Kfar Aza. About two-thirds of the community plan to move into the temporary housing. On a recent tour, some enthusiastically examined the box-like structures. It’s a chance, they said, to live together and rebuild on the southern land they’re accustomed to. But some weren’t convinced Kfar Aza will be rebuilt and not sure they’d ever feel safe returning. They want to know why it took so many hours before soldiers arrived at the kibbutz. The military has launched an investigation into what happened, but has not yet released its results. An investigation into the military’s failures at neighboring Kibbutz Be’eri found a 'lack of command and control, a lack of coordination and a lack of order' among the units that fought there. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government has brushed off calls for accountability, saying it will investigate at war’s end. Simona Steinbrecher feels too frozen in time to make a decision now about whether to return. Her daughter, Doron, a veterinary nurse who spent her girlhood in Kfar Aza, was dragged by militants into Gaza on Oct. 7. She is among 66 Israelis still held captive. Hamas is believed to hold the bodies of 35 others. The 65-year-old Steinbrecher last saw her daughter in a Hamas propaganda video. Doron’s skin was pale, her voice weak. 'Without Doron, it’s still the seventh of October,' her mother said. 'And we won’t go home until she’s home.' The military command structure collapsed when it was needed most Hostage families and many residents of southern communities are boycotting the government’s ceremony commemorating Oct. 7. To them, as long as it fails to bring hostages home and refuses to investigate and take responsibility for its mistakes, it has blood on its hands. Instead, residents of Kfar Aza will hold a small tribute and lower the kibbutz flag to half-mast. Residents said they have nothing but admiration for the troops who fought that day. But they are furious at the military higher-ups, blaming them for a command structure that collapsed when the kibbutz needed it most. When she recounts the day, Eilon is gripped with fury and astonishment — over 35 hours of horror her family endured and the military’s response. When the sirens began blaring that Saturday morning, Eilon thought it would take the army minutes to arrive, she told the AP as she toured the bullet-riddled remnants of her home. It took hours. Her family scrambled into their safe room. A son and daughter muscled the door shut against gunmen trying to get inside. Granddaughters, Gali and Mika, hid under the bed. Eilon got a message saying Tal had gone out to fight. The five huddled in the saferoom, hearing the attackers’ shouts and gunfire, not knowing whether Tal was dead or alive. Israeli troops finally gained control of their house, and Eilon said she saw how scared and confused the young soldiers looked. Gali shared with them desperate texts from her friends across the kibbutz trying to escape the rampage. 'She became a 15-year-old commander of an IDF elite unit,' said Eilon, using the acronym for the Israeli military. Still, the troops didn’t evacuate the family. It was only on Sunday afternoon, as militants were hiding out in the house again, that soldiers hustled them out. As she ran into her backyard, Eilon saw a tank swivel its cannon at her house. It fired, collapsing her home on the militants inside. Soon after being rescued, Eilon learned Tal was dead. 'I’d known it all along,' she said. 'But some part of me was hoping that he was injured, that he was unconscious in some hospital.' ‘They could have saved them’ As the battle still raged, some residents were evacuated early and sped away in army jeeps. Hanan Dann, a young father, recounted passing a cluster of soldiers at a gas station just outside the kibbutz, who looked like they were waiting for orders. 'I wanted to say, there’s fighting inside still, there’re people dying,' he said. 'They could have saved them.' Soldiers and militants fought in Kfar Aza for days. By the end, militants had killed 64 civilians and 22 soldiers and dragged 19 hostages into Gaza. Nearby, in the recesses of the Negev desert, stands a decrepit water tower. It’s a remnant of Be’erot Yitzhak, a kibbutz abandoned after a deadly 1948 Egyptian attack during the war that led to Israel’s creation. 'Will that be what Kfar Aza looks like 10 years from now?' asked Dann. 'Just a stop on the highway I can point out to my kids?' Even those who want to reinhabit it know Kfar Aza will never be the same. Shpack, the civilian guard member, said he understands why no one would bring a child here now, pointing to the border fence. Every few minutes, an Israeli warplane drops a bomb on Gaza, puncturing the kibbutz's silence with a loud boom. 'And even once the bombs end, how can you raise him here?' Shpack asked. 'How do you explain what happened here?' For some, the kibbutz’s fate is tied to Gaza. Some want Israel to take a hard line in the future. Marcus Scharfstein, 29, who lives in the kibbutz, said he won’t feel completely safe until Israel reestablishes Jewish settlements in Gaza. Israel unilaterally withdrew its soldiers and some 8,000 Jewish settlers from Gaza in 2005. 'If I will know that in Gaza right now, there are 10, 20 villages of Jewish people,' he said, 'I will feel in control again,' adding he did not feel that way before the Oct. 7 attack. But others say as long as there is no peace agreement with Palestinians, they will again be on the front lines of another Oct. 7. Some of Gaza's Palestinians once lived in these same arid reaches of what is now southern Israel. Almost no trace is left of their villages after Israeli troops drove them out during the 1948 war. 'We’ve tried war enough times and it never led to anything good,' Eilon said. She wants a new government that will talk to the Palestinians to find 'some arrangement for us to live together on the same land.' 'I’m dreaming for the day with an open fence from here to the sea, with two people living together.' ___ Find more coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/mideast-wars	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-gaza-war-kibbutz-attack-anniversary-344b289751d8ee80d4909f15864f508c	2024-10-06T19:21:49-07:00	
US court to review civil rights lawsuit alleging environmental racism in a Louisiana parish	NEW ORLEANS (AP) — A federal appellate court is set to hear oral arguments Monday in a civil rights lawsuit alleging a south Louisiana parish engaged in racist land-use policies to place polluting industries in majority-Black communities. The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans is reviewing a lawsuit filed by community groups claiming St. James Parish 'intentionally discriminated against Black residents' by encouraging industrial facilities to be built in areas with predominantly Black populations 'while explicitly sparing White residents from the risk of environmental harm.' The groups, Inclusive Louisiana, Rise St. James and Mt. Triumph Baptist Church, seek a halt to future industrial development in the parish. The plaintiffs note that 20 of the 24 industrial facilities were in two sections of the parish with majority-Black populations when they filed the complaint in March 2023. The parish is located along a heavily industrialized stretch of the Mississippi River between New Orleans and Baton Rouge, Louisiana, known as the Chemical Corridor, often referred to by environmental groups as 'Cancer Alley' because of the high levels of suspected cancer-causing pollution emitted there. The lawsuit comes as the federal government has taken steps during the Biden administration to address the legacy of environmental racism. Federal officials have written stricter environmental protections and committed tens of billions of dollars in funding. In the Louisiana case, U.S. District Judge Carl Barbier of the Eastern District of Louisiana in November 2023 dismissed the lawsuit largely on procedural grounds, ruling the plaintiffs had filed their complaint too late. But he added, 'this Court cannot say that their claims lack a basis in fact or rely on a meritless legal theory.' Barbier said the lawsuit hinged primarily on the parish's 2014 land-use plan, which generally shielded white neighborhoods from industrial development and left majority-Black neighborhoods, schools and churches without the same protections. The plan also described largely Black sections of the parish as 'future industrial' sites. The plaintiffs missed the legal window to sue the parish, the judge ruled. Yet the parish's land-use plan is just one piece of evidence among many revealing ongoing discrimination against Black residents in the parish, said Pamela Spees, a lawyer for the Center of Constitutional Rights representing the plaintiffs. They are challenging Barbier's ruling under the 'continuing violations' doctrine on the grounds that discriminatory parish governance persists, allowing for industrial expansion in primarily Black areas. The lawsuit highlights the parish's decision in August 2022 to impose a moratorium on large solar complexes after a proposed 3,900-acre (1,580-hectare) solar project upset residents of the mostly white neighborhood of Vacherie, who expressed concerns about lowering property values and debris from storms. The parish did not take up a request for a moratorium on heavy industrial expansion raised by the plaintiffs, the lawsuit states. These community members 'have tried at every turn to simply have their humanity and dignity be seen and acknowledged,' Spees said. 'That’s just been completely disregarded by the local government and has been for generations.' Another part of the complaint argues the parish failed to identify and protect the likely hundreds of burial sites of enslaved people by allowing industrial facilities to build on and limit access to the areas, preventing the descendants of slaves from memorializing the sites. The federal judge tossed out that part of the lawsuit, noting the sites were on private property not owned by the parish. At its core, the complaint alleges civil rights violations under the 13th and 14th amendments, stating the land-use system in the parish allowing for industrial buildout primarily in majority-Black communities remains shaped by the history of slavery, white supremacy and Jim Crow laws and governance. Lawyers for St. James Parish said the lawsuit employed overreaching claims and 'inflammatory rhetoric.' St. James Parish did not respond to a request for comment. 'The Civil War ain’t never been over,' said lifelong St. James Parish resident Gail LeBoeuf, 72, a plaintiff in the case who co-founded the local environmental justice organization Inclusive Louisiana. 'They’re trying to destroy the Black people in this country in any way they can.' LeBoeuf, who lives 1 mile (1.6 kilometers) from an alumina plant, was diagnosed with cancer in 2022 and blames her illness on the high levels of industrial pollution she has been exposed to for decades. She acknowledges the link cannot be proven but counters there is no way to prove industrial pollution was not the reason. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency found in a 2003 report that St. James Parish ranked higher than the national average for certain cancer deaths. In August, a federal judge barred the EPA from using the Civil Rights Act to fight industrial pollution alleged to have disproportionately affected minority communities in Louisiana. Besides a moratorium on industrial expansion in the parish, LeBoeuf's organization calls for real-time air monitoring of pollution and buffer zones around residential areas. Community groups have battled for years against plans by Taiwanese company Formosa to build a $9.4 billion plastics plant near a predominantly Black town in the parish. LeBoeuf and other prominent, local environmental activists met with White House officials in September to discuss the Biden administration's progress in responding to concerns raised by United Nations human rights experts over industrial expansion in the Chemical Corridor. LeBoeuf said she had rescheduled a doctor's appointment to meet with White House officials. She believes her advocacy for environmental justice is just as important a cure for her community as her ongoing chemotherapy treatment is for her body. 'Both are medicine,' LeBoeuf said. 'Fighting is medicine.' ___ Jack Brook is a corps member for The Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

In Mexico, the mayor of a state capital has been killed less than 1 week after he took office	MEXICO CITY (AP) — The mayor of a state capital in southern Mexico has been killed just one week after he took office, officials said Sunday. Alejandro Arcos was sworn in last Monday as mayor of Chilpancingo, a city so violent that a drug gang openly staged a demonstration, hijacked a government armored car and took police hostage in 2023 to win the release of arrested suspects. Chilpancingo is the capital of Guerrero state, where Acapulco is located. The state prosecutors’ office issued a statement Sunday confirming Arcos had been killed, but provided no details. Alejandro Moreno, the national leader of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, lamented Arcos' killing and said the newly installed secretary of the city council had also been murdered three days earlier. 'They had been in office less than a week,' Moreno wrote on his social media accounts. 'They were young and honest public servants who were seeking progress for their community.' Chilpancingo has long been the scene of bloody turf battles between two drug gangs, the Ardillos and the Tlacos. The battle has resulted in dozens of gruesome slayings and some high-profile scandals. A previous mayor was caught on video apparently holding a meeting with leaders of one of the gangs at a restaurant. She was subsequently expelled from her party. In July 2023, federal officials said a demonstration held by hundreds of people in Chilpancingo that month had been organized by the Ardillos gang to win the release of two gang leaders arrested for drugs and weapons possession. The demonstrators largely blocked all traffic on the highway between Mexico City and Acapulco for two days, battled security forces and commandeered a police armored truck and used it to ram down the gates of the state legislature building. The demonstrators abducted 10 members of the state police and National Guard, as well as three state and federal officials, and held them hostage to enforce their demands before releasing them.	https://apnews.com/article/mexico-guerrero-chilpancingo-mayor-killed-cartels-263349ff58e7bc5fd6b3c5ca9bdd4302	2024-10-06T19:13:48-07:00	
US spends a record $17.9 billion on military aid to Israel since last Oct. 7	WASHINGTON (AP) — The United States has spent a record of at least $17.9 billion on military aid to Israel since the war in Gaza began and led to escalating conflict around the Middle East, according to a report for Brown University's Costs of War project, released on the anniversary of Hamas’ attacks on Israel. An additional $4.86 billion has gone into stepped-up U.S. military operations in the region since the Oct. 7, 2023, attacks, researchers said in findings first provided to The Associated Press. That includes the costs of a Navy-led campaign to quell strikes on commercial shipping by Yemen's Houthis, who are carrying them out in solidarity with the fellow Iranian-backed group Hamas. The report — completed before Israel opened a second front, this one against Iranian-backed Hezbollah militants in Lebanon, in late September — is one of the first tallies of estimated U.S. costs as the Biden administration backs Israel in its conflicts in Gaza and Lebanon and seeks to contain hostilities by Iran-allied armed groups in the region. The financial toll is on top of the cost in human lives: Hamas militants killed more than 1,200 people in Israel a year ago and took others hostage. Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed nearly 42,000 people in Gaza, according to the territory's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in its count. At least 1,400 people in Lebanon, including Hezbollah fighters and civilians, have been killed since Israel greatly expanded its strikes in that country in late September. The financial costs were calculated by Linda J. Bilmes, a professor at Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government, who has assessed the full costs of U.S. wars since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, and fellow researchers William D. Hartung and Stephen Semler. Here's a look at where some of the U.S. taxpayer money went: Record military aid to Israel Israel — a protege of the United States since its 1948 founding — is the biggest recipient of U.S. military aid in history, getting $251.2 billion in inflation-adjusted dollars since 1959, the report says. Even so, the $17.9 billion spent since Oct. 7, 2023, in inflation-adjusted dollars, is by far the most military aid sent to Israel in one year. The U.S. committed to providing billions in military assistance to Israel and Egypt each year when they signed their 1979 U.S.-brokered peace treaty, and an agreement since the Obama administration set the annual amount for Israel at $3.8 billion through 2028. The U.S. aid since the Gaza war started includes military financing, arms sales, at least $4.4 billion in drawdowns from U.S. stockpiles and hand-me-downs of used equipment. Much of the U.S. weapons delivered in the year were munitions, from artillery shells to 2,000-pound bunker-busters and precision-guided bombs. Expenditures range from $4 billion to replenish Israel's Iron Dome and David’s Sling missile defense systems to cash for rifles and jet fuel, the study says. Unlike the United States' publicly documented military aid to Ukraine, it was impossible to get the full details of what the U.S. has shipped Israel since last Oct. 7, so the $17.9 billion for the year is a partial figure, the researchers said. They cited Biden administration 'efforts to hide the full amounts of aid and types of systems through bureaucratic maneuvering.' Funding for the key U.S. ally during a war that has exacted a heavy toll on civilians has divided Americans during the presidential campaign. But support for Israel has long carried weight in U.S. politics, and Biden said Friday that 'no administration has helped Israel more than I have.' U.S. military operations in the Middle East The Biden administration has bolstered its military strength in the region since the war in Gaza started, aiming to deter and respond to any attacks on Israeli and American forces. Those additional operations cost at least $4.86 billion, the report said, not including beefed-up U.S. military aid to Egypt and other partners in the region. The U.S. had 34,000 forces in the Middle East the day that Hamas broke through Israeli barricades around Gaza to attack. That number rose to about 50,000 in August when two aircraft carriers were in the region, aiming to discourage retaliation after a strike attributed to Israel killed Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Iran. The total is now around 43,000. The number of U.S. vessels and aircraft deployed — aircraft carrier strike groups, an amphibious ready group, fighter squadrons, and air defense batteries — in the Mediterranean, Red Sea and Gulf of Aden has varied during the year. The Pentagon has said another aircraft carrier strike group is headed to Europe very soon and that could increase the troop total again if two carriers are again in the region at the same time. The fight against the Houthis The U.S. military has deployed since the start of the war to try to counter escalated strikes by the Houthis, an armed faction that controls Yemen's capital and northern areas, and has been firing on merchant ships in the Red Sea in solidarity with Gaza. The researchers called the $4.86 billion cost to the U.S. an 'unexpectedly complicated and asymmetrically expensive challenge.' Houthis have kept launching attacks on ships traversing the critical trade route, drawing U.S. strikes on launch sites and other targets. The campaign has become the most intense running sea battle the Navy has faced since World War II. 'The U.S. has deployed multiple aircraft carriers, destroyers, cruisers and expensive multimillion-dollar missiles against cheap Iranian-made Houthi drones that cost $2,000,' the authors said. Just Friday, the U.S. military struck more than a dozen Houthi targets in Yemen, going after weapons systems, bases and other equipment, officials said. The researchers' calculations included at least $55 million in additional combat pay from the intensified operations in the region.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-us-military-spending-8e6e5033f7a1334bf6e35f86e7040e14	2024-10-06T19:09:45-07:00	
For US adversaries, Election Day won't mean the end to efforts to influence Americans	WASHINGTON (AP) — Soon, the ballots will be cast, the polls will close and a campaign marked by assassination attempts, animosity and anxiety will come to an end. But for U.S. adversaries, the work to meddle with American democracy may be entering its most critical phase. Despite all the attention on efforts to spread disinformation in the months before the Nov. 5 election, the hours and days immediately after voting ends could offer foreign adversaries like Russia, Iran and China or domestic extremist groups the best chance to mess with America's decision. That's when Americans will go online to see the latest results or share their opinions as the votes are tabulated. And that's when a fuzzy photo or AI-generated video of supposed vote tampering could do its most damage, potentially transforming online outrage into real-world action before authorities have time to investigate the facts. It's a threat taken seriously by intelligence analysts, elected officials and tech executives, who say that while there's already been a steady buildup of disinformation and influence operations, the worst may be yet to come. 'It's not like at the end of election night, particularly assuming how close this election will be, that this will be over,' said Sen. Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat who chairs the Senate Intelligence Committee. 'One of my greatest concerns is the level of misinformation, disinformation that may come from our adversaries after the polls close could actually be as significant as anything that happens up to the closing of the polls.' Analysts are blunter, warning that a particularly effective piece of disinformation could be devastating to public confidence in the election if spread in the hours after the polls close, and if the group behind the campaign knows to target a particularly important swing state or voting bloc. Possible scenarios include out-of-context footage of election workers repurposed to show supposed fraud, a deepfake video of a presidential candidate admitting to cheating or a robocall directed at non-English speakers warning them not to vote. When a false or misleading claim circulates weeks before the election, there's time for local election officials, law enforcement or news organizations to gather the facts, correct any falsehoods and get the word out. But if someone spreads a deceptive video or photo designed to make a big chunk of the electorate distrust the results the day after the election, it can be hard or even impossible for the truth to catch up. It happened four years ago, when a drumbeat of lies about the 2020 results spurred the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. Often, those arrested on accusations of trying to interfere with the transfer of power have cited debunked election fraud narratives that circulated shortly after Election Day. An especially close election decided in a handful of swing states could heighten that risk even further, making it more likely that a rumor about suitcases of illegal ballots in Georgia, to cite an example from 2020, could have a big impact on perceptions. President Joe Biden's victory over Donald Trump in 2020 wasn't especially close, and no irregularities big enough to affect the result were found — and yet false claims about vote-rigging were still widely believed by many supporters of the Republican, who's running for president again. The relatively long run-up to Inauguration Day on Jan. 20 gives those looking to sow doubt about the results ample time to do so, whether they are propaganda agencies in Moscow or extremist groups in the U.S. like the Proud Boys. Ryan LaSalle, CEO of the cybersecurity firm Nisos, said he won't feel relief until a new president is sworn in without any serious problems. 'The time to stay most focused is right now through the peaceful transfer of power,' LaSalle said. 'That’s when real-life activities could happen, and that’s when they would have the greatest chance of having an impact on that peaceful transfer.' Another risk, according to officials and tech companies, is that Russia or another adversary would try to hack into a local or state election system — not necessarily to change votes, but as a way of making voters question the security of the system. 'The most perilous time I think will come 48 hours before the election,' Microsoft President Brad Smith told lawmakers on the Senate Intelligence Committee last month. The hearing focused on American tech companies’ efforts to safeguard the election from foreign disinformation and cyberattacks. Election disinformation first emerged as a potent threat in 2016, when Russia hacked into the campaign of Democrat Hillary Clinton and created networks of fake social media accounts to pump out disinformation. The threat has only grown as social media has become a leading source of information and news for many voters. Content designed to divide Americans and make them mistrust their own institutions is no longer tied only to election seasons. Intelligence officials say Russia, China and other countries will only expand their use of online disinformation and propaganda going forward, a long-range strategy that looks beyond any one election or candidate. Despite the challenges, election security officials are quick to reassure Americans that the U.S. election system is impervious to any attack that could alter the outcome of the vote. While influence operations may seek to spread distrust about the results, improvements to the system make it stronger than ever when it comes to efforts to change votes. 'Malicious actors, even if they tried, could not have an impact at scale such that there would be a material effect on the outcome of the election,' Jen Easterly, director of the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, told The Associated Press.	https://apnews.com/article/election-interference-trump-harris-russia-china-efff7f7fcbc71032b1152d011c953eba	2024-10-06T19:04:50-07:00	
Tilda Swinton explores assisted suicide in Pedro Almodovar’s 'The Room Next Door'	TORONTO (AP) — Although 'The Room Next Door' is Pedro Almodóvar’s first English-language feature, Tilda Swinton notes that he’s never written in a language that anyone else truly speaks. 'He writes in Pedro language, and here he is making another film in another version of Pedro language, which just happens to sound a little bit like English,' Swinton said. Set in New York, Swinton stars as Martha, a terminally ill woman who chooses to end her life on her own terms. After reconnecting with her friend Ingrid, played by Julianne Moore, Martha persuades her to stay and keep her company before she goes through with her decision. Beyond the film’s narrative, Swinton said she believes individuals should have a say in their own living and dying. She acknowledges that she has personally witnessed a friend’s compassionate departure. 'In my own life I had the great good fortune to be asked by someone in Martha’s position to be his Ingrid (Julianne Moore),' Swinton said. She said that experience shaped her attitude about life and death: 'Not only my capacity to be witness to other people in that situation, but my own living and my own dying.' Swinton spoke to The Associated Press about 'The Room Next Door,' Almodóvar and he idea of letting people die on their own terms. Remarks have been edited for clarity and brevity. AP: Tackling that role, what was the challenge to get into the character? SWINTON: I felt really blessed by the opportunity. So many of us have been in the situation Julianne Moore’s character finds herself in, being asked to be the witness of someone who is dying. Whether that wanting to orchestrate their own dismount or not, to be in that position to be a witness is something that I’ve been privileged to experience many times in my life since I was quite young. AP: Many people experience watching terminally ill family members, can this film help them? SWINTON: It’s a really beautiful poem to a possibility of an attitude. I think (my character) Martha’s attitude to her own living is really inspiring. I would like to think that this is a really generous proposal and that it might inspire people to just know that it’s possible to face their own death with dignity, which is really what we’re talking about. It really is a fool’s errand to think we can avoid thinking about death because it’s not just unlucky people who get ill or who die. It’s an inevitability. And so we might as well, you know, embrace it. And by the way, the more we embrace it, I would suggest the more we will enjoy our living. AP: Your character goes to great extents to alleviate the criminality. Do you think that also shows that that perhaps that there is a place in a society for assisted suicide? SWINTON: There are many countries in the world where it is not criminal to assist somebody’s active will to orchestrate their own dying. And in the United States, there are 10 states where it is not criminal, where it’s possible for two doctors to assist in the active will of a patient to take charge of their own dying. And it’s there are just other places where and New York State, which is where our film is set, is not one of those 10 states. And there are all sorts of people, very wise and very compassionate people, very educated and very enlightened people, in my view, who are actively campaigning to broaden this acceptance. AP: You’ve worked with lots of great directors in your career, what was the adjustment to working with Pedro? SWINTON: I’d had a taste of it with short film, 'The Human Voice.' We made it in the middle of COVID. We shot it in nine days. Super, super fast… And I thought that Pedro was working very fast because it was a short film and because we were in the middle of COVID. No, no, that is the way Pedro works. I now discover super, super fast two takes, if you’re lucky. AP: Does his style put your performance on an organic path? SWINTON: I mean, it really helps always when you know the work of a filmmaker as well as it’s possible to know Pedro’s work. I’ve known it since I was a student, and I’ve loved it always. It’s like a country. I love to go to the world of Almodóvar and it’s not Spain, it’s somewhere else. It’s his environment. So, stepping into the frame of a filmmaker who creates that environment is always a bit of a trip. AP: At Venice, the film resonated with audiences with a very long standing ovation. How validating was that? SWINTON: It’s still a bit of a shock to us. When you’re in an audience, that’s the first indication of whether the souffle has risen or not. Apparently 18-and-a-half minutes is a record when you’re standing next to Pedro Almodóvar and you know that that is 18-and-a-half minutes of people really lovingly appreciating him. It pretty much doesn’t get much better than that. AP: Is awards season something that you look at when you’re doing a film like this? When you hear the buzz, is that something that’s ever on your mind? SWINTON: Not mine. To be honest, I’m ignorant really, of that in particular. I have other things on my mind. That’s like the weather. It’s like saying, do you have the weather in three months on your mind? Well, no. Let’s wait and see. Let’s keep it real. Let’s keep it today.	https://apnews.com/article/tilda-swinton-room-next-door-interview-abc0620a794b0a77c5f61b9b7f985c6f	2024-10-06T19:04:27-07:00	
Israelis, scarred and battling on multiple fronts, mark a year since Hamas' Oct. 7 attack	RE'IM, Israel (AP) — Israelis were holding vigils and somber ceremonies on Monday to mark a year since the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack, the deadliest in the country’s history, which sparked the war in Gaza and scarred Israelis indelibly. The surprise cross-border attack, which caught Israel unprepared on a major Jewish holiday, shattered Israelis’ sense of security and shook their faith in their leaders and their military. Its aftershocks still ripple one year later. The war in Gaza rages on, Israel is fighting a new war against Hezbollah, which began attacking Israel on Oct. 8, and an escalating conflict with Iran — which backs both Hamas and Hezbollah — threatens to drag the region into a far more dangerous conflagration. In Gaza, which is still buckling under the weight of the ongoing war, no formal commemorative event is planned. The massive destruction and displacement are a constant reminder of the retaliatory Israeli assault on the territory, which has no end in sight. Israelis were expected to flock to ceremonies, cemeteries and memorial sites around the country, remembering the hundreds of victims, the dozens of hostages still in captivity and the soldiers wounded or killed trying to save them. At 6:30 a.m. — the exact hour Hamas launched its attack — the families of those killed at the Nova music festival, joined by Israeli President Isaac Herzog, gathered at the site where almost 400 revelers were gunned down and from where many others were taken hostage. After briefly playing the same trance music that was blared during the festival, hundreds of family members and friends of the victims stood for a moment of silence. One woman’s piercing wail broke the silence as booms echoed from the fighting in Gaza, just a few kilometers away. 'When we are here, we are near our loved ones, this is the time they danced and fled,' said Sigal Bar-On, whose niece, Yuval Bar-On, 25, and her fiancée Moshe Shuva, 34, were supposed to get married in December 2023. At 6:31 a.m., four projectiles were launched from Gaza toward the very Israeli communities that came under fierce assault last year, the Israeli military said. The ceremony was not disrupted. At that same time, the families of hostages still held in Gaza — about 100, a third of whom are said to be dead — gathered near Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Jerusalem residence and stood during a two-minute siren, replicating a custom from the the most solemn dates on the Israeli calendar, Holocaust Remembrance and Memorial Day. 'We are here to remind (the hostages) that we haven’t forgotten them,' said Shiri Albag, whose daughter Liri is among the captives. Her message to Netanyahu: 'We wont let you rest until all of them are back, every last one of them,' she told the crowd, which hoisted the faces of the hostages. An official state ceremony focusing on acts of bravery and hope is set to be aired on Monday evening. The ceremony was prerecorded without an audience — apparently to avoid potential disruptions — in the southern city of Ofakim, where over two dozen Israelis were killed. But anger at the government’s failure to prevent the attack and enduring frustration that it has not returned the remaining hostages prompted the families of those killed and taken captive to hold a separate event in Tel Aviv. That event had been set to draw tens of thousands of people but was scaled back drastically over prohibitions on large gatherings due to the threat of missile attacks from Iran and Hezbollah. Hamas’ attack, which killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and dragged some 250 into Gaza as hostages, continues to cast a shadow over daily life in Israel. Dozens of hostages remain in captivity, with no end in sight to their struggle. Border communities have been upended and tens of thousands were displaced. Soldiers are being killed in Gaza and Lebanon. Israel faces ongoing international criticism over its wartime conduct, with two world courts examining its actions. The war in Gaza has killed more than 41,000 Palestinians, displaced most of the territory's 2.3 million population and sparked a humanitarian crisis that has led to widespread hunger. It has also left the tiny coastal enclave ravaged beyond recognition as U.S.-led cease-fire efforts have repeatedly sputtered. ___ Goldenberg reported from Tel Aviv, Israel. ___ Follow AP's coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/mideast-wars	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-one-year-anniversary-cf123f95609051e8e8eaf6aebe661b6a	2024-10-06T18:35:39-07:00	
Samoa warns of 'highly probable' oil spill from New Zealand navy ship that sank and caught fire	WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — An oil spill is 'highly probable' from a grounded New Zealand navy ship which sank and caught fire off the coast of Samoa, the Pacific island nation's acting prime minister said late Sunday. Officials in Samoa are conducting an environmental impact assessment in the area where the ship sank on Sunday morning, acting Prime Minister Tuala Tevaga Iosefo Ponifasio said in a statement. All 75 people on board the HMNZS Manawanui were taken to safety on life rafts in 'challenging conditions' and darkness, New Zealand’s Chief of Navy Rear Admiral Garin Golding told reporters. The vessel was about a mile from shore when it grounded on a reef and began taking on water, but it took the first survivors five hours to reach land, he said. New Zealand will hold a court of inquiry into the loss of the ship, which was one of nine in its navy. The cause of the disaster is not known. The specialist dive and hydrographic vessel had been in service since 2019. It was surveying a reef off the coast of Upolu, Samoa’s most populous island, when it ran aground on the reef. Photos and videos taken from the shore appeared to show the ship listing before disappearing completely below the waves, with a large plume of smoke rising where it sank. Defense Minister Judith Collins said she did not expect the vessel could be salvaged. 'This is a ship that unfortunately is pretty much gone,' she told reporters. Those on board included civilian scientists and foreign military personnel, Golding said. Authorities in Samoa said some were treated for minor injuries. There was 'a lot of fuel' on the ship and efforts had turned to assessing the potential environmental impact, Collins told Radio New Zealand Monday. New Zealand 'would obviously have to front up' if there was a spill, she added. The state of New Zealand’s ageing military hardware has prompted warnings from the defense agency, which in a March report described the navy as 'extremely fragile,' with ships idle due to problems retaining the staff needed to service and maintain them. Golding said the HMNZS Manawanui underwent its usual maintenance before the deployment. The ship’s captain was an experienced commander who had worked on the vessel for two years, he said.	https://apnews.com/article/samoa-zealand-navy-ship-sank-fire-spill-47500555456f78dad18a958b95ab500c	2024-10-06T13:47:47-07:00	
A massive blast outside Karachi Airport in Pakistan kills 2 and injures at least 8	KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) — A massive blast outside Karachi Airport in Pakistan on Sunday killed two people and injured at least eight, officials said. Police and the provincial government said a tanker exploded outside the airport, which is Pakistan’s biggest. But the provincial home minister, Zia Ul Hassan, told local TV station Geo that it was an attack targeting foreigners. A Home Ministry official told The Associated Press that it was an attack on Chinese nationals, one of whom was injured. He spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to the media. Thousands of Chinese workers are in Pakistan, most of them involved in Beijing’s multibillion-dollar Belt and Road Initiative that connects south and central Asia with the Chinese capital. Videos showed flames engulfing cars and a thick column of smoke rising from the scene. There was a heavy military deployment at the site, which was cordoned off. Deputy Inspector General East Azfar Mahesar told media that it seemed like it was an oil tanker explosion. 'We are determining the nature and reasons for the blast. It takes time.' Police officers were among the injured, he added. The home minister and inspector general also visited the blast site, but they did not talk to the press. Rahat Hussain, who works in the civil aviation department, said the blast was so big that it shook the airport’s buildings.	https://apnews.com/article/pakistan-karachi-airport-blast-6b6387efa177af341f1a125bc802102c	2024-10-06T10:30:52-07:00	
Over 6,000 people in Haiti leave their homes after gang attack killed dozens	SAINT-MARC, Haiti (AP) — Nearly 6,300 people have fled their homes in the aftermath of an attack in central Haiti by heavily armed gang members that killed at least 70 people, according to the U.N.’s migration agency. Nearly 90% of the displaced are staying with relatives in host families, while 12% have found refuge in other sites including a school, the International Organization for Migration said in a report last week. The attack in Pont-Sondé happened in the early hours of Thursday morning, and many left in the middle of the night. Gang members 'came in shooting and breaking into the houses to steal and burn. I just had time to grab my children and run in the dark,' said 60-year-old Sonise Mirano on Sunday, who was camping with hundreds of people in a park in the nearby coastal city of Saint-Marc. Bodies lay strewn on the streets of Pont-Sondé following the attack in the Artibonite region, many of them killed by a shot to the head, Bertide Harace, spokeswoman for the Commission for Dialogue, Reconciliation and Awareness to Save the Artibonite, told Magik 9 radio station on Friday. Initial estimates put the number of those killed at 20 people, but activists and government officials discovered more bodies as they accessed areas of the town. Among the victims was a young mother, her newborn baby and a midwife, Herace said. Prime Minister Garry Conille vowed that the perpetrators would face the full force of the law in comments in Saint-Marc on Friday. 'It is necessary to arrest them, bring them to justice, and put them in prison. They need to pay for what they have done, and the victims need to receive restitution,' he said. The U.N. Human Rights Office of the Commissioner said in a statement that it was 'horrified by Thursday’s gang attacks.' The European Union also condemned the violence in a statement on Friday, which it said marked 'yet another escalation in the extreme violence these criminal groups are inflicting on the Haitian people.' Haiti’s government deployed an elite police unit based in the capital of Port-au-Prince to Pont-Sondé following the attack and sent medical supplies to help the area’s lone, and overwhelmed, hospital. Police will remain in the area for as long as it takes to guarantee safety, Conille said, adding that he didn’t know whether it would take a day or a month. He also appealed to the population, saying 'the police cannot do it alone.' Gang violence across Artibonite, which produces much of Haiti’s food, has increased in recent years. Since that uptick, Thursday’s attack is one of the biggest massacres. Similar ones have taken place in the capital of Port-au-Prince, 80% of which is controlled by gangs, and they typically are linked to turf wars, with gang members targeting civilians in areas controlled by rivals. Many neighborhoods are not safe, and people affected by the violence have not been able to return home, even if their houses have not been destroyed. More than 700,000 people — more than half of whom are children — are now internally displaced across Haiti, according to the International Organization for Migration in an Oct. 2 statement. That was an increase of 22% since June. Port-au-Prince hosts a quarter of the country’s displaced, often residing in overcrowded sites, with little to no access to basic services, the agency said. Those forced to flee their homes are mostly being accommodated by families, who have reported significant difficulties, including food shortages, overwhelmed healthcare facilities, and a lack of essential supplies on local markets, according to the agency. ___ Hughes reported from Rio de Janeiro.	https://apnews.com/article/haiti-gang-attack-displaced-un-d45cbcbe3258523291d3b36bbd4f30f5	2024-10-06T10:26:11-07:00	
Minnesota man arrested after allegedly threatening to 'shoot up' synagogue	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — A Minnesota man was arrested after allegedly threatening to 'shoot up' a Minneapolis synagogue, officials announced on Saturday. Staff at Temple Israel reported to the Minneapolis Police Department on Sept. 11 that they had received several phone calls from a person threatening to 'shoot up' the synagogue. Then on Thursday, a special police detail assigned provide extra patrols around Temple Israel ahead of the Jewish new year and the one-year anniversary of the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel were notified of a man outside with a firearm. He fled the area, but officers arrested a 21-year-old man the next day. 'Everyone in Minneapolis has the right to feel safe in their communities, and we will ensure our Jewish neighbors are protected as they celebrate the holy days,' Minneapolis Police Chief Brian Chief O’Hara said at a news conference. 'We take all threats made against our religious institutions seriously, and will continue to hold the individuals accountable who threaten any of our city’s houses of worship.' O'Hara said officers learned the man had used a phone app to mask his voice as he made repeated threats against the synagogue. Officers did not recover a gun. The man was arrested for making 'terroristic threats' and charges will be referred to the Hennepin County Attorney’s Office. O’Hara said officers had not found evidence the threat was motivated by antisemitism, but he said the timing of the threats was concerning. 'Since the Oct. 7 terrorist attacks, the worst terrorist attack on our Jewish community since the Holocaust, our police officers have been present where a whole lot of hateful rhetoric has been said against our residents, against members of our community, simply because they are Jewish,' O’Hara said.	https://apnews.com/article/minneapolis-synagogue-shooting-threat-da711840fadd4c40377d20434af0bbf3	2024-10-06T08:22:26-07:00	
Pro-Palestinian and pro-Israeli crowds rally across the world on the eve of Oct. 7 anniversary	PARIS (AP) — Crowds were participating in pro-Palestinian and pro-Israeli protests and memorial events across the world on Sunday on the eve of the first anniversary of the Hamas attacks on Israel. Sunday’s events follow massive rallies that took place Saturday in several European cities, including London, Berlin, Paris and Rome. Other events are scheduled through the week, with an expected peak on Monday, the date of the anniversary. In Australia, thousands of people on Sunday protested in support of Palestinians and Lebanon in various cities, while a pro-Israeli rally also took place in Melbourne. Samantha Gazal, who came to the rally in Sydnay, said she was there 'because I can’t believe our government is giving impunity to a violent extremist nation and has done nothing. ... We’re watching the violence play out on livestream, and they’re doing nothing.' In Melbourne, supporters of Israel held up posters showing Israeli hostages who are still missing. 'We feel like we didn’t do anything to deserve this,' said Jeremy Wenstein, one of the participants. 'We’re just supporting our brothers and sisters who are fighting a war that they didn’t invite.' At a rally in Berlin, near the Brandenburg Gate, hundreds of pro-Israeli demonstrators set off up the famed Unter den Linden behind a banner that read 'Against all antisemitism,' accompanied by a police escort. With many Israel flags waving over head, some Jewish leaders led a song about 'shalom' — peace — while marchers chanted 'Free Gaza from Hamas!' and 'Bring them home,' referring to hostages still held in the Gaza strip. Some in the crowd held up photos of hostages still held by Hamas. Photos of several women featured the word 'Kidnapped' in German. Memorial events organized by the Jewish community for those killed in the Oct. 7 attack and prayers for those still in captivity were also to be held in Paris and London on Sunday afternoon. Security forces in several countries warned of heightened levels of alert in major cities, amid concerns that the escalating conflict in the Middle East could inspire new terror attacks in Europe or that some of the protests could turn violent. On Sunday, Italy’s Premier Giorgia Meloni expressed her 'full solidarity' with police, the day after after security forces used tear gas and water cannons to disperse violent demonstrators in Rome. Meloni firmly condemned clashes between a few pro-Palestinian demonstrators and law enforcement officers, saying it was 'intolerable that dozens of officers are injured during a demonstration.' Thirty police officers and four protesters were hurt in clashes at the pro-Palestinian march in Rome Saturday, local media said. In Rome’s central Piazzale Ostiense, hooded protesters threw stones, bottles and even a street sign at the police, who responded using water cannons and tear gas. Pope Francis, celebrating his Sunday Angelus prayer from the Vatican, issued a new appeal for peace 'on every front.' Francis also urged his audience not to forget the many hostages still held in Gaza, asking for 'their immediate liberation.' The pope called for a day of prayer and fasting on Monday, the first anniversary of the attack. On Oct. 7 last year, Hamas launched a surprise attack into Israel, killing 1,200 Israelis, taking 250 people hostage and setting off a war with Israel that has shattered much of the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip. More than 41,000 Palestinians have been killed since then in Gaza, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not differentiate between fighters and civilians. It says more than half were women and children. Nearly 100 Israeli hostages remain in Gaza, with fewer than 70 believed to be alive. Israelis have experienced attacks — missiles from Iran and Hezbollah, explosive drones from Yemen, fatal shootings and stabbings — as the region braces for further escalation. In late September, Israel shifted some of its focus to Hezbollah, which holds much of the power in parts of southern Lebanon and some other areas of the country, attacking the militants with exploding pagers, airstrikes and, eventually, incursions into Lebanon.	https://apnews.com/article/mideast-israel-gaza-war-protests-memorial-hostages-d1e8c03e14c28c64afa3fffe086c3e8f	2024-10-06T04:56:23-07:00	
Brazilians vote in tense local elections	RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) — Brazilians began voting in the first round of local elections on Sunday for mayors, deputy mayors and councilors in the country’s 5,569 municipalities. In Sao Paulo, three mayoral candidates are running neck-and-neck, including incumbent Ricardo Nunes, left-wing lawmaker Guilherme Boulos and self-help guru turned far-right politician Pablo Marçal. A runoff is scheduled for Oct. 27. Much of the attention leading up to Sunday’s vote has been on Brazil ’s biggest city, where the race has been marred by episodes of violence involving Marçal. Last month, José Luiz Datena, a former TV presenter turned candidate, slammed Marçal with a metal chair during a televised debate following references to allegations of sexual misconduct. In a later debate, an aide to Marçal thumped an adversary’s counterpart, resulting in a bloody face. Marçal sparked more controversy on Friday, when he published on social media a falsified medical report indicating cocaine use by Boulos. The document was widely debunked by local media that pointed to inconsistencies including the fact that it was signed by a doctor who had passed away. Boulos, a longtime campaigner for housing rights who is backed by President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, vehemently denied the veracity of the document. On Saturday, a judge sitting on Sao Paulo’s electoral court ordered the suspension of Marçal’s Instagram account for 48 hours and deemed that there are 'indications of various offenses under the Electoral Code.' Some of former President Jair Bolsonaro ’s political base has been drawn to Marçal, enthralled by his fiery rhetoric, although the far-right leader is supporting Nunes. In Rio de Janeiro, incumbent Eduardo Paes is hoping to avoid a second-round runoff. Polls indicated until recently that was possible. But his principal challenger Alexandre Ramagem has steadily climbed in the polls in recent weeks, rendering the outcome of Sunday’s vote uncertain. Ramagem, the former chief of Brazil’s intelligence agency under Bolsonaro, is being investigated as part of a wider probe into alleged spying on political opponents. He has denied the accusations. Bolsonaro is backing Ramagem, and his ascent in the polls is widely attributed to the former president's campaigning on his behalf. More than 155 million Brazilians are eligible to vote. Forty-three percent of the electorate is in the southeastern region, where Rio and Sao Paulo are located. Women make up around 52% of voters. Nearly 1,000 transgender politicians are running Sunday in every one of Brazil’s 26 states, according to the nation’s electoral court, which is tracking them for the first time. The number of candidacies has tripled since the last local elections four years ago, when trans rights group Antra mapped them. Polls opened at 8 a.m. Brasilia time and close at 5 p.m. (2000 GMT). A second round will be held in municipalities with more than 200,000 registered voters if none of the candidates for mayor obtains an absolute majority.	https://apnews.com/article/brazil-municipal-elections-nunes-marcal-1e762fc9bc72abba1049997d7c79ee55	2024-10-06T04:29:47-07:00	
Tropical Storm Milton could hit Florida as a major hurricane midweek	MIAMI (AP) — People across Florida were given notice Sunday that Milton, for now just a tropical storm off the coast of Mexico, could intensify rapidly into a major hurricane before slamming midweek into the storm-ravaged Gulf Coast. Tropical Storm Milton's center was about 860 miles (1,385 kilometers) west-southwest of Tampa, Florida, early Sunday, heading east at 5 mph (7 kph) with maximum sustained winds of 60 mph (95 kph), the National Hurricane Center in Miami said. 'Milton is moving slowly but is expected to strengthen rapidly,' the center said. 'There is increasing confidence that a powerful hurricane with life-threatening hazards will be affecting portions of the Florida west coast around the middle of this week.' Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said Sunday that while it remains to be seen just where Milton will strike, it's clear that Florida is going to be hit hard — 'I don't think there's any scenario where we don't have major impacts at this point.' 'You have time to prepare — all day today, all day Monday, probably all day Tuesday to be sure your hurricane preparedness plan is in place,' the governor said. 'Know your evacuation zone — there will be mandatory and voluntary evacuations.' DeSantis said as many as 4,000 National Guard troops are helping the Florida Division of Emergency Management and the Florida Department of Transportation to remove debris, and he declared a state of emergency in 35 counties ahead of Milton. He said Floridians should prepare for more power outages and disruption. 'All available state assets ... are being marshaled to help remove debris,' DeSantis said. 'We're going 24-7 ... it's all hands on deck.' FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell defended her agency's response to the destruction wrought by Hurricane Helene after Republicans’ false claims, amplified by former President Donald Trump, created a frenzy of misinformation across devastated communities. 'This kind of rhetoric is not helpful to people and it’s really a shame we’re putting politics ahead of helping people,' Criswell told ABC’s George Stephanopoulos. It's created fear and mistrust among residents against the thousands of FEMA employees and volunteers on the ground across the southeast, she said. Despite this, Criswell said the agency is already preparing for Milton, well before it's clear exactly where it will move across the Florida peninsula this week. 'We’re working with the state there to understand what their requirements are going to be, so we can have those in place before it makes landfall,' she said. The hurricane center said Mexico’s Yucatan peninsula, the Florida Peninsula, the Florida Keys and the northwestern Bahamas should monitor the system’s progress. Heavy rainfall was expected Sunday ahead of the storm itself, and will likely then combine with Milton's rainfall to flood waterways and streets in Florida, where forecasters said up to a foot (30 centimeters) of rain could fall in places through Wednesday night. 'There is an increasing risk of life-threatening storm surge and wind impacts for portions of the west coast of the Florida Peninsula beginning late Tuesday or Wednesday. Residents in these areas should ensure they have their hurricane plan in place, follow any advice given by local officials, and check back for updates to the forecast,' the center said. The Atlantic hurricane season has become more active as rescuers in the U.S. Southeast continue to search for people unaccounted for in the wake of Hurricane Helene, which left a huge trail of death and catastrophic damage from Florida into the Appalachian mountains. Hurricane Kirk diminished to a Category 2 hurricane in the open Atlantic early, with top winds of 105 mph (165 kph), sending large swells and 'life-threatening surf and rip current conditions' to Bermuda and northward along the U.S. and Canadian coasts, the center said. Hurricane Leslie also was moving northwest over the open Atlantic, with top winds of 85 mph (140 kph) but posing no threats to land.	https://apnews.com/article/tropical-weather-milton-helene-florida-fe1a0232599542fffeb080e5d3a3683e	2024-10-06T04:29:42-07:00	
Tunisians vote in an election with one of President Saied's 2 challengers in prison	TUNIS, Tunisia (AP) — Tunisians cast ballots Sunday in the country’s third presidential election since the pro-democracy revolt known as the Arab Spring, while one of the candidates remains in prison. Voters are deciding who among three candidates will lead the North African nation for the next five years — President Kais Saied, imprisoned businessman Ayachi Zammel or Zouhair Maghzaoui, a leftist who supported Saied before choosing to run against him. Saied, the 66-year-old first-term president, is considered the heavy favorite largely because of a crackdown on his opponents and the moves to remove checks and balances on his executive power. The majority of the opposition is boycotting the contest in protest of what they call an absence of democratic conditions for free and fair elections. Dozens of candidates had expressed interest to challenge Saied and 17 submitted preliminary paperwork to run in Sunday’s race. However, members of the election commission, all of whom are appointed by the president, approved only three. They ignored a court ruling ordering them to reinstate three other challengers. Zammel was later imprisoned and charged with forging voter signatures to qualify for the ballot, which his attorney denied. Tunisia's presidential election is its third since protests led to the 2011 ouster of President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali — the first autocrat toppled in the Arab Spring uprisings that also overthrew leaders in Egypt, Libya and Yemen.	https://apnews.com/article/tunisia-election-saied-opposition-11a1ba0d77ec1459928bb2266792551f	2024-10-06T03:00:50-07:00	
Central Thailand braces for inundation as rain stops in flooded Chiang Mai	CHIANG MAI, Thailand (AP) — Several provinces in central Thailand braced for floods Sunday after the Irrigation Department announced it was releasing water from a major dam after weeks of frequent heavy rain. The rain stopped in the northern city of Chiang Mai, but many people, especially the elderly, remained cut off by floodwaters that in some areas were waist-high or more. Volunteer rescue teams, often traveling by boat, worked to supply them with food or evacuate them. Further complicating the situation, electricity was cut off in some neighborhoods for safety reasons. Areas popular with tourists, such as the city’s Night Bazaar and Tha Pae Gate, were under as much as a meter (3 1/3 feet) of water. Central provinces, including the capital Bangkok, have been warned of possible flooding as the Irrigation Department plans to release water from the Chao Phraya Dam to keep it under capacity. The latest flooding in Chiang Mai began when the Ping River, which runs along the eastern edge of the city, began overrunning its banks on Friday. Flooding is an annual problem in many parts of Thailand during the monsoon season. Concern remained for animals that had been kept in parks and sanctuaries on the outskirts of Chiang Mai. Most of the the 125 elephants held at the city's Elephant Nature Park have been led to safety, though some escaped on their own to seek higher ground. Photos in Thai media showed elephants in water so deep that they could barely keep their heads above it. Thai media reported that at least two elephants have been found dead and several more were unaccounted for.	https://apnews.com/article/thailand-chiang-mai-floods-elephants-b94db0efe687b35755e694fa7d8b8944	2024-10-06T02:55:15-07:00	
Rwanda will deploy Marburg vaccine under trial as death toll rises to 12	KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) — Rwandan health authorities will begin a vaccine study against the Marburg hemorrhagic fever, officials said Sunday, as the East African country tries to stop the spread of an outbreak that has killed 12 people. Rwanda, which received 700 doses of a vaccine under trial from the U.S.-based Sabin Vaccine Institute on Saturday, will target health workers and emergency responders as well as individuals who have been in contact with confirmed cases, according to the Health Ministry. Health Minister Sabin Nsanzimana told reporters Sunday that the Rwanda Biomedical Centre had reviewed the vaccine shipment. There is no authorized vaccine or treatment for Marburg. Like Ebola, the Marburg virus is believed to originate in fruit bats and spreads between people through close contact with the bodily fluids of infected individuals or with surfaces, such as contaminated bed sheets. Without treatment, Marburg can be fatal in up to 88% of people who fall ill with the disease. In a statement, Sabin Vaccine Institute said it had 'entered into a clinical trial agreement with the Rwanda Biomedical Centre, the trial sponsor, to provide investigational doses' for the study. The Rwandan government said there were 46 confirmed cases, with 29 of them in isolation. Health authorities have identified at least 400 people who came into contact with confirmed cases of the virus. Rwanda declared an outbreak of Marburg on Sept. 27 and reported six deaths a day later. Authorities said at the time that the first cases had been found among patients in health facilities. There is still no confirmation of the source of the outbreak. Symptoms include fever, muscle pains, diarrhea, vomiting and, in some cases, death through extreme blood loss. In Rwanda, most of the sick are health workers in six out of the country's 30 districts. Some patients live in districts bordering Congo, Burundi, Uganda and Tanzania, according to the World Health Organization. Rwandans have been urged to avoid physical contact to help curb the spread. Strict measures include the suspension of school and hospital visits as well as a restriction on the number of those who can attend funerals for Marburg victims. Home vigils aren’t allowed in the event a death is linked to Marburg. The U.S. Embassy in Kigali has urged its staff to work remotely and avoid visiting offices. Marburg outbreaks and individual cases have in the past been recorded in Tanzania, Equatorial Guinea, Angola, Congo, Kenya, South Africa, Uganda and Ghana, according to WHO. The virus was first identified in 1967, after it caused simultaneous outbreaks of disease in laboratories in Marburg, Germany and Belgrade, Serbia. Seven people died after being exposed to the virus while conducting research on monkeys.	https://apnews.com/article/rwanda-marburg-outbreak-vaccine-4eb415e5ebd15755242ce85467368cf7	2024-10-06T02:08:15-07:00	
Pope names 21 new cardinals, significantly increasing pool who will one day elect successor	ROME (AP) — Pope Francis named 21 new cardinals Sunday, significantly increasing the size of the College of Cardinals and further cementing his mark on the group of prelates who will one day elect his successor. Among those named by history’s first Latin American pope were the heads of several major dioceses and archdioceses in South America. They include the heads of the Catholic Church in Santiago del Estero, Argentina; Porto Alegre, Brazil; Santiago, Chile; Guayaquil, Ecuador; and Lima, Peru. The new cardinals will get their red hats at a ceremony, known as a consistory, on Dec. 8, an important feast day on its own that officially kicks off the Christmas season in Rome. Even before Sunday’s announcement, Francis had already named the vast majority of the voting-age cardinals who will one day vote in a conclave to choose his successor. According to Vatican statistics, before Sunday, 92 of the cardinals under 80 — and thus eligible to vote in a conclave — had been named by Francis, compared with 24 named by Pope Benedict XVI and six by St. John Paul II. Added to their ranks on Sunday were two Vatican officials who hold positions that don’t usually carry with them a cardinal’s rank: the official in charge of the migrants section of the Vatican development office, the Rev. Fabio Baggio, and the official who organizes the pope’s foreign travels, the Rev. George Jacob Koovakad. In a nod to the current synod underway at the Vatican this month debating the future of the church, Francis also tapped the Rev. Timothy Radcliffe, a British theologian who is one of the spiritual advisers for the meeting. ___ Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

1 dead as Russia strikes Ukraine with drones and missiles	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — One person has died after Russian forces attacked Ukraine overnight with 87 Shahed drones and four different types of missiles, officials said Sunday. A 49-year-old man was killed in the Kharkiv region after his car was hit by a drone, said regional Gov. Oleh Syniehubov. A gas pipeline was also damaged and a warehouse set alight in the city of Odesa, Ukrainian officials reported. Ukraine’s air force said in a statement that air defenses had destroyed 56 of the 87 drones and two missiles over 14 Ukrainian regions, including the capital, Kyiv. Another 25 drones disappeared from radar 'presumably as a result of anti-aircraft missile defense,' it said. The barrage comes a day after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Saturday that he will present his 'victory plan' at the Oct. 12 meeting of the Ramstein group of nations that supplies arms to Ukraine. Zelenskyy presented his plan to U.S. President Joe Biden in Washington last week. Its contents have not been made public but it is known that the plan includes Ukrainian membership in NATO and the provision of long-range missiles to strike inside Russia. In a statement Sunday, the Ukrainian leader paid tribute to the country’s troops, which he also described as 'preparing (for) the next Ramstein.' 'They demonstrate what Ukrainians are capable of when they have enough weapons and sufficient range,' he said in a statement on social media. 'We will keep convincing our partners that our drones alone are not enough. More decisive steps are needed — and the end of this war will be closer.'	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-drone-strike-missiles-ramstein-fe11f1e598e66f456361a785237b9de0	2024-10-06T00:40:22-07:00	
International rescue teams arrive in Bosnia after devastating floods and landslides	SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) — Rescue teams from Bosnia's neighbors and European Union countries on Sunday were joining efforts to clear the rubble and find people still missing from floods and landslides that devastated parts of the Balkan country. Bosnia sought EU help after a heavy rainstorm overnight on Friday left entire areas under water and debris destroyed roads and bridges, killing at least 18 people and wounding dozens. 'Our hearts and thoughts are with the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina, hit by devastating floods,' EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said on X. 'We have activated our EU Civil Protection Mechanism and are sending rescue teams on the ground. This is EU solidarity in action.' Officials said that at least 10 people are still unaccounted for, many of them in the village of Donja Jablanica, in southern Bosnia, which was almost completely buried in rocks and rubble from a quarry on a hill above. Residents there have said they heard a thundering rumble and saw houses disappear before their eyes. 'We heard water and rock coming down from the hill. I told my son, Let's go up to the attic, we don’t know what’s going to happen,' recalled Munevera Dautbegovic. 'In the morning when we got out, we saw large amount of sand around.' Regional Gov. Nermin Niksic visited the village on Sunday, promising help to rebuild. 'All material damage can be compensated somehow but human lives cannot. Grief will stay on.' Earlier on Sunday, Luigi Soreca, who heads the EU mission in Bosnia, said on X that teams wer arriving to help. Bosnia is a candidate country for membership in the 27-nation bloc. Authorities said Croatian rescuers have already arrived while a team from Serbia is expected to be deployed in the afternoon, followed by a Slovenian team with dogs. Montenegro, North Macedonia, Poland, Czechia and Turkey have also offered help, a government statement said. Sunday is the date of a local election in Bosnia. Election authorities have postponed voting in the flood-hit regions, but the flooding has overshadowed the vote across the country. Ismeta Bucalovic, a resident of Sarajevo, Bosnia's capital, said 'we are all overwhelmed by these flooding events. We all think only about that.' Impoverished and ethnically divided, Bosnia has struggled to recover after the brutal war in 1992-95. The country is plagued by political bickering and corruption, stalling its EU bid.	https://apnews.com/article/bosnia-floods-eu-help-missing-3c2545e71652ebdd3a18cd0701d200b4	2024-10-05T23:45:38-07:00	
Lebanese worldwide fear for their homeland and loved ones as violence escalates	It was a year ago when Jomana Siddiqui visited Lebanon, where her father was born — and is now buried. She planned to return there soon; this time, she thought, she would take her two teenage daughters. Instead, Siddiqui, who lives in California, now worries about relatives there. As she watches from afar the violence and the recent escalation in Israel’s military campaign against Hezbollah in Lebanon, Siddiqui thinks about the people she met during her visit, the kindness and generosity she encountered. She thinks about her father’s grave — when, or if, she will get to visit it again. Her voice cracks with emotions. It’s been gut-wrenching, she said. 'It’s like the universal story of the Lebanese people,' she said. 'They have to keep leaving and not knowing when they can come back.' From the United States to South Africa, Cyprus, Brazil and beyond, many members of Lebanon’s far-flung and large diaspora are contending with the ripples of the violence — grieving, gripped by fear for loved ones and for their homeland, trying to find ways to help. Some 1,400 Lebanese, including civilians and fighters of the militant group Hezbollah, have been killed and some 1.2 million driven from their homes since Israel escalated its strikes in late September, saying it aims to push Hezbollah away from the countries’ shared border. For Lina Kayat, who moved to South Africa almost 36 years ago but still has a big family in Lebanon, the violence and tensions there have echoes of earlier turbulent chapters. 'We lived through a civil war for a long time; I was like seven years old,' she said. 'It feels like history repeating itself. ... It’s the unknown of who is going to get killed next.' Kayat, who lives in South Africa’s coastal city of Durban, speaks daily to her family, including her mother and her sister. 'They are very scared and very worried about what is going to happen,' she said. Generations of Lebanese have grappled with whether to leave to seek better opportunities or escape various times of tumult — from a 15-year-old civil war to military occupations, bombings and political assassinations — or stay in a Lebanon that despite its numerous scars retains its allure for many. Lebanon — home to multiple religious groups, including Christians and Sunni and Shiite Muslims — takes pride in its large emigrant communities, which include successful businessmen and celebrities of Lebanese heritage. The current military escalation unfolds amid fears that fighting could spread in the region and comes as the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza nears the grim one-year mark. 'It happening on top of Gaza is almost too much to bear,' said James Zogby, president of the Washington D.C.-based Arab American Institute. 'It almost makes you physically ill just trying to fathom the extent of the trauma,' added Zogby, whose father was born in Lebanon. Already, Lebanon had been on edge and struggling under the weight of an economic meltdown, the fallout from a massive 2020 port explosion and other crises. It’s been without a president for two years. Against such a somber backdrop, Zogby wonders what will become of the displaced. 'Who’s going to care for them? Where do the health services come from ... when the country is already as overstretched as it is and on the verge of collapse?' he said. 'At what point does it finally collapse? And who will care?' Fueling the pain, he said, is his anger at the U.S. response to the devastation in Gaza and now the escalation in Lebanon. 'There’s a sense of powerlessness, a sense of almost despair that, you know, it can get out of control. And as long as nothing here happens to restrain it, it will get worse.' Akram Khater, director of the Khayrallah Center for Lebanese Diaspora Studies at North Carolina State University, said that since the earliest diaspora, Lebanese who left have been contributing heavily to the economic well-being of Lebanon, sending large amounts of remittances. Watching the escalation in Lebanon, where he was born and raised, has been re-traumatizing, he said. 'I find myself amidst a swirl of emotions that are unresolved and that derive from this recurring nightmare,' he said. 'Yet, even amidst this our community comes together to create solidarity and provide solace and comfort for each other.' Recently, hundreds of Lebanese flags filled the night sky in Dearborn, Michigan, as some attended a rally to support Lebanon and protest the Israeli offensive there. At Sao Paulo’s international airport, two Lebanese brothers who’ve been living in Brazil, recently had a solemn reunion. They said eight of their loved ones — their sister, brother-in-law, four of their nephews and two of their nephews’ children — were killed in Lebanon in one of the attacks. Hussein Zeineddine, one of the brothers, had been on vacation with his family in southern Lebanon when the area was hit by Israeli attacks, he told The Associated Press. He and his family moved to a safer location until they could book flights back to Brazil. 'My wife was crying and asking us to leave. We left just with basic items. And then, shortly after, my sister’s house was bombed,' he said after his arrival. 'It will be tough here. But it will be tougher for people there,' he said. In Cyprus, Rosaline Ghoukassian said the overwhelming majority of Lebanese don’t want this war. She relocated to Cyprus with her husband Raffi Garabedian and their daughter Maria after the 2020 ammonium nitrate explosion in Beirut's port that killed more than 200 people. She said she'd been disenchanted with Lebanon's political leadership and also lamented Hezbollah's influence. 'We knew this was coming,' she said. 'The problem is in Lebanon. ... Because we don’t have a good government.' Their decision to leave Lebanon was never about money but safety, as their daughter explained in a letter she wrote in class in Cyprus: 'I don’t want to go there because I was saved in the explosion, and I don’t want to go live there because I don’t want to die.' The family chose to stay. 'I’m not here to make thousands of euros. No. I’m here just to live. To be happy, to be safe. This is what I want. To live,' Garabedian said. Hezbollah began firing into Israel the day after Hamas’ attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, in which the militants killed some 1,200 people and took about 250 others hostage. Since then, Israel’s military response in Gaza has killed more than 41,000 Palestinians, according to local health officials. Back in California, Siddiqui said coping with it all has been challenging. 'You grab the phone; you hesitate to open it because you’re afraid of what you’re going to see, but you kind of have to.' She talks to friends and others in her circle who can relate. 'We all feel kind of sad, depressed, helpless, rundown,' she said. 'We can do things like fundraise and donate and protest or anything like that, but at the end of the day, it still weighs on you.' ___ AP journalists Mogomotsi Magome in Johannesburg; Mauricio Savarese in Sao Paulo and Menelaos Hadjicostis in Nicosia, Cyprus, contributed reporting. ___ Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

Survivors grapple with aid cuts and the Taliban a year after massive Afghan earthquake	KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) — People had just seconds to flee their homes when the terrifying sound of earth cracking open reverberated across western Afghanistan's Herat province. Nobody knows for sure how many people died in a 6.3 magnitude earthquake on Oct. 7, 2023, or in the strong aftershocks that followed. The Taliban government estimated that at least 4,000 perished. The U.N. gave a far lower figure of about 1,500. Survivors stopped counting, exhausted after digging through dirt to save their loved ones or bury them. It was the deadliest natural disaster to strike Afghanistan in recent memory. It was also another major challenge for the Taliban since they seized power in 2021, a test of their readiness to lead a country beset by economic hardship, isolation, devastation from decades of war, and vulnerability to shocks like earthquakes and climate change. 'At that time, the government really cooperated in transporting patients and the dead,' said Ismatullah Rahmani, from the quake’s epicenter in Zinda Jan district, where every home, usually built of mud and timber, was levelled. His brother and nephew were killed, and he spent hours trying to free his wife from under 1 1/2-meter (60 inches) of soil. She survived. 'They opened hospitals and provided water and food to people for free,' he told The Associated Press from his new home in Zinda Jan. He said the Taliban went to camps and helped survivors over several months, a blessing ahead of the harsh Herat winter. 'After that, our aid stopped,' said Rahmani. Quake survivors rely on charities Charities had stepped in to build housing for survivors. But the accommodation they built lacks walls so there is no privacy, while the poor design leaves them vulnerable to storms or heavy rainfall. Houses either have no bathrooms or the bathrooms don’t have a roof. Rahmani's village, Naib Rafi, still doesn’t have a health clinic or a school. Instead, children are learning in tents. The government didn’t provide financial assistance, he said. Senior officials and Islamic scholars visited communities a few times, listened to people’s problems and left. Ahmadullah Muttaqi, spokesman and member of the Herat Earthquake Commission, said authorities worked with charities and nongovernmental groups to provide shelter and medical assistance. 'People’s problems haven’t been solved, of course, but the first necessity is building houses until they stand on their own feet. They have been given food and hospitals are still working,' he told AP. He said they were still working to rebuild mosques, schools, madrassas and parks. He did not answer questions about authorities' preparedness for future disasters. Foreign aid money is drying up Afghans were already struggling with displacement, food insecurity and poverty before the quake struck, and the tragedy put further pressure on public services. Aid agencies, which have been propping up Afghan health care and education for the past three years under the Taliban, became even more thinly stretched. The International Rescue Committee set up feeding corners after the earthquake so mothers could safely breastfeed children and get nutrition counselling. The relief agency said it also fixed water systems, provided emergency cash, hygiene kits, medical and mental health support to tens of thousands of people. But, with other global crises raging, such support is finite. International funding for Afghanistan has received less than a third of its target. Changing political priorities, economic troubles and wars are hitting donors’ pockets, especially those in the West. Widespread opposition to the Taliban’s treatment of Afghan women and girls is also having an effect. 'There is donor fatigue, for sure, but perhaps the bigger problem is a nervousness from many donors about supporting anything but the most urgent life-saving aid,' said Mark Calder from World Vision International. The U.N. says international recognition of the Taliban as the legitimate government of Afghanistan is nearly impossible while restrictions remain on female education and employment. The Taliban reject this position, demanding Afghanistan’s seat at the U.N. and saying that sanctions and the country's continued isolation are hurting people. Investment in quality development assistance would benefit Afghan women and girls disproportionately and it’s sometimes in their name that a reduction in aid to Afghanistan is promoted, said Calder. 'It’s difficult to imagine that Afghan communities are much better prepared for natural disasters than they were a year ago,' he added. Fears of another disaster Herat authorities have been unable to fully meet humanitarian needs, while damaged infrastructure has hampered recovery efforts. A near-total reliance on aid organisations for basics like health care and shelter has left people exposed. Four of Gul Ahmad Osmani’s children died in the disaster. He heard boys screaming under the soil in his village. It was impossible to pull them out, he said. He and his surviving family members spent the winter in a tent. 'The government took care of us, keeping my wife and children in a camp, but we didn’t see anything from the government that was specifically from them, like flour, cooking oil or rice,' Osmani said. 'Our own people, the people of Afghanistan, brought food for several days.' The helping hands came from other cities, districts and provinces to clear away rubble, bury the dead, and distribute everyday items like clothing. But it’s been almost six months since NGOs or well-wishers came to help the residents of Zinda Jan. A kind doctor from northern Baghlan province donated money recently. 'There are still earthquakes and these new houses are heavy,' said Osmani. 'Children are afraid. The help for the earthquake did not help us.' —- Haqjoo reported from Zinda Jan, Afghanistan.	https://apnews.com/article/afghanistan-herat-earthquake-taliban-c26e12ed6862a7f7f6ef29771c74ed9b	2024-10-05T19:45:22-07:00	
Apparent Israeli airstrike on mosque in central Gaza kills at least 18 people	DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — An apparent Israeli airstrike early Sunday killed at least 18 people in central Gaza, Palestinian medical officials said. The strike hit a mosque sheltering displaced people near the al-Aqsa Martyrs hospital in the town of Deir al-Balah, the hospital said in a statement. An Associated Press journalist counted the bodies at the hospital morgue. Hospital records showed that the dead were all men. Another two men were critically wounded, the hospital said. The Israeli military did not immediately comment about the strike on the mosque. The latest strikes add to the mounting Palestinian death toll in Gaza, which is nearing 42,000, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry. The ministry does not differentiate between civilian and militant deaths, but many of the dead were women and children. The attack early Sunday came after Israel bombarded Lebanon on Saturday as it targeted both Hezbollah and Hamas fighters. Thousands of people in Lebanon, including Palestinian refugees, continued to flee the widening conflict in the region, while rallies were held around the world marking the approaching anniversary of the start of the war in Gaza. The strong explosions Saturday began near midnight and continued into Sunday after Israel’s military urged residents to evacuate areas in Dahiyeh, the predominantly Shiite collection of suburbs on Beirut’s southern edge. AP video showed the blasts illuminating the densely populated suburbs, where Hezbollah has a strong presence. They followed a day of sporadic strikes and the nearly continuous buzz of reconnaissance drones. Israel’s military confirmed it was striking targets near Beirut and said about 30 projectiles had crossed from Lebanon into Israeli territory, with some intercepted. The strikes reportedly targeted a building near a road leading to Lebanon’s only international airport, and another building formerly used by the Hezbollah-run broadcaster Al-Manar. Social media reports claimed that one of the strikes hit an oxygen tank storage facility, but this was later denied by the owner of the company. Shortly thereafter, Hezbollah claimed in a statement that it successfully targeted a group of Israeli soldiers near the Manara settlement in northern Israel 'with a large rocket salvo, hitting them accurately.' On Saturday, Israel’s attack on the northern Beddawi camp killed an official with Hamas’ military wing along with his wife and two young daughters, the Palestinian militant group said. Hamas later said another military wing member was killed in Israeli strikes in Lebanon’s eastern Bekaa Valley. The aftermath showed smashed buildings, scattered bricks and stairways to nowhere. Israel has killed several Hamas officials in Lebanon since the Israel-Hamas war began , in addition to most of the top leadership of the Lebanon-based Hezbollah as fighting has sharply escalated. At least 1,400 Lebanese, including civilians, medics and Hezbollah fighters, have been killed and 1.2 million driven from their homes in less than two weeks. Israel says it aims to drive the militant group away from shared borders so displaced Israelis can return to their homes. Iranian-backed Hezbollah, the strongest armed force in Lebanon, began firing rockets into Israel almost immediately after Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack, calling it a show of support for the Palestinians. Hezbollah and Israel’s military have traded fire almost daily. Last week, Israel launched what it called a limited ground operation into southern Lebanon after a series of attacks killed longtime Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and others. The fighting is the worst since Israel and Hezbollah fought a brief war in 2006. Nine Israeli soldiers have been killed in the ground clashes that Israel says have killed 440 Hezbollah fighters. Iran’s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, told reporters in Damascus that 'we are trying to reach a cease-fire in Gaza and in Lebanon.' The minister said the unnamed countries putting forward initiatives include regional states and some outside the Middle East. Araghchi spoke a day after the supreme leader of Iran praised its recent missile strikes on Israel and said it was ready to do it again if necessary. On Saturday evening, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said 'Israel has the duty and the right to defend itself and respond to these attacks, and it will do so.' On Lebanon, he said 'we are not done yet.' ___ Magdy reported from Cairo, Egypt.	https://apnews.com/article/mideast-wars-lebanon-hezbollah-hamas-6-october-2024-0210e9d539a899e21ee89b52807b6af7	2024-10-05T19:39:16-07:00	
A year into the Israel-Hamas war, students say a chill on free speech has reached college classrooms	WASHINGTON (AP) — As a junior at George Washington University, Ty Lindia meets new students every day. But with the shadow of the Israel-Hamas war hanging over the Washington, D.C., campus, where everyone has a political opinion, each new encounter is fraught. 'This idea that I might say the wrong thing kind of scares me,' said Lindia, who studies political science. 'You have to tiptoe around politics until one person says something that signifies they lean a certain way on the issue.' He has seen friendships — including some of his own — end over views about the war. In public, he keeps his stance to himself for fear that future employers could hold it against him. 'Before Oct. 7, there wasn’t really a big fear,' said Lindia, of Morristown, New Jersey. A year after Hamas’ attack in southern Israel, some students say they are reluctant to speak out because it could pit them against their peers, professors or even potential employers. Social bubbles have cemented along the divisions of the war. New protest rules on many campuses raise the risk of suspension or expulsion. Tensions over the conflict burst wide open last year amid emotional demonstrations in the aftermath of the Oct. 7 attack. In the spring, a wave of pro-Palestinian tent encampments led to some 3,200 arrests. The atmosphere on U.S. campuses has calmed since those protests, yet lingering unease remains. Students reconsider what to say in classes In a recent class discussion on gender and the military at Indiana University, sophomore Mikayla Kaplan said she thought about mentioning her female friends who serve in the Israeli military. But in a room full of politically progressive classmates, she decided to stay quiet. 'In the back of my head, I’m always thinking about things that I should or shouldn’t say,' Kaplan said. Kaplan, who proudly wears a Star of David necklace, said that before college she had many friends of different faiths, but after Oct. 7, almost all of her friends are Jewish. The war began when Hamas-led fighters killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, in the Oct. 7 attack on southern Israel. They abducted another 250 people and are still holding about 100 hostages. Israel’s campaign in Gaza has killed at least 41,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. At the University of Connecticut, some students said the conflict doesn’t come up as much in classes. Ahmad Zoghol, an engineering student, said it remains a tense issue and he has heard of potential employers scrutinizing political statements students make in college. 'There’s definitely that concern for a lot of people, including myself, that if we speak about it there’s going to be some sort of repercussion,' he said. Campuses grapple with divisions Compared with the much larger campus protests of the Vietnam War era, when few students openly supported the war, campuses today appear more divided, said Mark Yudof, a former president of the University of California system. For many, the issues are more personal. 'The faculty are at odds with each other. The student body is at odds with each other. There’s a war of ideologies going on,' he said. Some universities are trying to bridge the divide with campus events on civil discourse, sometimes inviting Palestinian and Jewish speakers to share the stage. At Harvard University in Massachusetts, a recent survey found that many students and professors are reluctant to share views in the classroom. A panel suggested solutions including 'classroom confidentiality' and teaching on constructive disagreement. Meanwhile, many campuses are adding policies that clamp down on protests, often banning encampments and limiting demonstrations to certain hours or locations. At Indiana University, a new policy forbids 'expressive activity' after 11 p.m, among other restrictions. Doctoral student Bryce Greene, who helped lead a pro-Palestinian encampment last semester, said he was threatened with suspension after organizing an 11:30 p.m. vigil. That's a startling contrast to past protests on campus, including a 2019 climate demonstration that drew hundreds of students without university interference, he said. 'There’s definitely a chilling effect that occurs when speech is being restricted in this manner,' said Greene, who is part of a lawsuit challenging the new policy. 'This is just one way for them to restrict people from speaking out for Palestine.' New rules allow protests, but with conditions The tense atmosphere has led some faculty members to rethink teaching certain subjects or entering certain debates, said Risa Lieberwitz, general counsel for the American Association of University Professors. Lieberwitz, who teaches labor law at Cornell University, has been alarmed by the growing number of colleges requiring students to register demonstrations days in advance. 'It’s so contradictory to the notion of how protests and demonstrations take place,' she said. 'They’re oftentimes spontaneous. They’re not planned in the way that events are generally planned.' Protests have continued on many campuses, but on a smaller scale and often under the confines of new rules. At Wesleyan University in Connecticut, police removed a group of pro-Palestinian students from a campus building where they held a sit-in in September. Wesleyan President Michael Roth said he supports students' free speech rights, but they 'don’t have a right to take over part of a building.' Wesleyan is offering new courses on civil disagreement this year, and faculty are working to help foster discussion among students. 'It's challenging for students, as it is for adults — most adults don’t have conversations with people who disagree with them,' Roth said. 'We’re so segregated into our bubbles.' Schools try to find balance on free speech American universities pride themselves as being places of open discourse where students can engage across their differences. Since Oct. 7, they have been under tremendous pressure to uphold free speech while also protecting students from discrimination. The U.S. Education Department is investigating more than 70 colleges for reports of antisemitism or Islamophobia. Leaders of several prestigious colleges have been called before Congress by Republicans who accuse them of being soft on antisemitism. Yet finding the line where protected speech ends is as hard as ever. Leaders grapple with whether to allow chants seen by some as calls of support for Palestinians and by others as a threat against Jews. It's especially complicated at public universities, which are bound by the First Amendment, while private colleges have flexibility to impose wider speech limits. At George Washington University, Lindia said the war comes up often in his classes but sometimes after a warming-up period — in one class, discussion loosened after the professor realized most students shared similar views. Even walking to class, there is a visible reminder of the tension. Tall fencing now surrounds University Yard, the grassy space where police broke up a tent encampment in May. 'It’s a place for free expression, and now it’s just completely blocked off,' he said. Some students say moderate voices are getting lost. Nivriti Agaram, a junior at George Washington, said she believes Israel has a right to defend itself but questions America’s spending on the war. That opinion puts her at odds with more liberal students, who have called her a 'genocide enabler' and worse, she said. 'It’s very stifling,' she said. 'I think there’s a silent majority who aren’t speaking.' ___ Associated Press writer Michael Melia in Storrs, Connecticut, contributed to this report. ___ The Associated Press’ education coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

A faith is on the edge of vanishing in Georgia after being exiled from Russia centuries ago	GORELOVKA, Georgia (AP) — A 10-year-old boy proudly stands beside his father and listens to the monotone chanting of elderly women clad in embroidered headscarves and long colorful skirts. It is Ilya's first time attending a night prayer meeting in Gorelovka, a tiny village in the South Caucasus nation of Georgia, and he is determined to follow the centuries-old hymns that have been passed down through the generations. There is no priest and no iconography. It's just men and women praying together, as the Doukhobors have done since the pacifist Christian sect emerged in Russia in the 18th century. Thousands of their ancestors were expelled to the fringes of the Russian Empire almost two centuries ago for rejecting the Orthodox church and refusing to serve in Czar Nicholas I's army — much like the thousands of men who fled Russia two years ago to avoid being drafted to join Moscow's invasion of Ukraine. Today, only about 100 Doukhobors remain in the tight-knit Russian-speaking farming community in two remote mountainous villages. 'Our people are dying,' 47-year-old Svetlana Svetlishcheva, Ilya's mother, tells The Associated Press, as she walks with her family to an ancient cemetery. Prayer never stops Some 5,000 Doukhobors who were banished in the middle of the 19th century established 10 villages close to the border with the hostile Ottoman Empire, where they continued to preach nonviolence and worshipped without priests or church rituals. The community prospered, growing to around 20,000 members. When some refused to pledge allegiance to the new czar, Nicholas II, and protested by burning weapons, the authorities unleashed a violent crackdown and sent about 4,000 of them to live elsewhere in the vast Russian Empire. Nonviolence is the foundation of Doukhobor culture, says Yulia Mokshina, a professor at the Mordovia State University in Russia, who studies the group. 'The Doukhobors proved that without using force, you can stand up for the truth,' Mokshina says. 'They fought without arms but with their truth and internal power.' Their plight caught the attention of Russian novelist Leo Tolstoy, also a pacifist, who donated the profits from his final novel 'Resurrection' to help around 7,500 Doukhobors emigrate to Canada to escape persecution. And all the while, the prayers never stopped, not even when the Soviet authorities relentlessly cracked down on religious activities. 'There hasn’t been a single Sunday without prayer,' Yuri Strukov, 46, says with pride, in the village of Orlovka, where he has lived for 30 years. A shrinking community Like others in the rural community, Strukov owns cattle and produces cottage cheese, sour cream and a brined cheese called suluguni, which he sells in a nearby town. His way of life is challenging — he braves freezing temperatures during winter and droughts in the summer, and the remote village is a three-hour drive from the nearest big city — which does not appeal to many Doukhobors any longer. 'The community has changed because it became small,' Strukov says. 'The fact that there are few of us leaves a heavy residue in the soul.' In Soviet times, the Doukhobors maintained among the best collective farms in the region. But the nationalist sentiment that bubbled up in Georgia as the collapse of the Soviet Union loomed prompted many to return to Russia in the late 1980s. 'We didn’t relocate, we came back,' says 39-year-old Dmitry Zubkov, who was among the first convoy of 1,000 Doukhobors who left Gorelovka for what is now western Russia in 1989. Zubkov and his family settled in the village of Arkhangelskoye in Russia's Tula region. Strukov also thinks about moving. After several waves of Doukhobors departed, ethnic Georgians and Armenians — Orlovka is close to the Armenian border — moved in, and he says relations between them and the ever-shrinking community of Doukhobors are tense. His four family members are the last Doukhobors living in Orlovka. But the prayer house and his ancestors' graves keep him from leaving. 'The whole land is soaked with the prayers, sweat and blood of our ancestors,' he says. 'We always try to find the solution in different situations so we can stay here and preserve our culture, our traditions and our rites.' Keeping the traditions alive Doukhobor rites have traditionally passed from one generation to the next by word of mouth, and Strukov's 21-year-old daughter Daria Strukova feels the urgency to learn as much as she can from senior community members. 'I’m always worried that such a deep and interesting culture will just get lost if we don’t take it over in time,' Strukova says. She says she considered converting to the Georgian Orthodox Church as a student in the Georgian capital, Tbilisi, where that faith wields great influence. But her doubts were dispelled as she listened to a Doukhobor choir during a prayer meeting. 'I realized that this is what I missed, this is what I couldn’t find anywhere,' she says. 'I know now that the Doukhobor faith will always be with me till the end of my life.' Zubkov says Strukova's wavering faith is not unusual among Doukhobors in Russia. Once they assimilate into Russian society, experience big cities, speak the same language and share traditions with the locals, of course they will be tempted by the predominant religion. 'People didn’t want to stand out,' he says. 'Unfortunately, we have been assimilating very fast.' Around 750 Doukhobors settled in Arkhangelskoye more than 30 years ago. Now, only a few elderly women attend Sunday prayers, and only a couple of Doukhobors sing traditional anthems at funerals. Zubkov predicts that within a decade the culture will disappear from Arkhangelskoye altogether. Enduring faith The Doukhobors whose families started anew in Canada more than a century ago don't feel a strong connection to the villages that are sacred for the Strukov family. They say what is important is their faith and the pacifist principles that underscore it. 'We do not hold any specific place and historical places ... in some kind of spiritual significance,' said John J. Verigin Jr., who leads the largest Doukhobor organization in Canada. 'What we try to sustain in our organization is our dedication to those fundamental principles of our life concept.' But Ilya, in Gorelovka, is comforted by the knowledge that his community, culture and faith are rooted in a place established by his ancestors. 'I see myself a tall grown-up going to the prayers every day in Doukhobor clothes,' Ilya said. 'I will love coming here, I love it now too.' ___ Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

A year of blood and anguish: The Mideast war in AP photos	A year after Hamas launched a cross-border attack into southern Israel on Oct. 7, the images of that day and its ongoing aftermath still defy belief. No one thought they would see heavily armed Hamas gunmen going door-to-door on quiet Israeli streets or storming a crowded music festival, mowing people down for hours with no soldiers in sight. No one thought they would see entire neighborhoods in the Gaza Strip turned into rubble-strewn wastelands, with high-rises leveled, paved roads turned to dirt and people fleeing on foot with only what they could carry. Few thought it would last this long, or claim so many lives. Hamas' surprise attack and the war it triggered in Gaza have brought unprecedented death, destruction and anguish to both Israelis and Palestinians. Its ripples across the Middle East have raised the specter of an even larger conflict. Associated Press photographers have tried to capture its impact on ordinary people. They have photographed Israelis returning to the scenes of the killings, mobilizing for war and protesting their country's wartime leadership and its failure to return scores of hostages. They have been there as Palestinians dig for survivors after airstrikes and as the wounded are treated on the floors of overwhelmed hospitals. They have photographed people huddling in tents and crowding around aid stations, reaching with empty pots for desperately needed food, They have followed Palestinians from one end of Gaza to another as they flee airstrikes and evacuation orders, often traveling by foot or donkey cart with only what they can carry. And they have been to funerals — too many funerals — on both sides. As with all wars, civilians have paid the heaviest price. Young Israelis were killed by the hundreds at the music festival. Grandparents in their 70s and 80s were dragged into Gaza and held in tunnels, where many perished. Airstrikes killed Palestinian children in front of their parents and left thousands of orphans — some with no living relatives. Lebanon's Hezbollah militant group began firing rockets into Israel on Oct. 8, drawing retaliatory strikes in a cycle of escalation that has steadily worsened. In recent weeks, Israeli warplanes have pounded large areas of Lebanon, killing Hezbollah's leader and several of his top commanders, as well as many civilians. Ground operations commenced last week. The bombings have brought more giant plumes of smoke, more blackened craters where buildings once stood, more screaming ambulances and more people — by the hundreds of thousands — taking to the roads to flee the war's widening vortex. Through it all, there have been some moments of joy, however fleeting. There were happy homecomings — on both sides — last November after more than 100 hostages were freed in exchange for the release of Palestinians imprisoned by Israel. But a year on, everyone still seems to be trapped in the violent reality unleashed in the early hours of Oct. 7, with no end in sight.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-lebanon-photo-gallery-dc81e4fa104fa821ed74bd40fd9e56f5	2024-10-05T19:02:53-07:00	
A displaced family's year of fleeing across the devastated Gaza Strip	DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Ne’man Abu Jarad sat on a tarp on the ground. Around him, canvas sheets hung from cords, forming the walls of his tent. For the past year, Ne’man; his wife, Majida; and their six daughters have trekked the length of the Gaza Strip, trying to survive as Israeli forceswreaked destruction around them. It's a far cry from their house in northern Gaza — a place of comforting routine, of love, affection and safety. A place where loved ones gathered around the kitchen table or on the roof on summer evenings amid the scent of roses and jasmine flowers. 'Your house is your homeland. Everything good in our life was the home,' Ne'man said. 'Everything in it, whether physical or intangible -- family, neighbors, my siblings who were all around me. 'We are missing all that.' The Abu Jarad family lost that stability when Israel launched its campaign in Gaza in retaliation for Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack. They did exactly as the Israelis ordered in the devastating weeks and months of war that followed. They obeyed evacuation calls. They moved where the military told them to move. Seven times they fled, and each time, their lives became more unrecognizable to them, crowding with strangers in a school classroom, searching for water in a vast tent camp or sleeping on the street. The Associated Press traced the family's journey as they were driven from their home. Israel's campaign has displaced nearly the entire population of Gaza — 1.9 million of its 2.3 million Palestinians — and killed more than 41,600 people, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. Like the Abu Jarads, most families have been uprooted multiple times. For this family, the journey has taken them from a comfortable middle-class life to ruin. Before the war: A cozy life Living at the northernmost end of Gaza, most days before the war in Beit Hanoun were simple. Ne’man headed out each morning to work as a taxi driver. Majida got their daughters off to school. Their youngest, Lana, had started first grade. Hoda, the 18-year-old, was in her first year at university. The eldest, Balsam, just had her first baby. Majida spent much of her day doing housework — her face lights up when she talks about her kitchen, the center of family life. Ne’man had planted the garden with a grapevine and covered the roof with potted flowers. Watering them in the evenings was a soothing ritual. Then, the family and neighbors would sit on the front stoop or the roof to chat. 'The area would always smell nice,' he said. 'People would say we have perfume because of how beautiful the flowers are.' Oct. 7: The attack On the morning of Oct. 7, the family heard Hamas rockets firing and news of the militants’ attack into southern Israel, in which some 1,200 people were killed and 250 kidnapped. The Abu Jarads knew that the Israeli response would be swift and that their house, only about 2 kilometers (1.2 miles) from the border fence with Israel, would be on the front line. By 9 a.m., Ne’man and Majida, their six daughters, and Ne’man’s sister packed up what they could and fled, as the Israeli military issued one of its first evacuation orders. 'It makes no sense to be stubborn and stay,' Majida said. 'It is not about one person. I am part of a family and have girls.' Oct. 7-13: Staying with Majida's parents Like many, the family tried, at first, to stay close to home. They went to stay with Majida’s parents, in Beit Lahiya about a kilometer (.6 miles) away. 'The place was very comfortable, to be honest. I felt like I was at home,' Majida said. 'But we were living in fear and terror.' Already, Beit Lahiya was being heavily bombarded. Over the six days they were there, at least nine Israeli strikes hit the town, killing dozens, according to the conflict monitor Airwars. Entire families were killed or wounded under the rubble of their homes. As the explosions got closer, shrapnel pierced water tanks at Majida's parents' home. Windows shattered as the family huddled inside. It was time to move again. Oct. 13-15: Refuge at a hospital When they arrived at al-Quds hospital, the family saw for the first time the scale of displacement. The building and its grounds were packed with thousands of people. All around northern Gaza, families took refuge in hospitals, hoping they'd be safe. The family found a small space on the floor, barely enough room to spread their blanket amid the frantic medical staff struggling with the wounded. It was a black night and there were strikes, Majida remembers. 'The martyrs and wounded were strewn on the floor,' she said. The day after they arrived, a strike smashed into a house a few hundred meters away, killing a prominent doctor and some two dozen members of his family, many of them children. The Israeli military ordered all civilians to leave northern Gaza, setting in motion a wave of hundreds of thousands of people heading south across Wadi Gaza, the stream and wetlands that divide the north from the rest of the strip. The family joined the exodus. Oct. 15-Dec. 26: A cramped school The family walked 10 kilometers (6 miles) until they reached the U.N.-run Girls’ Preparatory School in the Nuseirat refugee camp. Every classroom and corridor was packed with families from the north. Majida, the daughters and Ne’man’s sister found a tiny space in a classroom already housing more than 100 women and children. For privacy in the cramped conditions, Ne’man moved in with the men in tents outside, in the schoolyard. This was their home for more than 10 weeks. Majida and the girls slept curled up on the floor, without enough space even to extend their legs. As winter set in, there weren’t enough blankets. The bathrooms were the worst part, Majida said. Only a few toilets served thousands of people. Getting a shower was a miracle, she said. People went weeks unable to bathe. Skin diseases ran rampant. Every day, the daughters went at dawn to wait in line at the few bakeries still working and came back in the afternoon, sometimes with only one flatbread. One day, Ne’man and his daughters walked 5 kilometers (3 miles) to the town of Deir al-Balah, looking for drinkable water. 'If it wasn’t for the kind people in Deir al-Balah who took pity on us and gave us half a gallon, we could have returned with nothing,' Ne’man said. As strikes continued, the family decided to go as far as possible, trekking 20 kilometers (12 miles) to Rafah, at Gaza’s southernmost end. Dec. 26-May 14: Life in a tent The Abu Jarads weren’t the only ones: As Israeli evacuation orders ate away at more and more of Gaza, nearly half of the population crammed into Rafah. Here, the family had their first taste of living in a tent. They set up amid the massive sprawl of tens of thousands of tents on Rafah’s outskirts, near U.N. aid warehouses known as 'the barracks.' 'In the winter, it was hell, water drenched us,' Majida said. 'We slept on the ground, nothing under us, and no covers.' They had no money to buy food in the markets, where prices soared. The youngest girls got sick with colds and diarrhea, and there was no nearby pharmacy to buy medicine. The family survived completely off U.N. handouts of flour and other basics. 'To buy one tomato or cucumber and find it in the tent was like a dream,' Ne’man said. Like so many others, they'd believed Rafah was the last safe place in Gaza. It was not. In the first week of May, Israel ordered the evacuation of all of Rafah. Then its troops pushed into the city. Bombardment intensified. Ne’man and Majida tried to stay as long as possible. But an airstrike hit nearby, he said, killing four of Ne’man’s cousins and a young girl. May 16-Aug. 16: 'Humanitarian zone' Palestinians who'd packed into Rafah — more than 1 million — all streamed out again, fleeing the Israeli offensive. They scattered across southern and central Gaza. New tent cities filled beaches, fields, empty lots, schoolyards, cemeteries, even dumpsites – any open space. The Abu Jarads moved by foot and donkey cart until they reached a former amusement park known as Asdaa City. Now its Ferris wheel stood above a landscape of tents stretching as far as the eye could see. Here, in Muwasi, a barren area of dunes and fields along the coast, Israel had declared a 'humanitarian zone' – though there was little aid, food or water. Every amenity once taken for granted was a distant memory. Now the kitchen was a pile of sticks for kindling and two rocks for setting a pot over the fire. No shower, only the occasional bucket of water. Soap was too expensive. Only a draped sheet separated them from their neighbors. Everything was filthy and sandy. Large spiders, cockroaches and other insects crept into the tent. Aug. 16-26: Fleeing to the sea Even the 'humanitarian zone' was unsafe. A raid by Israeli troops less than a kilometer (half-mile) away forced Majida and Ne’man to uproot their family once more. They headed toward the Mediterranean coast, not knowing where they'd stay. Fortunately, they said, they found some acquaintances. 'God bless them, they opened their tent for us and let us live with them for 10 days,' Ne’man said. Late August: Moving again, no end in sight When they returned to Muwasi, the Abu Jarads found their tent had been robbed – their food and clothes, all gone. Since then, the weeks blur together. The family finds survival itself loses meaning in a conflict that seems to have no end. Food has become even harder to find as supplies entering Gaza drop to their lowest levels of the war. Israeli drones buzz overhead constantly. The mental strain wears on everyone. One day, Ne’man said, his youngest daughter, Lana, told him, 'You stopped loving me. Because now when I come near you, you say you are fed up and tell me to stay away.' He kept telling her, 'No, darling, I love you. I just can’t bear it all.' They all dream of home. Ne’man said he learned that his brother’s house next door was destroyed in a strike, and his own home was damaged. He wonders about his flowers. He hopes they survived — even if the house is gone. The difference between then and now, Majida said, is 'the difference between heaven and earth.' Far from the warmth and affection of home, the Abu Jarads feel themselves surrendering to despair. 'We are jealous,' Majida said. 'Jealous of who? Of the people who were killed. Because they found relief while we are still suffering, living horrors, torture and heartbreak.' ___ AP writers Julia Frankel in Jerusalem and Lee Keath in Cairo contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-gaza-displacement-families-moving-161d9ad8d07e12b22bfd41c79d174c70	2024-10-05T19:00:59-07:00	
North Korea and China mark their 75th anniversary of ties as outsiders question their relationship	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — The leaders of North Korea and China marked the 75th anniversary of their diplomatic relations on Sunday by exchanging messages that expressed hopes for stronger ties, as outsiders raised questions about their relationship. The message exchange came as North Korea and Russia have been sharply expanding their cooperation while China apparently keeps its distance. Experts say that the level of exchanges and commemorative programs between North Korea and China in the coming months will provide a clue to the exact status of their ties. In a message sent to Chinese President Xi Jinping, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said his government will 'steadily strive to consolidate and develop the friendly and cooperative relations' between the two countries, according to North Korea’s official Korean Central News Agency. Xi, in his message to Kim, said that China is ready to jointly promote 'the stable and further advance of the socialist cause in the two countries,' KCNA said. Since North Korea and China established diplomatic ties on Oct. 6, 1949, their relationship has often been described as being 'as close as lips and teeth.' China, North Korea’s biggest trading partner and main aid provider, has been suspected of avoiding fully implementing U.N. sanctions on North Korea and sending clandestine aid shipments to help its impoverished neighbor stay afloat and continue to serve as a bulwark against U.S. influence on the Korean Peninsula. But many observers say China is reluctant to form a three-way, anti-West alliance with North Korea and Russia as it prefers a stable regional security environment to tackle numerous economic challenges and maintain relationships with Europe and its Asian neighbors. North Korea and Russia have moved significantly closer to each other amid widespread outside suspicions that North Korea has supplied conventional weapons to Russia for its war in Ukraine in return for military and economic assistance. During a meeting in Pyongyang in June, Kim and Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a pact stipulating mutual military assistance if either country is attacked, in what was considered the two countries’ biggest defense deal since the end of the Cold War. North Korea is locked in confrontations with the U.S., South Korea and their partners over its advancing nuclear program. Kim has said he was forced to expand both nuclear and conventional capabilities to cope with U.S.-led security threats. On Sunday, KCNA reported that Kim oversaw a live artillery firing drill by cadets of a military academy. After watching the drill, Kim said training programs at the military academy must focus on 'the guerrilla war tactics to wipe out the enemies through rapid mobile and surprise operations,' according to KCNA.	https://apnews.com/article/north-korea-kim-china-xi-f2b1aebf0016cc32fb40600802540a21	2024-10-05T18:57:18-07:00	
South Korean leader says North Korea wants US attention by showing off nuclear might	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korea’s recent disclosure of a nuclear facility was likely an attempt to grab U.S. attention ahead of next month's presidential election, and the North will likely stage major provocations like a nuclear test explosion and a long-range missile test, South Korea’s president says. President Yoon Suk Yeol shared his government’s assessment on the recent moves by North Korea with The Associated Press, before he leaves Sunday for a three-nation trip that includes a stop in Laos for summits with Southeast Asian and other world leaders. At Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)-related meetings, Yoon says he’ll emphasize that North Korea’s nuclear disarmament is essential to regional peace. 'At the upcoming ASEAN-related summits, I will stress the importance of denuclearization of North Korea, which is a prerequisite for realizing a free, peaceful and prosperous Indo-Pacific region,' Yoon said in written responses to questions from the AP. 'This will serve to send a clear message that the international community will never condone North Korea’s reckless actions,' he said. Concerns about North Korea have grown in recent weeks, with the country unveiling a secretive uranium-enrichment facility, vowing to build more nuclear weapons and continuing its provocative missile tests. Last week, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un threatened to destroy South Korea with his nuclear weapons, if provoked. Many foreign experts say North Korea eventually hopes to use an expanded nuclear arsenal as leverage to win outside concessions like sanctions relief, after a new U.S. president is elected. They say Kim likely thinks a win by Republican candidate Donald Trump, whom he engaged in high-stakes nuclear diplomacy in 2018-19, would increase his chances to get what he wants than Democratic candidate Kamala Harris. During campaigns, Trump boasted about his personal ties with Kim, while Harris said she won’t 'cozy up to tyrants and dictators like Kim Jong Un who are rooting for Trump.' The Sept. 13 disclosure of the nuclear site showed Kim’s defiance of U.S.-led efforts to eliminate his advancing nuclear program. It was North Korea’s first unveiling of a facility to produce weapons-grade uranium since the country showed one at its main Yongbyon nuclear complex to visiting American scholars led by nuclear physicist Siegfried Hecker in 2010. Hecker said the centrifuge hall shown in the recent North Korean photos was not the same one that he saw in 2010. 'North Korea seems to have recently disclosed its nuclear facility in order to draw attention from the United States and the international community in the run-up to the U.S. presidential election, and it is likely that North Korea will carry out additional provocations such as nuclear tests and ICBM (intercontinental ballistic missile) launches going forward,' Yoon said. Yoon didn’t elaborate whether South Korea has detected any suspicious activities in North Korea that indicate its preparations for nuclear and ICBM tests. He said South Korea is closely monitoring North Korea’s movements through the South Korea-U.S. combined intelligence and surveillance assets. North Korea has conducted six underground nuclear tests since 2006, and numerous ICBM test-launches in recent years. Additional tests are likely meant to further hone its nuclear and missile capabilities. Many observers assess North Korea has yet to possess functioning nuclear missiles that can reach the U.S. mainland, though it likely has ones that can strike all of South Korea and Japan. Since his inauguration in 2022, Yoon, a conservative, has made a stronger military alliance with the United States the center of his foreign policy to cope with North Korea's evolving nuclear threats. He’s also taken a major step toward moving beyond historical disputes with Japan to beef up a trilateral Seoul-Washington-Tokyo security partnership. Such moves have enraged North Korea, which has called Yoon 'a traitor' and ignored his calls for dialogue. There are some potential worries about the South Korea-U.S. alliance if Trump returns to the White House. He had previously asked South Korea to drastically increase its share for the cost of the U.S. military deployment on its soil. Some experts say Trump's possible push for a new round of negotiation with Kim could complicate Yoon's approach on North Korea's nuclear program. But Yoon said that he's confident that the 'ironclad' South Korea-U.S. alliance will continue to advance steadily regardless of the outcome of the U.S. election. 'There is a firm bipartisan support for the ROK-U.S. alliance in the United States,' Yoon said. 'Numerous leading U.S. Democrats and Republicans have publicly stated their staunch support for the alliance and are continuously visiting Korea for consultations to enhance the bilateral relations.' The ROK stands for the Republic of Korea, South Korea's formal name. Yoon also expressed confidence that South Korea and Japan will continue to advance their bilateral ties under Japan's new Cabinet led by Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, who took office last week. Yoon's office said the two countries are discussing arranging a meeting between Yoon and Ishiba on the sidelines of the ASEAN summit. Yoon said he believes North Korea's nuclear threats against South Korea are aimed at fomenting internal divisions in South Korea and tightening its domestic control with heightened military tensions on the Korean Peninsula. 'The North Korean regime’s past claim that its nuclear development was never intended to target the Republic of Korea, since we are one nation, has been debunked,' Yoon said. Asked about North Korea's repeated launches of trash-carrying balloons toward South Korea, Yoon said that North Korea 'will face consequences that it will find difficult to withstand' if the safety of South Korean people is jeopardized. He didn't elaborate what specific steps his government is considering. Before visiting Laos, Yoon is to travel to the Philippines and Singapore. At the ASEAN-related summits, Yoon said that a key issue that South Korea plans to raise other than the North Korean nuclear program is the establishment of the ROK-ASEAN comprehensive strategic partnership. He said South Korea will further expand cooperation with ASEAN on a range of areas such as politics, military exchanges, cybersecurity, environments and a safety net against financial crises.	https://apnews.com/article/south-korea-yoon-north-nuclear-asean-3e6a6839383efed921afc12351e3ba8c	2024-10-05T14:10:12-07:00

Health workers in Lebanon describe deadly Israeli attacks on colleagues and fear more	BEIRUT (AP) — Israel's military struck outside the gates of a hospital in southern Lebanon without warning on Friday, killing seven paramedics and forcing the facility to close, the hospital director told The Associated Press a day after one of the most deadly attacks on health workers in the weeks since fighting escalated between Israel and Hezbollah. The account of the Friday airstrikes that flung hospital doors off their hinges and shattered glass was the latest to detail attacks that Lebanon's health ministry says have killed dozens of health workers. Marjayoun hospital director Mounes Kalakesh said that even before Friday's attack, ambulance crews in the area were so reluctant to operate that the facility had not received anyone wounded for days. 'We have not been able to work. There was fear and panic among the staff,' he said. Kalakesh said the government hospital didn't receive any warning from Israeli forces before the attack, even though nearby villages have received such warnings to evacuate. Israel has not commented specifically on the incident. Friday's attack came hours before Israel’s Arabic-language military spokesman accused the Hezbollah militant group, based in southern Lebanon, of using ambulances to transport weapons and fighters, and warned medical teams to stay clear of the group. The spokesman provided no evidence. It is a charge that Lebanese officials and hospital directors, including Kalakesh, deny. Lebanon’s health minister has accused Israel of committing 'a war crime' by targeting medical teams and paramedics. The health ministry on Thursday said 40 paramedics, firefighters and health care workers had been killed in Israeli attacks over three days, making it even more challenging to care for people wounded in the intense fighting. The ministry has said more than 100 health workers have been killed in the year since the war in Gaza began and since Israel and Hezbollah stepped up exchanges of fire along the border. The paramedics with the Islamic Health Committee are part of the coordinated health ministry response to crises in Lebanon. Other civil defense teams have expressed concern for their safety, with some saying they came under attack while clearly identified and operating in areas where they were transporting the wounded or putting out fires. Israeli strikes have landed near the Marjayoun hospital before but never had come so close, Kalakesh said. He described the paramedics dying in their burning vehicles. The 45-bed hospital is now shut down. 'I am responsible for this staff. I must protect them,' Kalakesh said, explaining the decision to evacuate. At the time of the Friday attack, there were 30 staff in the hospital. His team was already exhausted after a year of working close to the front line. Other groups have expressed concern. A Lebanese Red Cross convoy, escorted by Lebanese troops and coordinated with the U.N. peacekeeping force in Lebanon, came under fire on Thursday. A Lebanese soldier was killed and four Red Cross volunteers were wounded. Separately on Thursday, Israeli forces struck rescue teams with the Islamic Health Committee in Beirut's southern suburbs and the southern village of Odeissah, killing at least four. In Odeissah, responding ambulances were hit by Israeli fire and three medics who were wounded in the initial attack were killed as rescuers tried to reach them, the health ministry said. In the Beirut suburbs, the team working to remove rubble from the initial airstrike was hit in a drone attack that killed a driver and wounded seven, said Islamic Health Committee spokesman Mahmoud Karaki. Targeting the health sector undermines the safety net for the public, Karaki said, He said 145 of his team members have been wounded over the past year. Lebanon’s health ministry has said nine hospitals and 45 health care centers have been damaged during that time. Hours after the Friday attack outside Marjayoun hospital, another hospital in the southern town of Bint Jbeil was shelled by Israeli forces after receiving a warning to evacuate. Nine members of the medical and nursing staff at Salah Ghandour Hospital were wounded, most of them seriously. The hospital later shut down because of the damage.	https://apnews.com/article/lebanon-israel-medics-hezbollah-hospitals-6c7f75c921c9deec0fa5c160ce639664	2024-10-05T11:39:25-07:00	
Born on Oct. 7, Ali's first year has played out against the backdrop of the Israel-Hamas war	NUSEIRAT, Gaza Strip (AP) — Ali Al-Taweel was born as Israeli warplanes started to pound the Gaza Strip after Hamas’ surprise cross-border attack on southern Israel. Now, the Palestinian child will celebrate his first birthday as the Israeli-Hamas war reaches its one-year mark. For his family, it's been a year filled with uncertainty and anxiety as they moved from place to place amid widespread destruction and limited resources. 'I had arranged another, very sweet life for him,' Ali’s mother, Amal Al-Taweel, told The Associated Press in an interview. 'The war has changed everything.' When the war began on Oct. 7 of last year, Al-Taweel was being rushed to a hospital in central Gaza to give birth to a child she and her husband, Mustafa Al-Taweel, had sought for three years. After Ali’s birth, his family returned to their home in the Zahrah neighborhood, just north of Wadi Gaza, but were forced to flee on Oct. 18, just a day before Israeli warplanes bombed the area, Al-Taweel said. Since then, they have been living in relatives’ homes and shelters across central and southern Gaza, including the city of Rafah before the Israeli military invaded it in May. They now shelter in the house of Al-Taweel’s parents in the Nuseirat refugee camp, along with 15 other relatives. 'It was a very difficult year, bad in every way — from a health perspective, from a psychological perspective,' the 30-year-old said, adding that her child has been raised against the backdrop of daily bombing and killing. The Hamas-led attack on Oct. 7, 2023, killed some 1,200 people — mostly civilians — and took about 250 hostage, including children and a newborn. Israel responded with one of the deadliest and most destructive military campaigns in recent history. The war has killed about 42,000 Palestinians, many of them women and children, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which doesn’t differentiate between civilians and combatants. More than 80% of Gaza’s population of 2.3 million have been forced to flee their homes and cram into a tent camp on Gaza’s shore. A quarter of the strip’s population faces starvation amid an Israel-imposed blockade, allowing only limited delivery of aid, according to the United Nations. Al-Taweel said every stage of Ali's life has been difficult 'from the time he started crawling, to when his teeth came out, to when he started his first steps, to when he started walking.' And she worried constantly about his safety, recalling that he was slightly injured when a strike hit close to her sister’s house in the camp, shattering the windows. Al-Taweel counted multiple challenges she and her husband, who lost his job as a day laborer in a seaside restaurant in Gaza City, have faced since the war began. Ali didn’t receive any vaccinations in his first six months, making him vulnerable to disease, his mother said. And, with the blockade in place, she has struggled to obtain formula and diapers. 'They do not exist, and if they exist, they are very expensive and we can’t afford them,' she said. Israel has severely restricted aid deliveries of food, water, medicine and other supplies into Gaza during the war. U.N. agencies and aid groups working in the enclave have long complained about lack of access and crippling restrictions on aid delivery. 'There is no single word that can describe the past year,' said Sondos Alashqar, who works with the Medical Aid for Palestine group. Alashqar said that the hardships Palestinians saw during this past year exceeded what their grandparents experienced during the 1948 Nakba — or catastrophe — when some 700,000 Palestinians fled or were forced from what is now Israel. 'We witnessed numerous death-and-life situations,' she said. 'It was one of the hardest years we’ve even lived — harder than what our grandparents experienced.' Al-Taweel said that constant bombing, displacement and destruction have made it difficult for her to raise her child as she had planned in his first year. 'It (the year) was full of tension, fear, anxiety, displacement, bombing and destruction,' she said. 'He was not like any other child who lives in a safe, peaceful, and healthy (environment).' ___ Magdy reported from Cairo.	https://apnews.com/article/gaza-israel-war-anniversary-birthday-child-515add1ecaeefeab07429ce4eded92b1	2024-10-05T07:46:50-07:00	
Congo finally begins mpox vaccinations in a drive to slow outbreaks	GOMA, Congo (AP) — Congolese authorities on Saturday began vaccination against mpox, nearly two months after the disease outbreak that spread from Congo to several African countries and beyond was declared a global emergency by the World Health Organization. The 265,000 doses donated to Congo by the European Union and the U.S. were rolled out in the eastern city of Goma in North Kivu province, where hospitals and health workers have been overstretched, struggling to contain the new and possibly more infectious strain of mpox. Congo, with about 30,000 suspected mpox cases and 859 deaths, accounts for more than 80% of all the cases and 99% of all the deaths reported in Africa this year. All of the Central African nation’s 26 provinces have recorded mpox cases. Although most mpox infections and deaths recorded in Congo are in children under age 15, the doses being administered are only meant for adults and will be given to at-risk populations and front-line workers, Health Minister Roger Kamba said this week. 'Strategies have been put in place by the services in order to vaccinate all targeted personnel,' Muboyayi ChikayaI, the minister's chief of staff, said as he kicked off the vaccination. At least 3 million doses of the vaccine approved for use in children are expected from Japan in the coming days, Kamba said. Mpox, also known as monkeypox, had been spreading mostly undetected for years in Africa before the disease prompted the 2022 global outbreak that saw wealthy countries quickly respond with vaccines from their stockpiles while Africa received only a few doses despite pleas from its governments. However, unlike the global outbreak in 2022 that was overwhelmingly focused in gay and bisexual men, mpox in Africa is now being spread via sexual transmission as well as through close contact among children, pregnant women and other vulnerable groups, Dr. Dimie Ogoina, the chair of WHO’s mpox emergency committee, recently told reporters. More than 34,000 suspected cases and 866 deaths from the virus have been recorded across 16 countries in Africa this year. That is a 200% increase compared to the same period last year, the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. But access to vaccines remains a challenge. The continent of 1.4 billion people has only secured commitment for 5.9 million doses of mpox vaccines, expected to be available from October through December, Dr. Jean Kaseya, head of the Africa CDC, told reporters last week. Congo remains a priority, he said. At the vaccination drive in Goma, Dr Jean Bruno Kibunda, the WHO representative, warned that North Kivu province is at a risk of a major outbreak due to the 'promiscuity observed in the camps' for displaced people, as one of the world's biggest humanitarian crisis caused by armed violence unfolds there. The news of the vaccination program brought relief among many in Congo, especially in hospitals that had been struggling to manage the outbreak. 'If everyone could be vaccinated, it would be even better to stop the spread of the disease,' said Dr. Musole Mulambamunva Robert, the medical director of Kavumu Hospital, one of the mpox treatment centers in eastern Congo. Eastern Congo has been beset by conflict for years, with more than 100 armed groups vying for a foothold in the mineral-rich area near the border with Rwanda. Some have been accused of carrying out mass killings. ___ Associated Press writers Jean-Yves Kamale in Kinshasa, Congo and Chinedu Asadu in Abuja, Nigeria contributed to this report. —— The Associated Press receives financial support for global health and development coverage in Africa from the Gates Foundation.

Ukraine downs a Russian warplane and Russia claims gains in the east	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukrainian forces said they shot down a Russian fighter plane on Saturday while Russia claimed it made gains in Ukraine’s east. The Russian bomber was shot down near the city of Kostiantynivka in the Donetsk province, head of the Kostiantynivka Military Administration Serhiy Horbunov was quoted as saying by Ukraine’s public broadcaster, Suspilne. Photos showed charred remains of an aircraft after it landed on a house that caught fire. Also in the partially occupied Donetsk province, Russia’s Defense Ministry claimed Saturday that it had taken control of the village of Zhelanne Druhe. If confirmed, the capture would come three days after Ukrainian forces said they were withdrawing from the front-line town of Vuhledar, some 33 kilometers (21 miles) from Zhelanne Druhe, following a hard-fought two-year defense. Although unlikely to change the course of the war, the loss of Vuhledar is indicative of Kyiv’s worsening position, in part the result of Washington's refusal to grant Ukraine permission to strike targets deep inside Russian territory and preventing Kyiv from degrading Moscow’s capabilities. Zelenskyy will present his victory plan to allies Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Saturday that he will present his 'victory plan' at the Oct. 12 meeting of the Ramstein group of nations that supplies arms to Ukraine. 'We will present the victory plan — clear, concrete steps towards a just end to the war. The determination of our partners and the strengthening of Ukraine are what can stop Russian aggression,' he wrote on X, adding that the 25th Ramstein meeting would be the first to take place at the leaders’ level. Zelenskyy presented his plan to U.S. President Joe Biden in Washington last week. Its contents have not been made public but it is known that the plan includes Ukraine’s membership of NATO and the provision of long-range missiles to strike inside Russia. Russia shells southern Ukraine and a Ukraine drone hits a bus Meanwhile, two people died in Russian shelling in Ukraine’s southern Zaporizhzhia region, regional Gov. Ivan Fedorov said. Ukraine’s air force said that Russia had launched three guided missiles and 13 attack drones at Ukraine overnight into Saturday. It said the missiles were intercepted, three drones were shot down over the Odesa region and 10 others were lost. Nine people were wounded when a Ukrainian drone struck a passenger bus in the city of Horlivka in the partially occupied Donetsk region, the city’s Russian-installed Mayor Ivan Prikhodko said. Russia’s Defense Ministry said Saturday that air defenses shot down 10 Ukrainian drones overnight in three border regions, including seven over the Belgorod region, two over the Kursk region, and one over the Voronezh region. ___ Morton reported from London. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-donetsk-4f53538ff4b20c74a36823d365f4d269	2024-10-05T03:52:07-07:00	
European cities brace for pro-Palestinian rallies amid high alert as Oct. 7 anniversary approaches	ROME (AP) — Hundreds of thousands of pro-Palestinian demonstrators were expected to take to the streets across Europe on Saturday calling for a cease-fire as the first anniversary of the Hamas attacks on Israel approached. Security forces in several countries warned of heightened levels of alert in major cities, amid concerns that the escalating conflict in the Middle East could inspire new terror attacks in Europe or that some of the protests could turn violent. Massive rallies are planned in several European cities, including London, Berlin, Paris and Rome through next week, with the largest gatherings expected from Saturday to Monday. Events will peak on Monday, the date of the anniversary. By midday Saturday, thousands had gathered in central London’s Russell Square amid a significant police presence. Some of the march’s organizers had said they planned to target companies and institutions they claimed were 'complicit in Israel’s crimes,' including Barclays Bank and the British Museum. Protests are also taking place in other parts of the world. In the Philippines on Saturday, dozens of left-wing activists protested near the U.S. Embassy in Manila, where police prevented them from getting closer to the seaside compound. On Oct. 7 last year, Hamas launched a surprise attack into Israel, killing 1,200 Israelis, taking 250 people hostage and setting off a war with Israel that has shattered much of the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip. More than 41,000 Palestinians have been killed since then in Gaza, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not differentiate between fighters and civilians. It says more than half were women and children. Nearly 100 Israeli hostages remain in Gaza, with fewer than 70 believed to be alive. Israelis have experienced attacks — missiles from Iran and Hezbollah, explosive drones from Yemen, fatal shootings and stabbings — as the region braces for further escalation. In late September, Israel shifted some of its focus to Hezbollah, which holds much of the power in parts of southern Lebanon and some other areas of the country, attacking the militants with exploding pagers, airstrikes and, eventually, incursions into Lebanon. Rally Banned in Rome Pro-Palestinian protests calling for an immediate cease-fire have repeatedly taken place across Europe and around the globe in the past year and have often turned violent, with confrontations between demonstrators and law enforcement officers. In Rome, a rally was planned for Saturday afternoon — with about 30,000 demonstrators expected — in spite of a ban by local police chiefs who refused to authorize protests in the Italian capital, citing public security concerns. Italian authorities believed that the timing of the planned rally risked the Oct. 7 attack being 'glorified,' local media reported. Interior Minister Matteo Piantedosi also stressed that, ahead of the key anniversary, Europe is on high alert for potential terror attacks. 'This is not a normal situation … We are already in a condition of maximum prevention,' he said. A large crowd was also expected to gather in central London on Saturday afternoon. Ben Jamal, director of the Palestine Solidarity Campaign in Britain, said he and others will keep organizing marches until action against Israel is taken. 'We need to be out on the streets in even bigger numbers to stop this carnage and stop Britain being drawn into it,' Jamal said. In Berlin, a march is scheduled from the Brandenburg Gate to Bebelplatz on Sunday. Local media reported that security forces have warned of potential overload due to the scale of protests. German authorities pointed to increasing antisemitic and violent incidents in recent days. France was also on alert for new protests on Saturday. Earlier this week, Interior minister Bruno Retailleau warned the country’s regional prefects, expressing concern about possible tensions and saying that the terrorist threat was high. —— Hui reported from London	https://apnews.com/article/mideast-israel-gaza-war-protests-rallies-propalestine-terror-alerts-b314ac9fc24ab91e3c0639405a15d5d0	2024-10-05T03:09:26-07:00	
Israel strikes Lebanon, hitting Beirut suburbs and the north	TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Israel expanded its bombardment in Lebanon on Saturday, hitting Beirut’s southern suburbs with 12 airstrikes and striking a Palestinian refugee camp deep in northern Lebanon for the first time. The attack on the Beddawi refugee camp near the northern city of Tripoli killed an official with Hamas’s military wing, along with his wife and two young daughters, the Palesitnian militant group said in a statement. Tripoli is much farther north than the majority of Israel’s strikes, which have been concentrated in southern Lebanon and Beirut. Israel has killed several Hamas officials in Lebanon since the Israel-Hamas war began in October last year, in addition to most of the top leadership of Hezbollah. Hundreds of thousands flee Lebanon as battle continues At least six people were killed in more than a dozen Israeli airstrikes overnight and into Saturday, according to National News Agency, Lebanon’s official news agency. The Israeli military said special forces were carrying out targeted ground raids against Hezbollah infrastructure in southern Lebanon, destroying missiles, launchpads, watchtowers and weapons storage facilities. The military said troops also dismantled tunnel shafts that Hezbollah used to approach the Israeli border. Some 1,400 Lebanese, including Hezbollah fighters and civilians, have been killed and some 1.2 million driven from their homes since Israel escalated its strikes in late September aiming to cripple Hezbollah and push it away from the countries’ shared border. On Tuesday, Israel launched what it called a limited ground operation into southern Lebanon. Nine Israeli troops have been killed in close fighting in the area in the past few days, the military said. Nearly 375,000 people have crossed from Lebanon into Syria fleeing Israeli strikes in less than two weeks, according to a Lebanese government committee. Associated Press journalists saw thousands of people continuing to cross the Masnaa Border Crossing on foot even after Israeli airstrikes left huge craters in the road leading up to it on Thursday. More strikes and evacuation orders in Gaza Also on Saturday, Palestinian medical officials said Israeli strikes in northern and central Gaza killed at least nine people, including two children. One strike hit a group of people in the northern town of Beit Hanoun, killing at least five people, including two children, according to the Health Ministry’s Ambulance and Emergency service. Another strike hit a house in the northern part of the Nuseirat refugee camp, killing at least four people, the Awda hospital said. The strike also left a number of people wounded, it said. The Israeli military did not have any immediate comment on the strikes, but it has long accused Hamas of operating from within civilian areas. The Israeli military warned Palestinians to evacuate along the strategic Netzarim corridor in central Gaza, which was at the heart of obstacles to a ceasefire deal earlier this summer. The military told people in parts of the Nuseirat and Bureij refugee camps to evacuate to Muwasi, an area along Gaza's shore the military has designated a humanitarian zone. It’s unclear how many Palestinians are currently living in the areas ordered evacuated, parts of which were evacuated previously. Almost 42,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza during the nearly year-long war, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry, which does not differentiate between civilian and militant deaths.	https://apnews.com/article/mideast-wars-lebanon-hezbollah-hamas-5-october-2024-a8b70daeccc57a86fc6d939c604f2caf	2024-10-05T02:44:37-07:00	
Russian prosecutors seek 7-year sentence for US man accused of fighting for Ukraine	MOSCOW (AP) — Russian prosecutors asked for a seven-year sentence in the trial of a U.S. citizen accused of fighting as a mercenary in Ukraine against Russia, Russian news agencies reported Saturday. Prosecutors asked the court to take into account 72-year-old Stephen Hubbard’s age and said he has admitted guilt, according to Interfax. They asked that Hubbard serve the sentence in a maximum-security penal colony. In Russia, participating in mercenary activities is a criminal offense punishable by imprisonment for a term of 7-15 years. Prosecutors accuse Hubbard of signing a contract with the Ukrainian military after Russia sent troops into Ukraine in February 2022, for which he allegedly was to receive at least $1,000. He reportedly underwent training, received a personal firearm and fought in the Ukrainian military as a mercenary until April 2022, when he was detained by the Russian military. The U.S. Embassy in Moscow told The Associated Press it was 'aware of the reports of the arrest of an American citizen,' but said it could not comment any further 'due to privacy restrictions'. Russian courts convict more than 99% of defendants, and prosecutors can appeal sentences that they regard as too lenient. Arrests of Americans have become increasingly common in Russia in recent years. Concern has risen that Russia could be targeting U.S. nationals for arrest to later use as bargaining chips in talks to bring back Russians convicted of crimes in the U.S. and Europe. The U.S. and Russia in August completed their largest prisoner swap in post-Soviet history, a deal involving 24 people, many months of negotiations and concessions from other European countries who released Russians in their custody as part of the exchange. Several U.S. citizens remain behind bars in Russia following the swap.	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-us-mercenary-prosecutors-85337ef2e4c84fd1df6962aec553bc7e	2024-10-05T00:52:32-07:00	
Rescue teams search for missing after floods, landslides kill at least 16 in Bosnia	JABLANICA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) — Rescue teams on Saturday searched for those still missing after flash floods and landslides hit parts of Bosnia, killing at least 16 people and injuring scores more. Construction machines worked to remove piles of rocks and debris covering the central town of Jablanica after the rainstorm early on Friday. Huge quantities of rain fell in the area around Jablanica and nearby Konjic, causing sudden floods that broke into people's homes as they were sleeping. Surging waters also triggered landslides that collapsed roads and hills, covering villages in mud and cutting off entire areas. Bosnian media are reporting that rocks from a nearby quarry fell on the village of Donja Jablanica, burying houses. Alka Gusic, a resident of Donja Jablanica, lost her brother and his entire family while her own son has been hospitalized. Overnight on Friday, she said, a frightening rumble woke her up from her sleep. 'I thought it was an earthquake,' said Gusic. She waited until morning to venture out. 'I saw my brother's son being pulled out. He was lying on the ground – it was obvious (he was dead).' 'God help us,' she cried. 'I lost four of them, house destroyed completely, no one stayed alive, no one.' Officials have said that at least 16 people are confirmed dead so far, including a baby. At least 10 are still missing while dozens are injured. Rescuers sealed off Jablanica, banning any entry for outsiders while the search took place. Some houses were submerged up to their roofs and as the water withdrew, rescuers could be seen walking over piles of rubble left behind. Near the town of Konjic that was also hit by the storm, officials said some villages remained cut off on Saturday. 'Kilometers of roads no longer exist, nearly all bridges have been destroyed,' Husein Hodzic from the local civil protection unit told regional N1 television. 'There is no electricity, all power poles have been swept away. There are no phone lines.' Bosnia's election authorities said local elections set for Sunday will be postponed in the flood-hit municipalities. Human-caused climate change increases the intensity of rainfall because warm air holds more moisture. This summer, the Balkans were also hit by long-lasting record temperatures, causing a drought. Scientists said the dried-out land has hampered the absorption of floodwaters. Flooding was also reported in Croatia and Montenegro in the previous days but caused less damage and no fatalities. ___ Jovana Gec contributed to this report from Belgrade, Serbia.	https://apnews.com/article/balkans-bosnia-floods-rain-missing-b771f8846c1e015b21a7e97321c9fd2f	2024-10-05T00:34:23-07:00	
Militants kill six Pakistani soldiers during a shootout in the country's northwest	PESHAWAR, Pakistan (AP) — Militants killed six Pakistani soldiers during a shootout in the northwest, the army said Saturday. It’s the latest unrest in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, which borders Afghanistan and is a base for armed groups including the Pakistani Taliban. The troops died in an overnight operation in North Waziristan on Saturday, according to an army statement. The statement also said six militants were killed. The army said a separate operation killed two militants in Swat, also in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. One of them was said to be involved in an attack on a convoy of foreign ambassadors in the area earlier this month. Also Saturday, cellphone services remained suspended in Islamabad as it entered a second day of a lockdown aimed at thwarting rallies in support of ex-leader Imran Khan. He is in prison on multiple charges. Shipping containers have blocked off the city’s entry and exit points, but videos from Khan’s political party showed his supporters piled into vehicles and attempting to head toward Islamabad. The chief minister of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Ali Amin Gandapur, and others in the convoy worked throughout the night to remove shipping containers from the road, the party said. Khan’s PTI party said it plans to hold a rally in Lahore.	https://apnews.com/article/pakistan-militants-northwest-imran-khan-rally-c85d8f925b616bbbf45bbb3a54a1e3a9	2024-10-05T00:13:07-07:00	
A van packed with migrants skids off a road in Croatia, killing 2 and injuring 25	ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) — A van packed with migrants slid off the road and overturned in central Croatia early Saturday, killing two people and injuring 25, including some seriously, police and doctors said. The accident happened around 1 a.m. near Peklenica, some 100 kilometers (60 miles) southeast of Zagreb, the capital, said a police statement. A patrol spotted the van with German license plates overnight and started to follow it when the driver increased the speed, the statement said. After several kilometers (miles), the officers saw the van overturned in a ditch by the road after it apparently hit a concrete bridge, a house and a power pole. Doctors told Croatian media that 9 people were seriously injured and were being treated in hospitals in the area. They include people from Iraq, Turkey and Syria, as well as Palestinians. A similar accident in September in Croatia injured 14 people, illustrating the dangers migrants face as they flee wars and poverty in the Middle East, Africa and Asia. Migrants often seek help from people smugglers to cross borders without authorization to reach wealthy Western European countries. Migrants are often forced to travel in crammed boats or vans. ___ Follow AP migration coverage at: https://apnews.com/hub/migration	https://apnews.com/article/croatia-migration-deadly-van-accident-d1db4dc5da650285d8ed44f948c44554	2024-10-04T23:03:41-07:00	
Middle East latest: Two Hamas officials killed in Israeli strikes in Lebanon	An Israeli strike on a refugee camp in north Lebanon has killed Hamas official Saeed Atallah Ali and his family, the militant group said Saturday. Hamas later said another military wing member was killed in an Israeli strike in Lebanon’s eastern Bekaa Valley. The strikes come a day after another Israeli airstrike cut off a main highway linking Lebanon with Syria, leaving two huge craters on either side of the road. Israel began a ground incursion Tuesday into Lebanon against the Hezbollah militant group. The Israeli military said nine soldiers have died in the conflict in southern Lebanon. Israel and Hezbollah have traded fire across the Lebanon border almost daily since the day after Hamas’ cross-border attack on Oct. 7, 2023, which killed 1,200 Israelis and took 250 others hostage. Israel declared war on the Hamas militant group in the Gaza Strip in response. As the Israel-Hamas war reaches the one-year mark, more than 41,000 Palestinians have been killed in the territory, and just over half the dead have been women and children, according to local health officials. Nearly 2,000 people have been killed in Lebanon in the latest conflict, most of them since Sept. 23, according to the Lebanese Health Ministry. ___ Here is the latest: Apparent Israeli airstrike kills at least 18 in central Gaza, Palestinian officials say DEAIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — An apparent Israeli airstrike early Sunday killed at least 18 people in central Gaza, Palestinian medical officials said. The strike hit a mosque sheltering displaced people near the al-Aqsa Martyrs hospital in the town of Deir al-Balah, the hospital said in a statement. An Associated Press journalist counted the bodies at the hospital morgue. Hospital records showed that the dead were all men. Another two men were critically wounded, the hospital said. The Israeli military did not immediately comment about the strike on the mosque. The latest strikes add to the mounting Palestinian death toll in Gaza, which is now nearing 42,000 according to the Palestinian Health Ministry. The ministry does not differentiate between civilian and militant deaths, but many of the dead were women and children. New explosions in south Beirut suburbs as Israel expands bombing in Lebanon Powerful new explosions rocked Beirut’s southern suburbs late Saturday as Israel expanded its bombardment in Lebanon, also striking a Palestinian refugee camp deep in the north for the first time as it targeted both Hezbollah and Hamas fighters. Thousands of people in Lebanon, including Palestinian refugees, continued to flee the widening conflict in the region, while rallies were held around the world marking the approaching anniversary of the start of the war in Gaza. The strong explosions began near midnight after Israel’s military urged residents to evacuate areas in Beirut’s Haret Hreik and Choueifat neighborhoods. AP video showed the blasts illuminating the densely populated southern suburbs, where Hezbollah has a strong presence. They followed a day of sporadic strikes and the nearly continuous buzz of reconnaissance drones. Israel’s military confirmed it was striking targets near Beirut and said about 30 projectiles had crossed from Lebanon into Israeli territory. Israeli troops destroy Hezbollah tunnel near the border in south Lebanon TEL AVIV — The Israeli military says its troops have located and destroyed a 250-meter-long Hezbollah tunnel in southern Lebanon near the Israeli border. The army said Saturday that troops uncovered command centers, combat packs and a large number of weapons in the tunnel. There were also living quarters equipped with showers, a kitchen and stockpiles of food. The army says the tunnel did not cross into Israeli territory. The military says it has been carrying out ground raids against Hezbollah infrastructure in southern Lebanon for days, destroying missiles, launchpads, weapons storage facilities and multiple tunnel shafts that it says Hezbollah used to approach the Israeli border. Brazil evacuates 229 people from Lebanon RIO DE JANEIRO — A plane chartered by the Brazilian Air Force has left Beirut for Brazil carrying 229 passengers including 10 infants. Brazil’s foreign ministry said in a statement Saturday that three pets are also on the flight headed for Sao Paulo — Brazil’s first flight evacuating nationals from Lebanon. The ministry says it was supposed to leave Friday but was stalled due to security reasons. It says a second flight is scheduled for next week, depending on security conditions on the ground. Two Brazilian adolescents have been killed by Israeli bombardments in Lebanon, which is home to the largest community of Brazilians in the Middle East at around 21,000. Iran’s foreign minister hints at cease-fire discussions DAMASCUS, Syria — Iran’s foreign minister says some countries are making efforts to broker cease-fires in Lebanon and the Gaza Strip. Abbas Araghchi told reporters in Damascus that 'we are trying to reach a cease-fire in Gaza and in Lebanon.' The minister did not name the countries involved, describing them as regional states and some from outside the Middle East. He declined to provide details, saying the efforts are still 'ideas.' Araghchi says any proposal should be accepted by the Palestinian and Lebanese sides and once that happens Iran and Syria would back them. He also reiterated that Iran will retaliate to any Israeli attack, warning it would be 'stronger, and they can test our will.' Rocket sirens sound across northern Israel JERUSALEM — Rocket alert sirens have been blaring all day in northern Israel. The Israeli military says some 90 projectiles have been fired Saturday from Lebanon into Israel. Most were intercepted or fell in open areas, but several rockets fell in the northern Arab town of Deir al-Asad, where police said three people were lightly injured, and in the nearby city of Karmiel, damaging an apartment building. Slovakia evacuates nationals and others from Lebanon BRATISLAVA, Slovakia — A Slovak government plane has landed in the capital Bratislava carrying 46 people who were evacuated from Lebanon. The Slovak Foreign Ministry says another plane carrying 44 people is expected later Saturday. The ministry says 34 Slovaks are among them, as well nationals from other European countries. The Czech Foreign Ministry says 10 Czechs and three relatives with Lebanese passports will be on the second flight. They were first evacuated from Beirut to Larnaca in Cyprus by military transport plane before traveling to Bratislava on the government plane. Hamas says an Israeli strike killed a member of its military wing in Lebanon BEIRUT — Hamas says one of its members was killed in an Israeli strike in Lebanon’s eastern Bekaa Valley. The Palestinian militant group says Mohammed Lweis, who was a member of the group’s military wing the Qassam Brigade, was killed Saturday in an Israeli attack on the eastern Lebanese village of Fayda. Hours earlier, Hamas announced the deaths of another member of its military wing, his wife and two daughters in a Palestinian refugee camp in northern Lebanon. Over the past year, Israel has killed several Hamas officials in Lebanon. Reports: Israeli drone strikes car in central Syria, killing 1 BEIRUT — A Syrian opposition war monitor and pro-government media are reporting that an Israeli drone strike on a car in central Syria killed one person and wounded three. It was not immediately clear who was the target of Saturday’s airstrike near the central city of Hama, which was reported by the U.K.-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights and pro-government Sham FM radio. They did not give further details. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military. Israel regularly carries out airstrikes inside government-controlled parts of war-torn Syria but rarely acknowledges them. When it has, it says it targets Iranian-backed groups or Hezbollah weapons shipments. Almost 375,000 people have fled Lebanon for Syria in 2 weeks BEIRUT — Nearly 375,000 people have crossed from Lebanon into Syria, fleeing Israeli bombardment, in less than two weeks, Lebanese officials said. The government's crisis management unit, citing figures from Lebanese General Security, said 374,621 people — Lebanese citizens and Syrians living in Lebanon — have crossed into Syria since Sept. 23, when Israel intensified its air bombardment campaign in Lebanon. Thousands have continued to cross on foot through the main Masnaa Border Crossing even after Israeli airstrikes cut off the road leading up to it on Thursday. Associated Press journalists on Saturday saw a nonstop stream of people walking through a huge crater created by the airstrike to waiting buses on the other side. Syria's Assad praises Iran's strike on Israel DAMASCUS, Syria — Syrian President Bashar Assad praised Iran for firing nearly 200 missiles at Israel earlier this week saying it was a message to Israel that Tehran and its allies 'can deter the enemy.' Assad spoke during a meeting with visiting Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi on Saturday. In comments carried by state media, Assad said that 'resisting occupation, aggression and mass killings is a legitimate right.' Assad said the Iran-led alliance known as Axis of Resistance will remain strong because of the backing of its people. Syrian state media said Assad and Araghchi discussed ending Israel’s attacks on Lebanon. Iran has been a main backer of Assad since Syria’s civil war began in March 2011. Israel conducts more ground raids in southern Lebanon TEL AVIV, Israel — The Israeli military said on Saturday its special forces were carrying out ground raids against Hezbollah infrastructure in southern Lebanon, destroying missiles, launchpads, watchtowers and weapons storage facilities. The military said troops also dismantled tunnel shafts that Hezbollah used to approach the Israeli border. Some 1,400 Lebanese, including Hezbollah fighters and civilians, have been killed and some 1.2 million driven from their homes since Israel escalated its strikes in late September aiming to cripple Hezbollah and push it away from the countries’ shared border. On Tuesday, Israel launched what it calls a limited ground operation into southern Lebanon. Nine Israeli troops have been killed in close fighting in the area in the past few days, which is saturated with arms and explosives, the military said. Israeli strikes in Lebanon have hit civilian areas and infrastructure including hospitals and paramedics. Israeli strikes hammer Beirut suburbs BEIRUT — Beirut’s southern suburbs was hit by 12 Israeli airstrikes early Saturday, including one that badly damaged a large hall Hezbollah has used to hold ceremonies, Lebanon’s state news agency said. Later in the day, more strikes hit the area, from which tens of thousands of people have fled over the past two weeks. Israeli airstrikes also hit areas in southern and eastern Lebanon, according to state media. At least six people were killed, according to NNA. Israeli strikes in Gaza kill 9, including 2 children CAIRO — Palestinian medical officials say Israeli strikes in northern and central Gaza early Saturday have killed at least nine people, including two children. One strike hit a group of people in the northern town of Beit Hanoun, killing at least five people, including two children, according to the Health Ministry’s Ambulance and Emergency service. Another strike hit a house in the northern part of Nuseirat refugee camp, killing at least four people, the Awda hospital said. The strike also left a number of wounded people, it said. The Israeli military did not have any immediate comment on the strikes, but has long accused Hamas of operating from within civilian areas. Almost 42,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza during the almost year-long war, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry, which does not differentiate between civilian and militant deaths. Israel orders more evacuations in central Gaza CAIRO — The Israeli military on Saturday warned residents in parts of central Gaza to evacuate, saying its forces will soon operate there in response to Palestinian militants. The warnings cover areas along a strategic corridor in central Gaza, which was at the heart of obstacles to a ceasefire deal earlier this summer. The military warned Palestinians in areas of Nuseirat and Bureij refugee camps, located along the Netzarim corridor, to evacuate to an along Gaza's shore called Muwasi, which the military has designated a humanitarian zone. It’s unclear how many Palestinians are currently living in the areas affected by the order, parts of which were evacuated previously. Less than an hour after the evacuation order, Palestinians reported Israel’s artillery shelling and smoke bombing in the northern areas of Nuseirat camp. There were no immediate reports of casualties. Israeli forces have repeatedly returned to heavily destroyed areas of Gaza where they fought earlier battles against Hamas and other militants since the start of the war one year ago. The vast majority of Gaza’s population of 2.3 million people has been displaced in the war, often multiple times, and hundreds of thousands are packed into squalid tent camps. Others have remained in their homes despite being ordered to leave, saying nowhere in the isolated coastal territory feels safe. An Israeli strike on a refugee camp kills a Hamas official BEIRUT — An Israeli strike on a refugee camp in north Lebanon has killed a Hamas official and his family, the militant group said Saturday. Hamas said in a statement that the early Saturday strike on the Beddawi refugee camp struck the home of Saeed Atallah Ali, an official with Hamas’s military wing, the Qassam Brigades. Ali’s wife, Shaymaa Azzam, and their two daughters, Zeinab and Fatima — whom the statement described as children — were also killed in the attack. Beddawi camp is near the northern city of Tripoli. It was the first such strike on the camp in the recent conflict. Israel has killed several Hamas officials in Lebanon since the Israel-Hamas war began in October 2023. South Korea evacuates 97 people from Lebanon SEOUL, South Korea — A military plane evacuating 97 people from Lebanon arrived in South Korea on Saturday. South Korea's Foreign Ministry said the group on the plane includes South Korean nationals and their family members. There are about 30 South Koreans left in Lebanon besides diplomats and embassy workers who are staying. South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol instructed officials Wednesday to send military aircraft to conflict areas in the Middle East as he called a meeting to discuss the impact of the intensified fighting in the region. There are about 480 South Korean nationals living in Israel and 110 in Iran.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hezbollah-hamas-latest-mideast-5-october-2024-e8c20151ce6d01f8ac697a835314e70d	2024-10-04T21:31:31-07:00	
AP PHOTOS: In their 80s, these South Korean women learned reading and rap	CHILGOK, South Korea (AP) — Wearing an oversized bucket hat, silver chains and a black Miu Miu shirt, 82-year-old Park Jeom-sun gesticulates, her voice rising and falling with the staccato delivery of rhymes about growing chili peppers, cucumbers and eggplants. Park, nicknamed Suni, was flanked by seven longtime friends who repeated her moves and her lines. Together, they're Suni and the Seven Princesses, South Korea 's latest octogenarian sensation. With an average age of 85, they're probably the oldest rap group in the country. Born at a time when women were often marginalized in education, Park and her friends were among a group of older adults learning how to read and write the Korean alphabet, hangul, at a community center in their farming village in South Korea’s rural southeast. They were having so much fun that they started dabbling with poetry. They began writing and performing rap in summer last year. Suni and the Seven Princesses enjoy nationwide fame, appearing in commercials and going viral on social media. South Korean Prime Minister Han Duck-soo sent them a congratulatory message last month on their first anniversary, praising their passion for learning. At a road near their community center in Chilgok on Thursday, Park and her friends were rehearsing for a performance Friday evening in the capital, Seoul, where they were invited to open an event celebrating hangul heritage. 'Picking chili peppers at the pepper field, picking cucumbers at the cucumber field, picking eggplants at the eggplant field, picking zucchini at the zucchini field!' the group rapped along with Park. 'We’re back home now and it feels so good!' Park said the group usually practices two or three times a week, more if they're preparing for a show. On Friday, hundreds of people applauded and cheered, and then the group lined up for a photo with South Korean Culture Minister Yu In Chon. Park talked about the joy of learning to read, saying she can now 'go to the bank, ride the bus and go anywhere' she wants without someone helping her. 'During and after the Korean War, I couldn’t study because of the social atmosphere, but I started learning hangul in 2016,' Park said, referring to the devastating war between North and South Korea from 1950 to 1953. 'Being introduced to rap while learning Hangeul has made me feel better, and I thought it would help me stay healthy and avoid dementia.' Kang Hye-eun, Park’s 29-year-old granddaughter and a local healthcare worker who helps older adults, said she was proud to see her grandmother on television and in viral videos. 'It’s amazing that she got to know hangul like this and has started to rap,' she said.	https://apnews.com/article/south-korea-rappers-older-literacy-women-education-db7a109b38827e08804e6da20fb9414f	2024-10-04T21:26:36-07:00	
Leslie strengthens into a hurricane in the Atlantic but isn't threatening land	MIAMI (AP) — Leslie has strengthened into a hurricane in the Atlantic Ocean and isn’t threatening land, forecasters said. The storm was located Saturday about 725 miles (1,170 kilometers) west-southwest of the southernmost Cabo Verde Islands and had maximum sustained winds of 75 mph (120 kph). There were no coastal watches or warnings in effect. Meanwhile, Hurricane Kirk remained a Category 4 major hurricane, and waves from the system were affecting the the Leeward Islands, Bermuda, and the Greater Antilles, forecasters said. The storm's swells were expected to spread to the East Coast of the United States, the Atlantic Coast of Canada and the Bahamas on Saturday night and Sunday. Forecasters warned the waves could cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Kirk was expected to weaken starting Saturday, the center said. Though there were no coastal warnings or watches in effect for Kirk, the center said those in the Azores, where swells could hit Monday, should monitor the storm's progress. Kirk was about 975 miles (1,570 kilometers) east-northeast of the northern Leeward Islands with maximum sustained winds of 130 mph (209 kph). The storms churned in the Atlantic as rescuers in the U.S. Southeast searched for people unaccounted for after Hurricane Helene struck last week, leaving behind a trail of death and catastrophic damage.	https://apnews.com/article/hurricane-leslie-atlantic-ocean-b9585e905919ce6c30eda0862b818ba1	2024-10-04T19:35:55-07:00	
Solar power companies are growing fast in Africa, where 600 million still lack electricity	FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) — Companies that bring solar power to some of the poorest homes in Central and West Africa are said to be among the fastest growing on a continent whose governments have long struggled to address some of the world's worst infrastructure and the complications of climate change. The often African-owned companies operate in areas where the vast majority of people live disconnected from the electricity grid, and offer products ranging from solar-powered lamps that allow children to study at night to elaborate home systems that power kitchen appliances and plasma televisions. Prices range from less than $20 for a solar-powered lamp to thousands of dollars for home appliances and entertainment systems. Central and West Africa have some of the world’s lowest electrification rates. In West Africa, where 220 million people live without power, this is as low as 8%, according to the World Bank. Many rely on expensive kerosene and other fuels that fill homes and businesses with fumes and risk causing fires. At the last United Nations climate summit, the world agreed on the goal of tripling the capacity for renewable power generation by 2050. While the African continent is responsible for hardly any carbon emissions relative to its size, solar has become one relatively cost-effective way to provide electricity. The International Energy Agency, in a report earlier this year, said small and medium-sized solar companies are making rapid progress reaching homes but more needs to be invested to reach all African homes and businesses by 2030. About 600 million Africans lack access to electricity, it said, out of a population of more than 1.3 billion. Among the companies that made the Financial Times' annual ranking of Africa's fastest growing companies of 2023 was Easy Solar, a locally owned firm that brings solar power to homes and businesses in Sierra Leone and Liberia. The ranking went by compound annual growth rate in revenue. Co-founder Nthabiseng Mosia grew up in Ghana with frequent power cuts. She became interested in solving energy problems in Africa while at graduate school in the United States. Together with a U.S. classmate, she launched the company in Sierra Leone with electrification rates among the lowest in West Africa. 'There wasn’t really anybody doing solar at scale. And so we thought it was a good opportunity,' Mosia said in an interview. Since launching in 2016, Easy Solar has brought solar power to over a million people in Sierra Leone and Liberia, which have a combined population of more than 14 million. The company’s network includes agents and shops in all of Sierra Leone’s 16 districts and seven of nine counties in Liberia. Many communities have been connected to a stable source of power for the first time. 'We really want to go to the last mile deep into the rural areas,' Mosia said. The company began with a pilot project in Songo, a community on the outskirts of Sierra Leone’s capital Freetown. Uptake was slow at first, Mosia said. Villagers worried about the cost of solar-powered appliances, but once they began to see light in their neighbors’ homes at night, more signed on. 'We have long forgotten about kerosene,' said Haroun Patrick Samai, a Songo resident and land surveyor. 'Before Easy Solar we lived in constant danger of a fire outbreak from the use of candles and kerosene.' Altech, a solar power company based in Congo, also ranked as one of Africa's fastest growing companies. Fewer than 20% of the population in Congo has access to electricity, according to the World Bank. Co-founders Washikala Malango and Iongwa Mashangao fled conflict in Congo's South Kivu province as children and grew up in Tanzania. They decided to launch the company in 2013 to help solve the power problems they had experienced growing up in a refugee camp, relying on kerosene for power and competing with family members for light to study at night. Altech now operates in 23 out of 26 provinces in Congo, and the company expects to reach the remaining ones by the end of the year. Its founders say they have sold over 1 million products in Congo in a range of solar-powered solutions for homes and businesses, including lighting, appliances, home systems and generators. 'For the majority of our customers, this is the first time they are connected to a power source,' Malango said. Repayment rates are over 90%, Malango said, helped in part by a system that can turn off power to appliances remotely if people don't pay. ___ The Associated Press receives financial support for global health and development coverage in Africa from the Gates Foundation.

Alleged plots against US campaign are only the latest examples of Iran targeting adversaries	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Iran has emerged as a twofold concern for the United States as it nears the end of the presidential campaign. Prosecutors allege Tehran tried to hack figures associated with the election, stealing information from former President Donald Trump’s campaign. And U.S. officials have accused it of plotting to kill Trump and other ex-officials. For Iran, assassination plots and hacking aren’t new strategies. Iran saw the value and the danger of hacking in the early 2000s, when the Stuxnet virus, believed to have been deployed by Israel and the U.S., tried to damage Iran’s nuclear program. Since then, hackers attributed to state-linked operations have targeted the Trump campaign, Iranian expatriates and government officials at home. Its history of assassinations goes back further. After the 1979 Islamic Revolution, Iran killed or abducted perceived enemies living abroad. A look at Iran’s history of targeting opponents: A history of hacks For many, Iran’s behavior can be traced to the emergence of the Stuxnet computer virus. Released in the 2000s, Stuxnet wormed its way into control units for uranium-enriching centrifuges at Iran's Natanz nuclear facility, causing them to speed up, ultimately destroying themselves. Iranian scientists initially believed mechanical errors caused the damage. Ultimately though, Iran removed the affected equipment and sought its own way of striking enemies online. 'Iran had an excellent teacher in the emerging art of cyberwarfare,' wryly noted a 2020 report from the King Faisal Center for Research and Islamic Studies in Saudi Arabia. That was acknowledged by the National Security Agency in a document leaked by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden in 2015 to The Intercept, which examined a cyberattack that destroyed hard drives at Saudi Arabia’s state oil company. Iran has been suspected of carrying out that attack, called Shamoon, in 2012 and again in 2017. 'Iran, having been a victim of a similar cyberattack against its own oil industry in April 2012, has demonstrated a clear ability to learn from the capabilities and actions of others,' the document said. There also were domestic considerations. In 2009, the disputed reelection of hard-line President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad sparked the Green Movement protests. Twitter, one source of news from the demonstrations, found its website defaced by the self-described 'Iranian Cyber Army.' There’s been suspicion that the Revolutionary Guard, a major power base within Iran's theocracy, oversaw the 'Cyber Army' and other hackers. Meanwhile, Iran itself has been hacked repeatedly in embarrassing incidents. They include the mass shutdown of gas stations across Iran, as well as surveillance cameras at Tehran’s notorious Evin Prison and even state television broadcasts. Hacks offer low costs and high rewards Iranian hacking attacks, given their low cost and high reward, likely will continue as Iran faces a tense international environment surrounding Israel's conflicts with Hamas and Hezbollah, Iran's enrichment of uranium to near weapons-grade levels and the prospect of Trump becoming president again. The growth of 3G and 4G mobile internet services in Iran also made it easier for the public — and potential hackers — to access the internet. Iran has over 50 major universities with computer science or information technology programs. At least three of Iran’s top schools are thought to be affiliated with Iran’s Defense Ministry and the Guard, providing potential hackers for security forces. Iranian hacking attempts on U.S. targets have included banks and even a small dam near New York City — attacks American prosecutors linked to the Guard. While Russia is seen as the biggest foreign threat to U.S. elections, officials have been concerned about Iran. Its hacking attempts in the presidential campaign have relied on phishing — sending many misleading emails in hopes that some recipients will inadvertently provide access to sensitive information. Amin Sabeti, a digital security expert who focuses on Iran, said the tactic works. 'It’s scalable, it’s cheap and you don’t need a skill set because you just put, I don’t know, five crazy people who are hard line in an office in Tehran, then send tens of thousands of emails. If they get 10 of them, it’s enough,' he said. For Iran, hacks targeting the U.S. offer the prospect of causing chaos, undermining Trump’s campaign and obtaining secret information. 'I’ve lost count of how many attempts have been made on my emails and social media since it’s been going on for over a decade,' said Holly Dagres, a nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council who once had her email briefly hacked by Iran. 'The Iranians aren’t targeting me because I have useful information swimming in my inbox or direct messages. Rather, they hope to use my name and think tank affiliation to target others and eventually make it up the chain to high-ranking U.S. government officials who would have useful information and intelligence related to Iran.' Iran’s killings and abductions abroad Iran has vowed to exact revenge against Trump and others in his former administration over the 2020 drone strike that killed the prominent Revolutionary Guard Gen. Qassem Soleimani in Baghdad. In July, authorities said they learned of an Iranian threat against Trump and boosted security. Iran has not been linked to the assassination attempts against Trump in Florida and Pennsylvania. A Pakistani man who spent time in Iran was recently charged by federal prosecutors for allegedly plotting to carry out assassinations in the U.S., including potentially of Trump. Officials take Iran's threat seriously given its history of targeting adversaries. After the 1979 Islamic Revolution, its leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini signaled how Iran would target perceived enemies by saying, 'Islam grew with blood.' 'The great prophet of Islam, he had the Quran in one hand, and a sword in the other hand — a sword to suppress traitors,' Khomeini said. Even before creating a network of allied militias in the Mideast, Iran is suspected of targeting opponents abroad, beginning with members of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi’s former government. The attention shifted to perceived opponents of the theocracy, both in the country with the mass executions of 1988 and abroad. Outside of Iran, the so-called 'chain murders' targeted activists, journalists and other critics. One prominent incident linked to Iran was a shooting at a restaurant in Germany that killed three Iranian-Kurdish figures and a translator. In 1997, a German court implicated Iran’s top leaders in the shooting, sparking most European Union nations to withdraw their ambassadors. Iran’s targeted killings slowed after that, but didn’t stop. U.S. prosecutors link Iran’s Revolutionary Guard to a 2011 plot to kill the Saudi ambassador to Washington. Meanwhile, a suspected Israeli campaign of assassinations targeted scientists in Iran’s nuclear program. In 2015, Iran signed a nuclear deal that saw it greatly reduce its enrichment in exchange for the lifting of sanctions. Two years later, Trump was elected pledging to unilaterally withdraw America from the accord. As businesses backed away from Iran, Tehran renewed a campaign of targeting opponents abroad, but this time capturing them and bringing them to Iran for trial. Belgium arrested an Iranian diplomat, Assadollah Assadi, in 2018 and ultimately convicted him of masterminding a thwarted bomb attack against an exiled Iranian opposition group. Iran also increasingly has turned to criminal gangs for some attempts, such as what U.S. prosecutors have described as plots to kill or kidnap opposition activist Masih Alinejad. Among those targeted after Soleimani's death was former U.S. national security adviser John Bolton. The U.S. has offered a reward of up to $20 million for information leading to the capture or conviction of a Revolutionary Guard member it said arranged to kill Bolton for $300,000. An FBI agent quoted Guard Gen. Esmail Ghaani as saying in 2022 in a court filing, 'Wherever is necessary we take revenge against Americans by the help of people on their side and within their own homes without our presence.'	https://apnews.com/article/iran-hacking-assassinations-plot-6cb2929fa7065ca8d8e21c6713087258	2024-10-04T19:13:00-07:00	
One year in, war casts a shadow over every aspect of life in Israel	TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — At a busy Tel Aviv entertainment district, diners spill into outdoor seating and clink glasses as music fills the air. There’s laughter, there’s life. But all around the patrons, staring down from lampposts and shop windows, are pictures of hostages held in Gaza, stark reminders that Israel is at war and forever scarred by the deadliest attack in its history. As Israel's war with Hamas reaches its one-year mark, it can seem on the surface that much of life in the country has returned to normal. But with many still reeling from Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack, hostages remaining in captivity and a new front of warwith Hezbollah in the north, many Israelis feel depressed, despondent and angry as the war stretches into its second year. Uncertainty over the future has cast a pall over virtually every part of daily life, even as people try to maintain a sense of normalcy. 'The conversation about the situation is always there,' said activist Zeev Engelmayer, whose daily postcard project featuring illustrations of hostages or Israel's new reality has become a fixture at anti-war protests. 'Even those who are sitting in coffee shops, they’re talking about it, in every single situation I see it. It’s impossible to get away from it. It has entered into every vibration of our life.' Rattled Israelis feel hopeless Hamas' attack in which some 1,200 people were killed and 250 kidnapped shattered Israelis’ sense of security and stability in their homeland. Many have been rattled by the war's evolution. Nearly 100 hostages remain in Gaza, with less than 70 believed to be alive. Israelis have experienced attacks — missiles from Iran and Hezbollah, explosive drones from Yemen, fatal shootings and stabbings — as the region braces for further escalation. They've watched as Israel is accused of committing war crimes and genocide in Gaza and becomes increasingly isolated internationally. 'I’m almost 80 — we grew up in this country with a feeling that we have short wars, and we win them quickly,' said Israeli historian Tom Segev, who described new feelings of utter hopelessness. 'We’re not used to a long war.' Israelis have long harbored a sense that their country, born of the Holocaust's ashes and surviving a panoply of regional threats, is a success story, Segev said. They've strived, he added, for a normality akin to that of European and North American people, though their reality for decades has been anything but. 'I think that history is going backward,' he said of the past year. 'Everything we have achieved on our way to becoming a normal state isn’t happening.' Reminders are everywhere. At a Hebrew University graduation in Jerusalem, a large yellow ribbon was placed in front of the stage. A graduate who didn't attend because his brother was killed in Gaza the previous day was honored. Internal divisions grow Israel's longstanding internal divisions briefly eased in the aftermath of Hamas’ attack, but have only intensified since. Weekly protests calling for a cease-fire deal that would free hostages are attended mostly by secular Jewish Israelis who oppose Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his government. According to a September poll by Jerusalem-based think tank Israel Democracy Institute, 61 percent of right-wing Jewish Israelis — Netanyahu's base — support the war continuing. Occupied with their own trauma, most Israelis paid scant attention to the ongoing destruction in Gaza, even as the Health Ministry there put the Palestinian death toll at more than 41,000. Israeli media have reported little on the devastation. Israelis calling for a cease-fire are driven overwhelmingly by the hostages' plight. Many Israelis are furious at leaders and the military for not preventing Hamas’ attack. Tens of thousands of people are expected at an alternative ceremony marking one year since then, as a statement against the government's official commemoration. The state ceremony is being prerecorded without a live audience, in part because of fears of heckling and disruptions. 'The thing we lost on Oct. 7 — and we haven’t gotten it back — is our feeling of security,' Muli Segev, executive producer of 'Eretz Nehederet,' a popular sketch comedy show. 'Despite everything, we have been able to create a life here that’s pretty open and Western. 'Especially in Tel Aviv, we go about our lives, and we don’t think about the fact that our lives are really just pauses between wars and between explosions of violence.' In the war's early months, the show's sketches were gentler, focusing on what united Israeli society, such as the massive civilian volunteer response. Over time, they featured more pointed satire, including a reimagining of negotiations if the hostages were Israeli politicians' children — released in less than two hours. Parts of life have rebounded — beaches full of people, bustling cafes, concerts and sports back on schedules. But residents also check for the nearest bomb shelter, deal with school cancellations when violence flares up, and avoid domestic travel hubs that are now off-limits. Heartbreaking news arrives regularly, including the deaths of six hostages in August. 'It’s a nightmare; we’re just getting used to it,' said Maya Brandwine, a 33-year-old graphic designer who witnessed the Jaffa shooting that killed seven on Tuesday. 'I have so little hope. I’m sure the situation will only get worse.' Dror Rotches, a 47-year-old graphic designer, said from a Tel Aviv coffee shop: 'We try to go out when we can, meet friends and try to forget for a few hours. Then we go home and keep slogging through the mud.' Others simply can't return home. More than 60,000 from Israel's northern border with Lebanon are displaced. Thousands from the southern towns ransacked Oct. 7 are in temporary housing. Tens of thousands of reserve soldiers are serving their second or third tour of duty, straining their families and jobs. 'As the war goes on and on and we can’t see the end, there’s also a type of very large worry over the future, and, for some, if there is even a future here,' Muli Segev said. At this cafe, life meets war Cafe Otef seems like any of Tel Aviv's ubiquitous coffee shops: Patrons laugh and sip specialty coffee beside a playground; light rock music plays. But next to the sandwiches and cakes are chocolates made from the recipes of Dvir Karp, who was killed in the Oct. 7 attack, and cheeses from Kibbutz Be’eri, where more than 100 died and 30 were taken hostage. Totes and T-shirts for sale declare 'We shall thrive again.' The cafe, named for the region next to the Gaza border, is run by residents of Re'im, one of the kibbutzes struck. It's the second shop in the new chain, each aiming to support people of a southern Israeli town where lives were upended. 'The war still continues for almost a year, and I feel that if we won’t live, we will die,' said Reut Karp, cafe owner and Dvir's ex-wife. She lives with most of her kibbutz in temporary housing nearby. The cafe gives her purpose as her community deals with trauma and the uncertainty of returning home. While it's strange to see people flowing through the doors, going about life as normal, she and the staff have found comfort in the routine. 'We must take ourselves out of bed and continue to live and to work and to have the hope,' Karp said. 'Because without this hope, we don’t have anything.'	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-gaza-war-israelis-mood-depression-28daf7e6aa8ddab419cf76e31b111d4f	2024-10-04T19:03:41-07:00	
The Biden administration isn't extending a two-year program for migrants from 4 nations	WASHINGTON (AP) — The Biden administration will not extend a two-year program that allows migrants from certain nations into the U.S. if they came by plane with sponsorship. The program began in 2022 with Venezuelans and was an effort to provide an alternative legal pathway for migrants who were increasingly coming to the U.S.-Mexico border while the administration simultaneously cracked down on illegal crossings. It later expanded to Cubans, Haitians and Nicaraguans — the nationalities of the migrants who most frequently tried to cross the border. The program allowed them to live and work in the U.S. for two years while they sought other legal status. The decision comes just a month before the 2024 presidential election, as Democrat Kamala Harris has worked to project a tougher stance on immigration. Republican Donald Trump has derided the administration's immigration policies and has increasingly insulted and spread lies about migrants in the U.S., particularly Haitians, in recent weeks. Homeland Security officials said Friday that those at the two-year mark must apply for another type of legal status, depart the country or face deportation. There are multiple different pathways for many of the nationalities, including what's called 'temporary protected status' for Venezuelans and Haitians, which allows them to stay in the U.S. because of extreme violence, unrest or devastating natural disasters in their home countries. 'This two-year period was intended to enable individuals to seek humanitarian relief or other immigration benefits for which they may be eligible, and to work and contribute to the United States,' Homeland Security spokesperson Naree Ketudat said. New migrants to the border may still apply for the program, and it does not affect those from Afghanistan or Ukraine.	https://apnews.com/article/biden-immigration-election-4cb4c80e3a71ab79ef47406136653b1a	2024-10-04T13:28:42-07:00	
Thousands of Jewish pilgrims come to Ukraine for Rosh Hashana despite official warnings	UMAN, Ukraine (AP) — Prayer chants and the sounding of traditional ram's horns fill the air in the town of Uman, in central Ukraine, as thousands of pilgrims join an annual gathering to mark the Jewish new year, despite the war against Russia. Uman, 200 kilometers (125 miles) south of the Ukrainian capital Kyiv, is transformed for the celebration of Rosh Hashana. The streets are plastered with signs in Hebrew for the pilgrims who come to pray at the tomb of Rabbi Nachman, the great-grandson of the founder of Hasidic movement. Despite Ukrainian and Israeli diplomats warning of the security threat, officials told The Associated Press that 35,000 pilgrims made the journey to Uman this year, the same as in earlier years. Rabbi Moshe Reuven Azman, a leading figure in Ukraine’s Jewish community, was one of those who urged international pilgrims not to visit Ukraine due to security concerns but acknowledged that many would still make the trip regardless of the potential risks involved. 'Every year (since Russia's full-scale invasion), I speak on Israeli television and radio, and I call on the (Jewish) pilgrims not to come to Ukraine. My primary concern is for the lives of people,' he said. As the war in Ukraine rages for a third year, Russian army fires barrages of drones and missiles at Ukraine almost daily, leaving no region completely safe. Active combat is taking place along a 1,000-kilometer (620-mile) front, as Russian forces press their advantage in the eastern Donetsk region. This year alone, the Russian army has managed to capture several thousand square kilometers (miles) of Ukrainian territory, with the capture of the city of Vuhledar being their most recent notable achievement. Nachman Shitrit, 18, who traveled to Uman from Haifa, Israel with his father, said he had made the pilgrimage over a dozen times. 'The war here didn’t scare me from traveling to Ukraine; there’s also war where I came from,' he told the AP. This year’s pilgrimage comes at an increasingly volatile time in the Middle East. Israel is now engaged in a multifront war that includes the battles with Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, attacks from Iran and strikes inside Syria, plus ongoing confrontations with armed militants in the West Bank and occasional attacks launched by Iranian-backed militants in Iraq and by the Houthis in Yemen. The hostilities posed additional challenges to some pilgrims travelling to Ukraine this year. Ukraine closed its air space in February 2022, at the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion, forcing visitors to travel overland via other European countries in order to reach Uman. The United Jewish Community of Ukraine said Wednesday that more than 14,000 pilgrims were unable to travel to Uman, partly as a result of Iran’s attack on Israel Tuesday. Iran fired a barrage of nearly 180 missiles, causing cancellation of multiple flights from Israel in an act Iranian officials called retaliation for Israel’s recent strikes on Hezbollah. Meir Shpanier, 23, who travelled from Tel Aviv, said the difficulty of the journey had made the experience more meaningful to him this year. 'I managed to get here by a miracle. My travel agent booked airplane tickets from Tel Aviv to Budapest. From there, a Ukrainian driver picked me up, and we drove 22 hours to Uman. But some of my friends had to travel through five countries.' 'Because I had to work hard to get here, it means more to me now. I think we’re all blessed to be here,' Shpanier said.	https://apnews.com/article/ukraine-rosh-hashana-uman-pilgrimage-jewish-hasidic-0bfda5004958450de38e90853a5c7fce	2024-10-04T11:18:39-07:00	
12 people have been killed in coordinated attacks in violent Mexican city	MEXICO CITY (AP) — Twelve people were killed in a series of coordinated and near-simultaneous attacks in the violence-wracked city of Salamanca, authorities in the central Mexican state of Guanajuato said Friday. The victims were found Thursday at multiple points across the refinery city of over 200,000. In at least one case, a banner signed by a drug cartel was left with some of the bodies. The massacre is the latest episode in a wave of violence in Salamanca, west of the state’s capital Guanajuato, where gunmen killed four men and wounded two others in an attack at a drug rehabilitation center late Tuesday. Authorities said there are no clear suspects and they continue to investigate. The industrial and agricultural state of Guanajuato has for years been the scene of a bloody turf battle between the Jalisco New Generation Cartel and a local gang, the Santa Rosa de Lima Cartel. Guanajuato has the highest number of homicides of any state in Mexico. Security analyst David Saucedo said that the Jalisco New Generation Cartel has control of urban areas, while Santa Rosa de Lima controls rural ones, but they continue to fight for control of cities like Salamanca. 'There’s been a presence of the National Guard but (the violence) hasn’t stopped,' he said. 'Salamanca has a very complicated situation.' Saucedo said that Salamanca has had three different police directors in the last three years, noting a lack of capability to take on the organized crime groups. Salamanca Mayor César Prieto Gallardo was quoted in the media as saying that city and state authorities are working in a coordinated manner. 'Unfortunately,' he said, 'This is a conflict between delinquent groups. The civil population has nothing to do with this.' ____ Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america	https://apnews.com/article/mexico-guanajuato-killings-cartel-violence-dfafc1b069d0af93bd079ce567ff0cd1	2024-10-04T10:43:20-07:00	
Ubisoft shares jump following reports of Tencent, Guillemot family considering buyout	LOS ANGELES (AP) — Shares of Ubisoft jumped more than 30% Friday, following reports that Tencent and the Guillemot family are considering a buyout of the video game maker. Bloomberg news reported that Tencent and Guillemot family — minority stakeholders in Ubisoft — have been discussing ways to stabilize the company after it lost more than half its market value this year. Shares surged 33.5% to about $15.57 Friday, according to FactSet. Ubisoft declined to comment. Tencent did not immediately respond to a request for comment. France-based Ubisoft is the publisher behind the well-known franchise 'Assassin’s Creed.' Ubisoft’s shares fell last month to their lowest point in more than a decade after its latest title 'Star Wars Outlaws' underperformed and the company announced that it would delay the latest 'Assassin’s Creed' game. Yves Guillemot, Ubisoft’s CEO, said in a statement last week that the company’s 'second quarter performance fell short of our expectations.'	https://apnews.com/article/ubisoft-tencent-guillemot-possible-buyout-64bb35d2a382cdad97ce34f5d70c4d71	2024-10-04T10:24:30-07:00

Drought has dried a major Amazon River tributary to its lowest level in over 122 years	MANAUS, Brazil (AP) — One of the Amazon River’s main tributaries has dropped to its lowest level ever recorded, Brazil’s geological service said Friday, reflecting a severe drought that has devastated the Amazon rainforest and other parts of the country. The level of the Negro River at the port of Manaus was at 12.66 meters on Friday, as compared with a normal level of about 21 meters. It is the lowest since measurements started 122 years ago. The previous record low level was recorded last year, but toward the end of October. The Negro River's water level might drop even more in coming weeks based on forecasts for low rainfall in upstream regions, according to the geological service's predictions. Andre Martinelli, the agency's hydrology manager in Manaus, was quoted as saying the river was expected to continue receding until the end of the month. Water levels in Brazil’s Amazon always rise and fall with its rainy and dry seasons, but the dry portion of this year has been much worse than usual. All of the major rivers in the Amazon basin are at critical levels, including the Madeira River, the Amazon River’s longest tributary. The Negro River drains about 10% of the Amazon basin and is the world’s sixth-largest by water volume. Manaus, the biggest city in the rainforest, is where the Negro joins the Amazon River. For locals, the drought has made basic daily activities impossible. Gracita Barbosa, 28, works as a cashier on a floating shop on the Negro River. She’s out of work because boats that once stopped there can no longer navigate the river due to the low water levels. Barbosa can no longer bathe in the river and now has to travel longer distances to collect drinking water. ___ Sá Pessoa reported from Sao Paulo.	https://apnews.com/article/brazil-amazon-drought-negro-river-rainforest-69d0930a06987973914c5ae24c1c05ff	2024-10-04T08:49:37-07:00	
2 sisters from Egypt were among those killed in Mexican army shooting	TAPACHULA, Mexico (AP) — An 11-year-old Egyptian girl and her 18-year-old sister were among those killed after Mexican army troops opened fire on a truck carrying migrants earlier this week, an official said Friday. The sisters, and four other migrants from countries including Peru and Honduras, were killed on Tuesday in the southern state of Chiapas. An official in the state’s prosecutors office confirmed the identification of the two sisters and said their father was wounded in the shooting, but survived. The official was not authorized to be quoted by name, but a second federal official confirmed that information on the same basis. Federal officials, including newly inaugurated President Claudia Sheinbaum, again refused Friday to confirm the ages or genders of the six migrants killed in the shooting, which occurred on Sheinbaum’s first day in office. The Egyptian embassy in Mexico and the Egyptian foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Soldiers claimed they heard shots and returned fire and officials have studiously avoided saying the migrants were killed by army gunfire. However, that appears to be the case, and two soldiers have been relieved of duty and turned over to civilian prosecutors for questioning. The killings placed in doubt Sheinbaum's statements over her first days in office that human rights will be at the forefront of her administration's policies. Asked about her immigration policy Friday, Sheinbaum said only that the killings were under investigation and doubled down on earlier claims that the government doesn't violate human rights. 'First of all, human rights are respected,' Sheinbaum said. 'That is very important, that is why it is called a humanistic immigration policy, because human rights are at the forefront.' Three of the dead were from Egypt, and one each from Peru and Honduras. The other has apparently not yet been identified. Ten other migrants were wounded in the shooting. but there has not been any information on their conditions. Peru’s foreign ministry confirmed one Peruvian was killed and demanded 'an urgent investigation' into the killings. Peru and Mexico have had damaged relations since a 2022 diplomatic spat. It was the worst killing of migrants by authorities in Mexico since police in the northern state of Tamaulipas killed 17 migrants in 2021. Sheinbaum has said the shootings are being investigated to see if any commanders might face punishment, and noted 'a situation like this cannot be repeated.' But she left out any mention of that Thursday at a ceremony at a Mexico City army base, where army and navy commanders pledged their loyalty to her in front of massed combat vehicles and hundreds of troops. 'In our country, there is not a state of siege, there are no violations of human rights,' Sheinbaum said, as she promised wage increases for soldiers and sailors. The shootings Tuesday occurred near the city of Tapachula, near the border with Guatemala. The Defense Department initially said that soldiers claimed to have heard shots as a convoy of three trucks passed the soldiers’ position. The Attorney General’s Office later said all three trucks ignored orders to stop and tried to flee. The soldiers pursued them and reported coming under fire from the convoy, and returned fire. One of the trucks eventually stopped, the driver reportedly fled, and a total of 33 migrants were found aboard, from the three countries already mentioned, as well as Nepal, Cuba, India and Pakistan. The Defense Department said four of the migrants were found dead, and 12 wounded. Two of the wounded later died of their injuries. Sheinbaum refused to say whether any weapons were found in the migrants’ truck. The area is a common route for smuggling migrants, who are often packed into crowded freight trucks. It has also been the scene of drug cartel turf battles, and the department said the trucks 'were similar to those used by criminal groups in the region.' Irineo Mujica, a migrant rights activist, said he doubted the migrants or their smugglers opened fire. 'It is really impossible that these people would have been shooting at the army,' Mujica said. 'Most of the time, they get through by paying bribes.' If the deaths were the result of army fire, as appears likely, it could prove a major embarrassment for Sheinbaum. The new president has followed the lead of former president Andrés Manuel López Obrador in giving the armed forces extraordinary powers in law enforcement, state-run companies , airports, trains and construction projects. It is not the first time Mexican forces have opened fire on vehicles carrying migrants in the area, which is also the object of cartel turf battles. In 2021, the quasi-military National Guard opened fire on a pickup truck carrying migrants, killing one and wounding four. The Guard officers initially claimed some of those in the migrants’ truck were armed and had fired shots, but the governmental National Human Rights Commission later found that was not true. And in 2021, state police in Tamaulipas killed 17 migrants and two Mexican citizens. Those officers also initially claimed to have come under fire from the migrants’ vehicles. They argued they were responding to shots fired and believed they were chasing the vehicles of one of the country’s drug cartels, which frequently participate in migrant smuggling. But that later turned out to be false, and the police in fact burned the victims’ bodies in an attempt to cover up the crime. Eleven of the policemen were convicted of homicide and sentenced to over 50 years in prison. ____ Associated Press reporter Fabiola Sánchez contributed from Mexico City. ____ Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america	https://apnews.com/article/mexico-soldiers-migrants-killed-egypt-peru-honduras-41131f083f36bb4cbea09fe7bd2aae24	2024-10-04T08:36:35-07:00	
US launches airstrikes by fighter jets and ships on Yemen's Iran-backed Houthi rebels	WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. military struck more than a dozen Houthi targets in Yemen on Friday, going after weapons systems, bases and other equipment belonging to the Iranian-backed rebels, U.S. officials confirmed. Military aircraft and warships bombed Houthi strongholds at roughly five locations, according to the officials. Houthi media said seven strikes hit the airport in Hodeida, a major port city, and the Katheib area, which has a Houthi-controlled military base. Four more strikes hit the Seiyana area in Sanaa, the capital, and two strikes hit the Dhamar province. The Houthi media office also reported three air raids in Bayda province, southeast of Sanaa. The strikes come just days after the Houthis threatened 'escalating military operations' targeting Israel after they apparently shot down a U.S. military drone flying over Yemen. And just last week, the group claimed responsibility for an attack targeting American warships. The rebels fired more than a half dozen ballistic missiles and anti-ship cruise missiles and two drones at three U.S. ships that were traveling through the Bab el-Mandeb Strait, but all were intercepted by the Navy destroyers, according to several U.S. officials. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss details not yet publicly released. Houthis have targeted more than 80 merchant vessels with missiles and drones since the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza started last October. They have seized one vessel and sunk two in the campaign that has also killed four sailors. Other missiles and drones have either been intercepted by a U.S.-led coalition in the Red Sea or failed to reach their targets, which have included Western military vessels. The group has maintained that they target ships linked to Israel, the U.S. or the United Kingdom to force an end to Israel’s campaign against Hamas in Gaza. However, many of the ships attacked have little or no connection to the conflict, including some bound for Iran. ___ AP writer Samy Magdy in Cairo contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/houthis-yemen-us-strikes-weapons-752dd1e5dd6c284a7909878f89c73149	2024-10-04T06:52:24-07:00	
Mexico’s new president promises to resume fight against climate change	MEXICO CITY (AP) — In her first days as Mexico’s new president, Claudia Sheinbaum made a point of distancing herself from the fossil fuel reliance promoted by her predecessor and mentor, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, and vowed to resume an energy transition that he halted. 'We are going to boost renewable energies. The goal is that by 2030, they will have a 45% share (of total electricity production),' she said Tuesday in her first public speech in the capital’s Zocalo square, shortly after being sworn in as the country’s first woman president. Specifics are still scant, but her speech marks a sharp departure from the energy policy of former President López Obrador, a fierce defender of fossil fuels who, among other things, spent more than $20 billion to build a new oil refinery and stopped the auctions that had allowed developers to build solar and wind farms in the country. The president said in the coming days she will unveil an 'ambitious energy transition program' aimed at 'the reduction of greenhouse gases that cause climate change.' Yet Sheinbaum has also promised to strengthen the nation's Federal Electricity Commission, which owns older plants that mainly burn fossil fuels, and state-owned oil company Pemex. Even without specifics, experts and environmentalists said the change in rhetoric was notable. 'The terms ‘sustainability’ or ‘renewable energy’ really never appeared,' in López Obrador’s policies, said Rosanety Barrios, who worked for more than a decade at the Mexican Energy Regulatory Commission. 'He didn't use the term in any speech, in any document. And she has been using it all the time.' During her campaign, Sheinbaum repeatedly promised to promote renewable energy to meet an increasing demand for electricity, due in part to rising temperatures from climate change. In a speech to Congress, also on Tuesday, with López Obrador sitting a few steps from her, the promises seemed more tangible. The goal of reaching 45% clean electricity by 2030 is well above the 24% it represented last year, according to the Ministry of Energy. If achieved, Mexico would be back on track to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement, which seeks to keep the global average temperature to no more than two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. The energy policy promoted by López Obrador led Climate Action Tracker, an organization which evaluates the actions countries take to comply with the Paris Agreement, to downgrade Mexico’s rating to 'critically insufficient.' In her speech to Congress, the president also announced what would be the country’s first ever limit on oil production – 1.8 million barrels per day. All crude oil in Mexico is produced by Pemex, and that amount is approximately what the company produced in 2023 on an average day. It is far less than the 2.6 million barrels per day López Obrador promised at the beginning of his term. Sheinbaum recalled that more than a decade ago, a 2013 energy reform promoted by then President Enrique Peña Nieto proposed production of 3 million barrels per day. 'That is environmentally impossible,' she said. 'It is better to promote efficiency and renewable sources.' At the same time, however, Sheinbaum has vowed to 'strengthen Pemex' and she never criticized the building of the new Dos Bocas refinery, paying several visits to it with López Obrador. Experts said Mexico would not be able to increase oil production using current methods, because its fields are getting tapped out. 'Mexico has ten years of oil left at its current rate of production, which is modest. Mexico is almost out of oil,' said Adrian Fernandez, who holds a PhD in environmental science from Imperial College London and directs the Mexico Climate Initiative, a think tank. But Fernández nevertheless praised Scheinbaum's words 'because it means she is not going to try to increase oil production.' Mexico would have to invest significant money either in hydraulic fracturing, also known as fracking, or deepwater exploration to increase production beyond current levels, he said. Up until now, the country has rejected both of these. Fernández also said Sheinbaum’s speech is 'totally consistent with her experience and knowledge.' The president has a PhD in energy engineering and degrees in physics, and was part of the United Nations panel of experts on climate change that won the Nobel Prize in 2007. This week, Sheinbaum saw firsthand the havoc that climate change is wreaking in Mexico. On Wednesday, on her first trip as the country’s leader, she visited Acapulco, in the southern state of Guerrero, to assess the damage caused by Hurricane John, which struck the coast first as a hurricane and then again as a tropical storm last week. The storm left a trail of devastation while the city was still recovering from last year’s Hurricane Otis. The strengh of both hurricanes was turbocharged by rising ocean temperatures due to global warming. But the big question is whether the new president will be able to achieve her goals within Mexico’s current legal framework. Before leaving office, López Obrador pushed through a constitutional reform that strongly favors the Federal Electricity Commission. On one hand, Sheinbaum has supported that legal change and promised the state will keep control of 54% of electricity generation. On the other, she has committed to reopening private investment in renewable energy, stopped by López Obrador to favor the state-owned CFE. 'From my point of view, the biggest problem Claudia has is legal uncertainty,' Barrios said. — The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

The Latest: Harris to visit Michigan while Trump heads to Georgia	Vice President Kamala Harris will visit the union stronghold of Flint, Michigan, on Friday as she battles with Donald Trump for working-class voters who could tip the scales in this year’s election. Her appearance in the battleground state comes the day after U.S. dockworkers suspended their strike in hopes of reaching a new contract, sparing the country a damaging episode of labor unrest that could have rattled the economy. Meanwhile, Trump is heading to Georgia to appear with Gov. Brian Kemp, the latest sign that he’s patched up his rocky relationship with the top Republican in a key battleground state. Follow the AP’s Election 2024 coverage at: https://apnews.com/hub/election-2024. Here’s the latest: Elon Musk will join Trump at Pennsylvania rally Elon Musk will join Donald Trump at his rally Saturday in Butler, the Pennsylvania city where the Republican presidential nominee survived an assassination attempt earlier this year. 'I will be there to support!' Musk wrote on his social platform X on Thursday in a retweet of Trump’s own promotion of the rally. The SpaceX and Tesla CEO will be among special guests in attendance, Trump’s campaign confirmed Friday. The event will mark the first time the billionaire businessman appears publicly at a campaign event for the former president since endorsing him. Musk has supercharged his support for Trump in recent months and has become personally more invested in politics — even agreeing to lead a government efficiency commission if Trump wins reelection. Saturday’s rally will take place at the same property where a gunman’s bullets grazed Trump’s right ear and killed his supporter, Corey Comperatore. The shooting left multiple others injured. Harris will travel to North Carolina on Saturday as the state recovers from Helene The Democratic presidential nominee has already been to Georgia, where she helped distribute meals and spoke with families in Augusta. More than 200 people died in the powerful storm that spread out across the Southeast, causing devastation. President Joe Biden, too, has traveled to areas hard-hit by the storm. From Georgia, Harris said she and Biden have been paying attention 'from the beginning to what we need to do to make sure the federal resources hit the ground as quickly as possible, and that includes what was necessary to make sure that we provided direct federal assistance. And that work has been happening.' Their travel comes as Republican Donald Trump is falsely claiming the federal government wasn't doing enough to help affected people in Republican areas. Biden was angered by the suggestion, calling it a lie. He said partisan politics should not be part of this conversation. Obama will campaign for Harris in key swing states Former President Barack Obama is planning to hit key swing states to boost Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign for the White House, starting on Thursday in Pittsburgh. The Harris campaign says Obama will travel around the country over the final 27 days ahead of the election. It noted that the former president and Harris have a friendship that goes back 20 years, from when they first met while he was running for Senate. Harris was also an early supporter of Obama’s 2008 presidential bid and knocked on doors for him in Iowa ahead of its caucus that led off voting in the Democratic primary. In his speech at the Democratic convention in August, Obama said Harris 'wasn’t born into privilege. She had to work for what she’s got.' 'And she actually cares about what other people are going through,' the former president added then.	https://apnews.com/article/harris-trump-vance-walz-election-cdf0cac197011d8a6e67fc339638f553	2024-10-04T05:15:08-07:00	
This week's gang attack on a Haitian town killed more than 50 people, activist says	PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) — The tally of victims killed in this week's brutal attack on a small town in central Haiti by heavily armed gang members has risen to more than 50, a human rights activist said Friday. Bodies lay strewn on the streets of Port-Sondé following Thursday’s attack in the Artibonite region, many of them killed by a shot to the head, Bertide Harace, spokeswoman for the Commission for Dialogue, Reconciliation and Awareness to Save the Artibonite, told Magik 9 radio station. Initial estimates were that about 20 people were killed, but activists and government officials have been gradually accessing areas of the town and discovering more bodies. Among the victims is a young mother, her newborn baby and a midwife, Herace said. The attack is blamed on the Gran Grif gang, which operates in the Artibonite region and is considered one of Haiti’s cruelest gangs. The motive remains unclear for what was one of the biggest massacres in the central region in recent years. Attacks of that kind have taken place in the capital of Port-au-Prince, 80% of which is controlled by gangs, and they typically are linked to turf wars, with gang members targeting civilians in areas controlled by rivals. But Port-Sondé is considered part of Gran Grif's own territory. The gang was created after former Haitian legislator Prophane Victor began arming young men in the area to secure his election and control over the Artibonite region nearly a decade ago, according to a U.N. report. Both Victor and the leader of Gran Grif, Luckson Elan, were sanctioned by the U.S. last month. The gang attacked Port-Sondé before dawn on Thursday and encountered little resistance, Herace said, though she said that contrary to some reports, police officers did try to repel the gang. 'The gang had total control of the area,' Herace said. Haiti’s government has deployed an elite police unit based in the capital of Port-au-Prince to Port-Sondé following the attack and sent medical supplies to help the area’s lone hospital overwhelmed by dozens of people injured. 'This heinous crime, perpetrated against defenseless women, men, and children, is not only an attack on these victims, but on the entire Haitian nation,' Prime Minister Garry Conille said in a statement Friday. Gang violence across Artibonite, which produces much of Haiti’s food, has increased in recent years. In January 2023, the Gran Grif gang was accused of attacking a police station in Liancourt, located near Pont-Sondé, and killing at least six officers. Violence unleashed by the gang also forced the closure of a hospital in February 2023 that serves more than 700,000 people.	https://apnews.com/article/haiti-gang-attack-port-sonde-saint-marc-massacre-da09975e15278b9a507e85c8ba731f55	2024-10-04T05:09:15-07:00	
Relatives say a whole family was killed in Israel's deadliest West Bank strike since Oct. 7	TULKAREM, West Bank (AP) — An Israeli airstrike on a West Bank cafe that the military said targeted Palestinian militants also killed a family of four, including two young children, relatives told The Associated Press on Friday. The strike slammed into a three-story building in the Tulkarem refugee camp late Thursday, setting it on fire, destroying a popular cafe and killing at least 18 Palestinians, according to the territory's Health Ministry. It was the deadliest strike in the West Bank since the start of the Israel-Hamas war nearly a year ago. On Friday, paramedics searched the rubble inside the blasted-out coffee shop, gathering human remains into small boxes. Young boys and men walked among the ruins of the shop, with holes in the ceiling and debris blanketing the ground, digging past bloodstained furniture and dislodged iron beams for anything to salvage. Among the dead was the Abu Zahra family: Muhammad, a bakery worker; his wife, Saja; and their two children, Sham, 8, and Karam, 6, according to the man's brother, Mustafa Abu Zahra, who said the family lived above the coffee shop. He added that one of Muhammad’s brothers-in-law was also in the apartment at the time and was killed. The Israeli military said the strike killed several militants, including Hamas’ leader in the camp, who it accused of planning and taking part in multiple attacks against Israeli civilians. Tulkarem, known to be a hotbed of Palestinian militancy, is a flashpoint in the West Bank and a frequent target of Israeli military raids. Hamas, which did not immediately claim any of the dead as its fighters, condemned the strike and called for Palestinians in Tulkarem to rise up. Israel has carried out several large-scale raids in the West Bank since the start of the war in Gaza, ignited by Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on southern Israel. While airstrikes used to be rare in the Palestinian territory, they have grown more common since the outbreak of war as Israeli forces clamp down, saying they aim to prevent attacks on their citizens. Israeli fire has killed at least 722 Palestinians in the West Bank since Oct. 7, Palestinian health officials say. In that time, Palestinian militants have launched a number of attacks on soldiers at checkpoints and within Israel. A shooting attack in Tel Aviv earlier this week that Israeli police said was carried out by Palestinians from the West Bank left at least six people dead. Nimer Fayat, the owner of Dr. Coffee, said the cafe was full with 'regular customers coming to eat and drink' when the strike occurred around 10:15 p.m. 'What happened was a very strong blow, the likes of which we had not seen in the past since the Al-Aqsa Intifada,' he said, using a Palestinian term for the second intifada, or uprising, in the early 2000s. Paramedics rushing to the area encountered a ghastly scene, with body parts flung onto power lines by the force of the blast, said Nebal Farsakh, a spokesperson for the Palestinian Red Crescent, whose teams brought nine dead to the hospital. A full list of the dead and wounded was not immediately released by the Palestinian Health Ministry. Yasser Jibra, another relative of the Abu Zahras, said the strike was 'like a lightning bolt.' 'Look around, the destruction is so obvious,' he said, adding that it was difficult to identify the bodies of his loved ones. The Israeli military did not immediately respond to a request for comment on civilian deaths in the strike. Israel says it takes care to guard against such deaths. But to Jibra, that means little. 'This is the work of the criminal occupation, which does not take into account the presence of a child or a woman, or an elderly or young person,' he said, as he stood inside the blasted-out cafe. 'Everything is permissible for them.' ___ Associated Press reporter Julia Frankel and producer Ibrahim Hazboun contributed to this report from Jerusalem.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-west-bank-strike-tulkarem-militants-1656f77bb28acdfb3d72ec5fccd628e9	2024-10-04T03:12:22-07:00	
Technical problem at German air traffic control causes delays and some cancellations	BERLIN (AP) — A technical problem at Germany's air traffic control agency caused disruptions on Friday, with some flights canceled at Frankfurt Airport, the country's biggest. The air traffic control company DFS said the problem that arose Friday morning affected flight plans and weather data. It was resolved by 10:30 a.m. but caused delays of varying severity across the country. Frankfurt Airport warned on its website that flight delays and cancellations could be expected throughout the day. Operator Fraport said about 70 flights were canceled but didn't expect many more because the data problem had been resolved, German news agency dpa reported. The country's biggest airline, Lufthansa, said there were a few cancellations and delays but long-haul services weren't affected.	https://apnews.com/article/germany-air-traffic-control-disruption-95725d9a827f3a8d86fb68754dfe4f3d	2024-10-04T03:06:31-07:00	
Two London police officers reinstated over stop and search of Black athletes	LONDON (AP) — Two former London police officers have been handed their jobs back and will receive back pay after winning an appeal Friday against a ruling that said they had lied about smelling cannabis during a stop and search of two Black athletes. The Police Appeals Tribunal overturned the conclusion by a disciplinary panel a year ago that the two former Metropolitan Police officers — Jonathan Clapham and Sam Franks — had lied. That conclusion was 'irrational' and 'inconsistent,' the appeals tribunal said. The two athletes, British sprinter Bianca Williams and her Portuguese partner Ricardo Dos Santos, told the police watchdog that they were racially profiled by a group of police officers on July 4, 2020. The couple were driving home in London with their 3-month-old son in the back seat when police followed their car and pulled them over outside their home. The athletes were handcuffed and searched on suspicion of having drugs and weapons but nothing was found. The appeals tribunal's chairman Damien Moore said Clapham and Franks were 'dedicated, hard-working and much respected officers' whose reputations had been 'ruined' by the original findings. 'Both officers did not lie,' Moore said. 'Both officers will now be reinstated to the Met Police. They should receive back pay.' Williams had filmed the original incident and the video was widely shared online. It shows her visibly distressed about being separated from her baby. The Met, which is the U.K.'s biggest police force, came under heavy criticism after the footage was aired. After the appeal decision, Dos Santos released a statement expressing his disappointment and said he and Williams will challenge the outcome in civil courts. 'Our drive home from training in 2020, with our baby, should never have turned into a violent incident where we were wrongly accused of smelling of drugs,' he said. 'We are professional athletes, we pride ourselves on not doing drugs,' he added. 'The actions and allegations of the officers were completely unacceptable.' The Metropolitan Police Federation, which represents police officers, said Friday's ruling represented 'yet another damning indictment' of the Independent Office for Police Conduct, which first assessed the incident. 'Justice has been served,' said Rick Prior, the group's chairman. 'Why it ever got to this point however remains an absolute mystery.'	https://apnews.com/article/london-metropolitan-police-officers-dismissed-racism-reinstated-3eb6722a3a6b9a4d73dd85904f4b77ec	2024-10-04T02:42:11-07:00	
Clashes in Kenya as people discuss the deputy president's impeachment motion	NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) — Supporters and opponents of Kenya's deputy president clashed Friday at public forums over an impeachment motion against him, which was introduced in parliament by the ruling alliance this week. Rigathi Gachagua is accused of supporting anti-government protests in June and of being involved in corruption and other irregularities, charges he denies. A motion for the impeachment of Gachagua was proposed in parliament on Tuesday and Kenyans were given until Friday to fill out public participation forms at their constituencies. Public forums are being held across the country to discuss the impeachment. In the capital, Nairobi, a public forum at the Bomas of Kenya turned violent as supporters of President William Ruto clashed with those supporting Gachagua. Chairs were thrown in the auditorium and an activist Morara Kebaso, known for exposing stalled government projects, said he had been injured. In central Kenya’s Nyeri county, police clashed with supporters of the deputy president as they chanted that there would be no president if his deputy is impeached. The two were elected on a joint ticket. In Nyandarua county, opponents were called out as being traitors and were chased out of the community hall. Some 291 legislators, more than the 117 constitutional requirement, signed the impeachment motion before it was introduced, but a number of them from the deputy president’s home tuff say they no longer support the motion after hearing contrary views from their constituents. 'If the deputy president is guilty, then his boss the president is equally guilty,' a woman supporter told Citizen TV. Gachagua is facing impeachment on 10 grounds that include corruption, ethnic discrimination and contradicting government policies. He has maintained that he is innocent and has vowed to fight the impeachment motion. The high court on Thursday declined to stop Friday’s public participation and set next Wednesday as the date for the hearing. President Ruto has not weighed into his deputy’s impeachment debate. He is on record in the earlier days of his presidency saying he would not publicly humiliate his deputy, alluding to the troubled relationship he had with his predecessor Uhuru Kenyatta during their second term in office. The senate is expected to hear the impeachment motion on Tuesday next week.	https://apnews.com/article/kenya-deputy-president-impeachment-ff1e3f2172b0e8b3b3753b68ca57893c	2024-10-04T02:21:58-07:00	
Iranian supreme leader praises missile attack on Israel, saying Iran will do it again if necessary	TEHRAN, Iran (AP) — Iran’s supreme leader on Friday praised the country’s recent missile strike on Israel and said it was ready to do it again if necessary, state TV reported. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, in his first appearance as leader at Friday prayers in about five years, called the missile strike a 'shining' job by Iran's armed forces. On Tuesday, Iran launched at least 180 missiles at Israel, the latest in a series of rapidly escalating attacks between Israel and Iran and its allies that threaten to push the Middle East closer to a regionwide war. Israel said it intercepted many of the missiles, and officials in Washington said U.S. destroyers assisted in Israel’s defense. Iran said most of its missiles hit their targets. There were no immediate reports of casualties. Khamenei, 85, said in a 40-minute speech to thousands of people at the Mosalla mosque, the main prayer site in Tehran, that the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel nearly a year ago on Oct. 7, 2023, was a legitimate action by the Palestinian people. He said Tuesday's missile barrage was based on international law, the country’s law and Islamic beliefs. He urged nations from 'Afghanistan to Yemen and from Iran to Gaza and Yemen' to be ready to take action against the enemy, and praised those who had died doing so. 'Our resisting people in Lebanon and Palestine, you brave fighters, you loyal and patient people, these martyrdoms and the blood that was shed shouldn’t shake your determination but make you more persistent,' he said. Khamenei gave half of the speech in Arabic as he addressed his comments to Arab nations. His last appearance at Friday prayers was after the death of Revolutionary Guard Gen. Qassem Soleimani, who was killed in 2020 in a U.S. drone strike in Baghdad. A ceremony commemorating the death of Lebanese Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah was held before Khamenei’s speech. Most high-ranking Iranian officials, including President Masoud Pezeshkian and top Revolutionary Guard generals, attended the ceremony. Iran is Hezbollah’s main backer and has sent weapons and billions of dollars to the group. Also on Friday, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi arrived in the Lebanese capital, Beirut, where he was expected to discuss ongoing fighting between Israel and Hezbollah with Lebanese officials. Foreign Ministry spokesperson Esmail Baghaei said Iran sent a shipment of aid to Lebanon, including 10 tons of food and medicine.	https://apnews.com/article/iran-israel-missile-strike-khamenei-2bce5479abfdac5fd953d5547d04941c	2024-10-04T01:42:26-07:00	
Malaysian billionaire hotelier charged in Singapore in relation to ex-minister's wrongdoings	KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) — A Malaysian billionaire hotelier who brought Formula One to Singapore was charged Friday for allegedly obstructing justice and abetting wrongdoings by a former Cabinet minister who was imprisoned a day earlier in a rare graft case. The two charges against Ong Beng Seng came just a day after f ormer Transport Minister S. Iswaran was sentenced to a year in prison, making him the first minister to be jailed in Singapore in nearly half a century. Iswaran, 62, pleaded guilty last week to a count of obstructing justice and four of accepting illegal gifts such as F1 tickets, wine and whisky from Ong and another businessman Lum Kok Seng. The commencement of Iswaran's sentence has been delayed to Monday. It is unclear if he will appeal the sentence. Ong, 78, is accused of helping Iswaran obtain two flights and accommodation in Doha in December 2022, and abetting Iswaran in obstructing the course of justice, the Attorney-General Chambers said in a statement. According to the charge sheet, Iswaran was at the time chairman of the F1 Steering Committee and was aware the paid-for trip was linked to an agreement for the race between Ong's Singapore GP and the Singapore Tourism Board. The charges against Ong corresponded to two of the charges to which Iswaran pleaded guilty to on Sept 24, the statement said. The prosecution will not be charging the other businessman, Lum, it added. 'In arriving at the decision, the prosecution considered all the relevant facts and circumstances of the case, including the role that Lum played in each of the transactions,' an AGC spokesman said in reply to queries on why Lum was let off. He didn't elaborate. Ong did not indicate how he would plead to the charges. Channal News Asia reported. His bail has been extended, and the case has been adjourned till next month. Ong, a Malaysian businessman based in Singapore, is the managing director of Hotel Properties Limited which owns 38 hotels and resorts in 17 countries. He is known for bringing Formula 1 to Singapore in 2008, and holds the right to the Grand Prix night race in the city-state. Shares of HPL, which owns brands such as Four Seasons Hotels, Intercontinental Hotels and Marriott International, were halted early Friday ahead of the court proceedings. Singapore ’s ministers are among the world’s best paid, and the case has embarrassed the ruling People’s Action Party, which prides itself on clean governance. The last Cabinet minister charged with graft was Wee Toon Boon, who was found guilty in 1975 and jailed for accepting gifts in exchange for helping a businessperson. Another Cabinet minister was investigated for graft in 1986, but died before charges were filed. Prime Minister Lawrence Wong said he was saddened as Iswaran had made significant contributions in his government roles but his 'past contributions do not right this wrong.' 'Those entrusted with public service must uphold the highest standards of integrity and their conduct must be beyond reproach. This is absolutely vital and non-negotiable,,' Wong said in a statement.	https://apnews.com/article/singapore-malaysia-businessman-minister-corruption-441bd273ef4cc1816e0fc3ff07538cc5	2024-10-04T01:22:23-07:00	
Landmark ruling from EU's top court says some FIFA rules on transfers are contrary to the bloc's law	The European Union's top court said Friday that some FIFA rules on player transfers are contrary to European Union legislation relating to competition and freedom of movement, in a ruling that will likely lead to a shakeup of the soccer market's regulations and could change the sport's economy. The European Court of Justice's ruling came after former France international Lassana Diarra legally challenged FIFA rules following a dispute with a club dating back to a decade ago. Diarra argued that FIFA's restrictions meant he was unable to find a new club after his contract with Russian club Lokomotiv Moscow was terminated in 2014. FIFA's rules state that if a player terminates his contract without 'just cause,' the player and any club wishing to sign him are jointly liable for paying compensation to the previous club. 'Those rules hinder the free movement of players and competition between clubs,' the court said in a statement. 'The rules in question are such as to impede the free movement of professional footballers wishing to develop their activity by going to work for a new club.' The ruling is seen as crucial because it could make it easier for players to terminate their contracts and join another team – potentially leading to a scenario where bigger clubs could more easily poach players from smaller rivals. The global players’ union FIFPro, which had supported Diarra's case, said the ruling 'will change the landscape of professional football.' However, it could take a couple of years before any changes to the system go into effect as Friday’s ruling is part of a Belgian court case that is still ongoing. And although the ruling was seen as a defeat for FIFA, the court recognized that the current transfer regulations can also be necessary to help maintain a form of stability within professional squads and guarantee the regularity of competitions. FIFA said it would 'analyze the decision in coordination with other stakeholders before commenting further.' Diarra's decade-long fight Diarra's lawyers called the ruling a 'total victory' after a long-running legal battle. Diarra had signed a four-year contract with Lokomotiv Moscow in 2013 but the deal was terminated a year later after Diarra was unhappy with alleged pay cuts. Lokomotiv Moscow applied to the FIFA dispute resolution chamber for compensation and the player submitted a counterclaim seeking compensation for unpaid wages. The Court of Arbitration for Sport ruled in favor of the Russian club and the player was ordered to pay 10.5 million euros ($11.2 million). Diarra claimed his search for a new club was hampered by FIFA's rules stipulating that any new side would be jointly responsible with him for paying compensation to Lokomotiv. The former Real Madrid player also argued that a potential deal with Belgian club Charleroi fell through because of the FIFA rules, and sued FIFA and the Belgian federation at a Belgian court for damages and loss of earnings of six million euros ($7 million). With the lawsuit still going through Belgian courts, the case was referred to the European Court of Justice for guidance. In Friday's ruling, the court added that current rules 'impose considerable legal risks, unforeseeable and potentially very high financial risks as well as major sporting risks on those players and clubs wishing to employ them which, taken together, are such as to impede international transfers of those players.' A significant impact? It was not immediately clear what impact the ruling will have on players and leagues more broadly, but some analysts have compared it to the ECJ’s 1995 decision on Belgian footballer Jean-Marc Bosman. That ruling removed restrictions placed on foreign EU players within national leagues and allowed players in the bloc to move to another club for free when their contracts ended. That ruling ultimately skewed the player trading market in favor of wealthier clubs in western Europe who could lure free agents with big salaries and avoided paying transfer fees that many smaller clubs relied on. If FIFA introduces rules making it easier for player to terminate their contracts and join new clubs when they want, the whole system of transfers largely based on transfer fees could be challenged, with clubs less tempted to invest millions in players with more freedom to leave. But it could also give more power to the richest clubs capable of luring players with gigantic salary offers. 'All professional players have been affected by these illegal rules and can therefore now seek compensation for their losses,' Diarra's lawyers claimed in a statement. FIFA willing to discuss adjustments The Diarra case went through FIFA judicial bodies before the 2016 election of FIFA president Gianni Infantino, who has made it a priority to modernize transfer market rules. During the progress of the Diarra case, FIFA indicated it is open to a wide-ranging consultation with unions, clubs and leagues to address the courts’ opinions. FIFA said the ruling 'only puts in question two paragraphs of two articles of the FIFA Regulations on the Status and Transfer of Players, which the national court is now invited to consider.' Concerning competition rules, the court slammed FIFA's rulings for restricting and preventing cross-border competition between European clubs. 'The Court recalls that the possibility of competing by recruiting trained players plays an essential role in the professional football sector and that rules which place a general restriction on that form of competition, by immutably fixing the distribution of workers between the employers and in cloistering the markets, are similar to a no-poach agreement,' it said. ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer ___ Graham Dunbar in Geneva and Lorne Cook in Brussels contributed.	https://apnews.com/article/fifa-diarra-case-transfers-contracts-eu-50fcc2d3c8bbafb31ac80503646a04ef	2024-10-03T23:47:33-07:00	
Rainstorms and heavy floods hit large parts of Bosnia, killing at least 14 people	KISELJAK, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) — A severe rainstorm struck Bosnia overnight Friday, killing at least 14 people in floods and landslides in several towns and villages in central and southern parts of the country. Rescue services in the south of the country reported several people missing and called on volunteers and the army to assist as roads were closed and houses left without electricity. Darko Juka, a spokesman for the local administration, said at least 14 people had died in and around the southern town of Jablanica. 'Those are the ones who have been discovered by rescuers,' he said. 'We still don't know the final death toll.' 'I don't remember such a crisis since the war,' Juka said referring to the 1992-95 war in Bosnia that left the country in ruins. 'The scale of this chaotic situation is harrowing.' Defense Minister Zukan Helez told N1 regional television that troops have been engaged to help and that the casualties were reported. Helez said that 'hour after hour we are receiving news about new victims … We sent everyone we could. Our first priority is to save the people who are alive and buried in houses where the landslides are.' A pregnant woman lost her baby after she was rescued from the floods and transferred to a hospital in the regional center of Mostar. Authorities said doctors were fighting for her life as well. Separately, a child was successfully rescued and hospitalized, local officials said. Rescue services in the towns of Jablanica and Kiseljak said the power was off overnight and mobile phones lost their signal. The Jablanica fire station said that the town was completely inaccessible because roads and trainlines were closed. 'The police informed us that the railroad is also blocked,' the state rescue service said in a statement. 'You can’t get in or out of Jablanica at the moment. Landline phones are working, but mobile phones have no signal.' It urged people not to venture out on the flooded streets. Human-caused climate change increases the intensity of rainfall because warm air holds more moisture. This summer, the Balkans were also hit by long-lasting record temperatures, causing a drought. Scientists said the dried-out land has hampered the absorption of floodwaters. Drone footage broadcast on Bosnian media showed villages and towns completely submerged under water, while videos on social networks showed dramatic scenes of muddy torrents and damaged roads. Photos show that one of the busiest roads linking Sarajevo with the Adriatic coast via Jablanica was swept into a river together with a railway line in a huge landslide. 'Many people are endangered because of big waters and landslides. There is information about victims and many injured and missing persons,' said the civic protection service. Authorities urged people to stay on upper floors. Reports said surging waters swept away domestic animals and cars as the water swiftly filled up the lower floors of buildings. The heavy rains and strong winds were also reported in neighboring Croatia where several roads were closed and the capital of Zagreb prepared for the swollen Sava River to burst its banks. Heavy winds have hampered traffic along the southern coast of the Adriatic, and flash floods caused by heavy rain threatened several towns and villages in Croatia. Floods caused by torrential rains were also reported in Montenegro, south of Bosnia, where some villages were cut off and roads and homes flooded. —- AP writers Dusan Stojanovic and Jovana Gec contributed from Belgrade, Serbia.	https://apnews.com/article/floods-bosnia-rainstorm-rescue-croatia-5c50ea065f9fbbef8307d500ddd3fbb3	2024-10-03T23:29:10-07:00	
The Nobel Prizes will be announced against a backdrop of wars, famine and artificial intelligence	STAVANGER, Norway (AP) — Wars, a refugee crisis, famine and artificial intelligence could all be recognized when Nobel Prize announcements begin next week under a shroud of violence. The prize week coincides with the Oct. 7 anniversary of the Hamas-led attacks on Israel, which began a year of bloodshed and war across the Middle East. The literature and science prizes could be immune. But the Peace Prize, which recognizes efforts to end conflict, will be awarded in an atmosphere of ratcheting international violence — if awarded at all. 'I look at the world and see so much conflict, hostility and confrontation, I wonder if this is the year the Nobel Peace Prize should be withheld,' said Dan Smith, director of the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. As well as events roiling the Middle East, Smith cites the war in Sudan and risk of famine there, the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, and his institute's research showing that global military spending is increasing at its fastest pace since World War II. 'It could go to some groups which are making heroic efforts but are marginalized,' Smith said. 'But the trend is in the wrong direction. Perhaps it would be right to draw attention to that by withholding the peace prize this year.' Withholding the Nobel Peace is not new. It has been suspended 19 times in the past, including during the world wars. The last time it was not awarded was in 1972. However, Henrik Urdal, director of the Peace Research Institute Oslo, says withdrawal would be a mistake in 2024, saying the prize is 'arguably more important as a way to promote and recognize important work for peace.' Civil grassroot groups, and international organizations with missions to mitigate violence in the Middle East could be recognized. Nominees are kept secret for 50 years, but qualified nominators often publicize their picks. Academics at the Free University Amsterdam said they have nominated the Middle East-based organizations EcoPeace, Women Wage Peace and Women of the Sun for peace efforts between Israelis and Palestinians. Urdal believes it's possible the committee could consider the Sudan Emergency Response Rooms, a group of grassroots initiatives providing aid to stricken Sudanese facing famine and buffeted by the country’s brutal civil war. The announcements begin Monday with the physiology or medicine prize, followed on subsequent days by the physics, chemistry, literature and peace awards. The Peace Prize announcement will be made on Friday by the Norwegian Nobel Committee in Oslo, while all the others will be announced by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in Stockholm. The prize in economics will be announced the following week on Oct. 14. New technology, possibly artificial intelligence, could be recognized in one or more of the categories. Critics of AI warn the rise of autonomous weapons shows the new technology could mean additional peace-shattering misery for many people. Yet AI has also enabled scientific breakthroughs which are tipped for recognition in other categories. David Pendlebury, head of research analysis at Clarivate’s Institute for Scientific Information, says scientists from Google Deepmind, the AI lab, could be among those under consideration for the chemistry prize. The company’s artificial intelligence, AlphaFold 'accurately predicts the structure of proteins,' and is already widely used in several fields, including medicine, where it could one day be used to develop a breakthrough drug. Pendlebury spearheads Clarivate’s list of scientists whose papers are among the world’s most cited, and whose work it says are ripe for Nobel recognition. 'AI will increasingly be a part of the panoply of tools that researchers use,' Pendlebury said. He said he would be extremely surprised if a discovery 'firmly anchored in AI' did not win Nobel prizes in the next 10 years.	https://apnews.com/article/norway-nobel-prizes-peace-wars-c72eac3761a1169356b5c8d32dbe177e	2024-10-03T22:40:50-07:00	
Middle East latest: An Israeli airstrike cuts a major highway linking Lebanon with Syria	An Israeli airstrike has cut off a main highway linking Lebanon with Syria, leaving two huge craters on either side of the road. The airstrike Friday rendered the road unusable for cars, leaving people to go on foot to the Masnaa Border Crossing where tens of thousands of people fleeing war in Lebanon have crossed into Syria over the past two weeks. On Tuesday, Israel began a ground incursion into Lebanon against the Hezbollah militant group while also conducting strikes in Gaza. The Israeli military said nine soldiers have died in the conflict in southern Lebanon. Israel and Hezbollah have traded fire across the Lebanon border almost daily since the day after Hamas’ cross-border attack on Oct. 7, 2023, which killed 1,200 Israelis and took 250 others hostage. Israel declared war on the Hamas militant group in the Gaza Strip in response. More than 41,000 Palestinians have been killed in the territory, and just over half the dead have been women and children, according to local health officials. Nearly 2,000 people have been killed in Lebanon since then, most of them since Sept. 23, according to the Lebanese Health Ministry. ___ Here is the latest: Dutch military plane lands in Beirut to pick up civilians fleeing Lebanon THE HAGUE, Netherlands — A Dutch military transport plane landed in Beirut early Friday afternoon to pick up citizens of the Netherlands fleeing Lebanon amid fighting between Israel and the Hezbollah militant group. Scores of people are expected to board the A330 plane in what the Dutch foreign ministry called a repatriation flight. The defense ministry says that if there were spare seats on the plane, it could also take citizens of other countries out of Beirut. Meanwhile Japan's foreign ministry announced that 11 Japanese and 4 French nationals were evacuated from Lebanon and arrived in Jordan Friday. Israel launched a ground incursion into Lebanon on Tuesday and its forces have been clashing with Hezbollah militants in a narrow strip along the border. Israeli jets also have been carrying out airstrikes in Lebanon, including one Friday that cut off a main highway linking Lebanon with Syria. War in Gaza leaves scores of children under the sole care of grandparents KHAN YOUNIS, the Gaza Strip— Almost a year of war in Gaza has left thousands of children either orphaned or separated from their parents, leaving their grandparents with the task of raising them on their own. Amir Ashour, 12, and his sister Fatima Ashour, 10, lost their parents and their 5-year-old brother Gheith when their house in Rafah was struck by the Israeli military in December 2023. They are now being taken care of by their Atta Ashour, their grandfather from their mother’s side. Sitting inside a tent, Fatima told The Associated Press she misses her parents and brother. 'My mother would comb my hair, dress me, and give me everything, and when I came back from school, she would help with schoolwork,' she said. The war also left four orphans in the care of their 52-year-old grandmother Najah al-Eish, who is concerned that she will not live for long to take care of them. 'No matter how much I care for them and raise them, I might not always stay with them,' she said. UNICEF estimates that 19,000 children are either unaccompanied, separated from family, or orphaned. The U.N. agency doesn’t have the exact number of orphans across the enclave. Iran warns of harsh retaliation if Israel carries out an attack on Iran BEIRUT - Iran’s foreign minister warned Israel on Friday that if it carries out an attack on Iran, Tehran will retaliate in a harsh way. Abbas Araghchi was in Beirut for meetings with Lebanese officials. His visit came three days after Iran launched at least 180 missiles into Israel, the latest in a series of rapidly escalating attacks that threaten to push the Middle East closer to a regionwide war. 'If the Israeli entity takes any step or measure against us, our retaliation will be stronger than the previous one,' Araghchi said after meeting Lebanon’s Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri. Israel says it struck an underground tunnel between Lebanon and Syria JERUSALEM — Israel’s military said Friday its fighter jets struck an underground tunnel between Lebanon and Syria and areas around a key border crossing used by many in recent days fleeing Israel’s offensive. Thursday’s strikes around the Masnaa Border Crossing effectively cut off the main highway linking Lebanon with Syria, Lebanon’s state-run National News Agency reported. Tens of thousands of people fleeing fighting in Lebanon have used crossing into Syria over the past two weeks. The military said that its fighter jets had struck the 3.5 kilometer-long (2.17 miles) underground tunnel between Lebanon and Syria because Hezbollah has used it to smuggle weapons from Iran and other proxies into the country. It said it struck the sites around the Masnaa border crossing because they were being used as militant infrastructure. There are half a dozen border crossings between the two countries, most of which are still open. Hezbollah is believed to have received much of its weapons from Iran via Syria. UN refugee agency says main Lebanon-Syria border closed to vehicles GENEVA — The U.N. refugee agency says Israeli airstrikes overnight near the main border crossing where people have been fleeing from Lebanon into Syria has 'put a halt on traffic' and closed the route to vehicles. UNHCR spokeswoman Rula Amin said the border crossing between Masnaa, Lebanon, and Jdaidit Yabws in Syria has been the main thoroughfare between the two countries, even though three other border crossings remain open. Amin, a spokeswoman for UNHCR’s Middle East and North Africa operations, also noted government figures that up to 1 million people have fled to places across Lebanon, and more than 185,000 have gone to Syria. Speaking from Amman, Jordan, to reporters in Geneva on Friday, Amin said most of the nearly 900 government-established collective shelters in Lebanon were full, forcing many people to sleep in the open air -- including along Beirut’s famed seaside Corniche. She said 60% of people who have crossed from Lebanon to Syria were children or adolescents, some of whom arrived alone. Israeli military says it killed Hezbollah communications chief JERUSALEM — The Israeli military said Friday that a strike in Beirut the day before killed Mohammed Rashid Skafi, the head of Hezbollah’s communications division. The military said in a statement that Skafi was 'a senior Hezbollah terrorist who was responsible for the communications unit since 2000' and was 'closely affiliated' with high-up Hezbollah officials. Hundreds of Americans leave Lebanon on US contract flights WASHINGTON — The U.S. State Department says some 350 American citizens, green card holders and family members have now left Lebanon on US-organized contract flights this week. The department announced the new number — up by about 100 since Thursday — after another flight from Beirut landed early Friday in Frankfurt, Germany. The flight had the capacity to carry 300 passengers but only 97 people were aboard, it said. State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said Thursday that the U.S. would continue to organize such flights as long as the security situation in Lebanon is dire and as long as there is demand. More than 6,000 American citizens have contacted the U.S. embassy in Beirut seeking information about departing the country over the past week since the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah has escalated. Miller said the department understood that some Americans, many of them dual U.S.-Lebanese nationals and long-time residents of the country, may choose to stay. Iran's leader praises missile strike on Israel in a speech at Friday prayers TEHRAN, Iran — Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei praised the country’s recent missile strike on Israel, state TV reported Friday. Khamenei was leading Friday prayers and was to deliver a rare public sermon in the Iranian capital, Tehran, that was being watched for signs of what Iran might plan next. In a 40-minute speech, he praised Tuesday's missile barrage against Israel as a shining job by Iranian armed forces. 'It will be done in the future again if it becomes necessary,' he said. There was a commemoration ceremony for the late Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah beforehand. Most high-ranking Iranian officials, including President Masoud Pezeshkian and the Revolutionary Guard’s top generals, attended the ceremony. Iran is Hezbollah’s main backer and has sent weapons and billions of dollars to the group over the years. Also on Friday, Iran’s foreign minister Abbas Araghchi arrived in Beirut, where he was expected to discuss the ongoing war between Israel and Hezbollah with Lebanese officials. Spokesperson Esmail Baghaei said Iran sent its first shipment of aid to Lebanon, including 10 tons of food and medicine. Japan prepares to evacuate citizens from Lebanon, urging nationals in Iran to leave, too TOKYO — As Japan prepared to evacuate its citizens from Lebanon, the government also urged those in Iran to leave as soon as possible, while commercial flights are still operating. Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya told reporters Friday that Japan’s embassy in Iran renewed its safety advisory to Japanese nationals this week after Iran fired missiles into Israel. On Thursday, the Japanese Defense Ministry dispatched two C-2 transport aircraft to Jordan to stand by for an evacuation of about 50 Japanese nationals from Lebanon. Iwaya said the government has not decided whether to also dispatch defense aircraft to Iran, where about 440 Japanese citizens are based, but 'we will do our utmost so that we can respond to any contingency in order to protect the safety of Japanese citizens.' Iran’s foreign minister is in Beirut to meet with Lebanese officials BEIRUT — Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi arrived in Beirut where he will discuss with Lebanese officials the ongoing war between Israel and Hezbollah. Iran is the main backer of Hezbollah and has sent weapons and billions of dollars to the group over the years. The Iranian official arrived in Lebanon as Israel launched new airstrikes on different parts of Lebanon, including Beirut’s southern suburb, south Lebanon, and the eastern Bekaa Valley. Araghchi’s visit to Beirut came after Iran launched at least 180 missiles Tuesday into Israel, part of a series of rapidly escalating attacks that threaten to push the Middle East closer to a regionwide war. Israeli strike cuts a main highway linking Lebanon with Syria BEIRUT — Lebanon’s state-run National News Agency says an Israeli airstrike has cut a main highway linking Lebanon with Syria. The agency gave no further details about Friday’s airstrike that led to the closure of a road near the Masnaa Border Crossing, from where tens of thousands of people fleeing war in Lebanon have crossed into Syria over the past two weeks. It’s the first time this major border crossing has been cut off since the beginning of the war. Lebanese General Security recorded more than 250,000 Syrian citizens and over 80,000 Lebanese citizens crossing into Syrian territory during the last week of September, after Israel launched a heavy bombardment of southern and eastern Lebanon. Dama Post, a pro-government Syrian media outlet, said Israeli warplanes fired two missiles and damaged the road between Masnaa Border Crossing in Lebanon and the Syrian crossing point of Jdeidet Yabous. There are half a dozen border crossings between the two countries and most of them remain open. Lebanon’s minister of public works said all border crossings between Lebanon and Syria work under the supervision of the state. Hezbollah is believed to have received much of its weapons from Iran via Syria. The Lebanese group has a presence on both sides of the border where it fights alongside Syrian President Bashar Assad’s forces. Australia's prime minister condemns comments by Iranian ambassador praising Hezbollah's slain leader SYDNEY — Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese on Friday condemned the Iranian ambassador’s comments praising a recently slain Hezbollah leader, but rejected opposition advice to expel the envoy. Ambassador Ahmad Sadeghi described Hezbollah Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah, who was killed by an Israeli missile strike in September in Lebanon, as a 'remarkable leader' on social media. 'The government condemns any support for terrorist organizations such as Hezbollah. We condemn the ambassador’s comments,' Albanese told reporters in Sydney. 'Australia has maintained a relationship with Iran since 1968 that has been continuous. Not because we agree with the regime, but because it’s in Australia’s national interest,' Albanese added. Opposition leader Peter Dutton, who could become prime minister at elections due by May, called for Sadeghi to be expelled over his post. Dutton described Sadeghi’s words as 'completely and utterly at odds with what is in our country’s best interests.' Sadeghi did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday. Australia officially rebuked Sadeghi in August for endorsing Hamas spiritual leader Ahmed Yassin’s hope that 'wiping out the Zionist plague out of the holy lands of Palestine happens no later than 2027.'	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hezbollah-hamas-latest-mideast-4-october-2024-22ce0cdc4813e1f0d657d67868a2da61	2024-10-03T21:58:15-07:00	
Malaysia's Anwar to visit Bangladesh to discuss trade, migrant workers with interim leader Yunus	DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) — Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim will visit Bangladesh on Friday to meet with interim leader Muhammad Yunus, who took over in August after the former prime minister fled during a mass uprising. Anwar's hourslong visit will focus on trade and investment, migrant workers and the Rohingya refugee crisis, officials and media reports said. It is the first visit by a foreign leader to Bangladesh since Yunus took over on Aug. 8 after former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina fled to India . It is also the first state visit by a Malaysian leader to Bangladesh in 11 years. Anwar, who is arriving from Pakistan, is leading a 58-member delegation. Next year, Malaysia will chair the Association for Southeast Asian Nations, and Bangladesh is eager to increase its trade with that region. Bangladesh is also pursuing a policy of increasingly involving ASEAN in resolving the Rohingya refugee crisis. More than 1 million Rohingya refugees from Myanmar live in camps in Bangladesh. Bangladesh was Malaysia’s second-largest trading partner in South Asia in 2023, with total trade reaching $2.78 billion, according to official figures. Malaysia is also one of the leading destinations for Bangladeshi migrant workers. Hundreds of thousands of Bangladeshi workers are employed as low-skilled workers in Malaysia’s construction, manufacturing, plantation and services sectors. But the recruiting process is often corrupt, and allegations of rights violations by Malaysian employers and Bangladeshi recruiting agencies are rampant. More than 6,000 Bangladeshi students study at Malaysian higher education institutions, according to 2023 figures.	https://apnews.com/article/bangladesh-malaysia-yunus-anwar-59c33187e4f6152af362c6e46084c014	2024-10-03T21:52:47-07:00	
Israeli airstrikes rock southern suburbs of Beirut and cut off a key crossing into Syria	BEIRUT (AP) — Israel carried out a series of massive airstrikes overnight in southern suburbs of Beirut and another that cut off the main border crossing between Lebanon and Syria. The new wave of strikes came after Israel warned people to evacuate communities in southern Lebanon that are outside a United Nations-declared buffer zone, as the yearlong conflict between Israel and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah escalates. Israel launched a ground incursion into Lebanon on Tuesday and its forces have been clashing with Hezbollah militants in a narrow strip along the border. A series of attacks before the incursion killed some of the group's key members, including longtime leader Hassan Nasrallah. The blasts overnight rocked Beirut’s southern suburbs, sending huge plumes of smoke and flames into the night sky and shaking buildings kilometers (miles) away in the Lebanese capital. The Israeli military did not immediately comment on what the intended target was, and there was no information immediately available on casualties. Lebanon’s state-run National News Agency reported that there were more than 10 consecutive airstrikes in the area late Thursday. The agency also reported that an Israeli airstrike led to the closure of the road near the busy Masnaa Border Crossing, from which tens of thousands of people fleeing war in Lebanon have crossed into Syria over the past two weeks. It gave no other details. The airstrike that cut the busiest border crossing between the two countries came a day after an Israeli military spokesperson said Lebanon’s Hezbollah has been trying to transport military equipment through the border crossing. Hezbollah is believed to have received much of its weaponry from Iran via Syria. The group has a presence on both sides of the border, a region where it has been fighting alongside Syrian President Bashar Assad’s forces. Dama Post, a pro-government Syrian media outlet, said Israeli warplanes fired two missiles, damaging the road between Masnaa Border Crossing in Lebanon and the Syrian crossing point of Jdeidet Yabous. It was the first time this major border crossing has been cut off since the beginning of the war. Lebanese General Security recorded 256,614 Syrian citizens and 82,264 Lebanese citizens crossing into Syrian territory between Sept. 23 — when the Israel launched a heavy bombardment of southern and eastern Lebanon — and Sept. 30. There are half a dozen border crossings between the two countries and most of them remain open. Lebanon’s minister of public works said all border crossings between Lebanon and Syria work under the supervision of the state. Israel and Hezbollah have traded fire across Lebanon's southern border almost daily since the day after Hamas’ cross-border attack on Oct. 7, 2023, in which the militants killed 1,200 Israelis and took 250 others hostage. Meanwhile, the Israeli army said it carried out a strike Thursday in Tulkarem, a militant stronghold in the West Bank, in coordination with the Shin Bet internal security service. The Palestinian Health Ministry said 18 people were killed in an Israeli strike on a refugee camp there. Violence has flared across the Israeli-occupied territory since the Israel-Hamas war erupted in October 2023. Tulkarem and other northern cities have seen some of the worst violence. Israel declared war on Hamas in the Gaza Strip in response to their Oct. 7 attack. More than 41,000 Palestinians have since been killed in the territory, and just over half the dead have been women and children, according to local health officials. Nearly 2,000 people have been killed in Lebanon in that time, most of them since Sept. 23, according to the Lebanese Health Ministry.	https://apnews.com/article/mideast-wars-lebanon-hezbollah-hamas-4-october-2024-5f2e512d5334b6f7fd7f5a46400e6979	2024-10-03T21:51:52-07:00

Japan's new leader expresses regret for governing party slush fund scandal, vows stronger defense	TOKYO (AP) — New Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba opened his first policy speech in office Friday by expressing deep regrets over the governing party's slush funds scandal that dogged his predecessor. Ishiba replaced Fumio Kishida on Tuesday with the paramount mission of quickly pacifying public anger over financial misconduct in the Liberal Democratic Party and regaining support ahead of an Oct. 27 parliamentary election. 'I will achieve politics that is not for politicians but for the people,' Ishiba said, pledging to provide sincere explanations and ensure that lawmakers abide by the rules. He set five policy pillars to uphold, including security, economy and disaster resilience. Ishiba said he will bolster Japan's military capability to defend itself from threats from China, Russia and North Korea under the framework of the Japan-U.S. security alliance. He did not mention two goals he advocated before taking office — making the Japan-U.S. security alliance more equitable and establishing a NATO-like collective defense system in Asia — apparently to avoid controversy ahead of the election that the LDP must win. Omitting those goals also saves him from possibly irking Washington, but may disappoint those who saw him as willing to speak up even when he risked disagreement with his own party. Ishiba noted violations of Japanese airspace last month by Chinese and Russian warplanes and North Korea’s advancing missile technology and testing as examples of the worsening security environment that Japan faces and stressed the need for a further buildup of Japan’s military. He said he will promote a 'strategic, mutually beneficial relationship' with China and increase communication on all levels to build 'stable and constructive' ties. He also said he will further strengthen and expand Japan’s ties with South Korea and the trilateral cooperation Japan has with it and the United States. He called the Japan-U.S. security alliance a cornerstone of Japanese diplomacy and security as well as the foundation of peace and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region and international society. The first public support ratings for Ishiba as prime minister were around 50% or even lower, the lowest levels for a new leader, according to Japanese media. Opposition leaders have criticized him for rushing to hold an election after only adding a new face and fresh image to the party without any concrete results. He plans to dissolve parliament next Wednesday for an election on Oct. 27, allowing only a few days of debate on his policies. On the economy, Ishiba said in his speech that he wants workers to have sustainable salary increases that exceed inflation, and will promote investment to create 'a virtuous cycle of growth and distribution.' He promised economic support for low-income households and measures for regional revitalization and disaster resilience. Despite earlier supporting a phasing out of nuclear power following the Fukushima nuclear plant disaster, he pledged to maximize the use of nuclear energy and push for geothermal and other renewable sources to meet the soaring electricity needs of data centers in the age of AI. ___ Follow AP's Asia-Pacific coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/asia-pacific	https://apnews.com/article/japan-ishiba-policy-us-china-security-economy-a5412430588c624ea25ee5dc8f38ae7f	2024-10-03T21:05:10-07:00	
Tunisia votes Sunday in its third presidential election since the Arab Spring	TUNIS, Tunisia (AP) — With his major opponents imprisoned or left off the ballot, Tunisian President Kais Saied faces few obstacles to winning reelection on Sunday, five years after riding anti-establishment backlash to a first term. The North African country's Oct. 6 presidential election is its third since protests led to the 2011 ouster of President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali — the first autocrat toppled in the Arab Spring uprisings that also overthrew leaders in Egypt, Libya and Yemen. International observers praised the previous two contests as meeting democratic norms. However, a raft of arrests and actions taken by a Saied-appointed election authority have raised questions about whether this year's race is free and fair. And opposition parties have called for a boycott. What's at stake? Not long ago, Tunisia was hailed as the Arab Spring’s only success story. As coups, counter-revolutions and civil wars convulsed the region, the North African nation enshrined a new democratic constitution and saw its leading civil society groups win the Nobel Peace Prize for brokering political compromise. But its new leaders were unable to buoy its struggling economy and were plagued by political infighting and episodes of violence and terrorism. Amid that backdrop, Saied, then 61 and a political outsider, won his first term in 2019. He advanced to a runoff promising to usher in a 'New Tunisia' and hand more power to young people and local governments. This year's election will offer a window into popular opinion about the trajectory that Tunisia’s fading democracy has taken since Saied took office. Saied’s supporters appear to have remained loyal to him and his promise to transform Tunisia. But he isn’t affiliated with any political party, and it’s unclear just how deep his support runs among Tunisians. It’s the first presidential race since Saied upended the country’s politics in July 2021, declaring a state of emergency, sacking his prime minister, suspending the parliament and rewriting Tunisia’s constitution consolidating his own power. Those actions outraged pro-democracy groups and leading opposition parties, who called them a coup. Yet despite anger from career politicians, voters approved Saied’s new constitution the following year in a low-turnout referendum. Authorities subsequently began arresting Saied’s critics including journalists, lawyers, politicians and civil society figures, charging them with endangering state security and violating a controversial anti-fake news law that observers argue stifles dissent. Fewer voters turned out to participate in parliamentary and local elections in 2022 and 2023 amid economic woes and widespread political apathy. Who's running? Many wanted to challenge Saied, but few were able to. Seventeen potential candidates filed paperwork to run and Tunisia’s election authority approved only three: Saied, Zouhair Maghzaoui and Ayachi Zammel. Maghzaoui is a veteran politician who has campaigned against Saied’s economic program and recent political arrests. Still, he is loathed by opposition parties for backing Saied’s constitution and earlier moves to consolidate power. Zammel is a businessman supported by politicians not boycotting the race. During the campaign, he has been sentenced to prison time in four voter fraud cases related to signatures his team gathered to qualify for the ballot. Others had hoped to run but were prevented. The election authority, known as ISIE, last month dismissed a court ruling ordering it to reinstate three additional challengers. With many arrested, detained or convicted on charges related to their political activities, Tunisia’s most well-known opposition figures are also not participating. That includes the 83-year-old leader of Tunisia’s most well organized political party Ennahda, which rose to power after the Arab Spring. Rached Ghannouchi, the Islamist party’s co-founder and Tunisia’s former house speaker, has been imprisoned since last year after criticizing Saied. The crackdown also includes one of Ghannouchi’s most vocal detractors: Abir Moussi, a right-wing lawmaker known for railing against Islamists and speaking nostalgically for pre-Arab Spring Tunisia. The 49-year-old president of the Free Destourian Party also was imprisoned last year after criticizing Saied. Other less known politicians who announced plans to run have also since been jailed or sentenced on similar charges. Opposition groups have called to boycott the race. The National Salvation Front — a coalition of secular and Islamist parties including Ennahda — has denounced the process as a sham and questioned the election’s legitimacy. What are the other issues? The country’s economy continues to face major challenges. Despite Saied’s promises to chart a new course for Tunisia, unemployment has steadily increased to one of the region’s highest at 16%, with young Tunisians hit particularly hard. Growth has been slow since the COVID-19 pandemic and Tunisia has remained reliant on multilateral lenders such as the World Bank and the European Union. Today, Tunisia owes them more than $9 billion. Apart from agricultural reform, Saied’s overarching economic strategy is unclear. Negotiations have long been stalled over a $1.9 billion bailout package offered by the International Monetary Fund in 2022. Saied has been unwilling to accept its conditions, which include restructuring indebted state-owned companies and cutting public wages. Some of the IMF’s stipulations — including lifting subsidies for electricity, flour and fuel — would likely be unpopular among Tunisians who rely on their low costs. Economic analysts say that foreign and local investors are reluctant to invest in Tunisia due to continued political risks and an absence of reassurances. The dire economic straits have had a two-pronged effect on one of Tunisia’s key political issues: migration. From 2019 to 2023, an increasing number of Tunisians attempted to migrate to Europe without authorization. Meanwhile, Saied's administration has taken a harsh approach against migrants arriving from sub-Saharan Africa, many who have found themselves stuck in Tunisia while trying to reach Europe. Saied energized his supporters in early 2023 by accusing migrants of violence and crime and portraying them as part of a plot to change the country’s demography. The anti-migrant rhetoric prompted extreme violence against migrants and a crackdown from authorities. Last year, security forces targeted migrant communities from the coast to the capital with a series of arrests, deportation to the desert and the demolition of tent camps in Tunis and coastal towns. Bodies continue to wash ashore on Tunisia’s coastline as boats carrying Tunisians and migrants from sub-Saharan Africa manage only to make it a few nautical miles before sinking. What does it mean overseas? Tunisia has maintained ties with its traditional Western allies but also forged new partnerships under Saied. Much like many populist leaders who’ve taken power worldwide, Saied emphasizes sovereignty and freeing Tunisia from what he calls 'foreign diktats.' He has insisted that Tunisia won’t become a 'border guard' for Europe, which has sought agreements with him to better police the Mediterranean. Tunisia and Iran lifted visa requirements and in May announced plans to boost trade ties. It has also accepted millions in loans as part of China’s Belt and Road Initiative to build hospitals, stadiums and ports. Yet European countries remain Tunisia’s top trade partners and their leaders have maintained productive ties with Saied, hailing agreements to manage migration as a 'model' for the region. Saied has spoken ardently in support of Palestinians as war has swept the Middle East and opposes moves made to normalize diplomatic ties with Israel.	https://apnews.com/article/tunisia-presidential-election-kais-saied-9cb6593c3154b0e9a32131d1afe6d118	2024-10-03T20:17:55-07:00	
A year later, Israeli survivors reflect on the lingering toll of Oct. 7	Lilach Almog walks past the remains of a police station seized by Hamas militants and buildings pockmarked by bullets in her southern Israeli town multiple times a day. 'Every corner has become a memorial,' she said. 'Even if you want to forget for a bit, you can’t. You look outside at the wall and it reminds you of everything all over again.' Almog joined the roughly 120,000 Israelis displaced by the Israel-Hamas war but has returned home to constant reminders of the Oct. 7, 2023, attack. A year later, survivors reflect on that day that changed everything. They hid in bedrooms, bomb shelters, safe rooms and beneath trees as Hamas militants poured across the border. In the aftermath, they've mourned loved ones, struggled with anxiety, suffered survivor's guilt and questioned whether they will ever return home to places that still bear the scars of their ordeal. Lilach Almog, 37, Sderot The force of a blast at the police station across from her apartment building knocked Almog off her feet on Oct. 7. She had scrambled to her home's fortified room after air raid sirens sounded in Sderot and watched from the window in disbelief as dozens of gunmen walked down her street with rocket-propelled grenades on their shoulders. They seized the police station, and a dayslong battle raged before the Israeli military bulldozed the building with militants still inside. More than 30 civilians and police officers were killed in the area around the station. Almog fled Sderot with her children and mother, living in a hotel in Tel Aviv for eight months, but government assistance ran out in August, forcing her to return to Sderot and memories of that day, when Hamas-led militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took about 250 hostage. The resulting war has killed more than 41,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not differentiate between fighters and civilians but says more than half were women and children. The anxiety of the past year has overwhelmed her, forcing her to leave her work as an architect and interior designer and go on disability leave. Her 9-year-old son began wetting the bed. Her 11-year-old daughter refuses to go anywhere without her. 'As long as the war is still continuing, there’s no way to feel calm, to return to our lives,' she said. 'We still have the hostages there. We still have nightmares. There’s no end.' Ziv Abud, 27, Nova music festival survivor and girlfriend of hostage Eliya Cohen When Ziv Abud spotted the bomb shelter on the side of the road as she was trying to escape the attack on the Nova music festival, she breathed a sigh of relief, thinking it would be a safe place to wait out the rockets. 'We know now that the shelter we went into was basically going into a death trap,' she said. Nearly 30 people had crammed into the concrete shelter meant to hold about 10. When Hamas militants arrived, they started tossing grenades inside. A former soldier was able to toss out eight grenades, but the ninth exploded inside the shelter, instantly killing about half the people, Abud said. In the smoke and chaos, militants grabbed people to take as hostages and sprayed the shelter with bullets. Abud survived, protected by the crush of bodies above her. When she opened her eyes, she saw the bodies of her nephew and his girlfriend but no trace of her boyfriend, Eliya Cohen. Four people, including Israeli-American Hersh Goldberg-Polin, were kidnapped, and six others survived. Over the past year, Abud has campaigned tirelessly for the hostages and flown around the world to press for Cohen’s return. 'I think less about my own trauma, just how to bring Eliyah home,' she said. Shlomo Margalit, 86, and Hanna'le Margalit, 79, Kibbutz Nir Oz Shlomo and Hanna'le Margalit still struggle to comprehend how they survived. All of the residents on both sides of their home in Kibbutz Nir Oz were killed or kidnapped on Oct. 7. Hamas militants entered their home three times but did not go into the safe room where they were hiding. Of Nir Oz's nearly 400 residents, 42 were killed and 75 were kidnapped that day. But the couple, part of the founding generation on the kibbutz, was spared. The Margalits have been married for 64 years and lived in Nir Oz nearly all that time, working to transform the barren desert into a village filled with towering trees and green lawns. The kibbutz was devastated by the attack and will take years to rebuild, though questions remain about how — or even if — it should be. Like most of the residents of Nir Oz, the couple is living in temporary housing, a development of new apartment buildings about an hour northeast. 'I still can’t think about what was lost. I think for me that will happen much later,' Hanna'le Margalit said. 'Right now, all the energy and our work is for survival, to get used to a new place, to hope the hostages will come home.' Shlomo Margalit returns to the kibbutz about once a week to care for the cemetery, a job he held before Oct. 7. But now many graves have been added. Each time he is there, he chooses one person and goes to their ruined house to properly bid them farewell. 'It’s too many to do all at once,' he said. 'It’s too sad and too hard. It’s impossible.' Eilat Shalev, 47, Nova festival survivor Eilat Shalev remembers that the pomelos — large citrus fruits — were about to be harvested a few days after Oct. 7 in southern Israel. She knows that because farmers had already set out large collection bins, which she hid behind as Hamas militants overran the road leading to the Nova music festival, where she had been dancing with her husband, Shai. The two got separated as militants began shooting at their car. Shalev ran toward nearby fields, jumping in and out of vehicles, until she found herself near a pomelo orchard. 'I grabbed the first tree I saw on the left side. I hid with my hands on my head and my face in the earth, just praying to God that God will rescue me so I will live and return to my kids,' she said. Minutes later, a bullet hit just centimeters from her head. She played dead for hours before making her way back to the road. Eventually, Israeli security forces brought her to a police station. As the hours passed and her husband didn't make contact, she grew increasingly worried. He was pronounced dead five days later. Shalev said she and her four children, ages 12 to 23, have turned to Judaism for comfort. But she has trouble sleeping at night and struggles to run her household alone. 'As the days go by, one day and another day and another day, it’s actually getting worse. It doesn’t get better,' Shalev said. 'Missing him gets stronger because you understand more and more that he’s not coming back. He’s really not coming back.' Liat Atzili, 50, hostage from Kibbutz Nir Oz After 54 days in captivity in Gaza, Liat Atzili was determined to return to her work as a high school history and civics teacher to wrest back control of her identity. 'I feel most comfortable and most at ease, and it’s the thing that comes the most naturally for me to be in a classroom,' she said. 'It’s a real connection to what I used to be like and what my life was before.' She counts herself lucky to have been held in an apartment in conditions much better than the hostages kept in underground tunnels. Still, during her captivity, Atzili had no idea whether her family had survived. The day after her release as part of a November cease-fire deal, the Israeli military announced that her husband, Aviv, had been killed and his body was being held in Gaza. Two of her three children were on the kibbutz, and both survived. The upcoming anniversary is more difficult than Atzili anticipated, a milestone for how much she has lost over the past year. On Oct. 7, she plans for at least part of the day to stay in bed and watch 'Dirty Dancing.' Next month, Atzili hopes to return to one of her passions, giving tours at Yad Vashem, Israel’s Holocaust Museum. She understands the parallels people want to draw between the Holocaust and what happened to her, but the reality in the Middle East is different, she said. 'The Israeli Jews sort of wish that the Palestinians disappeared, and the Palestinians sort of wish that the Jews disappeared, but that’s not going to happen,' she said. 'Nobody’s going anywhere. We don’t have to love each other, but we have to get along, and we have to find a way that everybody can live here in safety.'	https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-gaza-war-anniversary-survivors-fb65aa677e344a873566dc948d6bf52a	2024-10-03T19:12:20-07:00	
For migrant women who land in Colorado looking for jobs, a common answer emerges: No	AURORA, Colo. (AP) — East Colfax Avenue was the best place to find a job. That's what everyone told Sofia Roca. Never mind the open drug use, the sex workers or the groups of other migrant women marching the sidewalks soliciting work at the very same Mexican restaurants and bakeries. On East Colfax in Aurora, Colorado, bosses and customers would speak Spanish and might be willing to hire someone like Roca — a 49-year-old immigrant from Colombia — without legal authorization to work. That was the rationale for going back to Colfax each morning, fruitless as it was. 'Do you know how to cook Mexican food?' asked one woman, looking up from the limes she was quartering, when Roca inquired about a kitchen position advertised on the door. Roca’s accent was a giveaway: not Mexican. 'I can learn,' Roca replied in Spanish. Responded the woman: 'We’re not hiring.' As record numbers of South Americans attempt to cross the U.S. southern border seeking better economic opportunities, many are landing in communities that are unprepared for them — and sometimes outright hostile. And many migrants have also been unprepared for the realities of their new home. An influx of migrants strains one town Women are leaving Colombia, and to a greater extent Venezuela, to escape starvation and violence, to provide for their children and to seek medical care. They represent some of the more than 42,000 migrants who have arrived in the Denver area over two years. Many didn’t know anyone in Denver. But it was the closest city to which Texas was offering free bus rides, both to relieve pressure on its towns and to make a political point to liberal-leaning cities about immigration’s impact on the border. From Denver, untold numbers made their way to the neighboring suburb of Aurora, lured by cheaper rent and abundant Spanish speakers. But finding a job and an affordable place to stay has been anything but easy, and women face their own particular challenges. Last year, nearly 900,000 women and girls tried to cross the U.S. southern border, more than a fivefold increase over the last decade, U.S. Customs and Border Protection data shows. Like many of them, Roca came to the United States to help her children. Her adult daughter back in Colombia suffers from lupus and can’t afford 'the good medicines.' The economy in Colombia never recovered from pandemic shutdowns, and Roca heard from acquaintances that in the United States she could earn $1,000 a week. 'That’s a lot of money in Colombia,' she said. Back home, 'one U.S. dollar can buy breakfast for your entire family.' Roca set out for the United States with an uncle. He was detained in Mexico, but Roca made it across the border in Juárez and told U.S. agents she was seeking asylum. She heard from a shelter worker in El Paso that Denver was offering free housing for migrants and Texas would pay to get her there. As of September, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott has bused at least 119,000 migrants from the border to cities run by Democratic mayors, including Denver, New York, Chicago and Washington, D.C., according to a press release from the governor’s office. Roca arrived in November and stayed for two weeks in a hotel-turned-shelter paid for by the city of Denver. When she went looking for work in front of Home Depot and along East Colfax, she observed an icy reception from locals. 'They said horrible things about Venezuelans,' she said. She didn't know the benefits many recent migrants have received — specifically, a path to a temporary work visa and with it better-paying jobs — were causing resentment among Aurora's large Mexican community. Many have loved ones in the country illegally or have themselves lived for years in the United States without legal permission to work. As chaos and economic collapse drove more migrants to the border, President Joe Biden’s administration created and expanded legal pathways to enter the U.S., with the possibility of applying for work permits. However, in June, Biden temporarily suspended asylum for new immigrants who cross illegally, ending a main pathway to legal work. Roca never was eligible for a work permit, but Mexican residents in Aurora still associate her with the many migrants who are. Resentment for newcomers was building in another corner of Aurora, too — City Hall. Aurora officials in February had warned other communities against housing migrants there, vowing not to spend city money to help them. This summer, Aurora’s mayor repeated a landlord’s claim that a notorious Venezuelan gang had taken over an apartment building, saying he would investigate how so many Venezuelans ended up living in Aurora. Even though police say gangs hadn't taken over the building, former President Donald Trump took up the claim, mentioning it at his campaign rallies. The mayor last month walked back some of his comments. She wants a job — but not in ‘the business’ Roca never made a deliberate decision to settle in Aurora. To her, it wasn't clear where Denver ended and Aurora began, or that Denver was more eager to help migrants coming to the area. So when her time is almost up at the Denver shelter, she does the only thing she knows to do: She heads to East Colfax in Aurora. She walks up and down the sidewalks, dodging people who’d taken over the bus shelters to shoot up drugs or smoke fentanyl and who sell apparently shoplifted toiletries on the sidewalks. She approaches migrants holding cardboard signs and begging for money outside Walmart, asking if they know of work or a place to stay. A man standing by his truck parked outside a Goodwill thrift store catches her attention. He is singing along to rap music in Spanish. He seems happy, she thinks. He seems like a good guy. He says he can help her and her cousin, who arrived a few weeks earlier. But not in Colorado. She can come back to Kentucky with him and his family. To hold her over in the short term, the man — El Cubano, she calls him — gives her $10 and invites her for ice cream. After more than a week of staying with the family in Kentucky and cooking and eating meals together, Roca learns El Cubano's wife works in el negocio, or 'the business.' There is not much work in Kentucky, so she earns her money through sex work, she tells Roca, while her kids play a few feet away. A few days later, while they are cooking dinner together at the couple’s trailer, a Mexican man in his 30s pulls up outside in a pickup truck. He’d seen a picture of Roca and liked her — and would pay $1,000 for two nights with Roca, the wife says. Roca would keep $600, the couple would get $400. Roca would have to pay him $6 for each ride to and from his house. Roca stops chopping the onion and looks at her cousin. Don’t go with that man, the cousin says. You don’t know him. Roca considers all of the jobs she’s done in her life. Caring for Alzheimer’s patients as a home health aide. Answering phones at a call center. Selling beauty products on the street in Mexico. In her month in the United States, she has quickly come to understand she'll have to make sacrifices in this country. That the reports she’d heard back in Colombia about earning $1,000 a week were likely hyperbole. That she’ll have to push her body to its limits doing manual labor. She’ll have to accept below-standard wages until she gets work permission, if it ever comes. She’ll have to stay in someone’s living room with other new arrivals and give up her privacy. But subjecting herself to the whims of a stranger in such an intimate and vulnerable way? 'No,' she tells the woman. 'I’m not going anywhere with anyone.' The man is told to leave. The insults start immediately. How are you going to earn money, girl? asks the woman. You’re not going to just live here for free. The food here is good, isn’t it? But it’s not free. Roca doesn't know what to expect — maybe violence. She and her cousin have no money or transportation. They're essentially trapped. But a few days later, Roca leaves as El Cubano yells insults from his trailer. A Venezuelan woman she met outside Home Depot finds someone to help them leave Kentucky. Where did they want to go? Somewhere she knew people, she remembers thinking. Somewhere with other migrants. Back to Aurora and East Colfax Avenue. Even among Aurora's migrants, life isn't better Back in Aurora, Roca reached out to a Venezuelan woman she'd met briefly begging for money outside the Walmart on Colfax. Soon she took a place in the woman’s living room, sharing a queen-sized blow-up mattress with the woman’s teenage son. Roca found a job on the weekends helping a man set up and break down his stall at an outdoor flea market. She hefted large sacks of used clothing over her shoulders, put out the clothing on display, talked to customers. All for $10 an hour. 'It’s an abusive wage,' she said, 'but it’s a job.' She tried standing outside Home Depot, but found many people propositioned her for sex or wouldn’t pay her after she completed legitimate jobs. She gave up standing outside a day laborer’s center in Aurora when she didn’t feel safe trying to jockey for work against dozens of men, who would push her out of the way and jump onto moving trucks rounding up workers. On most days walking along Colfax Avenue, Roca says, men would solicit her for sex, holding up their fingers to signal how many hundreds of dollars they were willing to pay. As she looked for work in March, she came across what looked like an old motel, a place she hadn’t tried before. 'Is this a hotel or a motel? I don’t know,' she said as she opened the heavy metal door. 'Let’s check.' In the small vestibule, a 1970s-era cigarette vending machine stood in the corner. A grandfatherly man waited behind a plexiglass sliding window. There were no vacancies, but he urged her to try the bar in the back. 'They’re always looking for girls,' he said. Roca walked to the rear of the building and recognized the name of the bar. 'I know about this place,' she said. At a few Mexican cantinas around Aurora and Denver, women are paid to talk and drink with men. 'Ficheras,' as the women are known in Spanish, sell beers at a significant markup to men and pocket the profits. It can be a fast way to earn money, but also a route to sex trafficking or the drug trade. Visit these establishments, and you can see some 'ficheras' wearing government-issued ankle bracelets with their sky-high heels. The bracelets were given to them by federal immigration officials to monitor their movements while they await immigration hearings. 'I don’t think I have to do that yet,' Roca said. 'But this street — it only offers prostitution.' She boards another Greyhound — and moves on Since returning to Aurora, Roca had discovered she has few options for establishing legal residence or working legally in the U.S. She told U.S. Border Patrol officials she plans to plead for asylum at her deportation hearing next year, but she doubts they will grant it. Ironically, what happened to her in Kentucky could help her win a visa. The U.S. government issues special visas to victims of sex trafficking here, but Roca has never wanted to report the Cuban couple, fearing they might come after her. She had gotten in touch through Facebook with a high school friend from Colombia living for the last year in the northeastern United States. 'She’s told me she can get me a job at a hotel and I can stay with her,' she said. 'What would you do if you were me?' she asked a reporter. 'Would you go?' The idea of learning to move around a new American city exhausted Roca. But without more work, there wasn’t much keeping her in Aurora. Her roommates were headed to eviction court the next week. She didn’t know where she would go if they lost the apartment. Two days later, with about $80 in her pocket, Roca boarded a Greyhound bus paid for by the city of Denver. She landed in a new town — one that hasn’t received busloads of migrants from Texas — and reunited with her high school friend. (The Associated Press is not identifying her new location, since Roca is afraid the Cuban couple might seek her out after she spoke about them in the media.) Roca’s friend followed through on her promises, allowing her to live with her and connecting her to a job cleaning hotel rooms. Roca has already changed jobs and has found one she likes better. She walks through the city with ease — and anonymously. 'It’s a huge difference from my life in Denver,' she says. 'There’s less chaos, and no one has disrespected me. It's been a great refuge.' She's not sure how long she'll stay. But Sofia Roca will never live in Aurora, Colorado, again. ___ The Associated Press’ education coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Record-setting number of transgender candidates risk their lives in Brazil	RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) — Benny Briolly beamed as she strode through the concrete favela alleyway in a snow-white dress, volunteers proudly waving campaign flags emblazoned with her face. The city councilwoman and nearly 1,000 other transgender politicians are running Sunday in every one of Brazil's 26 states, according to the nation’s electoral court, which is tracking them for the first time. The number of candidacies has tripled since the last local elections four years ago, when trans rights group Antra mapped them. As trans people have set their sights on political office, many have been met with intimidation efforts bent on turning them away, including a candidate in Brazil’s biggest city who survived an assassination attempt last week. Trans advocates report record deaths in Brazil More trans people — 100 — were murdered in Brazil last year than in any other country, according to Transgender Europe, a network of global non-profits that tracks the data. Those precise statistics are almost certainly driven by a combination of poor reporting elsewhere and Brazil's active network of advocates, but experts agree that transphobia is ubiquitous. On International Women’s Day last year, Nikolas Ferreira — the federal lawmaker who received more votes than any other — donned a blond wig in Congress’ lower house. He said it allowed him to speak as a woman and denounce trans people. In 2022 Rio state lawmaker Rodrigo Amorim called Briolly 'an aberration of nature' in the state's legislature. Such tactics rally voters by portraying trans people as a menace to be courageously fought, according to Ligia Fabris, a gender and law specialist and a visiting professor at Yale University. Legacy of a far-right president for trans politicians Both Amorim and Ferreira were staunch allies of far-right former President Jair Bolsonaro. Transgender politician Leonora Áquilla, a candidate for city council in Sao Paulo this year, said that Bolsonaro had inflamed transphobia and that she has had to stare down people shouting death threats to her face. Bolsonaro lost his re-election bid to leftist Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva in 2022 but transphobia has far from retreated. Since entering the public eye, Briolly has received over 700 death threats. Some have included the address of her home in Rio de Janeiro’s metro area and warnings that she would suffer the same fate as city councilwoman Marielle Franco, a champion for LGBTQ+ rights who was gunned down in 2018. That threat prompted the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights to demand that Brazil provide Briolly protection. She won’t be scared off her reelection bid even though some may want her dead. 'When we get into politics, our bodies become threats and we become constant targets,' Briolly told the Associated Press, with the city of Niteroi — across the bay from Rio — stretching out behind her. 'Our bodies are revolutionary, are daring ... they are bodies that emanate hope to all those who were left behind.' An armed escort and a bulletproof vest Áquilla narrowly escaped an assassination attempt on Sept. 26. She was in northern Sao Paulo on her way to look into reports of transphobia when a motorcycle deliberately slammed into her car. When she got out, the driver revved his engine, and instinctively she ducked. The bullet from his gun missed her, and he fired more shots as she lay there, pretending to be dead. He escaped and Áquilla has ceased in-person campaigning. 'There have been so many threats they became banal; we never thought it would happen. I’m completely in shock. I’m taking a sedative, because I can’t control my nervousness, my anxiety,' she said in a video call. 'Right on the eve of the election, the moment when I most need to be on the streets, they’re trying to silence me.' Duda Salabert, who is running for mayor in Brazil’s sixth biggest city, Belo Horizonte, made history in 2022 when elected alongside another trans woman to Brazil’s lower house of Congress. Their victories were widely regarded as a breakthrough for trans representation, but Salabert said that during that campaign she received death threats daily. 'I had to walk with an armed escort ... I had to vote with a bulletproof vest, according to police instructions, and I couldn’t go into large crowds because I risked being attacked,' she said. This year, Salabert said she is seeking to become the first trans mayor of a major city in Latin America. 'It’s a joy, because we’re making history, but it’s sad because our candidacy highlights the entire history of exclusion, violence and alienation of the transvestite and transgender community from electoral processes in Brazil and Latin America,' she said in a video call. Positive changes accompany the violence and fear Indianarae Siqueira, a trangender sex worker and longtime activist running to be a city councilor in Rio, says that increasingly seeing trans people occupy places of power has had a snowball effect. 'Those who managed to win and are there — I think this is a reference and gives incentive so that people want to enter (politics),' she said during an interview on the steps leading to Rio’s municipal assembly. Back in the Niteroi favela, Briolly agreed that there’s an element of joy to playing an active role in politics, even amid the threats. 'For me, it’s pride — a latent, powerful pride — that grows more and more in my heart and in the heart of each and every person who believes that my body and my voice are just a reflection, an empowerment of the collective struggle,' she said. 'When a Black trans woman moves, she moves the whole of society.'	https://apnews.com/article/brazil-transgender-trans-candidates-elections-41e80c76edee7fea645bd6e859ee0143	2024-10-03T19:08:27-07:00	
Stock market today: Wall Street wobbles higher after strong jobs data pushes up rate forecasts	NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks are wobbling higher on Friday after a surprisingly strong jobs report raised optimism about the economy but also forced a rethink about how much lower interest rates will go over the next year. The S&amp;P 500 was up 0.4% in midday trading after paring a bigger gain. The Dow Jones Industrial Average went from an early gain of 300 points to a modest loss and back to a gain of 71 points, or 0.2%, as of 11 a.m. Eastern time. The Nasdaq composite was 0.7% higher. Banks, cruise-ship operators and other companies whose profits tend to benefit the most from a stronger economy led the way. Norwegian Cruise Line steamed 5.8% higher, JPMorgan Chase rose 1.8% and the small companies in the Russell 2000 index gained 1.2%. Stock indexes are clawing back some of their losses from earlier in the week, caused by worries that worsening tensions in the Middle East could lead to disruptions in the global flow of oil. Crude prices ticked higher again on Friday, but the moves were more modest than earlier in the week, as the world continues its wait to see how Israel will respond to Iran’s missile attack from Tuesday. In the meantime, the strength of the U.S. economy reclaimed its spot as the top mover of markets. Treasury yields jumped in the bond market after the U.S. government said employers added 254,000 more jobs to their payrolls last month than they cut. That was an acceleration from August’s hiring pace of 159,000 and blew past economists’ forecasts. It was a 'grand slam' of a report, according to Lindsay Rosner, head of multi-sector investing within Goldman Sachs Asset Management. She said policy makers at the Federal Reserve, who have been trying to pull off the difficult feat of keeping the economy humming while getting inflation under control, 'must be smiling.' Friday’s report capped a week of mostly encouraging data on the job market. Such strength helps allay one of Wall Street’s top questions: whether the job market will continue to hold up after the Federal Reserve earlier kept interest rates at a two-decade high. Before Friday’s jobs report, data had been showing the general trend was a slowdown in hiring by U.S. employers. That’s not surprising given that the Fed had been trying to press the brake hard enough on the economy to stamp out high inflation. But Friday's blowout numbers bolstered hope that the U.S. economy will indeed avoid a recession, particularly now that the Federal Reserve has made a drastic switch in policy and begun cutting interest rates to give it more juice. The Fed last month lowered its main interest rate for the first time in more than four years and indicated more cuts will arrive through next year. Friday's jobs data was strong enough to push traders to downgrade their forecasts for how steeply the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates by at its next meeting in November. They’re now forecasting less than a 10% probability that the Fed will deliver another larger-than-usual cut, according to data from CME Group. That’s down from the better-than-a-coin-flip’s chance they saw a week ago. That in turn sent the yield on the two-year Treasury shooting up to 3.88% from 3.71% late Thursday. The 10-year yield rose to 3.95% from 3.85%. Such increases in yields hurt stocks of home builders, real-estate owners and other companies that would have benefited the most from a continued easing in rates for mortgages and other loans. D.R. Horton, PulteGroup and Lennar all sank at least 3% for three of the biggest losses in the S&amp;P 500. Home Depot dropped 1.7% and was the biggest reason the Dow Jones Industrial Average was lagging other stock indexes. Friday's jobs report was so strong that it means the Federal Reserve may ultimately not need to cut interest rates as much as investors had been thinking. 'This report tells the Fed that they still need to be careful as a strong labor market along with sticky housing/shelter data shows that it won’t be easy to engineer meaningfully lower inflation from here in the nearer term,' according to Scott Wren, senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. At Bank of America, economist Aditya Bhave said he expects the Federal Reserve to stop cutting when its federal funds rate reaches a range of 3% to 3.25%, or a quarter of a percentage point higher than he was earlier forecasting. The rate is currently sitting in a range of 4.75% to 5%. Also Friday, some 45,000 dockworkers at East and Gulf coast ports are returning to work after their union reached a deal to suspend its three-day strike until Jan. 15 to provide time to negotiate a new contract. That helped calm worries that a lengthy strike could have pushed up on inflation and dragged on the economy. In the oil market, the price for a barrel of Brent crude, the international standard, rose 0.7% to $78.17 per barrel and is up more than 9% for the week. A barrel of benchmark U.S. crude rose 0.8% to $74.29, up from roughly $68 at the start of the week. In stock markets abroad, indexes rose across much of Europe following the strong jobs report from the world’s largest economy. In Asia, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng jumped 2.8% in its latest sharp swerve. It soared a bit more than 10% this week on excitement about a flurry of recent announcements from Beijing to prop up the world’s second-largest economy. ___ AP Business Writers Yuri Kageyama and Matt Ott contributed.	https://apnews.com/article/stock-markets-rates-oil-iran-cb6a744bb4c16fe09d59091a60c66609	2024-10-03T18:41:14-07:00	
North Korea's Kim threatens to destroy South Korea with nuclear strikes if provoked	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korean leader Kim Jong Un threatened to use nuclear weapons and destroy South Korea permanently if provoked, state media reported Friday, after the South’s leader warned that Kim’s regime would collapse if he attempted to use nuclear arms. The exchange of such rhetoric between the rival Koreas is nothing new, but the latest comments come during heightened animosities over the North’s recent disclosure of a nuclear facility and its continuation of missile tests. Next week, observers say North Korea's rubber-stamp parliament is expected to constitutionally declare a hostile 'two-state' system on the Korean Peninsula to formally reject reconciliation with South Korea and codify new national borders. During a visit to a special operation forces unit on Wednesday, Kim said his military 'would use without hesitation all the offensive forces it possesses, including nuclear weapons,' if South Korea attempts to use armed forces encroaching upon the sovereignty of North Korea, according to the North’s official Korean Central News Agency. 'If such a situation comes, the permanent existence of Seoul and the Republic of Korea would be impossible,' Kim said, using South Korea’s official name. Kim’s statement was a response to South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol’s speech at his country’s Armed Forces Day on Tuesday. Unveiling South Korea’s most powerful Hyunmoo-5 ballistic missile and other conventional weapons that could target North Korea, Yoon said the day that North Korea tries to use nuclear weapons would be the end of the Kim government because Kim would face 'the resolute and overwhelming response' of the South Korean-U.S. alliance. Kim responded that Yoon’s address fully betrayed his 'bellicose temerity' and showed 'the security uneasiness and irritating psychology of the puppet forces.' In a derisive comment, Kim called Yoon 'an abnormal man,' saying that 'the puppet Yoon bragged about an overwhelming counteraction of military muscle at the doorstep of a state that possesses nuclear weapons.' On Thursday, Kim’s sister and senior official, Kim Yo Jong, also ridiculed South Korea's showcasing of the Hyunmoo-5 missile, saying there there’s no way for South Korea to counter the North Korea’s nuclear forces with conventional weapons. Since adopting an escalatory nuclear doctrine in 2022, Kim has repeatedly threatened to use nuclear weapons preemptively. But many foreign experts say it's still unlikely that he would use his nuclear arms first because his military is outmatched by the U.S. and its allied forces. In July, South Korea and the U.S. signed a defense guideline on integrating South Korea's conventional capabilities with the U.S. nuclear forces to better deal with North Korea's advancing nuclear program. South Korea has no nuclear weapons. Animosities between the Koreas are at the worst point in years with Kim's provocative run of missile tests and the South Korean-U.S. military exercises intensifying in a cycle of tit-for-tat. All communication channels and exchange programs between the rivals remain stalled since 2019, when a broader U.S.-North Korea diplomacy on ending the North's nuclear program collapsed. In January, Kim called for rewriting North Korea’s constitution to eliminate the idea of a peaceful unification between the war-divided countries and to cement the South as an 'invariable principal enemy.' He also reiterated that his country does not recognize the Northern Limit Line, a western sea boundary that was drawn by the U.S.-led U.N. Command at the end of the 1950-53 Korean War. He called for the new constitution to include a clear definition of the North’s territories. North Korea has traditionally insisted upon a boundary that encroaches deeply into waters currently controlled by South Korea. On Friday, South Korea’s military said North Korea was again flying balloons likely carrying trash across the border into South Korea. Since late May, North Korea has launched thousands of rubbish-carrying balloons toward South Korea, prompting South Korea to resume anti-Pyongyang propaganda loudspeaker broadcasts at border areas. ___ Follow AP's Asia-Pacific coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/asia-pacific	https://apnews.com/article/north-korea-kim-nuclear-weapons-south-b10f3ee96e9a1171ad8043f2d8d0f8bb	2024-10-03T14:54:23-07:00	
Did this happen to me also? Korean adoptees question their past and ask how to find their families	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — Dozens of South Korean adoptees, many in tears, have responded to an investigation led by The Associated Press and documented by Frontline (PBS) last week on Korean adoptions. The investigation reported dubious child-gathering practices and fraudulent paperwork involving South Korea’s foreign adoption program, which peaked in the 1970s and `80s amid huge Western demands for babies. Here are some of the problems adoptees who responded say they faced, along with tips for finding histories and birth families. KYLA POSTREL — Adoption paperwork tells multiple stories Kyla Postrel's paperwork tells two different stories, neither of which she’s sure is true. After a DNA test last year, Postrel found a half-brother who was also adopted to the West. Comparing their paperwork made her even more skeptical of the stories they’d been told. But part of her is reluctant to keep looking 'for something that may or may not exist and could be absolutely devastating.' She has been flooded with messages from other adoptees looking for help, and tells them not to be disappointed if they can't track down their stories. 'I just don’t want any adoptees feeling like their life is a lie,' she says. 'Their life is everything that they’ve built since then.' If her birth mother is still out there, Postrel would want her to know her daughter has had a good life. CODY DUET — Not enough information in the file Cody Duet, adopted to rural Louisiana in 1986, requested his full file a decade ago. He got back less than one page, saying his mother was a young factory worker, his father was unknown and there was nothing more they were required to give him. 'It was probably one of the most angry moments in my life,' Duet says. 'Who are you to tell me that I don’t get to know who I am?' He fell into a depression and couldn’t sleep. He struggled with abandonment, like he was easy to get rid of, easy not to love. But now, he wonders, was that story even true? The AP investigation found that children were systemically listed as abandoned, even though researchers have found that the vast majority had known relatives. Now Duet wants to resume his search. He wants to find his mother, to tell her he’s reached a point in his life that he’s proud of. AMY McFADDEN — Some adoptees don't know what to believe Amy McFadden always believed what the adoption agency told her parents — that she was abandoned on a staircase at 5 weeks old. Adopted to the United States in 1975, she’d heard stories about fraudulent adoptions, but always thought of them as one-off problems that had nothing to do with her. She’s grateful for her American life and close to her adoptive parents, and never felt the longing so many other adoptees do to reconnect with their roots. But when she found out from the AP stories that mothers in South Korea have searched for their missing children for decades, she says, she was in shock for three days. Waves of nausea radiated over her. She wants to submit her DNA, in case a family has been looking for her. CALLIE CHAMBERLAIN — Not everyone has a happy ending For Callie Chamberlain, waiting for word on whether her birth parents wanted to connect felt like standing on the edge of a cliff. Her original documents said her mother was young, unmarried and uneducated, she says. Her full files from the South Korean agency contained a different story: Her mother was married and she was born of an affair. DNA testing showed both stories were untrue, and identified her mother and father as married both back then and now. When they connected, her mother said she’d nearly died giving birth. The family was poor. Disoriented from labor and medications, her mother said she only vaguely remembered hospital staff insisting she was very sick and the child deserved a better home. The baby disappeared the next day. She lived with that shame for years, and the entire family searched for Chamberlain. They have now invited her — and her adoptive family — with open arms. But Chamberlain has met many without such happy endings, and feels a sort of survivor's guilt. She also questions the belief that reunions will answer all questions and make you whole. 'There is so much grief and there’s so much sorrow,' she says. 'There’s this sense of death. And then there’s also so much that gets to be born. It’s an ancestral sorrow that I can feel sometimes, like this wasn’t supposed to happen.' She has learned of a Korean cultural concept called 'han,' an existential and endless grief, born from colonization, war, poverty and the line that cleaves Korea into North and South, splitting families for generations. 'That’s something we experience too,' she said. 'We are Koreans.' ___ Here are some steps Korean adoptees could take to learn more about their past: Do birth family searches Adoptees can request information from their adoption agencies or the South Korean government's National Center for the Rights of the Child. Birth searches can take months and aren’t always successful. Less than a fifth of 15,000 adoptees who have asked the government for help with family searches since 2012 have managed to reunite with relatives, according to data obtained by AP. Failures are often caused by inaccurate records or the practice of describing children as abandoned even when they had known parents. Many adoptees also criticize the consent process for reunions. Adoption agencies and the NCRC can only use traditional mail, and only up to three times, to contact birth parents for their consent to provide personal details to adoptees and meet them. Privacy laws prevent agency and NCRC workers from accessing birth parents’ phone numbers. Still, the Korean-language adoption documents kept by South Korean agencies often have more background information than translated files sent to Western adoptive parents. When they fail to locate birth parents, NCRC may recommend that adoptees register their DNA with South Korean police or diplomatic offices, or help them publish their stories in South Korean media. Take a DNA test Frustrated with search failures and unreliable records, many Korean adoptees in recent years have attempted to reconnect with their birth families through DNA. Adoptees can register their DNA with a South Korean embassy or consulate in the country where they live. They can also register their DNA with a local police station if they travel to South Korea. DNA testing isn’t common in South Korea, and the process usually depends on whether the birth family had also been trying to find the adoptee through DNA. Once collected at diplomatic or police offices, adoptees’ genetic information is cross-checked with South Korea’s national DNA database for missing persons. When there is a match, the NCRC takes steps to arrange a reunion. Some adoptees have also found birth relatives through commercial DNA tests popular in the West. The nonprofit group 325 Kamra helps South Korean adoptees and birth families reunite through DNA, by allowing adoptees to upload their commercial test results to a database or providing test kits. Join adoptee and volunteer groups There are various Facebook groups — some open, others closed for adoptees only — where adoptees talk about their lives and interactions with adoption agencies. One of the most active pages is run by Banet, a volunteer group named after the Korean word for newborn baby clothing. The group helps adoptees search for birth families, connects them with government and police, and provides translation during meetings with Korean relatives. Some websites are tailored to adoptees sharing the same agency, such as Paperslip, which helps adoptees placed through Korea Social Service with birth family searches and adoption document requests. The Seoul-based nonprofit Global Overseas Adoptees’ Link assists adoptees with birth family searches as well as language education, social events and obtaining visas for employment in South Korea. KoRoot, another Seoul-based civic group, also helps adoptees searching for their families and backgrounds and runs advocacy programs. —- This story is part of an ongoing investigation led by The Associated Press in collaboration with FRONTLINE (PBS).

G20 environment ministers back funding for forest conservation	SAO PAULO (AP) — Environment ministers of the Group of 20 nations agreed Thursday to support the creation of funding sources for ecosystem services, acknowledging Brazil's proposal to establish a trust fund for forest conservation. The Brazilian initiative, known as the Tropical Forests Forever Facility, would reward tropical forest countries for protecting critical biomes. Unlike the Amazon Fund, which rewards Brazil if it succeeds in reducing deforestation, the initiative would benefit all tropical forest nations based on the area preserved, paying local and Indigenous communities involved for maintaining ecosystems that 'benefit everyone,' João Paulo Capobianco, executive secretary of Brazil’s Minister of the Environment, told journalists after the ministers' meeting. The environment ministers of leading rich and developing countries assembled this week in Rio de Janeiro for four-day meetings to discuss climate change and sustainability. The topic is one of Brazil's priorities as it hosts the G20 presidency until the end of the year, with heads of state convening in Rio next month. Over the past few days, environment ministers discussed efforts to address climate change, biodiversity loss and environmental degradation. They also assessed public and private financing strategies to support climate change adaptation, transition policies and the disproportionate impacts on vulnerable populations, Brazil's Environment Minister Marina Silva said in opening remarks at Thursday's meeting. 'We have no time to lose, and we cannot leave anyone behind,' Silva said. She addressed extreme events that have afflicted her own country this year, including a deadly flood in southern Rio Grande do Sul state and an historic drought that helped spread massive wildfires across the country. 'In the Amazon, Cerrado and Pantanal biomes, record drought isolates communities and cities and triggers wildfires of enormous proportions,' Silva said. 'The situation is no different globally, showing in three dimensions the damage and suffering that average temperatures of 1.5°C (2.7°F) above pre-industrial levels are already causing to much of humanity.' The declaration emphasized scaling up mitigation and adaptation efforts. It also reiterated the signing ministers' support for the Paris Agreement, which aims to limit global warming to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels. Other focus areas included oceans, waste reduction, circular economy and plastic pollution. Heads of state on Nov. 18-19 will assess the proposals their proxies have developed in the run-up to their meeting. Brazil's President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has put issues that concern the developing world — such as the reduction of inequalities and the reform of multilateral institutions — at the heart of the country's G20 presidency. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of Brazil at https://www.apnews.com/hub/brazil	https://apnews.com/article/brazil-g20-environment-ministers-climate-change-marina-silva-f6ec8c0d48c8840e4c6d55e6c2ae0aff	2024-10-03T12:50:02-07:00	
Billionaire Frank Stronach is facing additional sexual assault charges in Canada	TORONTO (AP) — Austrian-Canadian billionaire Frank Stronach is facing more sexual assault charges involving three additional complainants, court documents show. The latest charges bring the total number of accusers in his case to 13. The 92-year-old Stronach was first charged in early June with five sex-related offences involving three complainants. Peel Regional Police filed more charges against him later that month as other complainants came forward. The alleged offences dated from 1977 to as recently as February of this year. Court documents filed in a Brampton, Ontario courthouse last week and obtained Thursday show that Stronach now stands accused of five additional charges, including sexual assault and indecent assault, for a total of 18 charges in the case. The alleged crimes are said to have occurred in Toronto and the hamlet of Gormley, Ontario, north of the city. Stronach, who is scheduled to appear in court Oct. 7, has previously denied all allegations against him and claimed in a CBC interview that his accusers are motivated by money. His former lawyer Brian Greenspan has said Stronach would 'vigorously' defend his reputation in court. Stronach’s latest lawyer, Leora Shemesh, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the most recent charges. Stronach became one of Canada’s wealthiest people by creating auto parts giant Magna in his garage in 1957. He also founded The Stronach Group, a company that specializes in horse racing, and founded Stronach International in 2018, a company focusing on organic foods and 'micro-electric mobility.' Stronach resigned as Magna’s chairman in 2011 and founded his own political party in his native Austria the following year. Magna International Inc. said Thursday it has launched a targeted review of its historical records in response to the charges against Stronach. Magna spokeswoman Tracy Fuerst said if any relevant information is found, the company — which is not facing any criminal or civil allegations — will follow a strict protocol to respect the legal rights of all and co-operate with authorities. The internal document review has so far discovered one settlement involving a historical harassment allegation against Stronach and Magna Entertainment Corp. that had already been reported.	https://apnews.com/article/frank-stronach-sexual-assault-charges-magna-0538f714ae6e3821e266892e1fb59b37	2024-10-03T12:34:13-07:00	
Federal agents detain 64 Haitian migrants left stranded on an island near Puerto Rico	SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) — Federal agents said they detained 64 Haitian migrants on Thursday after smugglers abandoned them on an uninhabited island west of Puerto Rico. Park rangers alerted authorities after discovering the group on Mona Island, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection. The group included 30 men, 28 women and six minors. It is the third time in recent weeks that a group of Haitians have been left stranded on that island, located in treacherous waters between Puerto Rico and the neighboring Dominican Republic, which shares the island of Hispaniola with Haiti. Two weeks ago, 31 other migrants were rescued from the island, and last Sunday, an additional 14 also were discovered, officials said. Haitians continue to flee their country, where gang violence has deepened poverty, increased hunger and left more than 700,000 people homeless in recent years.	https://apnews.com/article/haiti-migrants-stranded-mona-island-puerto-rico-f1172f4b299a06218be51a45273c3e72	2024-10-03T11:35:25-07:00	
Libya to resume oil production at two of its major fields	CAIRO (AP) — Libya’s state-run oil company said Thursday it was restarting full oil production, almost two months after shutting down operations in two of its major fields amid a political crisis. The National Oil Corporation said in a statement that it would resume production at the Sharara and El-Feel oil fields, and export shipments from Es Sider, the country's largest port. In August, the company declared 'force majeure,' a legal maneuver that lets a company get out of its contracts because of extraordinary circumstances. As part of the review of the force majeure situation, NOC confirmed in its statement that it 'can resume the operations of crude oil production and exporting operations to its customers.' The National Oil Corporation previously blamed the shutdown on the Fezzan Movement, a local protest group. It came as the country's rival authorities were locked in a dispute over the governance of its Central Bank, which distributes the country's oil revenues. In August, the U.N. warned that the country was poised to face even greater instability due to the dispute. But that was resolved in recent days, when the country's parliament appointed a new governor to the bank. Libya produces more than 1.2 million barrels of oil per day, and Sharara is the country’s largest field, producing up to 300,000 barrels per day. The oil-rich country has been in political turmoil since a NATO-backed uprising toppled and killed longtime dictator Moammar Gadhafi in 2011. Since then, Libya has been split between rival administrations in the east and the west, each backed by militias and foreign governments.	https://apnews.com/article/libya-crude-oil-production-sharara-9633506d7e3c928b81b29ddd731b5a93	2024-10-03T10:18:14-07:00	
Italian family believes painting found in a dump in 1960s is a Picasso and seeks authentication	MILAN (AP) — An Italian family hopes to prove definitively that a painting discarded from a villa on the island of Capri more than 60 years ago is a Picasso, and has been gathering scientific data to persuade Picasso’s estate administration in Paris to make the definitive call. The rolled-up canvas of a female figure was discovered in a pile of trash that a junk dealer was hired to discard in the early 1960s, and it hung innocuously in the family living room and then restaurant in Pompei, near Naples, for years until his son decided to investigate. 'My mother called it ugly,' the junk dealer’s son, Andrea Lo Russo, said Thursday. 'Here, we are used to landscapes featuring the sea.' Lo Russo said that his first inkling that the painting may be an important work came when he saw a Picasso in a middle school textbook, but neither his teacher nor his father were persuaded. His curiosity persisted, and in his early 20s, he and his brother drove to Paris and brought the painting to the Picasso Museum. 'They looked, and they said, ‘It is not possible,’' Lo Russo recalled. He said that he declined their invitation to leave the painting for further examination, not wanting to relinquish it. Over the years, Lo Russo said that his attempts to verify the painting exposed him to fraudsters who tricked him out of money, and even landed him under investigation for suspicion of trafficking in forged art — which was dropped after he produced paperwork showing his attempts to verify the painting's origin. After decades of trying to determine the painting’s provenance, Lo Russo believes that a recent battery of tests carried out by the Swiss-based Arcadia Foundation finally offers proof that it's the work of Picasso. They include lab tests that show the paints used were consistent with Picasso’s color palette during the period in question, said Luca Marcante, a trained chemist who founded the Arcadia Foundation in 2000 to investigate the provenance of artworks. Most recently, a handwriting expert authenticated the signature on the upper-left hand corner as that of Picasso, Marcante said. The only entity that can authenticate the painting is the Picasso Administration in Paris. It hasn't responded to a series of inquires over the years. Marcante said that he's preparing to share the most recent findings with them. 'You need to understand, they get dozens of inquiries every day from private people believing they have found a Picasso,’’ Marcante said. Contacted by The Associated Press, the Picasso Administration declined to comment on the case. Marcante put the value of the painting at 6 million euros ($6.6 million), but said that if fully authenticated, it would soar to 10-12 million euros. After years of hanging casually in the Lo Rosso family home, it's now in a vault in Milan. Marcante said that the painting is strikingly similar to a 1949 painting attributed to Picasso called 'Tete du femme,’’ which is included in the online Picasso Project curated by the Sam Houston State University in Texas. Marcante said that there is photographic proof Picasso visited the ruins of Pompeii in 1917, and asserts that he likely also visited nearby Capri, where he may have painted the Lo Russo-owned canvas sometime in the early 1940s, leaving it behind 'forgotten in time.' Marcante is convinced that the found painting isn't a forgery, because of the differences between the two, including different ceilings, and a missing edge on the seat. The painting 'Tete du femme,' appears to be of Picasso’s one-time lover Dora Maar, given the dark hair and dark eyes, according to Enrique Mallen, the Picasso scholar who runs the online project. He cast doubt on the theory that Picasso would have created two paintings that were so similar. 'From what I know of studying Picasso for 30 years, he would never do an identical copy of his own work,’’ Mallen told The Associated Press. 'He was quoted as saying, ‘You can copy anyone expect yourself.’' The only record of 'Tete du femme' was in a 1967 book, where it was listed as being in a private collection in Turin. It has never turned up in other references, Mallen said. Mallen underlined that his online database, which numbers more than 41,000 Picasso entries, assembles images of paintings, sculptures, drawings and other works attributed to the artist, but doesn't attest to their authentication — something only the Picasso Administration can do. Marcante called the 'Tete du femme' 'a ghost painting, because no one has ever seen it.' 'The only real one is ours, that we have examined in a scientific manner. We are convinced of our work, and of the results science has given us,' Marcante said. 'We can touch this painting with our hands. It is real, it is authentic.' If the painting his father discovered is confirmed to be a Picasso, Lo Russo said that the family is still trying to figure out if they would sell it, caught in a whirlwind of inquiries since news of the painting's suspected provenance surfaced this week. 'We are confused ourselves,' he said.	https://apnews.com/article/picasso-painting-suspected-capri-italy-2bf9ccc657bee35cb9bb4a6b934864b5	2024-10-03T07:49:50-07:00	
The US and Microsoft disrupt a Russian hacking group targeting American officials and nonprofits	WASHINGTON (AP) — A hacking group tied to Russian intelligence tried to worm its way into the systems of dozens of Western think tanks, journalists and former military and intelligence officials, Microsoft and U.S. authorities said Thursday. The group, known as Star Blizzard to cyberespionage experts, targeted its victims with emails that appeared to come from a trusted source — a tactic known as spear phishing. In fact, the emails sought access to the victims' internal systems, as a way to steal information and disrupt their activities. Star Blizzard's actions were persistent and sophisticated, according to Microsoft, and the group often did detailed research on its targets before launching an attack. Star Blizzard also went after civil society groups, U.S. companies, American military contractors and the Department of Energy, which oversees many nuclear programs, the company said. On Thursday, a U.S. court unsealed documents authorizing Microsoft and the Department of Justice to seize more than 100 website domain names associated with Star Blizzard. That action came after a lawsuit was filed against the network by Microsoft and the NGO-Information Sharing and Analysis Center, a nonprofit tech organization that investigated Star Blizzard. Authorities haven't gone into details about Star Blizzard's effectiveness but said they expect Russia to keep deploying hacking and cyberattacks against the U.S. and its allies. 'The Russian government ran this scheme to steal Americans’ sensitive information, using seemingly legitimate email accounts to trick victims into revealing account credentials,' Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco said in announcing the U.S. actions against Star Blizzard. 'With the continued support of our private sector partners, we will be relentless in exposing Russian actors and cybercriminals and depriving them of the tools of their illicit trade.' Star Blizzard has been linked to Russia's Federal Security Service, or FSB. Last year, British authorities accused the group of mounting a yearslong cyberespionage campaign against U.K. lawmakers. Microsoft said it has been tracking the group's activities since 2017. Microsoft said it observed Star Blizzard attempt dozens of hacking efforts targeting 30 different groups since January 2023. The tech giant's cybersecurity experts say Star Blizzard has proven to be especially elusive. 'Star Blizzard’s ability to adapt and obfuscate its identity presents a continuing challenge for cybersecurity professionals,' the company wrote in a report on its findings. U.S. authorities charged two Russian men last year in connection with Star Blizzard's past actions. Both are believed to be in Russia. Along with American targets, Star Blizzard went after people and groups throughout Europe and in other NATO countries. Many had supported Ukraine following Russia's invasion. A message left with the Russian Embassy in Washington was not immediately returned Thursday.	https://apnews.com/article/russia-hacking-microsoft-star-blizzard-fb41bfccbbe7aaecd10a0a93905d4c8a	2024-10-03T07:41:44-07:00	
Dozens of migrants still missing off Djibouti's coast after smugglers forced them out of boats	MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) — Rescuers searched Thursday for dozens of migrants from Africa still missing after smugglers apparently forced them out of two boats in the Red Sea off the coast of Djibouti earlier this week, the Djiboutian coast guard said. At least 48 people were earlier reported to have drowned. The boats had departed from Yemen, across the Red Sea on the Arabian Peninsula, carrying 310 people, the International Organization for Migration said. It was not known why the migrants were forced off the boats while still at sea. Initially, the IOM said the two boats with migrants had capsized but later made no mention of that, saying instead that the smugglers forced the people off the boats and told them to swim. Djibouti’s coast guard said the tragedy struck some 150 meters (about 500 feet) off a beach in the East African nation's northwestern region of Khor Angar. It said 115 survivors had been rescued. Moktar Abdi, a member of the Djiboutian coast guard, told The Associated Press over the phone on Thursday that the search operation was now focusing on deep-sea areas and nearby beaches. He said the coast guard would later share an update on the number of recovered bodies. On Wednesday, the IOM said 111 people were still missing while the Djiboutian coast guard put the number at 61. 'One woman drowned, but her 4-month-old infant survived along with 98 others from the first boat,' said the U.N. agency, which was assisting search and rescue efforts. Thousands of migrants from African, Middle Eastern and South Asian countries seeking a better life in Europe attempt irregular migration every year. Smugglers pack vessels full of desperate people willing to risk their lives to reach continental Europe. Yemen has been embroiled in a civil war since 2014, when Iran-backed Houthi rebels seized the capital of Sanaa and much of the country's nort h, forcing the internationally recognized government into exile. A Saudi-led coalition of mostly Arab states entered the conflict the following year to back the government forces. Over the past years, the war has become mostly stalemated along established front lines while efforts to find a negotiated solution have stalled. ___ Follow AP’s global migration coverage at: https://apnews.com/hub/migration	https://apnews.com/article/migrants-djibouti-yemen-boats-28721e85bd552163ee92264aefd644f2	2024-10-03T07:36:14-07:00

Belarus opposition urges immediate release of over 200 political prisoners in dire state	TALLINN, Estonia (AP) — Belarusian opposition leader in exile Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya on Thursday said 224 political prisoners in Belarus must be freed urgently, and called on Western countries to negotiate their release with the Belarusian authorities. Belarus' authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko in 2020 unleashed a brutal crackdown on dissent in response to mass protests that broke out after an election that handed him his sixth term in office and was denounced by the opposition and the West as rigged. More than 65,000 people have been detained since then as repressions continued unabated, according to the Viasna human rights group. The group has designated over 1,300 currently behind bars as political prisoners. Tsikhanouskaya, who ran against Lukashenko in 2020 and was forced to leave the country shortly after the vote, said Thursday that the opposition and human rights advocates identified 224 political prisoners who should be immediately released — 'minors, the elderly, those with serious medical conditions or mothers of multiple children.' 'These people need to be released immediately and without conditions,' Tsikhanouskaya said in a statement. The list includes Viasna founder Ales Bialiatski, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2022, and opposition leader Maria Kolesnikova, whose health is rapidly deteriorating in prison, according to her family. According to Tsikhanouskaya, 29 of those on the list are in critical condition and 'are basically dying in prison.' She said six political prisoners have died behind bars since 2020. Lukashenko, who has run the country with an iron fist for 30 years and will seek re-election next year, denies that there are political prisoners in Belarus. At the same time, in recent months he has pardoned 115 people who suffered from medical conditions, applied for clemency and publicly repented. Tsikhanouskaya welcomed the pardons and said 'these steps should continue. At the same time, hundreds (more) have been arrested and 142 more people have been designated as political prisoners.'	https://apnews.com/article/belarus-crackdown-political-prisoners-tsikhanouskaya-viasna-rights-1a5e6a0cd1283c08f408c617e36fa302	2024-10-03T07:07:27-07:00	
In time for Oct. 7 anniversary, a new film documents Hamas' attack on Israel music festival	NEW YORK (AP) — Horror came with sunrise following an all-night rave near the Gaza border on Oct. 7, 2023, the Hamas attack presaged by rockets that some young people mistakenly thought were fireworks. A new documentary shows the attack unfold over the next hours in stomach-churning detail: Gunmen mowing down passengers in cars that try to escape. Hiding in a garbage dumpster, or a refrigerator, to avoid detection. Live grenades tossed into a bunker, then thrown out seconds before exploding. Terrified hostages carried away to an uncertain fate. Veteran news producer Susan Zirinsky calls 'We Will Dance Again' the most significant project she's ever worked on, notable praise considering her '9/11' film is arguably the best video document of that day. How much it is seen, however, may depend as much on context as content. The film is now streaming on the Paramount+ service and debuted last weekend on Showtime, in advance of the attack's one-year anniversary. Distributors acknowledge, however, that it has been a hard sell in markets across the world: many potential outlets and film festivals did not want to wade into a hot-button political issue with war in the Mideast grinding on. Different openings were made for different markets A message at the film's beginning acknowledges that the human cost of the Oct. 7 massacre and the war that followed in Gaza 'has been catastrophic for both Israelis and Palestinians' and lists the death toll on both sides. 'This film cannot tell everyone's story,' it says. The message does not appear, however, when 'We Will Dance Again' is screened in Israel. 'We are documenting a moment in history,' Zirinsky said. 'This is not a political film. This happened.' The former CBS News president is now chief of See It Now Studios and, with colleague Terence Wrong, has made a specialty of filmed recountings of major events, like the '11 Minutes' series about the 2017 mass shooting at a country music concert in Las Vegas. With cameras in everyone's pocket, there's a rich trove of raw material to bring these stories to life. She was keenly interested when she learned of Israeli director Yariv Mozer, a former Israeli soldier who grabbed a camera and was one of the first non-officials given access to the scene. The haunting pictures of the hellscape he found illuminate the film's opening moments. What Mozer had already completed didn't need a lot of work, she said. Mozer weaves an intimate story of that morning through interviews with survivors and cellphone video many had saved. One of his executive producers also acquired material taken by Hamas fighters later killed. 'She didn't tell me how and I didn't ask,' he said. That access enabled the scene of the grenades tossed back and forth, almost a cartoonish sequence if the explosions didn't illustrate the life-and-death consequences. The killings that day weren't confined to the concert site. But Mozer quickly determined he wanted to concentrate his film on the people who were there. 'They were beautiful, young, young in spirit,' he said. 'Naive in a way.' It's not an easy film to watch The film is graphic and obviously not easy to watch. Zirinsky and Wrong had arguments over how much could be shown; there are a handful of spots where the picture is blurred out, in some cases to avoid showing expressions on the faces of victims. Critic Jacqueline Cutler wrote in The Daily Beast: 'There is no sugarcoating this. ‘We Will Dance Again’ is the most harrowing documentary I have ever seen.' Although the film is being offered on a streaming service and premium cable network in the U.S., getting exposure in the rest of the world has not been easy. Distributors made a deal to show it on the BBC, on the condition that it not describe Hamas as a terrorist organization. Several film festivals rejected 'We Will Dance Again,' in part because they worried about political fallout, and the rushed effort to make it publicly available for the first anniversary meant some deadlines were missed, said Michael Schmidt, president of the Sipur, an Israel-based studio that has worked on the project. Its only film festival appearance was in New Zealand, said Schmidt, who would not name the festivals that had rejected it. One European buyer expressed interest but said it needed to be approved by its board. That was the last he heard from them. Some interested in showing the film wanted changes to reflect a Palestinian point of view, or required that it be aired together with a Palestinian documentary, he said. Streaming services, which unlike many cable television networks have a direct-to-consumer subscriber relationship, were particularly reluctant to get involved, Schmidt said. Again, he would not specify who rejected the film. The goal wasn't to create a political controversy, but to document a moment in history. 'We are in this for the long game,' he said. They're trying to avoid its use as propaganda See It Now is open to projects that approach the war in Gaza from a Palestinian point of view, and has already taken some pitches. 'Our only qualification is that it's excellent,' Wrong said. The company has resisted outreach from Israeli groups, including one effort by the Israeli foreign ministry to show the film at the United Nations, Zirinsky said. The idea is to avoid any appearance that the work could be used as a propaganda film. Despite the complications involved, she said, 'I am very happy that we stood up to do this.' Toward the end of the film, one of the survivors says friends lost that day that 'I'm hoping that wherever they are, they're partying like crazy. And one day, we will, too.' Such a day seemed in the distant future for Eitan Halley, one of the survivors interviewed who attended a recent screening of the film in New York. He said he's determined that the truth of what happened that day get out, particularly when conspiracy theories suggest it didn't happen. He admitted to his emotional struggles, including survivor's guilt. Zirinsky suggested keeping the memories alive serve an important purpose. 'It could be your mission,' she said. 'It could be,' Halley said quietly. 'It could be.' ___ David Bauder writes about media for the AP.

The Grammys' voting body is more diverse, with 66% new members. What does it mean for the awards?	NEW YORK (AP) — For years, the Grammy Awards have been criticized over a lack of diversity — artists of color and women left out of top prizes; rap and contemporary R&amp;B stars ignored — a reflection of the Recording Academy's electorate. An evolving voting body, 66% of whom have joined in the last five years, is working to remedy that. At last year's awards, women dominated the major categories; every televised competitive Grammy went to at least one woman. It stems from a commitment the Recording Academy made five years ago: In 2019, the Academy announced it would add 2,500 women to its voting body by 2025. Under the Grammys' new membership model, the Recording Academy has surpassed that figure ahead of the deadline: More than 3,000 female voting members have been added, it announced Thursday. 'It’s definitely something that we’re all very proud of,' Harvey Mason jr., academy president and CEO, told The Associated Press. 'It tells me that we were severely underrepresented in that area.' Reform at the Record Academy dates back to the creation of a task force focused on inclusion and diversity after a previous CEO, Neil Portnow, made comments belittling women at the height of the #MeToo movement. Since 2019, approximately 8,700 new members have been added to the voting body. In total, there are now more than 16,000 members and more than 13,000 of them are voting members, up from about 14,000 in 2023 (11,000 of which were voting members). In that time, the academy has increased its number of members who identify as people of color by 63%. 'It's not an all-new voting body,' Mason assures. 'We’re very specific and intentional in who we asked to be a part of our academy by listening and learning from different genres and different groups that felt like they were being overlooked, or they weren’t being heard.' Mason says that in the last five years, the Recording Academy has 'requalified 100% of our members, which is a huge step.' There are voters who have let their membership lapse — and those who no longer qualify to be a voting member have been removed. There have been renewal review processes in the past, but under the current model, becoming a voting member requires proof of a primary career in music, two recommendations from industry peers and 12 credits in a single creative profession, at least five of which must be from the last five years. Comparisons might be made to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which announced in 2016 that it would restrict Oscars voting privileges to active members — ineligible parties included those who haven't worked in three decades since joining the Academy, unless they themselves are nominated — as a response to #OscarsSoWhite criticisms of its lack of diversity. As a result, some members protested that the new measures unjustly scapegoated older academy members. The film academy has also grown its membership, adding more women and people from underrepresented racial and ethnic communities. The Recording Academy sought to increase its voting body by reaching out to different, underrepresented communities, says Mason. 'Let’s take the time to understand why those people aren’t engaging with us, figure out how we can fix that,' he said. 'And once we fixed it, then let’s invite them or ask them if they would like to be a part of our organization. So, it was a multi-step process.' Since 2019, the Recording Academy has also seen growth in voters across different racial backgrounds: 100% growth in AAPI voters, 90% growth in Black voters and 43% growth in Latino voters. Still, Mason sees room to grow. Of the current voting membership, 66% are men, 49% are white and 66% are over the age of 40. 'Going forward, we’re going to continue the work. We’re going to continue to grow,' he says. That might not look like a public commitment to a specific figure, but Mason promises 'that our goals will be to be the most relevant, the most reflective, the most accurately representative of the music community that is humanly possible.'	https://apnews.com/article/grammy-awards-recording-academy-voting-diversity-women-c8f6d88c3821bb54efdb04fe1a3650b6	2024-10-03T06:02:51-07:00	
The Latest: Harris campaigns in Wisconsin and Trump in Michigan in battle for 'blue wall' states	Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris is opening a two-day stay in Wisconsin and Michigan, and Republican candidate Donald Trump will be in Michigan on Thursday as the two candidates grapple for wins in the 'blue wall' battleground states, which also include Pennsylvania. Liz Cheney, one of Trump’s fiercest Republican antagonists, will join Harris at a campaign event in Wisconsin on Thursday aimed at reaching out to moderate voters and rattling the former president. Cheney was the top Republican on the House committee that investigated the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection, earning Trump’s disdain and effectively exiling herself from her own party. Cheney lost her Wyoming seat to a Trump-endorsed candidate two years ago and she endorsed Harris last month. The two women will appear together in a historic white schoolhouse in Ripon, where a series of meetings held in 1854 to oppose slavery’s expansion led to the birth of the Republican Party. Harris’ visit to Wisconsin comes one day after a federal judge unsealed a 165-page court filing outlining prosecutors’ case against Trump for his attempt to overturn his 2020 election defeat. Trump has pleaded not guilty to charges of conspiracy and obstruction. Harris on Friday will hold a campaign rally in Flint, Michigan, continuing her tour of states that have been critical to Democratic victories. Trump won Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan in 2016, and Joe Biden won them in 2020. Trump on Thursday will hold a rally in Saginaw County, a bellwether in the center of the state. The Republican candidate has ramped up his focus on Michigan, holding two rallies there less than a week ago. In 2020, Biden’s win in Saginaw County by a slim 303 votes contributed to his victory in the state. Follow the AP’s Election 2024 coverage at: https://apnews.com/hub/election-2024. Here’s the latest: President Biden says he isn't concerned the 2024 presidential race is close President Joe Biden said Thursday that he wasn’t concerned the 2024 presidential race between Democratic nominee Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump was close 'It always gets this close,' he said to reporters on the South Lawn of the White House on his way to visit storm-ravaged Georgia and Florida. 'She’s gonna do fine,' he said of his vice president. Biden was also asked how Harris’ running mate Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz did in the vice presidential debate. 'The other guy lost the debate,' Biden said. 'He misrepresented everything.' Hurricane Helene brings climate change to forefront of presidential campaign The devastation wrought by Hurricane Helene has brought climate change to the forefront of the presidential campaign after the issue lingered on the margins for months. Vice President Kamala Harris traveled to Georgia Wednesday to see hard-hit areas, two days after her Republican opponent, former President Donald Trump, was in the state and criticized the federal response to the storm, which has killed at least 180 people. Thousands of people in the Carolinas still lack running water, cellphone service and electricity. President Joe Biden toured some of the hardest-hit areas by helicopter on Wednesday. Biden, who has frequently been called on to survey damage and console victims after tornadoes, wildfires, tropical storms and other natural disasters, traveled to the Carolinas to get a closer look at the hurricane devastation. He is expected to visit Georgia and Florida later this week.	https://apnews.com/article/kamala-harris-cheney-wisconsin-trump-michigan-14918e156095e691246bd84d5346562b	2024-10-03T06:02:43-07:00	
Victor Perahia, Holocaust survivor and president of French Union of Auschwitz Deportees, dies at 91	PARIS (AP) — Victor Perahia, the president of the French Union of Auschwitz Deportees and a Holocaust survivor, has died. He was 91. Perahia, who was deported as a child to the Nazi death camp of Bergen-Belsen, died on Monday in the eastern Paris suburb of Saint-Mande, the Union of Auschwitz Deportees said in a statement. The cause of death wasn't disclosed. The union hailed Perahia, as 'one of its eminent figures, who worked with great humanity and determination to preserve the memory of the Shoah' for other generations. As a child survivor of the Holocaust, the ever present 'racism and antisemitism tormented him and fueled his strength to awaken minds,' French President Emmanuel Macron said in a statement. He added: 'As a lesson for future generations, he considered human cruelty to be limitless and the duty to fight without fear against all forms of intolerance and all attacks on basic human rights.' Perahia’s death comes four months before the 80th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz death camp. Six million European Jews and people from other minorities were killed there and in other extermination camps across Europe by the Nazis and their collaborators during the Holocaust. Perahia was born on April 4, 1933 in Paris into a family of fairground merchants. He lived in Saint-Nazaire in western France. He was arrested along with his parents in July 1942. They were taken to Lande internment camp, in central France, and then to Drancy camp, in the Paris region, where nearly 4,000 people were detained by French gendarmes. He was interned in Drancy for nearly two years before he was deported to Bergen-Belsen concentration and a forced labor camp with his mother in 1944. He was freed by Soviet troops at the end of March 1945. His father, Robert Perahia, was deported to Auschwitz, where he died along with Victor Perahia's maternal grandfather. 'The witnesses are leaving us,' Joël Mergui, president of the Paris Consistory, said in a post on X. 'We must take over the fight against antisemitism.' After years of keeping silent of the horrors that he and his family had endured, Perahia published a memoir of a stolen childhood in 2015. He often recounted the trauma and suffering of the Holocaust in Paris schools and at memorials. He became president of the Union of Auschwitz Deportees France bestowed him with the Knight of the Legion of Honor and the National Order of Merit for enduring and bearing witness to unimaginable human cruelty and for preserving the memory of the Holocaust for future generations.	https://apnews.com/article/victor-perahia-dies-france-holocaust-survivor-755a92c072888480e49d474e6d94e9cf	2024-10-03T05:34:28-07:00	
Cambodian maid is arrested and deported by Malaysia for criticizing Cambodia leaders on social media	PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) — A Cambodian woman who worked as a maid in Malaysia has been deported to her homeland for comments she posted on social media criticizing Cambodian government leaders, in the latest example of a Southeast Asian government helping another arrest a dissident. A Cambodia prison official and an opposition activist group said Thursday that Nuon Toeun, 36, who had worked in Malaysia for several years, was arrested last week by Malaysian authorities following a request from the Cambodian government. Human rights groups have criticized several Southeast Asian governments for helping each other harass, detain and deport political dissidents in exile. New York-based Human Rights Watch has urged the Thai government to stop forcing political dissidents to return to their authoritarian home countries, including Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia and China, where they might face torture, persecution or death. Freedom House, a U.S.-based organization that promotes democracy, says the practice of attacking or sending back exiled dissidents 'is becoming a ‘normal’ phenomenon as more governments around the world use it to silence dissent.″ Nuth Sovana, a spokesperson for Cambodia’s prison department, said Nuon Toeun was detained at Prey Sar prison in Phnom Penh upon her arrival in Cambodia on Tuesday. She was charged with incitement to commit a felony or cause social disorder and incitement to discriminate on the basis of race religion or nationality, he said. He couldn’t provide details of the offenses she was accused of committing. If convicted on both charges, she could face up to five years in prison and a fine. Malaysian police and immigration officials couldn’t immediately be reached for comment on her deportation. Nuon Toeun is neither an opposition leader nor a well-known activist. However, Cambodia’s government has expressed concern recently about overseas critics rallying support among Cambodian expatriates. Nuon Toeun's arrest came shortly after a Cambodian investigative reporter, Mech Dara, known for exposing online scams and corruption, was charged with incitement to commit a felony for material he posted on social media. Radio Free Asia, a U.S. government-funded news service that reports extensively on Cambodia, said Nuon Toeun often used social media to criticize Cambodia’s leadership, including Prime Minister Hun Manet and his father Hun Sen, the former prime minister who is now the Senate president, over their handling of social issues. Cambodia’s government under the governing Cambodia People’s Party has long been accused of silencing critics and political opponents. Radio Free Asia said Nuon Toeun was a supporter of the opposition Cambodian National Rescue Party, which was dissolved ahead of the 2018 general election as part of a crackdown on the opposition. The Cambodian People’s Party subsequently won every seat in the National Assembly. A few days before her arrest, Nuon Toeun posted a video on Facebook in which she said she was 'expressing rage on behalf of the people living inside Cambodia,' Radio Free Asia reported. 'If I have sinned because I (have cursed) this despicable guy, I am happy to accept the sin because he has mistreated my people so badly,' she said, in a reference to Hun Sen, Radio Free Asia reported. The Khmer Movement for Democracy, a movement formed by opposition leaders in exile, condemned Nuon Toeun’s deportation from Malaysia. It said in a statement that she was working legally in Malaysia and had committed no crime except expressing her opinions. It said her deportation without due process was a 'blatant violation of international law and a grave assault on human rights.' ___ Ng reported from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.	https://apnews.com/article/cambodia-maid-deport-malaysia-dissent-80e6155380d495511a30ae6cda174878	2024-10-03T05:34:16-07:00	
Bus full of wedding guests plunges into a ravine in southwestern Pakistan, killing 7	QUETTA, Pakistan (AP) — A speeding bus carrying wedding guests plunged into a ravine in southwestern Pakistan on Thursday, killing at least seven people, officials and rescuers said. The cause of the accident near Quetta, the capital of restive Balochistan province, was not immediately known. An investigation was underway. According to Wasim Baig, a spokesman for the health department, the bodies of the victims and 17 people who were injured in the accident were brought to a local hospital. Some of the injured were said to be in critical condition. Road accidents are common in Pakistan, where highways and roads are poorly maintained and traffic laws are widely ignored. In August, 32 people were killed in two bus accidents, one in Balochistan and the other in eastern Punjab province. Authorities at the time said both accidents were caused by the negligence of the drivers. And earlier in August, 28 Pakistani pilgrims were killed in a bus crash in neighboring Iran while heading to Iraq.	https://apnews.com/article/pakistan-bus-accident-wedding-guests-balochistan-743d7e086f3705af1e3620f5324b0226	2024-10-03T05:31:47-07:00	
A gang in Haiti has killed more than 20 and injured dozens after raiding a small town, official says	PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) — Gang members attacked a small town in central Haiti early Thursday, killing more than 20 people, including children, according to a human rights group. Another 50 people were injured as the Gran Grif gang burned homes and cars in the town of Pont-Sondé, said Bertide Harace, spokeswoman for the Commission for Dialogue, Reconciliation and Awareness to Save the Artibonite. 'A lot of people ran and left the area,' she told Radio Kiskeya. A video posted on social media shows a group of people fleeing through the brush, with one woman who was out of breath saying, 'Nowhere to go. Nowhere to go.' In another video, dozens of people start running through a street after hearing rumors that the gang was approaching. Harace and others criticized police in the nearby coastal city of Saint-Marc, saying they did not mobilize to help people being attacked in Pont-Sondé. Venson François, a government prosecutor based in Saint-Marc, called the attack a 'massacre' in an interview with Radio Caraïbes. Dozens of people crowded around a hospital in Saint-Marc where the injured were taken, with one man telling reporters that local authorities are not doing enough to protect people. The attack in Pont-Sondé was blamed on the Gran Grif gang. It operates in the central Artibonite region, and experts have described it as one of Haiti’s cruelest gangs. It has gained control of more territory since 2022 under the leadership of Luckson Elan, who was sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury Department last month. In January 2023, the Gran Grif gang was accused of attacking a police station in Liancourt, located near Pont-Sondé, and killing at least six officers. Violence unleashed by the gang also forced the closure of a hospital in February 2023 that serves more than 700,000 people. Former Haitian legislator Prophane Victor, who represented the Artibonite department, began arming young men who eventually formed the Gran Grif gang to secure his election and control over the area, according to a U.N. report. The U.S. also sanctioned Victor last month. The gang has about 100 members and has been accused of crimes including murder, rape, robberies and kidnappings, according to the report. While most of the gang violence is concentrated in the capital of Port-au-Prince, it has spread in recent years to the Artibonite region, where much of Haiti's food is produced.	https://apnews.com/article/haiti-gang-attack-st-marc-pont-sonde-01154eb1daf4cbbc97b792221fce6fd5	2024-10-03T05:31:30-07:00	
Boat capsizes on a lake in eastern Congo, killing at least 50 people, witnesses say	GOMA, Congo (AP) — A boat carrying scores of passengers capsized on Lake Kivu in eastern Congo on Thursday, killing at least 50 people, witnesses told The Associated Press. It was not immediately clear exactly how many people were on board or how many perished but witnesses said they saw rescue services recover at least 50 bodies from the water. They said 10 people survived and were taken to the local hospital. The boat, overloaded with passengers, sank while trying to dock just meters (yards) away from the port of Kituku, the witnesses said. It was going from Minova in South Kivu province to Goma, in North Kivu province. Local authorities said that the rescue efforts continued and the death toll remained unknown for the moment. In February, the majority of the 50 passengers aboard a wooden boat were presumed dead after the vessel capsized on Lake Kivu. 'This boat was carrying about a hundred people when it had the capacity for about thirty passengers,' the governor of the province of South Kivu Jean-Jacques Purusi told a local radio station following the accident. It was the latest deadly boat accident in the central African country, where overcrowding on vessels is often to blame. Maritime regulations also are often not followed. Congolese officials have often warned against overloading and vowed to punish those violating safety measures for water transportation. But in remote areas where most passengers come from, many are unable to afford public transport for the few available roads. In June, an overloaded boat sank near the capital of Kinshasa and 80 passengers lost their lives. In January, 22 people died on Lake Maî-Ndombe and in April 2023, six were killed and 64 went missing on Lake Kivu. Witnesses said the boat that capsized on Thursday was visibly overcrowded. 'I was at the port of Kituku when I saw the boat arriving from Minova, full of passengers,' Francine Munyi told the AP. 'It started to lose its balance and sank into the lake. Some people threw themselves into the water.' 'Many died, and few were saved,' she added. 'I couldn’t help them because I don’t know how to swim.' The victims’ families and Goma residents gathered at the port of Kituku, accusing authorities of negligence in the face of growing insecurity in the region. Since the fighting between the armed forces and the M23 rebels made the road between the cities of Goma and Minova impassable, forcing the closure of the passage to trucks transporting food, many traders have resorted to maritime transport on Lake Kivu. It's an alternative considered safer than road traffic, which is threatened by insecurity. But according to Elia Asumani, a shipping agent who works on this line, the situation has become dangerous: 'We are afraid,' he told the AP. 'This shipwreck was predictable.' Bienfait Sematumba, 27, said he lost four family members. 'They are all dead. I am alone now,' he said, sobbing. 'If the authorities had ended the war, this shipwreck would never have happened.' The survivors, about 10 of them, were taken to Kyeshero hospital for treatment. One of them, Neema Chimanga, said she was still in shock. 'We saw the boat start to fill with water halfway,' she recounted to the AP. 'The door of the boat opened, and we tried to close it. But the water was already coming in, and the boat tilted.' 'I threw myself into the water and started swimming,' she said. 'I don’t know how I got out of the water.' ___ Kamale reported from Kinshasa, Congo.	https://apnews.com/article/congo-boat-kivu-accident-1a4cb5013e7cfcc0c77de62e9c93936e	2024-10-03T03:42:09-07:00	
Rwanda's Marburg fever deaths rise to 11 as its source is being investigated	KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) — Marburg hemorrhagic fever has killed 11 people in Rwanda, health authorities said Thursday, as the East African country searches for the source of an outbreak first traced among patients in health facilities. There are 36 confirmed cases of the disease that manifests like Ebola, with 25 of them in isolation, according to the Rwandan government's latest update. Rwanda declared the outbreak on Sept. 27 and reported six deaths a day later. Authorities said at the time that the first cases had been found among patients in health facilities and that an investigation was underway 'to determine the origin of the infection.' The source remains unclear days later, raising contagion fears in the small central African nation. Isolating patients and their contacts is key to stopping the spread of viral hemorrhagic fevers like Marburg. The World Health Organization has warned that cases in Kigali, the Rwandan capital, pose a risk of international spread because the city has an international airport and is connected by road to other cities in East Africa. Testifying to growing international concern about the outbreak, two people were isolated in the northern German city of Hamburg after returning from Rwanda, where they had been in a medical facility with Marburg virus patients, the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control said in a statement on Thursday. Both tested negative for the virus, the ECDC statement said. German media reports said that concern about the virus led authorities to cordon off two tracks at a railway station where the two people had arrived. One was a young medical student who had felt symptoms of the disease and contacted doctors from the train. In Rwanda, most of the affected people are health care workers across six out of 30 districts in Rwanda. Some patients live in districts bordering Congo, Burundi, Uganda and Tanzania, according to WHO. At least 300 people who came into contact with those confirmed to have Marburg have been identified, and an unspecified number of them are now in isolation facilities, according to Rwandan health authorities. Rwandan Health Minister Sabin Nsanzimana said Thursday that the clinical trials for vaccination would start 'within days' but failed to clarify which type of vaccine will be used. He told journalists at an Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention briefing that Rwanda is screening everyone who presents fever, head and body ache symptoms and has so far tested 2,000 people with 5,000 more test kits expected to arrive in the country. Rwandans have been urged to avoid physical contact to help curb the spread. Strict measures include the suspension of school and hospital visits as well as a restriction on the number of those who can attend funerals for Marburg victims. Home vigils aren't allowed in the event a death is linked to Marburg. The U.S. Embassy in Kigali has urged its staff to work remotely and avoid visiting offices. Like Ebola, the Marburg virus is believed to originate in fruit bats and spreads between people through close contact with the bodily fluids of infected individuals or with surfaces, such as contaminated bed sheets. Without treatment, Marburg can be fatal in up to 88% of people who fall ill with the disease. Symptoms include fever, muscle pains, diarrhea, vomiting and, in some cases, death through extreme blood loss. There is no authorized vaccine or treatment for Marburg. Marburg outbreaks and individual cases have in the past been recorded in Tanzania, Equatorial Guinea, Angola, Congo, Kenya, South Africa, Uganda and Ghana, according to WHO.

Vietnam condemns China for assault on its fishermen in the disputed South China Sea	HANOI, Vietnam (AP) — Vietnam condemned China on Thursday, saying Chinese law enforcement personnel assaulted 10 Vietnamese fishermen, damaged their fishing gear and seized about 4 tons of fish catch near the disputed Paracel Islands in the South China Sea. The fishermen reported the assault near the Chinese-controlled islands by radio on Sunday but did not identify the attackers. Three of the fishermen suffered broken limbs and the rest sustained other injuries, according to Vietnamese state media. Some were taken on stretchers to a hospital after they returned to Quang Ngai province late Monday. Vietnam’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs blamed Chinese law enforcement personnel on Thursday for the high-seas attack, saying they had 'seriously violated Vietnam’s sovereignty in the Paracel Islands,' international law and an agreement by the leaders of the two countries to better manage their territorial disputes. Chinese officials did not immediately issue a reaction. Vietnam conveyed a protest and alarm over the attack to the Chinese ambassador in the Vietnamese capital, Hanoi. Vietnam demanded that Beijing respect its sovereignty in the Paracel Islands, launch an investigation and provide it with information about the attack, Vietnamese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Pham Thu Hang said in a statement. China has become increasingly aggressive in asserting its claims in virtually the entire South China Sea, through which about $5 trillion in global trade transits each year. The sea passage is also believed to be sitting atop vast undersea deposits of oil and gas. Aside from China and the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan also have overlapping claims in the strategic waterway. The United States has no claims in the disputed waters, but has deployed Navy ships and Air Force fighter jets to patrol the waterway and promote freedom of navigation and overflight. China has warned the U.S. not to meddle in what it says is a purely Asian dispute. U.S. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said in a statement Thursday on the social media platform X that the U.S. 'is deeply concerned by reports of dangerous actions by (Chinese) law enforcement vessels against Vietnamese fishing vessels around the Paracel Islands on September 29. We call on (China) to desist from dangerous and destabilizing conduct in the South China Sea.' The Vietnamese newspaper Tien Phong cited one of the fishermen, Tran Tien Cong, as saying that two foreign boats approached them from the rear and that personnel from the vessels boarded their boat and started beating the fishermen with a meter-long (three-foot-long) pole, apparently made of iron. The Vietnamese fishermen panicked and did not fight back because they were overwhelmed by an estimated 40 attackers, it said. Another fisherman, Nguyen Thuong, was cited as saying that the attackers, who spoke through a translator, ordered them to sail back to Vietnam. The assailants then seized their fishing gear and fish catch. After being beaten, the Vietnamese fishermen were forced to kneel and were covered with plastic sheets before the attackers left. The Paracel Islands lie about 400 kilometers (250 miles) off Vietnam’s eastern coast and about the same distance from China’s southernmost province of Hainan. Both countries, along with the self-governing island of Taiwan, claim the islands. The islands have been under the de facto control of China since 1974, when Beijing seized them from Vietnam in a brief but violent naval conflict. Last year, satellite photos showed that China appeared to be building an airstrip on Triton Island in the Paracel group. At the time, it appeared the airstrip would be big enough to accommodate turboprop aircraft and drones but not fighter jets or bombers. China has also had a small harbor and buildings on the island for years, along with a helipad and radar arrays. China has refused to provide details of its island construction work other than to say it is aimed at promoting global navigation safety. It has rejected accusations, including by the U.S., that it is militarizing the sea passage.	https://apnews.com/article/china-vietnam-paracel-south-china-sea-d86889dd2fda73499602951ef3056d32	2024-10-03T01:48:30-07:00	
UK gives sovereignty of the long-contested Chagos Islands to Mauritius. A key US base remains	LONDON (AP) — The British government agreed Thursday to hand sovereignty of the long-contested Chagos Islands, an archipelago of more than 60 islands in the Indian Ocean, to Mauritius, in a deal to secure the future of a strategically important U.K.-U.S. military base. British Foreign Secretary David Lammy said the agreement will secure the future of the base at Diego Garcia, the largest in the chain of remote islands off the tip of India that has been under British control for over 50 years. The base, which is home to around 2,500 personnel, mainly Americans, has been involved in military operations including the 2003 war in Iraq and the long-running war in Afghanistan. Britain's Labour government said without the deal the secure operation of the military base would be under threat, with contested sovereignty and legal challenges, including through various international courts and tribunals. 'It will strengthen our role in safeguarding global security, shut down any possibility of the Indian Ocean being used as a dangerous illegal migration route to the U.K., as well as guaranteeing our long-term relationship with Mauritius, a close Commonwealth partner,' Lammy said. The agreement also paves the way for the potential return of the few people still alive who were forcibly displaced from their homes on the islands decades ago. As part of the deal, the U.K. will retain sovereignty of Diego Garcia for an initial period of 99 years, and will pay Mauritius an undisclosed rent. It will also create a 'resettlement' fund for displaced Chagossians aimed at letting them move back to the islands other than Diego Garcia. The Chagos Islands, which conjure up images of paradise with their lush vegetation and long stretches of white sandy beaches, have been at the heart of what Britain has called the British Indian Ocean Territory since 1965 when they were siphoned away from Mauritius, a former U.K. colony that gained independence three years later. Mauritius, which lies east of Madagascar in southern Africa, is around 2,100 kilometers (1,250 miles) southwest of the Chagos Islands. Following a lease agreement with Britain, the U.S. built the naval base at Diego Garcia for defense purposes in the 1970s. The U.S. has described the base as 'an all but indispensable platform' for security operations in the Middle East, South Asia and East Africa. Around 1,500 inhabitants from the Chagos Islands were displaced to make way for the U.S. base, in what Human Rights Watch said last year amounted to 'crimes against humanity committed by a colonial power against an indigenous people.' Chagossian Voices, a U.K.-based group representing the Chagossian diaspora around the world, voiced disappointment that the negotiations excluded those displaced. 'Chagossians have learned this outcome from the media and remain powerless and voiceless in determining our own future and the future of our homeland.' it said in a statement on social media. 'The views of Chagossians, the indigenous inhabitants of the islands, have been consistently and deliberately ignored and we demand full inclusion in the drafting of the treaty.' The agreement will have to be signed off in a treaty and is dependent on legal processes being finalized. Both sides have committed to complete this as quickly as possible. A spokesman for British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said he spoke to his Mauritius counterpart, Pravind Jugnauth, on Thursday morning, welcoming the agreement after two years of negotiations that began under the previous Conservative government. '56 years after our independence, the decolonization is finally complete,' Jugnauth said in a televised address to the nation later Thursday. The Mauritius government said that the treaty will aim to resolve all outstanding issues related to the islands, including 'its former inhabitants,' as well as addressing 'the wrongs of the past.' It laid out the hope that those displaced who are still alive and their descendants, who are mainly living in the U.K., Mauritius and the Seychelles, will have a right to return, as it is now 'free' to implement a resettlement program on the islands except Diego Garcia. It added that the U.K. will financially support the Chagossians, who have fought a long-running legal battle about their displacement, most recently in 2016 when they lost out in a Supreme Court ruling in the U.K. At the time, the previous Conservative government refused their right to return but voiced its 'deep regret' for the way the Chagossian community had been mistreated in the 1960s and 1970s. Over the years, the Chagossians and Mauritius have garnered increasing international support, notably among African nations and within the United Nations. In 2019, in an advisory option that was non-binding, the International Court of Justice ruled that the U.K. had unlawfully carved up Mauritius when it agreed to end colonial rule in the late 1960s. In a statement, the White House said President Joe Biden applauded the 'historic agreement' on the status of the Chagos Islands. 'The agreement secures the effective operation of the joint facility on Diego Garcia into the next century,' the statement said. In the U.K., Conservative lawmakers standing to be leader of Britain's opposition party expressed dismay at the decision to hand over sovereignty of all but one of the islands. They were criticized for the comments, given that the previous Conservative government started the negotiations. One of the candidates, Tom Tugenhat, said he has consistently opposed any plan to hand over sovereignty of the islands and warned that the move could see Mauritius potentially leasing one of the islands to China. 'This is a shameful retreat undermining our security and leaving our allies exposed,' he said. ___ Gerald Imray in Cape Town, South Africa, contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/uk-mauritius-chagos-diego-garcia-base-37d13bf54f9769f3621bd41d08a448f8	2024-10-03T01:42:28-07:00	
Dutch airline KLM plans 'painful' cost-cutting to combat high costs and staff shortages	THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — Dutch airline KLM announced a 'painful' round of cost-cutting and other measures Thursday aimed at boosting the carrier's finances as it continues to recover from the COVID pandemic that grounded planes worldwide. CEO Marjan Rintel said KLM, along with many other airlines, 'is suffering from high costs and shortages of staff and equipment. Our aircraft are full, but our capacity is still not back to pre-corona levels.' The Dutch carrier is part of the Air France-KLM group that had a 7.1 billion-euro ($8.4 billion) loss in 2020 as the global pandemic grounded planes and halted travel plans worldwide, causing a 67% slump in passenger numbers. KLM said the package of measures is intended to improve its operating result by 450 million euros ($497 million) in the short term. It did not reveal if the changes would lead to staff cuts, but said it aims to 'protect jobs across the company as much as possible.' 'This is painful for every KLM colleague, but it is necessary, and it has to be done now,' Rintel said in a statement. The cost-cutting will also help clear the way for investments in rejuvenating KLM's fleet to buy quieter and more fuel-efficient planes, said chief financial officer Bas Brouns. Among the planned measures, KLM said it wants to increase productivity, reduce the impact of pilot shortages and achieve a better balance between European and long-haul flights and look at the option of outsourcing some maintenance. It also is reconsidering or postponing many planned investments and exploring options to outsource, divest or halt 'activities that do not directly contribute to flight operations.'	https://apnews.com/article/klm-airline-costcutting-netherlands-aviation-a3ea88ad98c154833948af2fc9c2ba93	2024-10-03T00:43:10-07:00	
Rare Israeli strike in central Beirut kills 7 as troops battle Hezbollah in southern Lebanon	BEIRUT (AP) — An Israeli airstrike on an apartment in central Beirut killed seven Hezbollah-affiliated civilian first responders. Israel has been pounding areas of the country where the militant group has a strong presence since late September, but has rarely struck in the heart of the capital. There was no warning before the strike late Wednesday, which hit an apartment in central Beirut not far from the United Nations headquarters, the prime minister’s office and parliament. Hezbollah’s civil defense unit said seven of its members were killed. In a separate development, the Israeli military ordered the evacuation of villages and towns in southern Lebanon that are north of a United Nations-declared buffer zone established after the 2006 war. The warnings issued Thursday signaled a possible broadening of Israel’s incursion into southern Lebanon, which until now has been confined to areas close to the border. At least eight Israeli soldiers were killed in clashes with Hezbollah in southern Lebanon, where Israel announced the start of what it says is a limited ground incursion earlier this week. The region was meanwhile bracing for Israeli retaliation following an Iranian ballistic missile attack. Residents reported a sulfur-like smell following strike in Beirut, and Lebanon’s state-run National News Agency accused Israel of using phosphorous bombs, without providing evidence. Human rights groups have in the past accused Israel of using white phosphorus incendiary shells on towns and villages in southern Lebanon. The Israeli military did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Hezbollah has an armed wing with tens of thousands of fighters but it also has a political movement and a network of charities staffed by civilians. In a separate development, Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen said they had launched two drones at Tel Aviv overnight. The military said it identified two drones off the coast of the bustling metropolitan area, shooting one of them down while the other fell in the Mediterranean Sea. The escalating violence in Lebanon has opened a second front in the war between Israel and Iran-backed militants that began nearly a year ago with Hamas’ surprise Oct. 7 attack from the Gaza Strip into Israel. The Israeli military said Thursday that it killed a senior Hamas leader in an airstrike in the Gaza Strip around three months ago. It said that a strike on an underground compound in northern Gaza killed Rawhi Mushtaha and two other Hamas commanders. There was no immediate comment from Hamas. Mushtaha was a close associate of Yahya Sinwar, the top leader of Hamas who helped mastermind the Oct. 7 attack. Sinwar is believed to be alive and in hiding inside Gaza. In recent weeks, Israelis strikes in Lebanon have killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and several of his top commanders. Hundreds more airstrikes across large parts of Lebanon since mid-September have killed at least 1,276 people, according to Lebanon’s Health Ministry. The Israeli military said Thursday that it had struck around 200 Hezbollah targets across Lebanon, including weapons storage facilities and observation posts. It said the strikes killed at least 15 Hezbollah fighters. There was no independent confirmation. Hundreds of thousands of people have fled their homes, as Israel has warned people to evacuate from around 50 villages and towns in the south, telling them to relocate to areas that are around 60 kilometers (36 miles) from the border and considerably farther north than a U.N.-declared buffer zone. Israel says it is targeting Hezbollah after nearly a year of rocket attacks that began on Oct. 8 and have displaced some 60,000 Israelis from communities in the north. Israel has carried out retaliatory strikes over the past year that have displaced tens of thousands on the Lebanese side. The vast majority of recent strikes have been in areas where Hezbollah has a strong presence, including the southern suburbs of Beirut known as the Dahiyeh. But Israel has also carried out strikes in Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon, and a strike in central Beirut earlier this week killed three Palestinian militants. Hezbollah, Hamas and the Houthis are part of the Iran-led Axis of Resistance, which also includes armed groups in Syria and Iraq. They have launched attacks on Israel in solidarity with the Palestinians, drawing retaliation in a cycle that has repeatedly threatened to set off a wider war. The region once again appears on the brink of such a conflict after Iran’s missile attack on Tuesday, which it said was a response to the killing of Nasrallah, an Iranian Revolutionary Guard general who was with him, and Ismail Haniyeh, the political leader of Hamas, who was killed in an explosion in Tehran in July that was widely blamed on Israel. Both Israel and the United States have said there will be severe consequences for the missile attack, which lightly wounded two people and killed a Palestinian in the occupied West Bank. The United States has rushed military assets to the region in support of Israel. ___ Jeffery reported from Jerusalem.

12 injured after a Russian glide bomb smashes into a Ukrainian apartment building	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — A Russian glide bomb struck a five-story apartment block in Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, injuring at least 12 people including a 3-year-old girl, local officials said Thursday. The bomb hit between the third and fourth floors of the building on Wednesday night, igniting blazes, Kharkiv regional Gov. Oleh Syniehubov said. Firefighters searched for survivors through smoke and rubble. The city of Kharkiv, located around 30 kilometers (18 miles) from the Russian border, has been a frequent target of aerial attacks throughout the war against Russia that is now deep into its third year. Glide bombs have become an increasingly common weapon in the war. They have terrorized civilians and bludgeoned the Ukrainian army’s front-line defenses. They were a key weapon in Russia’s capture of the tactically significant town of Vuhledar on Wednesday, as Russian forces wreak destruction on the eastern Donetsk region and force weary Ukrainian troops to withdraw from obliterated towns and villages. Ukraine has no effective countermeasure for glide bombs, which are launched from Russian aircraft inside Russia. Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the latest Kharkiv attack highlighted the urgent need for increased support from Ukraine’s Western allies. Zelensky recently held talks with officials in the United States in an effort to ensure further Western military support. Russia has had the battlefield initiative since late last year, when a Ukrainian counteroffensive petered out. Ukraine is grappling with a critical manpower problem on the front line and is straining to hold back Russia’s grinding assaults. Though Russia’s battlefield gains have been incremental, its steady forward movement is adding up as the Ukrainians are pushed backward and yield ground. Both sides have kept up regular cross-border aerial attacks, usually at night. Ukraine’s air force said Thursday that 78 out of 105 Shahed drones launched by Russia overnight were destroyed on Thursday as 15 regions of the country came under attack. The Russian military, meanwhile, intercepted 113 Ukrainian drones overnight, according to a statement by the Defense Ministry in Moscow. The drones were destroyed over four Russian regions on the border with Ukraine —Belgorod, Bryansk, Kursk and Voronezh, it said. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-kharkiv-glide-bombs-a4436a45d74456f0f199095442765957	2024-10-02T23:54:40-07:00	
Georgian parliament speaker signs anti-LGBTQ law after president refuses to sign it	TBILISI, Georgia (AP) — The speaker of the Georgian parliament signed into a law Thursday a bill that severely curtails LGBTQ+ rights in the country and mirrors legislation adopted in neighboring Russia. Shalva Papuashvili, the parliament speaker, said on social media that the legislation does 'not reflect current, temporary, changing ideas and ideologies, but is based on common sense, historical experience and centuries-old Christian, Georgian and European values.' Georgian President Salome Zourabichvili had refused to sign the bill and returned it to parliament on Wednesday. It was introduced by the governing Georgian Dream party and approved by lawmakers last month. The bill includes bans on same-sex marriages, adoptions by same-sex couples and public endorsement and depictions of LGBTQ+ relations and people in the media. It also bans gender-affirming care and changing gender designations in official documents. 'This law protects the rights of all citizens, including freedom of expression, so that the rights of others are not violated, which is the essence and idea of ​​true democracy,' Papuashvili wrote. Parliament gave the legislation its final approval as Georgia, a largely conservative country where the Orthodox Church wields significant influence, prepares to vote in a parliamentary election. The law has been widely seen as an effort by the governing party to shore up support among conservative groups. It was decried by human rights advocates and LGBTQ+ activists, who said it further marginalized an already vulnerable community. The law has drawn comparisons with Russia, where the Kremlin has been highlighting what it calls traditional family values. Russian authorities in the last decade have banned public endorsement of 'nontraditional sexual relations' and introduced laws against gender-affirming care, among other measures. Its Supreme Court effectively outlawed LGBTQ+ activism by labeling what the authorities called the LGBTQ+ 'movement' operating in Russia as an extremist organization and banning it. In Georgia, the LGBTQ+ community has struggled even before the legislation was introduced. Demonstrations and violent outbursts against LGBTQ+ people have been common, and last year hundreds of opponents of gay rights stormed an LGBTQ+ festival in the Georgian capital, Tbilisi, forcing the event’s cancellation. This year, tens of thousands marched in Tbilisi to promote 'traditional family values.' A day after parliament gave its final approval to the anti-LGBTQ+ bill, transgender actor and model Kesaria Avramidze was stabbed to death in her apartment in Tbilisi. Rights advocates had worried that the bill would stoke more violence. Papuashvili, the parliament speaker, said that by not signing the bill, President Zourabichvili and the Georgian opposition 'did not have enough courage to openly express their opinion regarding this law.' Some analysts say parts of the Georgian opposition are walking a fine line ahead of the Oct. 26 election between condemning the move to curtail LGBTQ+ rights and not wanting to alienate some voters. Zourabichvili has long been at odds with the governing party and vetoed a 'foreign influence' law adopted by parliament earlier this year. She was overridden by parliament, where Georgian Dream dominates. The measure requires media and nongovernmental organizations to register as 'pursuing the interests of a foreign power' if they receive more than 20% of their funding from abroad. It ignited weeks of protests and was widely criticized as threatening democratic freedoms. Those opposing the law compared it to similar legislation in Russia which is routinely used to suppress dissent, and accused the governing party of acting in concert with Moscow, jeopardizing Georgia’s chances of joining the European Union. The South Caucasus nation of 3.7 million formally applied to join the EU in 2022, after Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, but the bloc halted its accession in response to the 'foreign influence' law and froze some of its financial support. The United States imposed sanctions on dozens of Georgian officials in response to the law. Georgian Dream was set up by Bidzina Ivanishvili, a shadowy billionaire who made his fortune in Russia and served briefly as Georgia’s prime minister in 2012. It promised to restore civil rights and 'reset' relations with Moscow, which fought a brief war with Georgia in 2008 over the breakaway province of South Ossetia. Russia then recognized the independence of South Ossetia and another breakaway Georgian province, Abkhazia, and established military bases there. Many Georgians backed Ukraine as Kyiv battled Russia’s invasion in 2022. But the Georgian government abstained from joining sanctions against Moscow, barred dozens of Kremlin critics from entering the country, and accused the West of trying to drag Georgia into open conflict with Russia. The opposition has accused the governing party of steering the country into Russia’s orbit to the detriment of its European aspirations.	https://apnews.com/article/georgia-lgbtq-rights-crackdown-election-2cac5aea651c0380d6a2829aa28c4697	2024-10-02T23:19:06-07:00	
Taiwan hospital fire leaves at least 9 dead as typhoon batters island's south	TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) — A fire at a hospital in southern Taiwan killed at least nine people Thursday as the island was being battered by a typhoon. The fire occurred in Pingtung county, which has been hit hard by Typhoon Krathon, which made landfall in the afternoon with torrential rains and heavy winds and has brought parts of the island to a standstill. Those who died inhaled smoke from the fire, the source of which was still under investigation. Soldiers from a nearby base were mobilized to aid medical workers and firefighters in the evacuation of patients and putting out the flames. Reports said 176 patients were rushed to the front entrance and transferred to ambulances or tarps, used to shield them from the pouring rain. They were moved to shelters nearby. Krathon made landfall in the major port city of Kaohsiung, packing winds of 126 kph (78 mph) with higher gusts, according to Taiwan’s weather authorities. The slow-moving typhoon has doused eastern and southern parts of the island over the past five days, forcing thousands to evacuate from mountainous or low-lying areas. The weather administration has Kaohsiung and Pingtung County residents to not go outside when the eye of the storm passes above their area. Flooding and high winds have caused considerable damage to industries from fishing to to chemicals, while cutting off transportation routes and electrical networks. Taiwan has made considerable progress in fireproofing public facilities in recent years by banning smoking and boosting implimentation of building regulations. ___ This version has corrected the spelling of Pingtung county.	https://apnews.com/article/taiwan-hospital-fire-deaths-typhoon-efb59c48d91dd9676ab2b6e91bb3d9ae	2024-10-02T20:46:57-07:00	
This German church is the tallest in the world. Until Spain's La Sagrada Familia is done, anyway	ULM, Germany (AP) — The Ulmer Münster in southern Germany is the world's tallest church. For now, anyway. The Gothic-style Lutheran church's reign — begun in May 31, 1890 — could end in 2025, when La Sagrada Familia Basilica's 'Tower of Jesus Christ' in Spain is set to be completed. At an eventual 172.5 meters (about 566 feet) high, the Catholic basilica in Barcelona should inch out the Ulmer Münster by a mere 11 meters (36 feet). But La Sagrada Familia 's construction has taken 142 years and counting. The ultimate completion could come in 2026, 100 years since the death of the original Catalan architect, Antoni Gaudí. Ironically, when the basilica reaches its final height, it will be thanks to a 17-meter (55.77-foot) cross that was made by a German company. Still, the Ulmer Münster's lead pastor isn't upset. 'I don’t find it all that fascinating that it is the highest church tower in the world,' Dean Torsten Krannich told The Associated Press. 'The church also lifts my heart up to God. This is simply a wonderful church that invites you to pray and be thankful.' After all, Ulm will always have Albert Einstein. The physicist was born there in 1879 and lived in Ulm for the first 15 months of his life. His extended family remained, and he returned and climbed the church's tower in 1923. In addition to a stained glass window inside the Ulmer Münster that features Einstein and other famous scientists, the head of communications for Ulm's tourism board is quick to point out that the rest of the city has 'a very high density of art and culture.' 'We can inspire the guests who come here even when we no longer have the highest church in the world, but only have the second-highest,' Dirk Homburg said. The Ulmer Münster's history dates to 1377, when Ulm's citizens decided to demolish their old parish church. Located outside the city gates, it could be a perilous trek for congregants during the frequent wars of the Middle Ages. The residents chose to finance the building of a new one in the city's center themselves, and planned for it to have the highest spire in the world. Construction paused in 1543 when, in the wake of the Protestant Reformation, the city's leaders decided to stop the work amid political and economic turbulence. Building resumed in 1844 and by May 31, 1890, the church was complete. Reaching a record 161.5 meters (530 feet) high, the Ulmer Münster was built deliberately to be taller than the Cologne Cathedral in northwest Germany — which topped out at 157.2 meters (516 feet) in 1880. Although Ulm was destroyed by a World War II bombing raid in 1944, the church itself remained upright. But the Ulmer Münster’s age, as well as weather impacts and some 1 million annual visitors, mean that construction and restoration occur constantly amid tourism and religious services. For example, visitors can currently climb 560 stairs to the viewing platform at 102 meters (335 feet). The platform at 143 meters (469 feet) — 768 stairs — is closed due to stairwell repairs. Krannich said it remains special regardless. 'Whether the tower is now 5 meters (16.4 feet) higher or 5 meters lower, it doesn’t matter to the quality of this church,' he said. Ursula Heckler, a two-time visitor to the church, said she initially journeyed to Ulm in 2019 because she, like many others who trek there, knew it was the world’s tallest. She doesn't plan to visit La Sagrada Familia when it takes over. Christos Kalokerinos, a native Ulmer, is unruffled by the looming loss of status. 'There are so many other nice things about the Münster that it’s not really relevant,' he said. 'I think most people think that way, too. But of course it was also great to brag a bit about the fact that we have the highest church tower — because many, many people don’t necessarily know Ulm that way.' Indeed, there are few indications of the record in the city. The gift shop inside the church just has a fake fireplace labeled 'the world's tallest church,' and the only reference in a tourism store across the street appeared to be a postcard stacking the church's height up against the Great Pyramid of Giza, Big Ben and the Statue of Liberty. All are shorter than the Ulmer Münster. Apparently the region's residents, known as Swabians, 'prefer understatement.' 'They don’t want to tell everyone that they’re the greatest,' Krannich said. 'Not everyone needs to know. It’s enough if we know it.' But next year? 'We're going to involve Albert Einstein a bit more in our marketing,' Homburg said. ___ AP journalist Kirsten Grieshaber contributed to this report. ___ Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

Middle East latest: Israeli strike kills at least 6 in Beirut as foreign nationals evacuate	At least six people were killed in an Israeli airstrike on an apartment building in Beirut overnight, Lebanon’s Health Ministry said, as governments around the world scrambled to evacuate their citizens from the country. Israel was pursuing a ground incursion into Lebanon against Hezbollah while conducting strikes in Gaza that killed dozens, including children. The Israeli military said eight soldiers have died in the conflict in southern Lebanon. On Wednesday, the United Nations Security Council held an emergency meeting Wednesday to address the spiraling conflict in Middle East. Iran’s ambassador to the U.N. said his country launched nearly 200 missiles at Israel on Tuesday as a deterrent to further Israeli violence, while his Israeli counterpart called the barrage an 'unprecedented act of aggression.' Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed late Tuesday to retaliate, and an Iranian commander threatened wider strikes on infrastructure if Israel did so. U.S. President Biden said Wednesday that he would not support an Israeli attack targeting Iran’s nuclear program. Israel and Hezbollah have traded fire across the Lebanon border almost daily since the day after Hamas’ cross-border attack on Oct. 7, 2023, which killed 1,200 Israelis and took 250 others hostage. Israel declared war on the militant group in the Gaza Strip in response. More than 41,000 Palestinians have been killed in the territory, and just over half the dead have been women and children, according to local health officials. ___ Here is the latest: Japan readies military jets for evacuations TOKYO — Japan on Thursday dispatched two Self Defense Force planes to prepare for a possible airlift of Japanese citizens from Lebanon. Two C-2 transport aircraft are expected to arrive in Jordan and Greece on Friday, Japan NHK national television reported. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi told reporters that there has been no report of injury involving the about 50 Japanese nationals in Lebanon. Japan dispatched SDF aircraft in October and November 2023 to evacuate more than 100 Japanese and South Korean citizens from Israel. Australia plans evacuation flights from Lebanon SYDNEY — Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong said on Thursday her government had booked 500 seats on commercial aircraft for Australian citizens, permanent residents and their families to leave Lebanon on Saturday. The seats are available to 1,700 Australians and their families known to be in Lebanon on two flights from Beirut to Cyprus, Wong said.

Lebanon’s Health Ministry raises death toll to 6 from airstrike near central Beirut BEIRUT — Lebanon’s Health Ministry raised the death toll to six from an Israeli airstrike on an apartment building near the center of Beirut late Wednesday night. It said seven people were injured in the attack. The airstrike hit near the residential Bashoura district. The previous death toll had been two with 11 people injured. Residents reported a sulfur-like smell following the attack, and Lebanon’s state-run National News Agency accused Israel of using internationally banned phosphorous bombs. Human rights groups have in the past accused Israel of using white phosphorus incendiary shells on towns and villages in conflict-hit southern Lebanon. Lebanon’s Health Ministry says 2 killed in Israeli airstrike in central Beirut BEIRUT — At least two people have been killed in an Israeli airstrike on an apartment building in the Lebanese capital, Lebanon’s Health Ministry says. A further 11 people were wounded in the attack in Beirut late Wednesday, the ministry says. The airstrike started a fire in an apartment in a multistory building in the residential Bashoura district, not far from the United Nations headquarters, the prime minister’s office and parliament. Ambulances rushed to the scene. Hezbollah’s Al-Manar TV station says the strike targeted a center of the group’s health unit. There was no warning issued ahead of the strike. Israel’s UN ambassador calls Iran a ‘danger to the world’ UNITED NATIONS — Israel’s U.N. ambassador said Wednesday that the 'the time for empty calls for de-escalation is over.' Danny Danon told an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council that 'Iran’s true face is one of terror, death and chaos.' 'This is no longer a matter of words,' he said. 'Iran is a very real and present danger to the world, and if they are not stopped, the next wave of missiles will not be aimed solely at Israel,' he said. He called Iran’s missile barrage aimed at Israel on Tuesday 'a cold-blooded attack against 10 million civilians' and 'an unprecedented act of aggression.' Danon stressed that Israel will not stop until all of the hostages taken by Hamas and other militants are back in Israel. 'Let the world understand: Israel will defend itself, and we will do so with justice and strength,' he said. Iran’s UN ambassador says Iran has ‘consistently pursued peace and stability’ UNITED NATIONS – Iran’s U.N. ambassador says Iran had to launch a barrage of missiles at Israel to 'restore balance' after escalating Israeli violence in the region. Amir Saeid Iravani told an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council on Wednesday that the missile attack Tuesday was 'a necessary and proportionate response to Israel’s continued terrorist aggressive acts over the past two months.' He says Iran has 'consistently pursued peace and stability' and that Israel sees Iranian restraint 'not as a gesture of goodwill but as a weakness to exploit.' 'Each act of restraint taken by Iran has only emboldened Israel to commit greater crimes and more acts of aggression,' Iravani said. 'Consequently, Iran’s response was necessary to restore balance and deterrence.' He also accused the United States of complicity 'in Israel’s crimes' by helping to arm the nation after the Oct. 7 attacks by Hamas in southern Israel.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hezbollah-hamas-latest-mideast-3-october-2024-261671df3829423c4c9f4e6c8806be2a	2024-10-02T19:42:51-07:00	
Stock market today: Asian shares are mixed and the yen slips against the dollar	Asian shares were mixed on Thursday after U.S. stocks were little changed as investors watched to see developments in the Middle East. The U.S. dollar gained against the Japanese yen as officials downplayed the likelihood of an interest rate hike soon. That helped push Tokyo's Nikkei 225 index higher. It gained 2.2% to 38,655.03, while the dollar traded at 146.80 Japanese yen, up from 146.41 yen late Wednesday. The dollar had been trading around 142 yen after the ruling Liberal Democrats chose Shigeru Ishiba to head the party and succeed Fumio Kishida as prime minister. Ishiba had expressed support for the central bank's recent moves to raise its near-zero benchmark interest rate, which stands at around 0.25%. That led traders to bet that the yen would gain in value. But after a meeting between Ishiba and Bank of Japan Gov. Kazuo Ueda, both officials indicated that the central bank did not view further rate hikes as suitable for the economy at this time. That prompted a flurry of selling of yen. The meeting between Ishiba and Ueda was not expected to bring major news, however, 'when Ishiba hinted that growing global risks should keep the BoJ firmly grounded, yen bulls hit the exits faster than you can say ‘sayonara,’' Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management said in a commentary. Elsewhere in Asia, Hong Kong's Hang Seng dropped 3.5% to 21,661.99 as investors locked in profits after it roared 6.2% higher a day earlier on a wave of investor enthusiasm over recent announcements from Beijing to rev up the Chinese economy. With Shanghai and other markets in China closed for a weeklong holiday, trading has crowded into Hong Kong. Markets in South Korea and Taiwan also were closed. India's Sensex fell 0.7%. Oil prices rose again as the world waited to see how Israel will respond to Tuesday’s missile attack from Iran. U.S. benchmark crude oil gained 73 cents to $70.83 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude, the international standard, was up 67 cents to $74.57 per barrel. Israel is not a major producer of oil, but Iran is, and a worry is that a broadening war could affect neighboring countries that are also integral to the flow of crude. On Wednesday, Wall Street benchmarks ended little changed amid uncertainty over conflict in the Middle East. The S&amp;P 500 gained less than 1 point, to 5,709.54, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average edged up 0.1% to 42,196.52. The Nasdaq composite added 0.1% to 17,925.12. In the bond market, Treasury yields rose after a report indicated hiring by U.S. employers outside the government may have been stronger last month than expected. The report from ADP Research said private-sector employers accelerated their hiring in September. That could be an encouraging signal for the more comprehensive report on the U.S. job market due to arrive Friday from the U.S. government. The dominant question hanging over Wall Street has been whether the job market can keep holding up after the Federal Reserve earlier kept interest rates at a two-decade high. The Fed was trying to press the brakes hard enough on the economy to stamp out high inflation. Stocks are near records in large part on the belief that the U.S. economy will continue to grow now that the Federal Reserve has shifted to cutting interest rates. The Fed last month lowered its main interest rate for the first time in more than four years and indicated more cuts will arrive through next year. Nike sank 6.8% even though the athletic giant reported stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. Its revenue fell short of forecasts, and the slump shows how much work incoming CEO Elliott Hill has in making the brand cool among customers. Tesla sank 3.5% despite reporting an increase in its deliveries of electric vehicles during the latest quarter, the first time that’s happened this year. The number topped analysts’ forecasts, but investors may have been expecting an even bigger increase. Also early Thursday, the euro fell to $1.1038 from $1.1047.	https://apnews.com/article/stock-markets-rates-yen-iran-8c9ee16a53152dcb07bafd0051c3de93	2024-10-02T19:30:11-07:00	
Takeaways from The Associated Press' report on lost shipping containers	LONG BEACH, Wash. (AP) — From clothes to metals used for manufacturing, most of the world’s everyday goods and raw materials moved over long distances are packed in large metal boxes the size of tractor-trailers and stacked on ships. Millions of containers cross the oceans every year. Not everything gets to its destination. The Associated Press looked at what happens to the thousands of shipping containers that fall off ships and are lost at sea. Why do shipping container spills happen? Sometimes hundreds of shipping containers are lost at once in storms or wrecks. Sometimes just a few containers go overboard. The fact that ships have been getting bigger over recent years has contributed to the problem. 'On the modern big ships, it’s like a high-rise building,' said Jos Koning, a senior project manager at MARIN, a Netherlands-based maritime research organization that studies shipping risks. Today’s largest cargo vessels are longer than three football fields. Cranes are used to lift containers and stack them in towering columns. When the industry took off some 50 years ago, ships could hold only about a tenth of the freight that today’s huge ships carry. Greater size brings heightened risks. The largest ships are more difficult to maneuver and more prone to rolling in high waves. There’s a greater chance that any single box could be damaged and crushed. Such accidents can send a container stack cascading into the sea. Accidents are often linked to cargo that has been inaccurately labeled, weighed or stored. But cargo ship operators don’t have the capacity to verify all container weights and contents, and must rely on information that shippers provide. In a pilot study, the National Cargo Bureau, a nonprofit that works with the U.S. Coast Guard to inspect seagoing cargo, found that widespread mislabeling and improper stowage meant that nearly 70% of shipping containers arriving in the U.S. with dangerous goods failed the bureau’s safety inspection. 'Despite all these problems, most of the time it arrives safely,' said Ian Lennard, president of the National Cargo Bureau. How often do shipping container spills happen? There’s no clear answer. According to one trade group, at least 20,000 shipping containers have tumbled overboard in the last decade and a half. But tracking efforts are fragmented and incomplete. A few shipwrecks and disasters grab headlines, like the March crash of a cargo ship into a Baltimore bridge. But much less is known about how often containers are lost piecemeal or away from major ports. The most widely cited figures on lost shipping containers come from the World Shipping Council. The group’s membership, which carries about 90% of global container traffic, self-reports their losses in a survey each year. Over 16 years of collected data through 2023, the group said an average of 1,480 containers were lost annually – but fewer in recent years. Their recent figures show 650 containers were lost in 2022 and only about 200 last year. But spills involving shippers that aren’t members of the council aren’t included in the tally. For example, not included in the 2023 total were 1,300 containers that sank near a Taiwanese port with the cargo ship Angel. What happens to containers that go overboard? Marine biologist Andrew DeVogelaere of California’s Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary has spent 15 years studying the environmental impacts of a single container that was found in sanctuary waters. 'We are leaving time capsules on the bottom of the sea of everything we buy and sell – sitting down there for maybe hundreds of years,' he said. 'The first thing that happens is they land and crush everything underneath them,' said DeVogelaere. Debris that washed ashore in Long Beach, Washington, matched items lost off the giant cargo ship ONE Apus in November 2020. When the ship hit heavy swells on a voyage from China to California, nearly 2,000 containers slid into the Pacific. Court documents and industry reports show the vessel was carrying more than $100,000 worth of bicycle helmets and thousands of cartons of Crocs, as well as electronics and other more hazardous goods: batteries, ethanol and 54 containers of fireworks. Researchers mapped the flow of debris to several Pacific coastlines thousands of miles apart, including in Washington state and the remote Midway Atoll, a national wildlife refuge for millions of seabirds near the Hawaiian Islands. In Sri Lanka, the consequences linger three years after a massive fire aboard the X-Press Pearl sank the container ship a few miles offshore. The disaster dumped more than 1,400 damaged shipping containers into the sea — releasing billions of plastic manufacturing pellets known as nurdles as well as thousands of tons of nitric acid, lead, methanol and sodium hydroxide, all toxic to marine life. Hemantha Withanage remembers how the beach near his home smelled of burnt chemicals. Volunteers soon collected thousands of dead fish, gills stuffed with chemical-laced plastic, and nearly 400 dead endangered sea turtles, more than 40 dolphins and six whales, their mouths jammed with plastic. 'It was like a war zone,' he said. Cleanup crews wearing full-body hazmat suits strode into the tide with hand sieves to try to collect the lentil-size plastic pellets. The waterfront was closed to commercial fishing for three months, and the 12,000 families that depend on fishing for their income have only gotten a fraction of the $72 million that Withanage, founder of Sri Lanka’s nonprofit Centre for Environmental Justice, believes they are owed. There’s still an impact. This year’s summer winds washed thousands of plastic pellets ashore. Why are some shipping container losses not reported? Lloyd’s List Intelligence, a maritime intelligence company that’s tracked thousands of marine accidents on container ships over the past decade, told AP that underreporting is rampant. Marine insurers, which are typically on the hook to pay for mishaps, likely have access to more complete data on losses – but no laws require that data to be collected and shared publicly. World Shipping Council president Joe Kramek said the industry is researching ways to reduce errors in loading and stacking containers, as well as navigating ships through turbulent waters Earlier this year, the United Nations’ International Maritime Organization adopted amendments to two global ocean treaties aimed at increasing transparency around lost shipping containers. Those changes, expected to take effect in 2026, will require ships to report losses to nearby coastal countries and to authorities where the vessel is registered. But with no enforceable penalties, it remains to be seen how extensively operators will comply. ___ Larson and Wieffering reported from Washington, D.C.

A small town in central Thailand is mourning the 23 who died in a school bus fire	LAN SAK, Thailand (AP) — A small town in central Thailand prepared for a somber mass funeral Thursday for the 23 children and teachers who died in a horrific bus fire while on a school trip. Some residents and monks waited past midnight at Wat Khao Phraya Sangkharam, the Buddhist temple in Lan Sak town in Uthai Thani province, to receive the bodies of the dead returned from Bangkok. Also arriving back were relatives of the dead who went to the Thai capital to help identify the severely burned victims. The school the children attended is on the temple grounds, a common location for schools in much of rural Thailand. In the school’s assembly hall, florists came early to build a large display of white flowers in front of a line of coffins with portraits of the dead. An elderly woman wept in front of a photo of a 14-year-old boy before limping away, tears streaming down her face and and hands tightly clutching a black plastic bag. Relatives put food, snacks and beverages as offerings on top of the coffins — an act of respect symbolically sending nourishment and blessings to those who died. The afternoon funeral was to be attended by the head of Thailand’s Privy Council as a representative of the royal family. King Maha Vajiralongkorn has declared a royal cremation ceremony will be held for the victims next week. Six teachers and 39 elementary and junior high school students were on the bus that caught fire Tuesday on a highway in suburban Bangkok. It spread so quickly, only 22 were able to escape. On social media, parents have expressed nervousness about sending children on school field trips as well as deep outrage about potential safety lapses. Police were investigating whether the fire was caused by negligence and filed several initial charges against the driver, including reckless driving and failing to stop to help others. Police have not determined the cause but say the driver told them a front tire malfunctioned and the vehicle then scraped a concrete highway barrier. The sparks from the friction might have set off highly flammable gas canisters on the bus, police said. The bus had 11 gas canisters inside, but a permit to install only six. Many Thai vehicles use compressed natural gas for fuel. The bus company owner had told public broadcaster ThaiPBS the gas cylinders had passed safety standards. Thailand’s Department of Land Transport was implementing urgent inspections of all natural gas-fueled buses. The department also will upgrade its safety guidelines to require crisis management training for drivers and safety inspection when such vehicles are to be commissioned by schools, said Seksom Akraphand, the agency’s deputy director-general.	https://apnews.com/article/thailand-school-bus-fire-funeral-78b1bac792d9eff5febe6000182fdb0a	2024-10-02T19:09:03-07:00	
Former Singapore minister sentenced to a year in prison for receiving illegal gifts	KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) — A former Singaporean cabinet minister was sentenced Thursday to a year in prison after he pleaded guilty to charges of receiving illegal gifts, in a rare criminal case involving a minister in the Asian financial hub. Former Transport Minister S. Iswaran had pleaded guilty last week to one count of obstructing justice and four of accepting gifts from people with whom he had official business. He was the first minister to be charged and imprisoned in nearly half a century. Justice Vincent Hoong, in his ruling, said holders of high office 'must be expected to avoid any perception that they are susceptible to influence by pecuniary benefits,' according to Channel News Asia. 'I am of the view it is appropriate to impose a sentence in excess of both parties’ positions,' Hoong was quoted as saying. The defense had asked for no more than eight weeks in prison, while the prosecution had pushed for six to seven months imprisonment. Iswaran, 62, was initially charged with 35 counts, but prosecutors proceeded with only five, while reducing two counts of corruption to receiving illegal gifts. Prosecutors said they will apply for the remaining 30 charges to be taken into consideration for sentencing. No reasons were given for the move. Iswaran received gifts worth over 74,000 Singapore dollars ($57,000) from Ong Beng Seng, a Singapore-based Malaysian property tycoon, and businessperson Lum Kok Seng. The gifts included tickets to Singapore’s Formula 1 race, wine and whisky and a luxury Brompton bike. Ong owns the right to the local F1 race, and Iswaran was chair of and later adviser to the Grand Prix’s steering committee. The Attorney-General’s Chambers said it will decide whether to charge Ong and Lum after the case against Iswaran has been resolved. Singapore ’s ministers are among the world’s best-paid. Although the amount involved in Iswaran’s case appeared to be relatively minor, his indictment is an embarrassment to the ruling People’s Action Party, which prides itself on a clean image. The last Cabinet minister charged with graft was Wee Toon Boon, who was found guilty in 1975 and jailed for accepting gifts in exchange for helping a businessperson. Another Cabinet minister was investigated for graft in 1986, but died before charges were filed. Iswaran had resigned just before he was charged. His trial comes just over four months after Singapore installed new Prime Minister Lawrence Wong after Lee Hsien Loong stepped down after 20 years.	https://apnews.com/article/singapore-minister-corruption-trial-bcb189eeb86be52d8a30f8c17e625edb	2024-10-02T18:09:04-07:00	
In South Korea, deepfake porn wrecks women's lives and deepens gender conflict	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — Three years after the 30-year-old South Korean woman received a barrage of online fake images that depicted her nude, she is still being treated for trauma. She struggles to talk with men. Using a mobile phone brings back the nightmare. 'It completely trampled me, even though it wasn’t a direct physical attack on my body,' she said in a phone interview with The Associated Press. She didn't want her name revealed because of privacy concerns. Many other South Korean women recently have come forward to share similar stories as South Korea grapples with a deluge of non-consensual, explicit deepfake videos and images that have become much more accessible and easier to create. It was not until last week that parliament revised a law to make watching or possessing deepfake porn content illegal. Most suspected perpetrators in South Korea are teenage boys. Observers say the boys target female friends, relatives and acquaintances — also mostly minors — as a prank, out of curiosity or misogyny. The attacks raise serious questions about school programs but also threaten to worsen an already troubled divide between men and women. Deepfake porn in South Korea gained attention after unconfirmed lists of schools that had victims spread online in August. Many girls and women have hastily removed photos and videos from their Instagram, Facebook and other social media accounts. Thousands of young women have staged protests demanding stronger steps against deepfake porn. Politicians, academics and activists have held forums. 'Teenage (girls) must be feeling uneasy about whether their male classmates are okay. Their mutual trust has been completely shattered,' said Shin Kyung-ah, a sociology professor at South Korea’s Hallym University. The school lists have not been formally verified, but officials including President Yoon Suk Yeol have confirmed a surge of explicit deepfake content on social media. Police have launched a seven-month crackdown. Recent attention to the problem has coincided with France’s arrest in August of Pavel Durov, the founder of the messaging app Telegram, over allegations that his platform was used for illicit activities including the distribution of child sexual abuse. South Korea's telecommunications and broadcast watchdog said Monday that Telegram has pledged to enforce a zero-tolerance policy on illegal deepfake content. Police say they’ve detained 387 people over alleged deepfake crimes this year, more than 80% of them teenagers. Separately, the Education Ministry says about 800 students have informed authorities about intimate deepfake content involving them this year. Experts say the true scale of deepfake porn in the country is far bigger. The U.S. cybersecurity firm Security Hero called South Korea 'the country most targeted by deepfake pornography' last year. In a report, it said South Korean singers and actresses constitute more than half of the people featured in deepfake pornography worldwide. The prevalence of deepfake porn in South Korea reflects various factors including heavy use of smart phones; an absence of comprehensive sex and human rights education in schools and inadequate social media regulations for minors as well as a 'misogynic culture' and social norms that 'sexually objectify women,' according to Hong Nam-hee, a research professor at the Institute for Urban Humanities at the University of Seoul. Victims speak of intense suffering. In parliament, lawmaker Kim Nam Hee read a letter by an unidentified victim who she said tried to kill herself because she didn't want to suffer any longer from the explicit deepfake videos someone had made of her. Addressing a forum, former opposition party leader Park Ji-hyun read a letter from another victim who said she fainted and was taken to an emergency room after receiving sexually abusive deepfake images and being told by her perpetrators that they were stalking her. The 30-year-old woman interviewed by The AP said that her doctoral studies in the United States were disrupted for a year. She is receiving treatment after being diagnosed with panic disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder in 2022. Police said they've detained five men for allegedly producing and spreading fake explicit contents of about 20 women, including her. The victims are all graduates from Seoul National University, the country’s top school. Two of the men, including one who allegedly sent her fake nude images in 2021, attended the same university, but she said has no meaningful memory of them. The woman said the images she received on Telegram used photos she had posted on the local messaging app Kakao Talk, combined with nude photos of strangers. There were also videos showing men masturbating and messages describing her as a promiscuous woman or prostitute. One photo shows a screen shot of a Telegram chatroom with 42 people where her fake images were posted. The fake images were very crudely made but the woman felt deeply humiliated and shocked because dozens of people — some of whom she likely knows — were sexually harassing her with those photos. Building trust with men is stressful, she said, because she worries that 'normal-looking people could do such things behind my back.' Using a smart phone sometimes revives memories of the fake images. 'These days, people spend more time on their mobile phones than talking face to face with others. So we can’t really easily escape the traumatic experience of digital crimes if those happen on our phones,' she said. 'I was very sociable and really liked to meet new people, but my personality has totally changed since that incident. That made my life really difficult and I’m sad.' Critics say authorities haven’t done enough to counter deepfake porn despite an epidemic of online sex crimes in recent years, such as spy cam videos of women in public toilets and other places. In 2020, members of a criminal ring were arrested and convicted of blackmailing dozens of women into filming sexually explicit videos for them to sell. 'The number of male juveniles consuming deepfake porn for fun has increased because authorities have overlooked the voices of women' demanding stronger punishment for digital sex crimes, the monitoring group ReSET said in comments sent to AP. South Korea has no official records on the extent of deepfake online porn. But Reset said a recent random search of an online chatroom found more than 4,000 sexually exploitive images, videos and other items. Reviews of district court rulings showed less than a third of the 87 people indicted by prosecutors for deepfake crimes since 2021 were sent to prison. Nearly 60% avoided jail by receiving suspended terms, fines or not-guilty verdicts, according to lawmaker Kim's office. Judges tended to lighten sentences when those convicted repented for their crimes or were first time offenders. The deepfake problem has gained urgency given South Korea's serious rifts over gender roles, workplace discrimination, mandatory military service for men and social burdens on men and women. Kim Chae-won, a 25-year-old office worker, said some of her male friends shunned her after she asked them what they thought about digital sex violence targeting women. 'I feel scared of living as a woman in South Korea,' said Kim Haeun, a 17-year-old high school student who recently removed all her photos on Instagram. She said she feels awkward when talking with male friends and tries to distance herself from boys she doesn't know well. 'Most sex crimes target women. And when they happen, I think we are often helpless,' she said.	https://apnews.com/article/south-korea-deepfake-porn-women-df98e1a6793a245ac14afe8ec2366101	2024-10-02T17:52:13-07:00	
6 migrants shot dead near Guatemalan border when Mexican army troops open fire	MEXICO CITY (AP) — Six international migrants are dead after Mexican soldiers opened fire on a truck carrying a group near the border with Guatemala, Mexico's Defense Department said Wednesday. The department said in a statement that soldiers claimed they heard shots as the trucks and two other vehicles approached their position late Tuesday in the southern state of Chiapas, near the town of Huixtla. Two soldiers opened fire on the truck, which was carrying migrants from Egypt, Nepal, Cuba, India, Pakistan and at least one other country. Soldiers then approached the truck and found four of the migrants dead, and 12 wounded. Two of the wounded later died of their injuries. There was no immediate information on the condition of the other 10. Local prosecutors confirmed all the victims died of gunshot wounds. The Defense Department did not say whether the migrants died as a result of army fire, or whether any weapons were found in the truck. There were 17 other migrants in the truck who were unharmed. The vehicle was carrying a total of 33 migrants. The area is common route for smuggling migrants, who are often packed into crowded freight trucks. The department said the two soldiers who opened fire were relieved of duty pending investigations. In Mexico, any incident involving civilians is subject to civilian prosecution, but soldiers can also face military courts martial for those offenses. It is not the first time Mexican forces have opened fire on vehicles carrying migrants in the area, which is also the object of turf battles between warring drug cartels. In the same area in 2021, the quasi-military National Guard opened fire on a pickup truck carrying migrants, killing one and wounding four. Irineo Mujica, a migrant rights activist who has frequently accompanied caravans of migrants in that area of Chiapas, said he doubted the migrants or their smugglers opened fire. 'It is really impossible that these people would have been shooting at the army,' Mujica said. 'Most of the time, they get through by paying bribes.' The U.N. agency for refugees in Mexico, known as the ACNUR, wrote that it 'expresses its concern about the events in Chiapas,' noting 'people in migration are exposed to great risks during their journey, and that is why it is indispensable they have legal means of access, travel, and integration to avoid tragedies like these.' If the deaths were the result of army fire, as appears likely, it could prove a major embarrassment for President Claudia Sheinbaum, who took office Tuesday. Sheinbaum has followed the lead of former president Andrés Manuel López Obrador in giving the armed forces extraordinary powers in law enforcement, state-run companies , airports, trains and construction projects.	https://apnews.com/article/mexico-army-soldiers-kill-migrants-37e0e3f08124cd46703a598ff1b1e7c0	2024-10-02T16:34:42-07:00	
Typhoon Krathon shuts parts of Taiwan for a third day as it nears the island with extreme rains	KAOHSIUNG, Taiwan (AP) — A slow-moving typhoon approaching Taiwan led to school and office closures for a third consecutive day Thursday, with authorities asking people to stay indoors. Typhoon Krathon, packing fierce winds and torrential rainfall, was around 30 kilometers (19 miles) southwest of the major port city of Kaohsiung on Thursday morning, traveling northeastward at a speed of 4 kilometers (2.5 miles) per hour, according to the island’s Central Weather Administration. It was expected to make landfall later Thursday on Taiwan’s densely populated west coast. The typhoon, packing maximum sustained winds near the center of 137 kph (85 mph) and gusts of 173 kph (107 mph), is expected to continue to weaken as it moves inland. The typhoon has brought Kaohsiung, a city of 2.7 million people, to a standstill for the past three days. Stores and restaurants have been shuttered, and residents kept away from markets and harbors. All domestic flights have been grounded for the past two days. Gusts and heavy rains pelted the empty streets. Many residents woke up Thursday to mobile phone alerts urging them to take shelter from fierce winds of up to 134 kph (83 mph), with gusts of more than 166 kph (103 mph). The weather administration posted a Facebook message warning Kaohsiung and Pingtung County residents to not go outside when the eye of the storm passes above their area and the weather calms briefly, because the winds and storms will pick up again afterward. Weather-related events attributed to Krathon injured at least 123 people around the island, according to Taiwan’s fire department. Two people died — one after driving into fallen rocks on the road in the southeastern Taitung county, and the other while trimming tree branches in the city of Hualien. Two others remained missing. Thousands were evacuated from areas vulnerable to mudslides and landslides. Almost 40,000 troops were on standby to help with rescue efforts. Mountainous areas in the island’s south have seen up to 169 centimeters (5.5 feet) of rain over the past five days. China's weather agency said some eastern and southern parts of Taiwan are set to see extremely heavy rains of up to 40 centimeters (1.3 feet) over the next 24 hours. Typhoons rarely hit Taiwan’s west coast, affecting instead the mountainous, eastern side of the island. Krathon is forecast to slowly travel north and weaken into a tropical depression by Friday before it reaches the capital, Taipei. On Monday, the typhoon lashed northern Philippine islands, where four people were killed and at least 5,000 were displaced, officials said.	https://apnews.com/article/taiwan-typhoon-krathon-rain-e4acaaf0fbf22779c1f0124ee2f2712b	2024-10-02T15:57:36-07:00	
Dominican Republic will deport up to 10,000 Haitians a week, citing an 'excess' of immigrants	SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) — The Dominican Republic announced Wednesday that it would start massive deportations of Haitians living illegally in the country, expelling up to 10,000 of them a week. Government spokesman Homero Figueroa told reporters that the government took the decision after noticing an 'excess' of Haitian migrants in the Dominican Republic, which shares the island of Hispaniola with Haiti. Figueroa said officials have seen an increase in Haitian migrants as a U.N.-backed mission in Haiti to fight gang violence flounders. He said authorities also agreed to strengthen border surveillance and control, but he did not provide details. Last year, the Dominican Republic deported more than 174,000 people it says are Haitians, and in the first half of the year, it has expelled at least 67,000 more. Activists have long criticized the administration of President Luis Abinader for what they say are ongoing human rights violations of Haitians and those of Haitian descent born in the Dominican Republic. Abinader has denied any mistreatment. Wednesday's announcement comes a week after Abinader announced at the U.N. General Assembly that he would take 'drastic measures' if the mission in Haiti fails. It is led by nearly 400 police officers from Kenya, backed by nearly two dozen police and soldiers from Jamaica and two senior military officers from Belize. The U.S. has warned that the mission lacks personnel and funding as it pushes for a U.N. peacekeeping mission instead. Gangs in Haiti control 80% of the Port-au-Prince capital, and the violence has left nearly 700,000 Haitians homeless in recent years, while thousands of others have fled the country. ____ Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america	https://apnews.com/article/dominican-republic-haiti-immigrants-deportations-25a82fdefe7a51bff32e8215d10089f4	2024-10-02T12:58:46-07:00	
Five Chinese nationals charged with covering up midnight visit to Michigan military site	DETROIT (AP) — U.S. authorities charged five Chinese nationals with lying and trying to cover their tracks, more than a year after they were confronted in the dark near a remote Michigan military site where thousands of people had gathered for summer drills. The five, who were University of Michigan students at the time, were not charged for what happened at Camp Grayling in August 2023. Rather they are accused of misleading investigators about the trip and conspiring to clear their phones of photos, according to a criminal complaint filed in federal court. The FBI noted in the Tuesday court filing that there have been instances of college students from China taking photos of vital defense sites in the United States. There was nothing in the file revealing the whereabouts of the five men. 'The defendants are not in custody. Should they come into contact with U.S. authorities, they will be arrested and face these charges,' Gina Balaya, a spokesperson for the U.S. Attorney's Office in Detroit, said Wednesday. In summer 2023, the five were confronted after midnight near a lake by a sergeant major with the Utah National Guard. One said, 'We are media,' before they collected their belongings and agreed to leave the area, the FBI said. The FBI learned that the men had booked a room at a nearby motel a week before they were spotted outside Camp Grayling, 200 miles (321.8 kilometers) north of Detroit. Four months later, one of the men was interviewed by border officers at the Detroit airport before traveling to South Korea and China. He told investigators that he and others had taken a trip to northern Michigan 'to see shooting stars,' the FBI said. A check of his external hard drive revealed two images of military vehicles taken on the same night of the encounter with the National Guard officer, the FBI said. The other four men were interviewed last March after arriving in Chicago on a flight from Iceland. They acknowledged being in northern Michigan in August 2023, but they said it was to see a meteor shower, the FBI said. They mentioned the National Guard officer but referred to him only as 'the soldier,' a camper or 'nice guy,' according to the criminal complaint. The men last December communicated on WeChat about clearing photos from their cameras and phones, investigators said. The FBI said all five men graduated last spring from the University of Michigan. They were part of a joint program between the university and the Shanghai Jiao Tong University in Shanghai, China. In 2020, two Chinese nationals who were pursuing master's degrees at the University of Michigan were sentenced to prison for illegally photographing sites at a naval air station in Key West, Florida. ___ Follow Ed White at https://twitter.com/edwritez	https://apnews.com/article/chinese-students-michigan-military-camp-0f757785eb5eecb9e92ac89f99e96c2d	2024-10-02T10:55:11-07:00	
Days after being suspended Emi Martinez has Prince William celebrating in the Champions League	Days after being suspended by FIFA, Argentina goalkeeper Emiliano Martínez produced heroics in front of the watching Prince William as Aston Villa sealed another famous win against Bayern Munich. The Prince of Wales was among the ecstatic crowd at Villa Park to watch his beloved soccer team win 1-0 in the Champions League on Wednesday. Substitute Jhon Duran struck a 79th-minute winner, but two brilliant late saves from Martinez held off a fightback from six-time European champion Bayern to leave William celebrating. 'This is the loudest Villa Park that I’ve heard since I joined the club. That’s for sure. It was hurting my ears at some point,' said Martinez, who was suspended last week by FIFA for two upcoming international matches because of unspecified incidents in Argentina’s World Cup qualifiers against Chile and Colombia. 'I love playing here. I love the fans. This is a win for them.' Martinez denied Serge Gnabry in a one-on-one in stoppage time and then acrobatically kept out Harry Kane's header. Villa's win came more than 42 years after beating Bayern 1-0 to lift the European Cup in 1982, the same year William was born. This was only the second time the teams had met. It was also Villa's first home game in European soccer's elite competition since losing to Juventus as defending champion in the quarterfinals in 1983. William, who is a lifelong Villa fan, met members of the European Cup winning team and posed for pictures before the match. '42 years on, our 1982 European Cup winning legends are here on an historic night,' he wrote on X. 'Ready for the first game on home turf in this year’s European adventure...' William, who is also patron of the English Football Association, sat in an executive box, dressed casually in a dark blue button-up coat over a maroon sweater and blue shirt — Villa's colors. He was seen hugging another fan sat with him as the home crowd savored its latest triumph over German giant Bayern. He also was up and cheering in the first half when Pau Torres appeared to have fired Villa into a 23rd-minute lead only for the goal to be ruled out by VAR for offside. There was no reprieve for Bayern when Duran struck to continue his remarkable scoring record this season. Coming on in the 70th, he lashed in a first time shot from around 25 yards to beat Bayern keeper Manuel Neuer. It was the Colombian forward's sixth goal in nine games this season, having come on as a substitute in eight of them. Villa now has back-to-back wins in the revamped Champions League. Defeat for Bayern was its first under manager Vincent Kompany, who took over in the offseason. ___ James Robson is at https://twitter.com/jamesalanrobson ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer	https://apnews.com/article/prince-william-aston-villa-champions-league-e6be59fbf4a332f48ad07a7de1a7ac0c	2024-10-02T10:16:48-07:00	
US bans new types of goods from China over allegations of forced labor	WASHINGTON (AP) — The Department of Homeland Security announced Wednesday that it would ban the import of goods from a Chinese steel manufacturer and a Chinese maker of artificial sweetener, accusing both of being involved in the use of forced labor from China's far-west region of Xinjiang. The action broadens the scope of the U.S. effort to counter products from entering the country that the government says are tied to human rights abuses. The additions to the entity list under the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act marks the first time a China-based steel company or aspartame sweetener business have been targeted by U.S. law enforcement, DHS said. 'Today’s actions reaffirm our commitment to eliminating forced labor from U.S. supply chains and upholding our values of human rights for all,' said Robert Silvers, undersecretary of Homeland Security for policy. 'No sector is off-limits. We will continue to identify entities across industries and hold accountable those who seek to profit from exploitation and abuse.' The federal law that President Joe Biden signed at the end of 2021 followed allegations of human rights abuses by Beijing against members of the ethnic Uyghur group and other Muslim minorities in Xinjiang. The Chinese government has refuted the claims as lies and defended its practice and policy in Xinjiang as fighting terror and ensuring stability. The new approach marked a shift in the U.S. trade relationship with China to increasingly take into account national security and human rights. Beijing has accused the U.S. of using human rights as a pretext to suppress China’s economic growth. Enforcement of the law initially targeted solar products, tomatoes, cotton and apparel, but over the last several months, the U.S. government has identified new sectors for enforcement, including aluminum and seafood. 'That’s just a reflection of the fact that sadly, forced labor continues to taint all too many supply chains,' Silvers told a trade group in June when marking the two-year anniversary of the creation of the entity list. 'So our enforcement net has actually been quite wide from an industry-sector perspective.' He said the law 'changed the dynamic in terms of putting the onus on importers to know their own supply chains' and that its enforcement had showed that the U.S. could 'do the right thing' without halting normal trade. Since June 2022, the entity list has grown to a total of 75 companies accused of using forced labor in Xinjiang or sourcing materials tied to that forced labor, Homeland Security said. Baowu Group Xinjiang Bayi Iron and Steel Co. Ltd and Changzhou Guanghui Food Ingredients Co. Ltd. were the Chinese companies newly added to the list.	https://apnews.com/article/china-forced-labor-united-states-trade-8ec1637835bc9388c84796f77f218c2c	2024-10-02T09:31:27-07:00	
Biden won't support a strike on Iran nuclear sites as Israel weighs response to Iran missile attack	JOINT BASE ANDREWS, Md. (AP) — President Joe Biden said Wednesday he will not support an Israeli strike on sites related to Tehran’s nuclear program in response to Iran's missile attack on Israel. 'The answer is no,' Biden told reporters when asked if he would support such retaliation after Iran fired about 180 missiles at Israel on Tuesday. Biden’s comments came after he and fellow Group of Seven leaders from Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United Kingdom spoke by telephone about coordinating new sanctions against Iran. The U.S. and allies are scrambling to keep the Mideast conflict — sparked by Iran-backed Hamas militants' in Gaza's Oct. 7 attack on Israel — from spreading further. They are urging Israel to show restraint as it weighs retaliation against Iran for Tuesday's attack. Israel is now carrying out what it has described as limited ground operations across its northern border with Lebanon to dig out Hezbollah, another Iran-backed group, after carrying out a series of massive air strikes that killed the group's leader, Hassan Nasrallah, and decimated its leadership. Last month, thousands of explosives hidden in pagers and walkie-talkies used by Hezbollah detonated, killing dozens of people and maiming thousands, including many civilians. Israel is widely believed to be behind the attack Biden stated his opposition to Israel hitting Iranian nuclear facilities as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu weighed a range of options in how to respond to Tuesday’s attack. It was the second such attack by Iran on Israel in less than six months. Israel's choices range from a largely symbolic strike — similar to how Israel responded after Iran launched a barrage of missiles and attack drones in April — to hitting oil facilities and other infrastructure. Targeting Iran’s controversial nuclear program is seen as perhaps the most provocative action that Israel could take. It's one that the Democratic president believes could further enflame a Mideast conflict that he already worries could develop into a broader regional conflict. The White House said in a statement that G7 leaders 'unequivocally condemned Iran’s attack against Israel' and that Biden reaffirmed America's 'full solidarity and support to Israel and its people.' Biden added that he supports Israel's right to defend itself and 'there are things that have to be done' in response to the Iranian barrage. He said he expected sanctions from the G7 nations to be announced soon. 'We will be discussing with the Israelis what they are going to do,' Biden told reporters before heading to the Carolinas to see the devastation caused by Hurricane Helene. 'All seven of us agree that they have a right to respond.' The office of Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni said in a statement that the leaders expressed 'strong concern for the escalation of these last hours' and emphasized that 'a conflict on a regional scale is in no one’s interest.' Italy holds the rotating presidency of the G7 group of industrialized democracies. Biden said that he planned to speak with Netanyahu 'relatively soon.' Biden's administration has signaled that it is urging Israel to display restraint in how it responds to Iran’s missile attack, which Biden said was 'ineffective and defeated.' The U.S. military helped Israel defend against the attack that Iran carried out in retaliation for the killing of Tehran-backed leaders of Lebanese Hezbollah. Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell said there 'must be a return message' to Iran. He said the U.S. and Israel officials continue to discuss their response. 'At the same time, I think we recognize as important as the response of some kind should be, there is a recognition that the region is really balancing on a knife’s edge,' Campbell said at a forum hosted by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a Washington think tank. Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke on Wednesday with his counterparts Britain, France, Germany, and Italy to discuss the situation in the Middle East. ___ Associated Press writer Colleen Barry in Rome and White House Correspondent Zeke Miller in Washington contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/biden-israel-iran-hezbollah-nuclear-sites-846c8779b2b95a3bebcf955c4e69cf6c	2024-10-02T08:56:59-07:00

Vatican bank fires newlywed couple for violating a new workplace marriage ban	ROME (AP) — The Vatican bank confirmed Wednesday it has fired two employees on the grounds that their recent wedding violates a new ban on workplace marriages. The Institute for Religious Works said it took the 'difficult decision' to fire the couple, who have three children, after neither one agreed to resign voluntarily to allow the other to continue working. Their attorney, Laura Sgro, immediately challenged the firings in a letter to the bank chiefs and warned she would take the case to the Vatican civil court within 30 days. Sgro said the bank's notification of dismissal was 'null, illegitimate and gravely harmful of the fundamental rights of people and employees, and therefore devoid of any effect.' The couple had met at the IOR while working in different departments, and had informed the bank of their plans to marry in February, Sgro said. In May, a new personnel regulation went into effect barring workplace marriages. The bank said it in no way meant to question the right of employees to get married – a sacrament Francis frequently urges young couples to undertake in the face of dwindling numbers of Catholic weddings. But the bank said it needed to avoid any possible conflicts of interest in a small bank with just 100 employees in one location, and ensure impartiality in its operations. 'The formation of a married couple among the employees is in fact blatantly contradictory to the current regulations within the institute, the primary objective of which is to avoid the reputational risk of accusations of familism and consequently ensure impartial treatment among employees,' the IOR said in a statement. The couple had appealed to Pope Francis, seeking a dispensation in the enforcement of the new regulation, which went into effect once wedding plans were already under way and the official Catholic announcement made, Sgro said. They received no reply. They were married in August and on Oct. 1 were notified that they no longer fulfilled the requirement to be bank employees, and told to turn in their Vatican ID cards and return their IOR bank cards, Sgro said in a statement. Employment at the Vatican is often highly sought-after by Romans, since it usually involves income tax-free salary and benefits that can include below market-rate housing and access to the Vatican's health service and tax-free supermarket, department store, gas station and pharmacy. The Vatican bank has long been mired in scandal but has spent the past decade cleaning up its books and ridding itself of its reputation as an offshore tax haven. Years of reform have slimmed down its client list to Vatican offices, employees, religious congregations and embassies. It currently has some 5.4 billion euros in assets under management and reported 30 million euros in net profits last year. The bank had previously donated around 50 million euros a year of its profits to the pope to pay for the Vatican bureaucracy, but profits have fallen in recent years.	https://apnews.com/article/vatican-bank-pope-marriage-ban-230bdf13d30da06a6599ee9281a24b8b	2024-10-02T06:32:33-07:00	
More than 100 people missing after boat capsizes in northern Nigeria	ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) — More than 100 people, mostly women and children, were missing after an overloaded boat bringing them back from an Islamic festival at night capsized in northwestern Nigeria, authorities said Wednesday. The locally made boat, whose capacity was 100 passengers, had about 300 people onboard along the Niger River when it overturned in Niger state’s Mokwa district on Monday night, according to the Niger State Emergency Management Agency. Such boat disasters are common in Nigeria, especially in remote communities where the lack of good roads leaves many with no alternative routes. This is the fourth tragedy involving more than 100 passengers in northern Nigeria since mid-2023, many of them never accounted for. Local media reported that 11 bodies, nine men and two women, have been recovered from the river so far. At least 150 people had been rescued by Wednesday morning amid a frantic search operation that is being supported by local divers and volunteers, according to Abdullahi Baba-Arah, head of Niger state's emergency services. 'The boat was not supposed to carry more than 100 persons, but there were almost 300 people on it. And that was what resulted in the breakage of the boat,' said Salihu Garba, director of relief and rehabilitation at the state emergency services. Experts say most of the boat disasters in Nigeria in recent years increasingly point to regulatory failures and are often attributed to overloading or poorly maintained boats.	https://apnews.com/article/nigeria-boat-capsizing-niger-river-7f69c5bbde8b4c0c5eb27dc1c543bb60	2024-10-02T06:29:38-07:00	
4 Russian journalists accused of working for a Navalny group go on trial in Moscow	TALLINN, Estonia (AP) — Four Russian journalists went on trial in Moscow on Wednesday after being accused of working for an anti-corruption group founded by the late Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalny, which was designated by authorities as an extremist organization in 2021. Antonina Favorskaya, Artyom Kriger, Sergey Karelin and Konstantin Gabov were arrested earlier this year and charged with involvement with an extremist group, a criminal offense punishable by up to six years in prison. All four have rejected the charges. The trial, which is being held behind closed doors, is the latest step in the Kremlin's unrelenting crackdown on dissent that has reached unprecedented levels after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine more than two years ago. The authorities have targeted opposition figures, independent journalists, rights activists and ordinary Russians critical of the Kremlin with criminal and misdemeanor charges, jailing hundreds and prompting thousands to leave the country, fearing prosecution. The four journalists were accused of working with Navalny's Foundation for Fighting Corruption, which was designated as extremist and outlawed by the Russian authorities in 2021. That designation has been widely seen as politically motivated. Navalny was President Vladimir Putin's fiercest and most prominent foe and relentlessly campaigned against official corruption in Russia. In February, Navalny died in a remote Arctic prison while serving a 19-year sentence on a number of charges, including running an extremist group, which he had rejected as politically driven. Favorskaya and Kriger worked with SotaVision, an independent Russian news outlet that covers protests and political trials. Gabov is a freelance producer who has worked for multiple organizations, including Reuters. Karelin is a freelance video journalist, he has done work for Western media outlets, including The Associated Press. As they were led into the courtroom on Wednesday, a crowd of supporters greeted them with applause. In the courtroom, the four smiled at their loved ones from a glass defendant's cage. Addressing reporters from behind the glass, Kriger cast the case against him and his fellow journalists as a cautionary tale and urged journalists still in Russia to leave the country: 'It is not a joke, any person can be charged with anything.' Favorskaya, in turn, spoke about hope: 'Everything that is happening now, the darkness that surrounds us, it is not forever, and we will definitely see the country that Alexei (Navalny) dreamed of, we will definitely live in a country where rights and freedoms will be (respected) and journalists and other people will not be jailed for their views.' Shortly after the hearing began, the judge ordered to hold the proceedings behind closed doors upon a request from the prosecution, even though the defense objected to it.	https://apnews.com/article/russia-crackown-journalists-navalny-trial-df7e06de5c8e76634ece67c2139af6ff	2024-10-02T06:11:47-07:00	
The Latest: Trio of crises loom over final the campaign's final stretch	In a debate that evoked a calmer era in American politics, Tim Walz and JD Vance went after each other’s running mates Tuesday and sought to shore up their campaigns’ vulnerabilities at a time of renewed fears of a regional war in the Middle East and sadness over devastation from Hurricane Helene. Meanwhile, those new trials — along with a dockworkers strike that threatens the U.S. economy — are looming over the final weeks of the presidential campaign and could help shape the public mood as voters decide between Democrat Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump. Follow the AP’s Election 2024 coverage at: https://apnews.com/hub/election-2024. Here’s the latest: Harris and Biden are fanning out across the Southeast amid Helene's devastation Over the past four years, President Joe Biden has jetted off to survey damage and console victims after tornadoes, wildfires and tropical storms. It’s not a role Kamala Harris has played as vice president. But on Wednesday, they'll both fan out across the Southeast to grapple with the damage from Hurricane Helene, seeking to demonstrate commitment and competence in helping devastated communities after Donald Trump’s false claims about their administration’s response. Biden is heading to North and South Carolina, while Harris is going to Georgia. Harris’ stop will also serve as a political test in the midst of a humanitarian crisis. She’s trying to step into the role for which Biden is best known — showing the empathy Americans expect in times of tragedy — in the closing stretch of her campaign for president. Pennsylvania town grapples with Trump assassination attempt ahead of his return Former President Donald Trump is going back to Butler, Pennsylvania, where the world saw him pump his fist and beseech followers to 'fight,' even as blood streaked his face from a would-be assassin’s bullet. In announcing his return, the current Republican nominee said he planned to 'celebrate a unifying vision for America’s future in an event like the world has never seen before.' The question is: Is Butler ready? While many are predicting a large crowd to hear Trump speak back at the very Farm Show property where a bullet grazed his right ear on July 13, there's also apprehension in town, along with a sense that Butler is still healing.	https://apnews.com/article/harris-trump-vance-walz-election-f0400b64e7e632e39e0704b07b415b48	2024-10-02T03:27:41-07:00	
Are LGBTQ Jews welcome in Orthodox communities? This is how they are building spaces of their own	It was a heart-wrenching choice. But when Daniel Gammerman decided to never set foot back in an Orthodox synagogue, he thought of it as an act of love. Not toward the Jewish community he was born into, but to himself. 'A synagogue is a spiritual place, but it’s also a community place,' said Gammerman, 47, from his home in Miami. 'If I have to basically check at the door half of my identity in order to come in, I don’t feel that’s welcoming enough for me.' Dozens of LGBTQ+ Jews like him have struggled to find support and acceptance within their Orthodox communities. Most were raised with little knowledge of what being gay or queer meant. They just felt different, but found it hard to ask their rabbis: 'This is who I am, is there still room for me here?' 'The way it mostly works is invisibility,' Gammerman said. 'There’s no addressing the existence of LGBT people among us. And, whenever you hear something about it, of course it’s negative.' He can’t put his finger on a specific date in which he realized he was gay. But he remembers clearly what happened to him when the news got out. 'I used to get enormous texts from different people trying to explain to me how this was wrong,' Gammerman said. 'It was a bombardment of people trying to fix me.' Grandson to Eastern European Jews who fled during World War II, Gammerman was born in Brazil. He moved to the U.S. after finishing high school in the 1990s and continued his studies at a Jewish Orthodox university. At age 21, he got married. He and his wife — who he still thinks of as a friend — raised four children together. 'We built a perfect family,' he said. 'I checked all the boxes of what a nice Jewish Orthodox family is supposed to be.' Afraid to destroy his future and his children’s lives, he shut down his feelings for years, until he could do it no more. He initially traveled to Brazil and met with a therapist who counseled gay men in heterosexual marriages. That helped, Gammerman said, but something was missing. What about his life within an Orthodox religious community that didn’t even acknowledge that LGBTQ+ people exist? Embracing his true identity felt easier after meeting Steven Greenberg, an openly gay rabbi who founded Eshel, a U.S.-based organization focused on connecting LGBTQ+ Orthodox Jewish communities. According to Miryam Kabakov, Eshel's executive director, most of the people who reach out share similar concerns: I’m coming out and I’ve been part of this community my whole life. Can I still belong? What will happen to me now? Can you find a rabbi who can help me? 'We guide them toward religious leaders who will tell them that there’s still a place for them,' Kabakov said. 'That they still have the religious obligations and expectations that they’ve always had and that they should stay true to their heart and their tradition if that’s what they want.' Ely Winkler, a 37-year-old LGBTQ+ Orthodox Jew from Brooklyn, will soon be back at an Orthodox synagogue after years of distancing himself from his community. 'After the war broke out between Israel and Gaza, I felt a deeper calling,' he said. 'I didn’t feel strong enough to stand up for myself, for my beliefs, and I knew that I needed to strengthen my Judaism, to remember who I was.' Abrielle Fuerst, 32, moved from Texas to Philadelphia six years ago. Eshel helped her to connect with a local rabbi and an inclusive synagogue. 'Here it’s not: ‘Oh, come because you are Jewish and gay, we’ll accept you.’ It's just: ‘Hello, you’re Jewish, thanks for being in this space and it’s nice to meet you.’' One of Eshel’s projects, named the 'Welcoming Shuls,' enlists more than 200 rabbis who work across North America to make their synagogues hospitable for LGBTQ+ people. Many of them consent to being publicly identified; others ask to keep a low profile, foreseeing hostile reactions within their Orthodox communities. 'A lot of rabbis are very afraid to be public because they’ll get ostracized,' Kabakov said. 'But we know they’re there.' The group also counsels Orthodox LGBTQ+ Jews who wish to keep a distance from their religion. 'People who don’t want to be religious anymore are torn up about it,' Kabakov said. 'But we try to help them through the struggle and let them know that they can be gay and be religious. It might be hard to find a place, but we’re working on that.' Gammerman has tried to go back to Orthodox synagogues since he came out. Until now, none in Miami have made him feel truly accepted. 'I’ve tried many times, but it’s like wearing a costume,' he said. 'At some point I was able to live with that. But the more you accept yourself, the more you love yourself, you just cannot do it.' His Orthodox community did not prevent him from attending religious services after he came out, but rejection was still there. People stopped greeting him, and he was no longer allowed to officiate services at his synagogue. Once, during a speech, the rabbi looked at him and said: 'Homosexuality is destroying humanity and if this continues like this, there’ll be no more children in the world.' 'I lost friendships, relationships, participation and community,' Gammerman said. 'It was all gone really, really fast.' Meeting Greenberg, who is married to another man and has a child, helped him realize he could still live a happy, fulfilling life. After their encounter, Gammerman decided to talk to his wife. The couple separated and found a way to break the news to their children. 'Since then, I have rebuilt my life,' he said. 'I remarried. I have a husband. My children are part of my life and they understand.' In time, he realized that not only his family, but his approach toward his religion would also need to change. At first he tried to attend liberal Reform synagogues, some of which fully embrace LGBTQ+ worshippers, but having been raised an Orthodox Jew, he still felt out of place. 'Being LGBT is a whole identity,' Gammerman said. 'And I want to be embraced in a place where there are no buts or ifs.' He’d rather not label his current religious observance, but Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur still bear huge significance for him. So, every year, during the High Holy Days, he wakes up early, dresses nicely and opens his prayer book. 'I say the prayers from beginning to end,' Gammerman said. 'I call to all the praises as if I was in a synagogue, but I do it by myself in my house.' He was once taught that Jewish prayer required at least 10 men to be conducted, but he has learned a few things since. 'If I was given a switch that I could press to change who I am, I would not do it,' he said. 'God made me like this, so it’s not up for me to switch. I have to love myself for who I am.' ___ Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

The fall of Vuhledar is a microcosm of Ukraine's wartime predicament	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — The fall of a front-line town nestled atop a tactically significant hill is unlikely to change the course of Ukraine’s war against Russia. But the loss underscores Kyiv’s worsening position, in part the result of firm Western red lines, military officials and analysts said. Vuhledar, a town Ukrainian forces fought tooth and nail to keep for two years, is the latest urban settlement to fall to the Russians. It follows a vicious summer campaign along the eastern front that saw Kyiv cede several thousand square kilometers (miles) of territory. Ukraine’s military said they were withdrawing their troops from Vuhledar to 'protect the military personnel and equipment' in a statement on Wednesday. Vuhledar's fall is a microcosm of Ukraine’s predicament in this chapter of the nearly three-year war. It reflects the U.S.'s refusal to grant Ukraine permission to strike targets deep inside Russian territory, preventing Kyiv from degrading Moscow’s capabilities. Meanwhile, Russia's dominance of the skies allows it to develop and advance devastating aerial glide bombs for which Ukraine has no effective response, while a controversial mobilization drive has failed to produce a new class of Ukrainian fighters capable of holding the line. The Ukrainians' retreat from the town comes after a much-anticipated visit by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to the U.S. last week. The Biden administration so far has refused Kyiv’s request to use Army Tactical Missile Systems, or ATACMS, to strike Russian airfields and other key targets, and Zelenskyy’s 'victory plan,' was dismissed by some as more of a wish list than a plan of action. In the meantime, Russian fighter jets continued to drop aerial bombs on Vuhledar, which precipitated the retreat, soldiers there said. '(The Russians') main tactic was to encircle us from the flanks, and they did this constantly for six to seven months with constant aerial attacks — due to this tactic they managed to exhaust our resources, because we don’t have as much as they have,' said Arsenii Prylipka, the head of the press office of the 72nd Brigade, which had been defending Vuhledar since August 2022. THE FIGHT FOR VUHLEDAR After two years of failed attempts to capture Vuhledar, Russian forces switched tactics earlier this year. The town’s pre-war population of 14,000 dwindled to less than 100 during the heat of the fighting. Russian soldiers began mounting sophisticated attacks from the north and southern flanks, powered by superior electronic warfare capabilities and an array of infantrymen on motorcycles, artillery fire, drones and aerial glide bombs. Moscow suffered heavy causalities. Ukrainians have been pressuring the U.S. to relax restrictions on the use of Western weapons to strike targets deep inside Russia. Lawmakers said they expected a green light from the U.S. months ago, but it didn’t come: The Biden administration refused to waver on this red line. It has meant that Russian command and control centers, logistics hubs and airfields from which Russian fighter jets carry deadly aerial glide bombs, are out of reach of Ukrainian forces. Russia fires nearly 120 aerial bombs a day on average, about 3,000 a month. The bombs are Soviet-era weapons refitted with navigational technology. 'We cannot change the dynamics, and the Russians are pushing,' said Pavel Narozhnyi, founder of the non-profit Reactive Post, which sources spare parts for artillery. Month after month of constant attacks eventually eroded Ukrainian defenses. After two years of intense fighting, the 72nd Brigade — which never rotated out due to the intensity of the fight and the lack of a demobilization strategy from Ukrainian military leaders — withdrew from the patch of land many of their comrades died to defend. Prylipka had said the brigade would stay until the very last moment when defending Vuhledar became impossible. That scenario unfolded this week. 'The Russians searched for weak spots in our defenses, a constant probe to find routes to penetrate the town and as they advanced they tried to destroy the entire town. All the time we are under fire,' said Prylipka. Vuhledar served as a defensive stronghold, a fortress town atop a hill surrounded by open fields and near two major roads. From there, Ukrainian soldiers were able to observe approaching Russian forces at a distance. From that vantage point, it was easy to coordinate counter-attacks. That advantage now falls to Russian forces. While tactically significant, Vuhledar isn’t a crucial logistics hub for Kyiv, and Russian forces already controlled most of the main roads through the town before capturing it, the U.S.-based Institute for the Study of War said. Ukraine’s access to other critical supply lines remains intact. THE ROAD TO POKROVSK The capture of Vuhledar is part of Moscow’s pursuit of the strategic logistics hub of Pokrovsk, just 30 kilometers (19 miles) north. Its fall would severely compromise Ukrainian defenses. The next step for Russian forces will be to drive Ukrainian forces out of the nearby city of Kurakhove. 'This line is interconnected and the enemy will not be able to enter Pokrovsk and come close to Pokrovsk unless it can drive our troops out of Kurakhove,' said Ivan Tymochko, chairman of the Council of Reservists of Ukraine’s ground forces. 'Otherwise, (the Russians) would have exposed their fronts to the flanks and would have received a serious blow to the side.' 'On the other hand, the enemy understands that if it does not take Kurakhove, it will not be able to seriously influence the course of events around Vuhledar,' he added.	https://apnews.com/article/ukraine-russia-war-vuhledar-2403780647659883a203feda35dd8ccc	2024-10-02T02:22:40-07:00	
Israel's multilayered air-defense system passes another test in fending off Iranian missile strike	JERUSALEM (AP) — Israel's multilayered air-defense system appears to have passed another test after fending off Iran's latest missile barrage. In Tuesday's night's strike, Iran fired over 180 missiles toward Israel. The attack set off air raid sirens across the country and sent residents scrambling for shelter, but caused only a handful of minor injuries and limited damage, in large part because many were intercepted or landed in open areas. It was the latest success for an air-defense system that over the past year has intercepted projectiles fired from Gaza, Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, Yemen and Iran. They have ranged from short-range rockets to medium-range missiles to attack drones to long-range ballistic missiles like those fired Tuesday night. In Tuesday's attack, the U.S. and Britain said they assisted in shooting down the incoming missiles. Explosions also were seen over the skies of Jordan, though it remains unclear who carried out the interceptions. But the vast majority of Israel's air defense over the past year has been carried out by Israel itself. Over the decades, Israel has developed a sophisticated system capable of detecting incoming fire and deploying only if the projectile is headed toward a population center or sensitive military or civilian infrastructure. Israeli leaders say the system isn't 100% guaranteed, but credit it with preventing serious damage and countless casualties. Here’s a closer look at Israel’s multilayered air-defense system: The Arrow This system developed with the U.S. is designed to intercept long-range missiles, including the types of ballistic missiles Iran launched on Tuesday. The Arrow, which operates outside the atmosphere, has also been used in the current war to intercept long-range missiles launched by Houthi militants in Yemen. David’s Sling Also developed with the U.S., David’s Sling is meant to intercept medium-range missiles, such as those possessed by Hezbollah in Lebanon. It has been deployed on multiple occasions throughout the war. Iron Dome This system, developed by Israel with U.S. backing, specializes in shooting down short-range rockets. It has intercepted thousands of rockets since it was activated early last decade – including thousands of interceptions during the current war against Hamas and Hezbollah. Israel says it has a success rate of over 90%. Iron Beam Israel is developing a new system to intercept incoming threats with laser technology. Israel has said this system will be a game changer because it would be much cheaper to operate than existing systems. According to Israeli media reports, the cost of a single Iron Dome interception is about $50,000, while the other systems can run more than $2 million per missile. Iron Beam interceptions, by contrast, would cost a few dollars apiece, according to Israeli officials — but the system is not yet operational.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-defense-iron-dome-iran-hezbollah-hamas-326cd1e9484dd38c430d62739b7f2ef3	2024-10-02T02:13:07-07:00	
4 candidates to lead Britain's defeated Conservatives bash Labour, and each other	BIRMINGHAM, England (AP) — The four contenders to lead Britain’s Conservative Party took turns in the spotlight on Wednesday, each claiming to be the one who can lead the right-of-center party back from a catastrophic election defeat. Former Immigration Minister Robert Jenrick, ex-Business Secretary Kemi Badenoch, former Foreign Secretary James Cleverly and ex-Security Minister Tom Tugendhat each made impassioned speeches aimed at persuading party members that they have what it takes to turn around public opinion, trounce the Labour Party of Prime Minister Keir Starmer and return the Conservatives to power at the next election, due by 2029. That’s a tall order. After years of division, scandal and economic tumult, U.K. voters comprehensively rejected the Tories in a July election, leaving the party that had governed since 2010 with just 121 seats in the 650-seat House of Commons. The center-left Labour Party won more than 400. Jenrick, a former centrist who has shifted to the right with tough talk on migration, and the energetic libertarian Badenoch are considered the front-runners, though Cleverly's upbeat appeal for unity went down well with delegates in the auditorium. An initial field of six candidates was whittled down by Conservative lawmakers to four before the conference. Legislators will eliminate two more in voting next week. Party members across the country will then vote to pick a winner, who will be announced Nov. 2. The candidates agreed that they want a smaller state and a more vibrant economy and that they all revere the late Margaret Thatcher, whose 11 years in power transformed the U.K. They differed on how far to emulate Reform U.K., the hard-right, anti-immigrant party led by populist politician Nigel Farage. Though Reform won only five seats in the election, it came second in many more, and its rapid rise has scared some Conservatives into moving to the right. Jenrick leaned furthest towards embracing Reform, saying Britain needed a 'New Conservative Party' — an echo of the 'New Labour' project that returned that party to power under Tony Blair in the 1990s. He pledged to take Britain out of the European Court of Human Rights, scrap the U.K.’s own Human Rights Act, end mass migration, abolish carbon-emissions targets and 'stand for our nation and our culture, our identity and our way of life.' Nigeria-raised Badenoch cast herself as a fearless truth-teller, declaring that 'the system is broken,' arguing for a low-tax, free-market economy and pledging to 'rewire, reboot and reprogram' the British state. 'In government, we did not always keep our promises,' she said. 'We promised to lower taxes, they went up. We promised to lower immigration, it went up. ' Cleverly, who comes from a centrist section of the party, said there would be 'no mergers, no deals' with Reform if he won. He warned that the party must not 'wallow in self-pity' or veer to extremes. He also struck a note of humility, arguing that the party let the electorate down. Before the Conservative Party can reboot, he said, 'there’s something we need to say: Sorry.' 'Let’s be more normal,' said Cleverly, who urged Conservatives to emulate the optimism of 'my political hero,' Ronald Reagan. Tugendhat, widely seen as a longshot, accused his higher-profile rivals of a 'lack of substance … petty point scoring, and self-service' and said his past as a soldier gave him the leadership qualities to 'reconnect with the British people … restore trust … win again.' Delegate Belinda Williams said that she went into the speeches with an open mind and came out backing Cleverly. 'Such passion,' she said. 'He came out with some fantastic ideas.' Another party member, Steven Stanbury, thought Badenoch had best diagnosed 'what went wrong' for the party. 'We said one thing and we failed total and utterly to deliver,' he said. The slogan of the four-day conference in the central English city of Birmingham was the subdued 'review and rebuild.' But the leadership contest gave the event something of the buzz of a U.S. convention, with huge banners bearing the candidates’ faces, and branded merchandise including giant foam fingers for Tugendhat, 'We want Bobby J' baseball caps for Jenrick and T-shirts urging people to 'Be more Kemi.' Though all the candidates took potshots at Labour, the party’s time-consuming leadership contest has weakened its ability to capitalize on the new government’s missteps. Starmer’s personal approval rating has plunged amid his gloomy pronouncements about the economy and revelations about his acceptance of freebies from a wealthy Labour donor. Keiran Pedley, director of U.K. politics at pollster Ipsos, said the Conservative Party 'faces an uphill battle' whoever leads it. In an Ipsos poll released Tuesday, 64% of respondents said they didn’t care who became Conservative leader, while 31% said they cared a great deal or a fair amount. The pollster surveyed 1,100 British adults and the margin of error is plus or minus three percentage points. 'The public is largely indifferent to the leadership race, and the candidates are relatively unknown,' Pedley said.	https://apnews.com/article/uk-conservative-party-leadership-candidates-speeches-conference-edec89b2a7f02bb49bf2987bf3b54264	2024-10-02T02:06:15-07:00	
In music and dance, Sudanese performers transport refugee audiences back home	CAIRO (AP) — As the performers took the stage and the traditional drum beat gained momentum, Sudanese refugees sitting in the audience were moved to tears. Hadia Moussa said the melody reminded her of the country's Nuba Mountains, her family's ancestral home. 'Performances like this help people mentally affected by the war. It reminds us of the Sudanese folklore and our culture,' she said. Sudan has been engulfed by violence since April 2023, when war between the Sudanese military and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces broke out across the country. The conflict has turned the capital, Khartoum, into an urban battlefield and displaced 4.6 million people, according to the U.N. migration agency, including more than 419,000 people who fled to Egypt. A band with 12 Sudanese members now lives with thousands of refugees in Egypt. The troupe, called 'Camirata,' includes researchers, singers and poets who are determined to preserve the knowledge of traditional Sudanese folk music and dance to keep it from being lost in the ruinous war. Founded in 1997, the band rose to popularity in Khartoum before it began traveling to different states, enlisting diverse musicians, dancers and styles. They sing in 25 different Sudanese languages. Founder Dafallah el-Hag said the band's members started relocating to Egypt in recently, as Sudan struggled through a difficult economic and political transition after a 2019 popular uprising unseated longtime ruler Omar al-Bashir. Others followed after the violence began. El-Hag arrived late last year. The band uses a variety of local musical instruments on stage. El-Hag says audiences are often surprised to see instruments such as the tanbour, a stringed instrument, being played with the nuggara drums, combined with tunes of the banimbo, a wooden xylophone. 'This combination of musical instruments helped promote some sort of forgiveness and togetherness among the Sudanese people,' el-Hag said, adding that he is eager to revive a museum in Khartoum that housed historic instruments and was reportedly looted and damaged. Fatma Farid, 21, a singer and dancer from Kordofan, moved to Egypt in 2021. Her aunt was killed in 2023 when an explosive fell on their house in al-Obeid, the capital of North Kordofan. 'The way I see art has changed a lot since the war began,' she said. 'You think of what you present as an artist. You can deliver a message,' she said. Kawthar Osman, a native of Madani city who has been singing with the band since 1997, feels nostalgic when she sings about the Nile River, which forms in Sudan from two upper branches, the Blue and White Nile. 'It reminds me of what makes Sudan the way it is,' she said, adding that the war only 'pushed the band to sing more for peace.' Over 2 million Sudanese fled the country, mostly to neighboring Egypt and Chad, where the Global Hunger Index has reported a 'serious' level of hunger in Chad. Over half a million forcibly displaced Sudanese have sought refuge in Chad, mostly women and children. Living conditions for those who stayed in Sudan have worsened as the war spread beyond Khartoum. Many made hard decisions early in the war either to flee across frontlines or risk being caught in the middle of fighting. In Darfur, the war turned particularly brutal and created famine conditions, with militias attacking entire villages and burning them to the ground. Armed robberies, lootings and the seizure of homes for bases were some of the challenges faced by Sudanese who stayed in the country's urban areas. Others struggled to secure food and water, find sources for electricity and obtain medical treatment since hospitals have been raided by fighters or hit by airstrikes. Communications networks are often barely functional. The performers say they struggle to speak with family and friends still in the country, much less think about returning. 'We don’t know if we’ll return to Sudan again or will see Sudan again or walk in the same streets,' Farid said. ___ Video Journalist Mohamed Salah contributed to this report from Cairo.	https://apnews.com/article/sudan-cairo-music-refugees-traditional-folk-war-120d9354e0b03fbb0b825395c409c595	2024-10-02T01:53:21-07:00	
Ukraine's military will pull out of Vuhledar in the east after 2 years of intense fighting	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukrainian forces are withdrawing from the front-line town of Vuhledar, perched atop a tactically significant hill in eastern Ukraine, after more than two years of grinding battle, military officials said Wednesday. Vuhledar, a town Ukrainian forces fought tooth and nail to keep, is the latest urban settlement to fall to the Russians as the war stretches deep into its third year and the Ukrainian army is gradually being pushed backward in the eastern Donetsk province. It follows a vicious summer campaign along the eastern front that saw Kyiv cede several thousand square kilometers (square miles) of territory as the Russian army hacks its way westward, obliterating towns and villages with missiles, glide bombs, artillery and drones. Ukraine’s Khortytsia ground forces formation, which commands eastern regions including Donetsk, said in a statement posted on Telegram it was withdrawing troops from Vuhledar to 'protect military personnel and equipment.' 'In an attempt to take control of the city at any cost, (Russian) reserves were directed to carry out flanking attacks, which exhausted the defense of the units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. As a result of the enemy’s actions, there arose a threat of encircling the city,' the statement said. The tactical significance of the town, situated at the confluence of two major roads, is two-fold. Dominant heights and proximity to railway lines offer Moscow greater protection for their own logistics routes, and a better vantage point for attacks against Ukrainian forces and supply lines feeding the south. Its capture is another notch in Moscow’s belt, bringing it closer to the key logistics hub of Pokrovsk. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine	https://apnews.com/article/ukraine-russia-war-vuhledar-186ac647ae5ac93d6007e31a82a5e1ae	2024-10-02T01:06:22-07:00	
The UK and EU vow to mend their Brexit battered ties. They will set a new agenda and hold summits	BRUSSELS (AP) — The United Kingdom and the European Union agreed on Wednesday to strengthen their relationship after the damage caused by Brexit and to hold a series of meetings, including at the highest level, on issues like economic growth, energy, security and migration. In a statement issued after talks in Brussels, U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen agreed on 'the importance of the unique relationship' they share and vowed to 'ambitiously' strengthen their cooperation. The leaders both recommitted to the Withdrawal Agreement and other pacts reached on the terms of Brexit as Britain left the world’s biggest trade bloc four years ago, the first country to do so, creating a deep rift between them. They also reaffirmed their commitment to uphold international law and to the European Convention on Human Rights. Hard-line Brexiteers want the U.K. to leave the convention so that asylum-seekers can be deported without the intervention of rights courts. Britons voted to leave the EU during the 2016 Brexit referendum, when a key promise of the campaign to exit was that it would give the U.K. more control over its borders. But immigration figures have gone up, not down, since then. Von der Leyen and Starmer underlined the shared challenges that they face, notably because of Russia's full-fledged invasion of Ukraine, and they both 'reiterated their unwavering support for Ukraine’s sovereignty.' They said that 'a stable, positive and forward-looking relationship was in their mutual interests and provided the basis for long term cooperation.' An agenda for their cooperation will be established in coming months. It would start by 'defining together the areas in which strengthened cooperation would be mutually beneficial, such as the economy, energy, security and resilience, in full respect of their internal procedures and institutional prerogatives.' The two said they would meet again in the fall, and that the first of what should become a regular series of EU-U.K. summits should be held early next year. Earlier, standing alongside von der Leyen, Starmer told reporters that he believes 'the British public want to return to pragmatic, sensible leadership when it comes to dealing with our closest neighbors, to make Brexit work and to deliver in their interests, to find ways to boost economic growth, strengthen our security and tackle shared challenges like irregular migration and climate change.' Von der Leyen welcomed his visit and the opportunity to strengthen EU-U.K. relations. 'We have a set of solid agreements in place,' she said. 'We should explore the scope for more cooperation while we focus on the full and faithful implementation' of the Brexit agreements underpinning their painful and costly divorce. Starmer also held talks with the other leaders of the bloc’s main institutions: European Council President Charles Michel and European Parliament President Roberta Metsola. The EU, for its part, wants to build bridges between young people on either side of the English Channel by introducing a program that would allow young EU and U.K. citizens to study, work and live for short periods in the U.K. and the EU, respectively. Supporters of Brexit oppose it. Since his center-left Labour Party’s resounding election win on July 4, Starmer has sought a larger role for the United Kingdom on the global stage after years of soured relations with Europe over Brexit. He has vowed to reduce some of the post-Brexit barriers for people and goods that have undermined ties between Britain and the bloc. Starmer insists, though, that he won’t reverse Brexit, or rejoin the EU’s single market and customs union. ___ Pan Pylas contributed to this report from London.	https://apnews.com/article/eu-britain-uk-brexit-starmer-leyen-brussels-0936054bb4cf4991534a1ce437643a58	2024-10-02T00:25:08-07:00	
Women's role in Catholic Church tops agenda as Pope Francis opens second phase of big reform project	ROME (AP) — Pope Francis opened the second phase of his big Catholic reform project Wednesday, with widespread calls for women to take up more positions of responsibility in the church topping the agenda but ordained ministry still ruled out. Francis presided over an opening Mass in St. Peter’s Square with the 368 bishops and laypeople who will meet behind closed doors for the next three weeks to discuss the future of the church and how to make it more responsive to the needs of Catholics today. Several of the most contentious issues are officially off the table, after they encountered resistance and objections during the first session of the synod, or meeting, last year. They include ministering to LGBTQ+ Catholics and allowing women to serve as deacons. Francis has entrusted these topics to 10 study groups that are working in parallel to the synod, raising questions about what exactly will come out of the gathering when it concludes Oct. 26 with a final set of proposals for Francis to consider. Francis launched the reform process in 2021 to put in practice his goal of creating a church that is more inclusive, humble and welcoming, where ordinary Catholics have a greater say in decision making than the all-male priestly hierarchy. The process, and the two-year canvassing of rank-and-file Catholics that informed it, sparked both hopes and fears that real change was afoot. In his marching orders Wednesday, Francis urged delegates to leave aside their long-held and self-interested positions and truly listen to one another to 'give life to something new.' 'Otherwise, we will end up locking ourselves into dialogues among the deaf, where participants seek to advance their own causes or agendas without listening to others and, above all, without listening to the voice of the Lord,' he said in his homily. The first phase of the synod process ended last year by concluding it was 'urgent' to guarantee fuller participation by women in church governance positions, and calling for theological and pastoral research to continue about allowing women to be deacons. Deacons perform many of the same functions as priests, such as presiding over baptisms, weddings and funerals, but they cannot celebrate Mass. Advocates say allowing women to be deacons would help offset the Catholic priest shortage and address longstanding complaints that women have a second-class status in the church: barred from the priesthood yet responsible for the lion’s share of the work educating the young, caring for the sick and passing the faith onto next generations. Opponents say ordaining women to the deaconate would signal the start of a slippery slope toward ordaining women to the priesthood. The Catholic Church reserves the priesthood for men, saying Christ chose only men as his 12 apostles. Francis has repeatedly reaffirmed the all-male priesthood and as recently as this weekend sharply criticized 'obtuse' agitators pressing for a female diaconate. After a contentious visit to Belgium where he was challenged by female students, Francis said such calls were an attempt to 'make women masculine.' His arguments have outraged proponents of women’s ordination, who have organized a series of events outside the synod this month in Rome to press their case. 'It’s so insulting to keep on saying that the only valid role that will get the approval of this pope is to be nurturing, is to be a mother, while you can be nurturing and mothering and be a priest,' said Miriam Duignan, a trustee at the Wijngaards Institute for Catholic Research. 'He is putting a spiritual stamp of approval on sexism,' she said at a prayer event this week co-organized by the Women’s Ordination Conference. 'It is so irresponsible and dangerous for him to constantly criticize, belittle, dismiss and demonize women who are just saying ‘Stop lying. Stop hiding and stop trying to relegate us to second-class citizenship.’' While ordained ministry for women is out of the question, a host of other proposals are being discussed, including calls for women to have greater positions of responsibility in seminaries and sit as judges on canonical courts that decide everything from marriage annulments to priest discipline cases. There are 368 members of the synod, including 272 bishops and 96 non-bishops. In all, 85 women are participating, including 54 with the right to vote. In addition to delegates who were selected by their respective bishops conferences, Francis named a few members himself to participate, including two bishops from mainland China, many of his closest cardinal advisers and the exiled Nicaraguan Bishop Rolando Jose Alvarez. Also on the list of pontifically nominated members is the retired prefect of the Vatican’s doctrine office, Cardinal Gerhard Mueller, who has been critical of the synod process and Francis’ pontificate as a whole. In an essay this week on German Catholic site kath.net, Mueller took particular aim at the penitential liturgy that Francis celebrated Tuesday during which he begged forgiveness for a host of sins as a way to atone for the church’s transgressions before the start of the meeting. Mueller blasted what he called 'newly invented sins' -– including sins against the synod itself and the sin 'of using doctrine as stones to be hurled,' a reference to how conservatives have criticized Francis’ reform efforts as undermining traditional church doctrine. Mueller said such a laundry list of invented sins 'reads like a checklist of woke and gender ideology, somewhat laboriously disguised as Christianity.' Non-bishop members named by the pope include the Rev. James Martin, an American Jesuit who runs an LGBTQ+ outreach ministry. Martin has a sympathetic ear in both Francis, who approved same-sex blessings unilaterally after the first session of the synod ended, and the Rev. Timothy Radcliffe, who is one of the 'spiritual assistants' for the synod. In an essay this week in the Vatican newspaper L’Osservatore Romano, Radcliffe argued strongly for even doubters in the church to recognize the good in LGBTQ+ Catholics and their relationships, and why the church ought to welcome them. 'The acceptance of gay people is seen in some parts of the church as evidence of Western decadence,' he wrote. 'But the church must fight for the lives and dignity of gay people, still liable to capital punishment in 10 countries and criminal prosecution in 70. They have the right to live,' he said. At the same time, those opposed to a pastoral approach to gays have gifts the Western church should appreciate, including a deep sense of the divine life in all of creation, he said. 'The Body of Christ needs all our gifts,' he concluded. ___ AP visual journalist Silvia Stellacci contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/vatican-pope-reform-women-lgbtq-f8b42b57dcf7ef77dbd3f406780217ed	2024-10-01T23:53:05-07:00	
Two predawn explosions rock the area around the Israeli Embassy in Copenhagen but no one is injured	COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) — Police in the Danish capital said two predawn explosions took place Wednesday in the vicinity of the Israeli Embassy in Copenhagen, prompting the nearby Jewish school to close for the day. Police said no one had been injured and they were investigating whether there was a link between the blasts at around 3:20 a.m. and the Israeli diplomatic mission, which is close to several other embassies. They declined to say whether anyone had been arrested. Heavily armed officers, search dogs and forensic teams were inspecting the area which had been cordoned off. Copenhagen's Jewish school, Carolineskolen, which is just down the street from the embassy, was already due to remain closed on Thursday and Friday for the Jewish New Year holidays, Michael Rachlin, a spokesperson for Denmark’s Jewish community told The Associated Press. There will also be extra security around the main synagogue in downtown Copenhagen, the Jewish community said in a statement. Community chairman Henrik Goldstein wrote that he 'would like to encourage people to be aware when moving in public spaces.' 'And be critical of what you hear on social media and rumors,' he wrote, adding that 'there is no reason to refrain from participating in Jewish life.' Police refused to give details about the intensity of the reported blasts or the damage they may have caused. Denmark’s Justice Minister Peter Hummelgaard told broadcaster TV2 that the incident was 'inherently serious,' adding it was too early to say anything about a motive. On Tuesday night, the area around the Israeli Embassy in Stockholm was also closed off after a loud bang was reported. Police later announced that findings from the scene indicated that the embassy was hit by bullets. No one has been arrested, they said. Swedish broadcaster TV4 said that a weapon and an empty shell casing had been found at or near the embassy. Sweden's domestic security agency told the AP that it was not conducting a preliminary investigation linked to Tuesday's incident in Stockholm and referred to the ordinary police.	https://apnews.com/article/copenhagen-blasts-israel-denmark-embassy-security-jewish-491344e2f65f834f0ddbb7ae65c6851d	2024-10-01T23:05:07-07:00	
Pakistani security forces kill 6 insurgents in a raid in the southwest	ISLAMABAD (AP) — Pakistani security forces have killed at least six insurgents in a raid on their hideout in the country's restive southwest, officials said Wednesday. The raid targeted members of the Baloch Liberation Army in Harnai, a district in Balochistan province, which borders Iran and Afghanistan. It wasn’t immediately clear when the raid took place. Balochistan has for years been the scene of a long-running insurgency, with several separatist groups staging attacks that target mainly security forces in their quest for independence. The province also has an array of militant groups that are active there. Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi praised security forces for the raid. The outlawed Baloch Liberation Army killed dozens of civilians and security forces in attacks across the province in August. On Sunday, gunmen stormed a camp of construction workers in the province's Musa Khel district, torching bulldozers and other machinery. Initially, police said the attackers kidnapped 20 laborers but later it turned out they were unharmed and had fled the scene to escape the assailants.	https://apnews.com/article/pakistan-raid-balochistan-insurgents-c8e4f6683f95d471b5e6fd012e541fef	2024-10-01T22:49:09-07:00	
Under fire and using old equipment, Lebanon's rescuers struggle to respond to Israeli offensive	BEIRUT (AP) — When Israel bombed buildings outside the southern Lebanese city of Sidon, Mohamed Arkadan and his team rushed to an emergency unlike anything they had ever seen. About a dozen apartments had collapsed onto the hillside they once overlooked, burying more than 100 people. Even after 17 years with the civil defense forces of one of the world's most war-torn nations, Arkadan was shocked at the destruction. By Monday afternoon — about 24 hours after the bombing — his team had pulled more than 40 bodies, including children's, from the rubble, along with 60 survivors. The children's bodies broke his heart, said Arkadan, 38, but his team of over 30 first responders' inability to help further pained him more. Firetrucks and ambulances haven’t been replaced in years. Rescue tools and equipment are in short supply. His team has to buy their uniforms out of pocket. An economic crisis that began in 2019 and a massive 2020 port explosion have left Lebanon struggling to provide basic services such as electricity and medical care. Political divisions have left the country of 6 million without a president or functioning government for more than two years, deepening a national sense of abandonment reaching down to the people the country depends on in emergencies. 'We have zero capabilities, zero logistics,' Arkadan said. 'We have no gloves, no personal protection gear.' War has upended Lebanon again Israel’s intensified air campaign against Hezbollah has upended the country. Over 1,000 people have been killed in Israeli strikes since Sept. 17, nearly a quarter of them women and children, according to the Health Ministry. Hundreds of thousands of people have fled their homes, sleeping on beaches and streets. The World Health Organization said over 30 primary health care centers around Lebanon’s affected areas have been closed. On Tuesday, Israel said it began a limited ground operation against Hezbollah and warned people to evacuate several southern communities, promising further escalation. Lebanon is 'grappling with multiple crises, which have overwhelmed the country’s capacity to cope,' said Imran Riza, the U.N.'s humanitarian coordinator for Lebanon, who said the U.N. had allocated $24 million in emergency funding for people affected by the fighting. Exhausted medical staff are struggling to cope with the daily influx of new patients. Under government emergency plans, hospitals and medical workers have halted non-urgent operations. Government shelters are full In the southern province of Tyre, many doctors have fled along with residents. In Nabatiyeh, the largest province in southern Lebanon, first responders say they have been working around the clock since last week to reach hundreds of people wounded in bombings that hit dozens of villages and towns, often many on the same day. After the bombing in Sidon nearly 250 first responders joined Arkadan's team, including a specialized search-and-rescue unit from Beirut, some 45 kilometers (28 miles) to the north. His team didn't have the modern equipment needed to pull people from a disaster. 'We used traditional tools, like scissors, cables, shovels,' Arkadan said. 'Anyone here?' rescuers shouted through the gaps in mounds of rubble, searching for survivors buried deeper underground. One excavator removed the debris slowly, to avoid shaking the heaps of bricks and mangled steel. Many sought refuge in the ancient city of Tyre, 20 kilometers (12 miles) north of the border with Israel, thinking it was likely to be spared bombardment. More than 8,000 people arrived, said Hassan Dbouk, the head of its disaster management unit. He said that there were no pre-positioned supplies, such as food parcels, hygiene kits and mattresses, and moving trucks now is fraught with danger. Farmers have been denied access to their land because of the bombings and the municipality is struggling to pay salaries. The humanitarian situation is catastrophic Meanwhile, garbage is piling up on the streets. The number of municipal workers has shrunk from 160 to 10. 'The humanitarian situation is catastrophic,' Dbouk said. Wissam Ghazal, the health ministry official in Tyre, said in one hospital, only five of 35 doctors have remained. In Tyre province, eight medics, including three with a medical organization affiliated with Hezbollah, were killed over two days, he said. Over the weekend, the city itself became a focus of attacks. Israeli warplanes struck near the port city’s famed ruins, along its beaches and in residential and commercial areas, forcing thousands of residents to flee. At least 15 civilians were killed Saturday and Sunday, including two municipal workers, a soldier and several children, all but one from two families. It took rescuers two days to comb through the rubble of a home in the Kharab neighborhood in the city’s center, where a bomb had killed nine members of the al-Samra family. Six premature babies in incubators around the city were moved to Beirut. The city’s only doctor, who looked after them, couldn’t move between hospitals under fire, Ghazal said. One of the district’s four hospitals shut after sustaining damage from a strike that affected its electricity supply and damaged the operations room. In two other hospitals, glass windows were broken. For now, the city’s hospitals are receiving more killed than wounded. 'But you don’t know what will happen when the intensity of attacks increases. We will definitely need more.' Making do with what they have Hosein Faqih, head of civil defense in the Nabatiyeh province, said that 'we are working in very difficult and critical circumstances because the strikes are random. We have no protection. We have no shields, no helmets, no extra hoses. The newest vehicle is 25 years old. We are still working despite all that.' At least three of his firefighters’ team were killed in early September. Ten have been injured since then. Of 45 vehicles, six were hit and are now out of service. Faqih said he is limiting his team’s search-and-rescue missions to residential areas, keeping them away from forests or open areas where they used to put out fires. 'These days, there is something difficult every day. Body parts are everywhere, children, civilians and bodies under rubble,' Faqih said. Still, he said, he considers his job to be the safety net for the people. 'We serve the people, and we will work with what we have.'	https://apnews.com/article/lebanon-israel-hezbollah-rescue-emergency-services-cc0e211c73d8f033387574a69e14a32f	2024-10-01T22:05:19-07:00	
Typhoon bringing heavy rain slowly heads toward Taiwan, where 4,000 have evacuated	KAOHSIUNG, Taiwan (AP) — A typhoon bringing strong winds and torrential rainfall slowly advanced Wednesday toward Taiwan, where thousands of people have been evacuated from vulnerable low-lying or mountainous terrain. At least 93 centimeters (3 feet) of rain has fallen in the coastal Taitung County in the past four days and 29 centimeters (11.4 inches) in the major port city of Kaohsiung ahead of Typhoon Krathon. The typhoon, packing maximum sustained winds near the center of 173 kph (108 mph) and gusts of 209 kph (130 mph), is expected to make landfall early Thursday on Taiwan’s densely populated west coast, according to the island's Central Weather Administration. Typhoons rarely hit Taiwan’s west coast, affecting instead the mountainous, eastern side of the island. Authorities shut schools and government offices across the island and canceled all domestic flights. In the eastern Hualien County, more than 3,000 people were evacuated from townships vulnerable to landslides. Almost 200 people in the southwestern city of Tainan and more than 800 residents of the southern Pingtung County were also evacuated. Before noon Wednesday, the center of the typhoon was around 130 kilometers (81 miles) southwest of Kaohsiung, moving northeastward at around 8 kph (5 mph). It has been weakening and will continue to do so after landfall, the weather administration said. Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chi-mai earlier warned residents against approaching areas prone to flooding and landslides near rivers, the sea and the mountains. He likened Krathon’s intensity to that of Typhoon Thelma, which in 1977 devastated Kaohsiung and caused 37 deaths. In Kaohsiung, most stores and restaurants remained closed for a second consecutive day. Shoppers emptied supermarket shelves of essentials including bread, meats and instant noodles. Almost 40,000 troops were on standby to help with rescue efforts. The typhoon on Monday lashed northern Philippine islands, where four people were killed and at least 5,000 were displaced, officials said.	https://apnews.com/article/typhoon-krathon-taiwan-1a3d7b4ecf5031ebed065774ca6dcfe4	2024-10-01T21:09:19-07:00	
Mexico's Sheinbaum will keep doing mañanera briefings, though her style is unlike her predecessor's	MEXICO CITY (AP) — Mexico's new President, Claudia Sheinbaum, will start her day Wednesday much like her political mentor, ex-President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, began most of his: with an early morning press briefing from the National Palace. How the briefings, known in Mexico as mañaneras, will pan out remains to be seen. Under López Obrador, they were marathon affairs, featuring folksy dialogue, verbal jousting with the press and, frequently, long history lessons from the charismatic and indefatigable López Obrador. His oratorial skills turned his briefings into a powerful political weapon. Analysts agree that Sheinbaum will try to create her own personal brand, but she will inevitably be compared to the man who set the standard. It’s no surprise Sheinbaum decided to continue the successful formula of her mentor — she has promised to continue virtually everything he did. She will hope to set the press' daily agenda just as López Obrador did throughout his presidency. After her June 2 election victory, the former Mexico City mayor began holding midday press conferences that concluded within half an hour. Sheinbaum would open with announcements and then take questions from journalists. She has not shared details of how her mañaneras will be, but the expectation is for something abbreviated and more suited to her data-focused personality. During his presidency, which concluded Monday, the 70-year-old López Obrador held daily conferences Monday through Friday. The briefings lasted between two and three hours, then he would take questions from journalists, many of them pro-government. He also used the platform to frequently bash critical media and his adversaries. That's how he achieved the strategic objective of 'winning the battle for control of reality,' said communication consultant Luis Antonio Espino in his book, 'López Obrador: The Power of Populist Discourse.' But Sheinbaum, a 62-year-old scientist-turned-politician, has another style. 'As a communicator she’s different,' said Roy Campos, president of the polling company Consulta-Mitofsky. He said Sheinbaum has a 'spare' speaking style. She transmits an image of 'a university professor who tries to demonstrate seriousness and truth through science,' he added. That's a far cry from the folksy López Obrador. The former president would speak for hours, with lots of colloquial language, and he enjoyed publicly confronting his adversaries. According to Espino, the charismatic former president used his speeches to create 'emotional bonds to achieve his true goal.' Through his powerful speeches, López Obrador managed to leave office with an approval rating still above 60%. His legacy makes him one of Mexico’s most popular presidents in recent history. Now the question arises as to whether Sheinbaum will be able to capture the attention and win the empathy that López Obrador consolidated during his six-year term. Campos said it all depends on how she will come across in front of the cameras. 'She will try to create that empathy that López Obrador created,' he said. 'We’re going to see if this daily presence will give her control of the press agenda or popularity.'	https://apnews.com/article/sheinbaum-mananera-lopez-obrador-mexico-president-472598f0eb3ab5a5003b3499fa47af4b	2024-10-01T20:57:43-07:00	
Swine fever sweeps Italy's north, threatening production of prized prosciutto and livelihoods	CORTELEONA E GENZONE, Italy (AP) — One of Giovanni Airoli’s sows turned up positive for African swine fever in late August. Within a week, all 6,200 sows, piglets and fattening pigs on his farm south of Milan were slaughtered under strict protocols to halt the disease threatening Italy’s 20-billion-euro prosciutto, cured sausage and pork industry. Since swine fever appeared on the peninsula in January 2022, Italy has killed nearly 120,000 pigs — three-quarters of those over the past two months alone as the emergency intensified. 'It’s a desolation,' Airoli said outside his farm in the northern Lombardy region that is ground zero for Italy’s swine fever epidemic. No one is allowed in and out except for employees, and then under strict hygiene protocols that require clean coveralls and boots for use only inside the premises. 'It happened to us despite applying all of the safety measures required. There was obviously a failure. We don’t understand what it could have been,' Airoli said. The disease spiked with 24 outbreaks in early September, most of those in Lombardy. The area of greatest concern, where the infection has been confirmed in domestic pigs, extends 4,500 square kilometers (nearly 1,740 square miles) and includes neighboring Piedmont and Emilia Romagna, a region world-renowned for its prized Parma prosciutto. The impact of the swine fever outbreak goes further. Farmers in the 23,000-square-kilometer (8,880-square-mile) area also face restrictions due to infected wild boars, or falling in a buffer zone. The disease, which is nearly always fatal to swine, first infected wild boars and quickly spread to domestic pigs. It does not affect humans. Coldiretti, Italy’s powerful agricultural lobby group, estimates damage to the industry so far at 500 million euros ($554 million), partly due to import bans, and warns that some farmers risk losing their livelihoods. According to its calculation, the sector generates 20 billion euros ($22 billion) along the supply chain, from farms where the pigs are raised to factories where ham is cured. 'The spread of swine fever has reached alarming levels, putting at risk not just the health of the animals but of the entire pork sector,' Confindustria President Ettore Prandini warned in a recent letter to the agricultural minister. The government appointed a new special commissioner to tackle the epidemic over the summer, tapping Giovanni Filippini, a trained veterinarian and longtime Italian animal health authority director who eradicated swine fever from the island of Sardinia. Two previous commissioners focused efforts on dispatching the army to hunt wild boar, hitting resistance from sport hunters and the European Union, which underscored that hunting risked sending infected animals into new areas. Instead, Filippini has imposed new restrictions on accessing farms and transferring animals, and enlarged the buffer zones, measures that seem to be having an impact. In Lombardy, just one new outbreak was reported during the last full week of September. 'It is a positive sign, but not yet a victory,' said Giovanni Loris Alborali, director of the animal health institute for Lombardy and Emilia Romagna. 'We must keep the sanitation high and this will help the animals’ health with better growth rates for farmers and fewer antibiotics for consumers in the future.' As soon as the swine fever was confirmed in Italy, 12 countries, including China, Taiwan, and Mexico, put an immediate ban on importing Italian pork delicacies, like prosciutto crudo, no matter if they were produced in an area where swine fever was detected or not. Japan, South Korea and four other countries limited imports. That brought an immediate loss of 20 million euros ($22 million) a month in exports to a sector that recorded 2.1 billion euros ($2.3 billion) in sales last year, according to the Assica association of Italian meat industries. Markets like the United States and Canada did not stop their imports of pork products, as long as they came from areas not affected by swine fever. Airoli, who produces ham for both San Daniele and Parma prosciutto, like many other farmers, does not expect to restart his business raising some 13,000 pigs a year until swine fever is brought under control. And there is no indication when that might be. That's having an impact on Italy's prosciutto production. 'The limited availability of fresh pork legs is generating strong production limitations,' according to a statement by the Parma Prosciutto Consortium, which produces prosciutto with the certificate of origin designed to protect high-quality foods made by traditional methods. It added that a spike in prices of the raw materials due to the emergency was also 'unsustainable.' Farmers who are still outside the areas of concern are taking extra measures in a bid to ensure the disease does not reach them. Once detected, all pigs on the farm, even if healthy, must be killed. Sergio Visini, who runs the antibiotic-free Piggly farm in the eastern Mantova province of Lombardy, requires trucks transporting pigs to be sanitized a second time when they enter the sterile zone where the pigs are held. 'We do another detailed sterilization of all of the wheels and any part of the truck that could bring contamination,' said Visini, who opened the farm in 2017 with the aim of raising pigs with less stress and more space. He hopes more farmers will adopt his methods. 'This outbreak can also turn into an opportunity to improve animal health and welfare,' he added. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.

Gaza health officials say death toll from a large Israeli operation has climbed to 51	DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Gaza’s Health Ministry says at least 51 people have been killed and another 82 wounded in a large Israeli air and ground operation in the southern city of Khan Younis. Israel’s military has yet to comment on the operation, which began early Wednesday. Palestinian residents say ground forces pushed into three neighborhoods. THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP’s earlier story follows below. DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Israeli strikes killed at least 32 people in southern Gaza overnight, mostly women and children, as the military launched ground operations in the hard-hit city of Khan Younis, Palestinian medical officials said Wednesday. Israel has continued to strike what it says are militant targets across Gaza nearly a year after Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack ignited the war, even as attention has shifted to Lebanon, where Israel has launched ground operations against Hezbollah, and to Iran, which launched a ballistic missile attack on Israel late Tuesday. In a separate development, Hezbollah said its fighters clashed with Israeli troops in the Lebanese border town of Odaisseh, forcing them to retreat. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military or independent confirmation of the incident, which would mark the first ground combat since Israeli troops crossed the border this week. Israeli media reported infantry and tank units operating in southern Lebanon after the military sent thousands of additional troops and artillery to the border. The military warned residents to evacuate another 24 villages in southern Lebanon after making a similar announcement the day before. Hundreds of thousands have already fled their homes as the conflict has intensified. Palestinians describe massive raid in Gaza The European Hospital in Khan Younis said it received the bodies after heavy Israeli airstrikes and ground operations in the city. Hospital records show that seven women and 12 children as young as 22 months old were among those killed. Another 19 people, including two children, were killed in separate strikes late Tuesday in central Gaza, according to hospitals there that received the bodies. The Israeli military did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Residents said Israel had carried out heavy airstrikes as its ground forces staged an incursion into three neighborhoods in Khan Younis. Mahmoud al-Razd, a resident who said four relatives were killed in the raids, described heavy destruction and said first responders had struggled to reach destroyed homes. 'The explosions and shelling were massive,' he told The Associated Press. 'Many people are thought to be under the rubble and no one can retrieve them.' Israel carried out a weekslong offensive earlier this year in Khan Younis that left much of Gaza's second largest city in ruins. Over the course of the war, Israeli forces have repeatedly returned to areas of Gaza where they have previously fought Hamas and other armed groups as the militants have regrouped. Hamas-led militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, on Oct. 7 and took around 250 hostage. Around 100 are still in captivity in Gaza, a third of whom are believed to be dead. Israel’s retaliatory offensive has killed over 41,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities, who do not say how many were fighters but say a little more than half were women and children. The military says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence. Iran fires missiles to avenge attacks on militant allies Iran launched at least 180 missiles into Israel on Tuesday in what it said was retaliation for a series of devastating blows Israel has landed in recent weeks against Hezbollah, which has been firing rockets into Israel since the war in Gaza began. Israelis scrambled for bomb shelters as air raid sirens sounded and the orange glow of missiles streaked across the night sky. The Israeli military said it intercepted many of the incoming Iranian missiles, though some landed in central and southern Israel and two people were lightly wounded by shrapnel. Several missiles landed in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, where one of them killed a Palestinian worker from Gaza who had been stranded in the territory since the war broke out. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to retaliate against Iran, which he said 'made a big mistake tonight and it will pay for it.' President Joe Biden said his administration is 'fully supportive' of Israel and that he’s in 'active discussion' with aides about what the appropriate response should be. Iran said it would respond to any violation of its sovereignty with even heavier strikes on Israeli infrastructure. Hezbollah and Hamas are close allies backed by Iran, and each escalation has raised fears of a wider war in the Middle East that could draw in Iran and the United States, which has rushed military assets to the region in support of Israel. Iran said it fired Tuesday’s missiles as retaliation for attacks that killed leaders of Hezbollah, Hamas and the Iranian military. It referenced Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and Revolutionary Guard Gen. Abbas Nilforushan, both killed in an Israeli airstrike last week in Beirut. It also mentioned Ismail Haniyeh, a top leader in Hamas who was assassinated in Tehran in a suspected Israeli attack in July. The U.N. Security Council scheduled an emergency meeting for Wednesday morning to address the escalating situation in the Middle East. Israel says its forces are operating in Lebanon Israel is meanwhile carrying out what it says are limited ground incursions into southern Lebanon. Israeli airstrikes and artillery have been pounding southern Lebanon as Hezbollah fires dozens of rockets, missiles and drones into Israel, where there have been few casualties. Israel has said it will continue to strike Hezbollah until it is safe for tens of thousands of its citizens displaced from homes near the Lebanon border to return. Hezbollah has vowed to keep firing rockets into Israel until there is a cease-fire in Gaza with Hamas. Israel has warned people in southern Lebanon to evacuate to the north of the Awali River, some 60 kilometers (36 miles) from the border and much farther than the Litani River, which marks the northern edge of a U.N.-declared zone intended to serve as a buffer between Israel and Hezbollah after their 2006 war. The border region has largely emptied out over the past year as the two sides have traded fire. Israeli strikes have killed over 1,000 people in Lebanon over the past two weeks, nearly a quarter of them women and children, according to the Health Ministry. Hundreds of thousands have fled their homes. Hezbollah is a widely seen as the most powerful armed group in the region, with tens of thousands of fighters and an arsenal of 150,000 rockets and missiles. The last round of fighting in 2006 ended in a stalemate, and both sides have spent the past two decades preparing for their next showdown. ___ Magdy reported from Cairo.

Middle East latest: Iran and Israel swap threats following Tehran's missile barrage	The Middle East moved closer to a long-feared regional war the day after Iran fired a barrage of missiles at Israel and Israel said it began limited ground incursions into Lebanon targeting the Iran-backed Hezbollah militia. Israel said it intercepted many of the missiles, and officials in Washington said U.S. destroyers assisted in Israel's defense. Iran said most of its missiles hit their targets. There were no immediate reports of casualties. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed late Tuesday to retaliate against Iran, which he said 'made a big mistake tonight and it will pay for it.' An Iranian commander threatened wider strikes on infrastructure if Israel retaliates against Iran's territory. The United Nations Security Council called an emergency meeting for Wednesday to address the spiraling conflict. Israel and Hezbollah have traded fire across the Lebanon border almost daily since Oct. 8, the day after Hamas’ cross-border attack on Oct. 7, 2023, which killed 1,200 Israelis and took 250 others hostage. Israel declared war on the militant group in the Gaza Strip in response. More than 41,000 Palestinians have been killed in the territory, and just over half the dead have been women and children, according to local health officials. ___ Here is the latest: The Israeli military warns Lebanese to evacuate 24 villages in the south JERUSALEM — The Israeli military has warned people to evacuate another 24 villages across southern Lebanon. The warning on Wednesday came days after the military launched what it said were limited ground operations near the border to combat the Hezbollah militant group. The villages are in a U.N.-declared buffer zone established after Israel and Hezbollah fought their last war in 2006. Spain will send 2 military planes to evacuate 350 Spanish citizens from Lebanon MADRID — Spain’s Defense Minister Margarita Robles says that her government will send two military planes to evacuate 350 Spanish citizens from Lebanon. Robles said the planes will depart Spain on Thursday 'if conditions in the airspace allow it.' The announcement came a day after Spanish Foreign Minister José Manuel Albares urged Spaniards in Lebanon to leave the country and for Israel to stop its assault. Spain also has 676 soldiers in Lebanon deployed under a United Nations peacekeeping mission. Macron says France is committed to Israel's protection PARIS — French President Emmanuel Macron reiterated France’s commitment to Israel’s protection and said Paris has 'mobilized its military resources in the Middle East to counter the Iranian threat,' according to a statement from the French presidency on Wednesday. French military spokesman Col. Guillaume Vernet would not comment on military resources deployed after Iran has fired a barrage of missiles at Israel Tuesday. In April, France said its forces in the Middle East have intercepted Iranian missiles and drones targeting Israel. Macron condemned Iran’s attack on Israel 'in the strongest terms' and called on all countries involved in 'the dangerous escalation of tensions' in the Middle East 'to show the greatest restraint.' He reiterated France’s demand that 'Hezbollah cease its terrorist actions against Israel and its population,' according to the statement. The French president also called on Israel 'to end its military operations (in Lebanon) as soon as possible' because 'too many civilians have already become victims.' He said he hoped that Lebanon’s 'sovereignty and territorial integrity' would be restored after Israel’s military operations 'in strict compliance' with the United Nations Security Council resolution that ended the Israel-Hezbollah war in 2006. India says it's deeply concerned over Mideast escalation, advises Indians not to travel to Iran NEW DELHI — India on Wednesday said it was deeply concerned at the escalation of the security situation in the Middle East and reiterated its call for restraint by all concerned and protection of civilians. 'It is important that the conflict doesn’t take a wider regional dimension, and we urge that all issues be addressed through dialogue and diplomacy,' said a statement issued by the External Affairs Ministry. 'We are closely monitoring the recent escalation in security situation in the region,' the ministry said. It advised Indian nationals to avoid all non-essential travel to Iran. ``Those currently residing in Iran are requested to remain vigilant and stay in contact with the Indian Embassy in Tehran. Iran's foreign minister claims the ballistic missile attack on Israel was an act of self-defense TEHRAN, Iran — Iran’s foreign minister has described his nation’s ballistic missile attack on Israel as self-defense. Abbas Araghchi made the comments in a television interview on Wednesday in Tehran. 'We sent a message to the American side through the Swiss Embassy suggesting them not to get involved in the story,' Araghchi said. 'We will confront and answer any third party that enters any operation against us in support of the Zionist regime and we will have a crushing response.' He also reiterated that Iran’s response to Israel will be 'harsher' if Israel attacks Iran in response. South Korea to send military aircraft to evacuate its citizens from conflict areas in the Middle East SEOUL, South Korea – South Korea plans to send military aircraft to evacuate its citizens from conflict areas in the Middle East as he called a meeting to discuss the impact of intensified fighting in the region, President Yoon Suk Yeol said. Yoon’s government on Wednesday didn’t immediately provide more details about its evacuation plan, including how and when it would be carried out or the possible number of Koreans who could be flown home. There are reportedly about 480 South Korean nationals living in Israel, 130 in Lebanon and 110 in Iran. There’s increasing concern about a broader regional war in the Middle East after Iran on Tuesday fired a barrage of missiles at Israel and Israel began limited ground incursions into Lebanon targeting the Iran-backed Hezbollah group. During the government meeting in Seoul, Yoon instructed officials to operate a 24-hour monitoring system to track the Mideast developments and assess the impact on South Korea’s security and economy, including possible affects on energy supplies, trade logistics and supply chains. Germany's chancellor calls on Iran and Hezbollah to stop their attacks on Israel BERLIN — German Chancellor Olaf Scholz is calling on Iran and Hezbollah to stop their attacks on Israel and says Tehran is risking a wider regional conflagration. Scholz issued a statement on Wednesday strongly condemning Iran’s missile barrage against Israel the previous evening. He said that 'with this, Iran is risking setting the whole region on fire — that must be prevented under all circumstances. Hezbollah and Iran must cease their attacks on Israel immediately.' The chancellor added that Germany will continue to push for a cease-fire between Israel and the Hezbollah militant group, which he said must lead toward full implementation of a U.N. Security Council resolution that calls for Hezbollah to withdraw from the area near the Israeli border. Scholz said that would 'clear the way for people to return to the north of Israel and at the same time open a prospect of consolidating Lebanon’s statehood.' Israeli airstrikes on southern Gaza kill 32 people, Palestinian medics say KHAN YOUNIS, Gaza Strip — At least 32 people have been killed in Israeli strikes in southern Gaza overnight and into Wednesday, Palestinian medical officials said. The European Hospital in the hard-hit city of Khan Younis said it received the bodies after heavy Israeli airstrikes and ground operations in the city. It said the dead include several women and children, and that dozens of people were wounded. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military. Israel has continued to strike what it says are militant targets across Gaza nearly a year after Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack ignited the war there, even as attention has shifted to Lebanon, where Israel is battling Hezbollah, and to Iran, which launched a ballistic missile attack on Israel late Tuesday. Dr. Saleh al-Hams, head of the nursing department at the European Hospital, said dozens of dead and wounded people were brought to his facility and the Nasser Hospital starting at around 3 a.m. Some of the wounded were in critical condition, meaning the death toll could rise, he said. He said Israel had carried out heavy airstrikes as its ground forces staged an incursion into three neighborhoods in Khan Younis. Israel carried out a massive offensive earlier this year that left large parts of the city in ruins. Denmark police report 2 explosions overnight near Israeli Embassy COPENHAGEN — Police in Denmark said two explosions took place overnight in the vicinity of the Israeli Embassy in Copenhagen. In a post on X, the police said no one had been injured and an investigation was underway. Police had cordoned off the area while police with search dogs and forensic teams were inspecting the area. Addressing local media on Wednesday morning, police refused to give details about the intensity of the reported blasts or the damage they may have caused, and said it was too early to say if the explosion was aimed at the embassy. On Tuesday night, the area around the Israel embassy in Stockholm was also closed off after a loud bang was reported. Police later announced that findings from the scene indicated that the embassy was hit by bullets, according to the TT news agency. UK helped Israel repel Iranian missiles LONDON — The U.K. defense chief said Britain’s military helped Israel repel a missile attack from Iran. Writing on X, Defense Secretary John Healey said British forces 'played their part in attempts to prevent further escalation in the Middle East.' He did not give details of U.K. involvement. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said the U.K. supports Israel’s right to self defense, stating that 'Iran has menaced the Middle East for far too long.' In a televised statement after the missile attack on Tuesday night, Starmer said Iran’s missile attack had left the region 'on the brink' and he was 'deeply concerned about the risk of miscalculation.' Starmer said he spoke to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Tuesday as part of efforts to prevent a wider conflict. Starmer’s office said he was on the phone with Netanyahu when the Iranian attack began. Chinese citizens evacuate from Lebanon BEIJING — China’s official Xinhua news agency said 146 Chinese nationals and five members of their families arrived in Beijing on Wednesday after being evacuated from Lebanon on a charter flight. The report said that all Chinese citizens who wanted to evacuate have left the country, while the Chinese Embassy in Lebanon will continue its duties. Australian PM condemns Iranian attack MELBOURNE, Australia — Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese condemned Iran’s missile attack on Israel and called for de-escalation. 'We’re very concerned about Iran’s actions, which is why we condemn them,' Albanese told reporters in Melbourne, Australia, on Wednesday. 'It is a good thing that it would appear that the defense of Israel, supported by the United States, has ensured that there is no loss of civilian life, it would appear, at this stage. There’s been too much loss of life in that region,' Albanese added. Albanese said Israel had a right to defend itself. 'What we have called for consistently is for a de-escalation in the region, along with our friends in the United States and others,' Albanese said. UN says main Yemeni ports operational after Israeli airstrikes but power stations damaged UNITED NATIONS — Yemen’s two main ports remain operational following Israeli airstrikes, but the strikes damaged power stations, the United Nations says. U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said Tuesday that the U.N. humanitarian coordinator in Yemen went to assess the situation at Yemen’s main port of Hodeida and nearby port of Ras Isa following Sunday’s Israeli strikes targeting sites used by Houthi rebels in the ports in western Yemen. Israel said it was retaliating for a Houthi missile fired at central Israel on Saturday which was shot down. The Houthis said it was aimed at Ben Gurion Airport, where Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s plane had just arrived from New York where he addressed the annual meeting of world leaders at the United Nations. Dujarric said the U.N.’s humanitarian partners reported Tuesday that 'after conducting an initial assessment, both ports remain operational and able to receive commercial and humanitarian supplies.' 'Power stations throughout Hodeida city are, however, running at a very limited capacity,' the U.N. spokesman said. Top Iranian commander warns Israel not to retaliate or risk attacks on infrastructure TEHRAN, Iran — A top Iranian military commander has warned that his country will hit Israel’s infrastructure if it takes any action against its territory. Iran’s armed forces joint chief of staff Gen. Mohammad Bagheri said Wednesday that the Revolutionary Guard was prepared both defensively and offensively to repeat its missile attack with 'multiplied intensity.' 'If the Zionist regime, that has gone insane, is not contained by America and Europe and intends to continue such crimes, or do anything against our sovereignty or territorial integrity, tonight’s operation will be repeated with much higher magnitude and we will hit all their infrastructure,' he said. Bagheri said Iran avoided targeting Israeli civilians although it was 'completely feasible.' Israeli ambassador says his country's response to Iranian missile attack will be ‘painful’ UNITED NATIONS — Israel’s U.N. ambassador says his government will decide when and how to respond to Iran’s barrage of close to 200 ballistic missiles that forced Israel’s 10 million population into bomb shelters. 'But I can tell you one thing, it will be noticed,' he said. 'It will be painful.' Danny Danon reacted to a statement from Iran’s U.N. Mission that any new Israeli action would be met with a 'crushing response,' saying: 'I would not advise Iran to challenge our determination, our capabilities. In the past, we have proved it. We will prove it again.' 'We have no desire for war or escalation, but we cannot sit idly by when our civilians are being attacked in such manner,' the Israeli ambassador said. 'Iran used to send boxes but now, when they send almost 200 ballistic missiles, that’s something that I don’t think any other nation in the world will ignore.'	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hezbollah-hamas-latest-mideast-2-october-2024-9e71114e59ce259511eba59833c84426	2024-10-01T20:00:24-07:00	
Sex workers find themselves at the center of Congo's mpox outbreak	KAMITUGA, Congo (AP) — It's been four months since Sifa Kunguja recovered from mpox, but as a sex worker, she said, she's still struggling to regain clients, with fear and stigma driving away people who've heard she had the virus. 'It’s risky work,' Kunguja, 40, said from her small home in eastern Congo. 'But if I don’t work, I won't have money for my children.' Sex workers are among those hardest-hit by the mpox outbreak in Kamituga, where some 40,000 of them are estimated to reside — many single mothers driven by poverty to this mineral-rich commercial hub where gold miners comprise the majority of the clientele. Doctors estimate 80% of cases here have been contracted sexually, though the virus also spreads through other kinds of skin-to-skin contact. Sex workers say the situation threatens their health and livelihoods. Health officials warn that more must be done to stem the spread — with a focus on sex workers — or mpox will creep deeper through eastern Congo and the region. Mpox causes mostly mild symptoms such as fever and body aches, but serious cases can mean prominent, painful blisters on the face, hands, chest and genitals. Kunguja and other sex workers insist that despite risks of reinfection or spreading the virus, they have no choice but to keep working. Sex work isn't illegal in Congo, though related activities such as solicitation are. Rights groups say possible legal consequences and fear of retribution — sex workers are subject to high rates of violence including rape and abuse — prevent women from seeking medical care. That can be especially detrimental during a public health emergency, according to experts. Health officials in Kamituga are advocating for the government to shutter nightclubs and mines and compensate sex workers for lost business. Not everyone agrees. Local officials say they don't have resources to do more than care for those who are sick, and insist it's sex workers' responsibility to protect themselves. Kamituga Mayor Alexandre Bundya M’pila told The Associated Press that the government is creating awareness campaigns but lacks money to reach everyone. He also said sex workers should look for other jobs, without providing examples of what might be available. Sex work is a big part of the economy Miners stream into Kamituga by the tens of thousands. The economy is centered on the mines: Buyers line streets, traders travel to sell gold, small businesses and individuals provide food and lodging, and the sex industry flourishes. Nearly a dozen sex workers spoke to AP. They said well over half their clients are miners. The industry is well organized, according to the Kenyan-based African Sex Workers Alliance, composed of sex worker-led groups. The alliance estimates that 13% of Kamituga's 300,000 residents are sex workers. The town has 18 sex-worker committees, the alliance said, with a leadership that tries to work with government officials, protect and support colleagues, and advocate for their rights. But sex work in Congo is dangerous. Women face systematic violence that's tolerated by society, according to a report by UMANDE, a local sex-worker rights group. Many women are forced into the industry because of poverty or because, like Kunguja, they're single parents and must support their families. Getting mpox can put sex workers out of business The sex workers who spoke to AP described mpox as an added burden. Many are terrified of getting the virus — it means time away from work, lost income and perhaps losing business altogether. Those who recover are stigmatized, they said. Kamituga is a small place, where most everyone knows one another. Neighbors whisper and tell clients when someone is sick — people talk and point. Since contracting mpox in May, Kunguja said she's gone from about 20 clients daily to five. When she was sick, the lesions on her genitals were so painful she could hardly walk, hunched over and wobbling to get around. Her 9-year-old son caught it from her, she said — he’s out of the hospital but still has lesions. She's been supporting her 11 children through sex work for nearly a decade, but said she now can't afford to send them to school. To compensate, she's selling alcohol by day, but it's not enough. She said she wants the government to subsidize her income so she doesn't have to put herself or others at risk. Experts say information and awareness are key Disease experts say a lack of vaccines and information makes stemming the spread difficult. Some 250,000 vaccines have arrived in Congo, but it’s unclear when any will get to Kamituga. Sex workers and miners are among those slated to receive them first. Community leaders and aid groups are trying to teach sex workers about protecting themselves and their clients via awareness sessions where they discuss signs and symptoms. They also press condom use, which they say isn't widespread enough in the industry. Sex workers told AP that they insist on using condoms when they have them, but that they simply don't have enough. Kamituga’s general hospital gives them boxes of about 140 condoms every few months. Some sex workers see up to 60 clients a day — for less than $1 a person. Condoms run out, and workers say they can’t afford more. Dr. Guy Mukari, an epidemiologist working with the National Institute of Biomedical Research in Congo, noted that the variant running rampant in Kamituga seems more susceptible to transmission via sex, making for a double whammy with the sex industry. Even health experts admit the lack of information about the virus makes it unclear how effective condoms are. Lesions are usually found around the base of the penis, an area that condoms don’t cover, they note. Some women resort to flimsy plastic bags when they can't find condoms, sex worker Irene Mabwidi said. As a leader in her local sex industry group, she said she tries to advise women on other protection measures, such as inspecting clients’ bodies for lesions, though that's far from foolproof. Erin Kilbride of Human Rights Watch said it’s crucial that sex workers are in the room when the government designs outreach programs. 'The government should proactively reach out to sex worker organizations, at the local and national level, who are experts in what their communities need,' Kilbride said. Mines also lack safety measures Health experts say miners are also key to containing the virus. While mpox is spread mainly through close contact, it can also occasionally spread from the environment via objects or surfaces touched by an infected person, according to the World Health Organization. There's little awareness of that in mines, where conditions are often unsanitary. Mines have few, if any, handwashing stations, and sometimes miners don’t shower for days. Infected miners might urinate or openly defecate in mines and contaminate water sources, health officials say. Miners told AP more information and advocacy is needed in mines. Debus Bulambo said he got mpox in February, but sees most fellow miners failing to take the virus seriously. People want to spend cash on sex, even during an epidemic, sometimes paying five times more to go without a condom, he noted. And miners earn a lot — up to about $120 a month, more than double the country’s average annual income. Bulambo said he occasionally paid for sex in the past but stopped, though he realizes he's the exception. 'People aren’t afraid,' he said bluntly. 'I don’t understand.' ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.

Japan's Kojima, with its proud Jeans Street, draws fans of vintage, deep-blue denim	KOJIMA, Japan (AP) — Denim, that All-American fabric, is all about being Japanese in the town of Kojima, where the main road is named Jeans Street, with real pairs of pants flapping like flags overhead. Some would call this spot in southwestern seaside Okayama Prefecture a mecca of jeans, where fans from around the world make pilgrimage. The soda vending machines at the train station are plastered with the image of jeans. The roads are painted blue, with the lines at the edges pink and white, the trademark of Kojima jeans’ seams. With some 40 jeans manufacturers and stores, including denim-themed cafes, the area draws about 100,000 visitors a year, according to the Japan National Tourism Organization. Japanese jeans tend to be high-end, dark and durable. Although a tiny part of the global jeans market, they have carved out a niche with a reputation for craftsmanship. Kojima gave birth to popular brands like Big John, with roots dating to the 1940s, and now supplies international fashion brands, including Gucci. 'The Japanese industry has established a way of looking at denim from a much more connoisseurship and collecting approach' than a mass marketing one, says Emma McClendon, assistant professor of fashion studies at St. John’s University in New York. The ‘art of making things’ applies to jeans, too In Kojima, you might be in for a disappointment if you expect the glamour of a fashion center. Jeans Street is quaint and uncrowded. Each company in the region is relatively small, hiring about 100 people. What you will find are people taking pride in 'monozukuri,' or 'making things,' connoting a devoted, laborious attention to detail. It’s an ethic entrenched throughout Japan, from big carmakers to the local tofu store. 'More like making a kimono' is the way Yoshiharu Okamoto, a dyeing craftsman at Kojima-based manufacturer Momotaro Jeans, puts it. His hands and nails are tinged blue from dipping threads of Zimbabwean cotton into a big pail of dye. He knows by smell and feel the right state of the indigo, which he compares to a living thing. He swears it’s a 365-days-a-year job, as the dye has to be checked and mixed every day. 'It’s not that easy to get this special color,' Okamoto told The Associated Press during a recent tour of the production facilities. 'It’s my life.' The dark indigo hue of Made-in-Japan denim, much of it hailing from Kojima, is so distinctive it has earned the name 'Japan blue,' also known as 'tokuno blue,' which translates to 'especially concentrated blue.' Expect to pay more for Kojima denim Jeans made here aren’t cheap, ranging in price from a relatively affordable 33,000 yen ($230) per pair to those made by top craftsmen, which go for 200,000 yen ($1,400) or more. Thomas Stege Bojer, founder of Denimhunters, an online site devoted to denim, says Japanese brands use 'raw denim' that ages well and lasts a long time. He echoed the ' slow clothing' movement that has arisen in reaction to cheaper, mass-produced clothes. 'We just make too many clothes. The cycle is too fast, I think, and we need to slow down,' Bojer said from his home near Copenhagen, Denmark, where the walls are decorated with jeans. As McClendon, the fashion professor, put it, the Japanese industry is 'shifting the conversation around jeans to be about heritage elements, about educating consumers on historical details as a form of quality.' Momotaro Jeans, for instance, come with a lifetime warranty: Tears and other problems get fixed for free, within reason. Japan Blue Co., which runs Momotaro, a brand that debuted in 2006, said annual sales totaled about 1.6 billion yen ($11 million) for the latest year. About 40% of sales come from outside Japan. A region with a sewing and industrial history Like craftsman Okamoto, Shigeru Uchida, a loom specialist, and Naomi Takebayashi, who works at a sewing machine, believe they have special skills they must guard and hand to the next generation. They spoke while leading a group of younger sewers. The two say they have a special relationship with their machines. They listen to the machines' sounds to make daily adjustments. The clattering power looms are vintage Toyodas, from the weaving company that preceded automaker Toyota. Spare parts are hard to find. There is one loom operated by hand, used for products that the company says boast a unique texture. Masataka Suzuki, president and chief operating officer at Japan Blue, says the industrial history of the region is a source of strength, centered around sewing heavy fabrics, including military clothes and obi sashes for kimonos, as well as the cotton and indigo-dyeing native to the area. That’s why the jeans are for life, Suzuki said, fading and creasing, depending on how they’re worn and how the wearer lives. 'We want to create a product that is a testament to a person’s life,' he said. ___ Yuri Kageyama is on X: https://x.com/yurikageyama	https://apnews.com/article/japan-jeans-denim-kojima-indigo-291d243b88d5c8b67108e2641f739569	2024-10-01T19:44:41-07:00	
Thai police arrest driver and work to identify victims of the school bus fire that killed 23	BANGKOK (AP) — Thai police have arrested the driver of a bus carrying young students and teachers that caught fire and killed 23 in suburban Bangkok, as families arrived in the capital Wednesday to help identify their loved ones. The bus carrying six teachers and 39 students in elementary and junior high school was traveling from Uthai Thani province, about 300 kilometers (186 miles) north of Bangkok, for a school trip in Ayutthaya and Nonthaburi provinces Tuesday. The fire started while the bus was on a highway north of the capital and spread so quickly many were unable to escape. Trairong Phiwpan, head of the police forensic department, said 23 bodies were recovered from the bus. The recovery work and confirmation of the total dead had been delayed earlier because the burned vehicle, which was fueled with natural gas, remained too hot to enter for hours. The families were driven from Uthai Thani in vans to the the forensic department at the Police General Hospital in Bangkok on Wednesday to provide their DNA samples for the identification process. Kornchai Klaiklung, assistant to the Royal Thai Police chief, told reporters the forensics team was working as fast as it could to identify the victims. The driver, identified by the police as Saman Chanput, surrendered Tuesday evening several hours after the fire. Police said they have charged him with reckless driving causing deaths and injuries, failing to stop to help others and failing to report the accident. The driver told investigators he was driving normally until the bus lost balance at its front right tire, hit another car and scraped a concrete highway barrier, causing the sparks that ignited the blaze, Chayanont Meesati, deputy regional police chief, told reporters. The driver said he ran to grab a fire extinguisher from another bus that was traveling for the same trip but he could not put out the fire, and ran away because he panicked, Chayanont said. Police said they are also investigating whether the bus company followed all safety standards. In an interview with public broadcaster Thai PBS, bus company owner Songwit Chinnaboot said the bus was inspected for safety twice a year as required and that the gas cylinders had passed the safety standards. He also said he would compensate the victims’ families as best as he could. Three students are hospitalized, and the hospital said two of them were in serious condition. A 7-year-old girl suffered burns on her face, and a surgeon said doctors were doing their best to try to save her eyesight.	https://apnews.com/article/thailand-school-bus-fire-56780d1c64bc4474fb3157a6740cf938	2024-10-01T19:32:11-07:00	
Harris, Trump's approach to Mideast crisis, hurricane to test public mood in final weeks of campaign	WASHINGTON (AP) — A trio of new trials — a devastating hurricane, expanding conflict in the Mideast and a dockworkers strike that threatens the U.S. economy — are looming over the final weeks of the presidential campaign and could help shape the public mood as voters decide between Democrat Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump. How events shake out — and how the candidates respond — could be decisive as they claw for votes in battleground states. The sitting president, Joe Biden, is still the steward of a U.S. economy and foreign policy at this tumultuous moment and may well bear ultimate responsibility for how they play out. But how Harris and Trump approach the three disparate issues could have rippling impact on how Americans perceive their two choices this November. 'Unfortunately, there are going to be events like this, and this is where you see the leadership of a president show up,' White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters on Tuesday. 'I think this should send a message to Americans: It matters. It matters who sits behind the Resolute Desk.' Harris, with Biden's help, is trying to display steady calm as a flurry of difficult problems arise all at once. She and Biden on Tuesday toggled between directing Hurricane Helene recovery and rescue response work and huddling with aides in the White House Situation Room to watch as the U.S. helped Israel defend against a massive attack by Iran in retaliation for the killing of Tehran-backed leaders of Lebanese Hezbollah. All the while, they were keeping close contact with economic advisers as dockworkers took to the picket line Tuesday, a walkout stretching from ports in Maine to Texas that threatens to snarl supply chains and cause shortages and higher prices if it stretches on for more than a few weeks. Trump, for his part, lashed out at Harris as in over her head, while claiming that this sort of crush of problems never would have happened under his watch. 'We have been talking about World War III, and I don’t want to make predictions,' Trump said at a campaign event in Wisconsin. 'The whole world is laughing at us. That’s why Israel was under attack just a little while ago. Because they don’t respect our country anymore.' Yet voters cast Trump aside four years ago in large part because of how they viewed his handling of the swirling economic, social and public health challenges that emerged from the COVID-19 pandemic. Biden, in comments to reporters before meeting with aides Tuesday to discuss the ongoing hurricane response, seemed to acknowledge the growing frustration with the federal response to the massive storm. 'I’ve been in frequent contact with the governors and other leaders in the impacted areas, and we have to jumpstart this recovery process,' Biden said. He will travel to the Carolinas on Wednesday to get a closer look at the hurricane devastation. He is also expected to visit hurricane-impacted areas in Georgia and Florida later this week. 'People are scared to death. People wonder whether they’re going to make it.' Harris, meanwhile, is headed to Georgia on Wednesday and North Carolina in the coming days to do the same. Tuesday's vice presidential debate offered a sampling of how the two campaigns were reacting to new developments to bolster their own messages and sharpen their attacks on their rivals. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz promised 'steady leadership' under Harris while Ohio Sen. JD Vance pledged a return to 'peace through strength' if Trump is returned to the White House. Biden has stayed off the campaign trail since announcing in July that he was ending his reelection effort amid sliding public approval ratings. His conspicuous absence underscores that Democrats see him as more of a liability than an asset in making the case for Harris, said Christopher Borick, director of the Muhlenberg College Institute of Public Opinion in Pennsylvania. But how well Biden deals with the three latest emergency situations could have a big impact in how undecided voters perceive Harris in these final days. 'President Biden can't help Kamala Harris on the stump,' Borick said. 'But in a campaign where you are turning over every rock in a few states to get that undecided voter, how he manages these crises over the next several weeks could have an impact.' The Harris campaign understands the risks it faces with multiple crises converging all at once, especially given their varied and unpredictable nature. A prolonged strike, a bungled disaster response or a further expansion of Middle East conflict could raise doubts about Biden's leadership, and by extension that of his second-in-command. At the same time, Harris campaign aides believe the perilous moment presents an opportunity to demonstrate to voters the stakes of who’s in the job and the seriousness with which they approach it, according to campaign officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal thinking. The former president, in a speech in Waunakee, Wisconsin, and in social media postings Tuesday, offered a mixture of prayer and concern for those impacted by Helene, jabs at Harris for the dockworkers strike, and an aside about the casting of Stanley Kubrick's film 'Full Metal Jacket.' 'The situation should have never come to this and, had I been president, it would not have,' Trump said in a statement about the strike. Harris aides made a point of having the vice president deliver brief remarks on the Iranian attack Tuesday in between taping interviews for her campaign, aiming to portray her as ready to take command. Late-term tumult has been fixture in American presidential politics, sometimes in the form of scandal and other times with an incumbent hoping to demonstrate that he or his preferred successor would be a steady head at an uncertain time. George W. Bush pushed a rescue package through Congress to stabilize a reeling financial system by creating the Troubled Asset Relief Program amid fears that the economy was on the verge of collapse. The broader economic conditions didn't help Republican John McCain in the race he lost to Barack Obama. Jimmy Carter's reelection campaign in 1980 was paralyzed by the Iran hostage crisis. Fifty-two hostages were released on January 20, 1981, soon after his successor, Ronald Reagan, was inaugurated. Lyndon Johnson announced a halting of bombings in North Vietnam days before the 1968 election, a step he hoped would bring the conflict toward a peace settlement. But the South Vietnamese indicated they would not negotiate and Johnson's vice president, Hubert Humphrey, lost narrowly to Republican Richard Nixon. 'The efforts by incumbents to help themselves or their party's nominee with ‘October surprises’ go back quite a ways,' said Edward Frantz, a University of Indianapolis historian. 'In this current climate, I'm not sure how many voters can be persuaded by a candidate this late in the game trying to show competency.' ___ Beaumont reported from Des Moines, Iowa.

Tokyo shares fall, Hong Kong's advance as tensions escalate in the Middle East	Asian shares were mixed on Wednesday, with Tokyo’s benchmark falling while Hong Kong’s advanced despite the sharp escalation of tensions in the Middle East. Oil prices extended gains after Iran fired dozens of missiles into Israel, potentially raising the risk of disruptions to supplies. That news overshadowed an upbeat report showing U.S. job openings rose unexpectedly in August as the American labor market continued to show resilience. But regional trading was thin, with mainland Chinese markets closed for a weeklong national holiday. In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 lost 1.7% to 37,993.18. It has retreated since the ruling Liberal Democratic Party chose Shigeru Ishiba to lead the government, replacing Fumio Kishida, who stepped aside on Tuesday. A weaker Japanese yen and higher energy prices would add to Ishiba's burdens as he works to pep up the economy. The dollar was trading at 143.82 yen, up from 143.57 yen late Tuesday. Hong Kong's Hang Seng jumped 2.3% to 21,615.87, riding a wave of investor enthusiasm over recent moves by Beijing to rev up the Chinese economy with policies aimed at reviving the ailing property sector and supporting financial markets. Australia's S&amp;P/ASX 200 was flat at 8,208.50 and the Kospi in Seoul lost 0.5% to 2,579.63. On Tuesday, U.S. stocks retreated from their records, with the S&amp;P 500 dropping 0.9% to 5,708.75. The Dow dropped 0.4% to 42,156.97, and the Nasdaq composite lost 1.5% to 17,910.36. White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan called Iran’s missile attack a 'significant escalation,' although he said it was ultimately 'defeated and ineffective.' Israel is not a major producer of oil, but Iran is, and the potential for a wider conflict could affect other, neighboring producers of crude. The price for a barrel of benchmark U.S. crude rose as much as 5% before settling 2.4% higher. Brent crude, the international standard, rallied 2.6%. Early Wednesday, U.S. crude was up $1.15 at $70.98 per barrel. Brent crude climbed $1.10 to $74.66 per barrel. On Tuesday, oil-and-gas producers logged some of the market’s biggest gains. ConocoPhillips rose 3.9%, and Exxon Mobil climbed 2.3%. Shares of defense contractors also rallied. Northrop Grumman rose 3%, and RTX added 2.7%. RTX partners with Israeli company Rafael Advanced Defense Systems to make the 'Iron Dome' air defense system that Israel’s government uses. Most U.S. shares fell. The all-time high that the S&amp;P 500 set on Monday was its 43rd of the year so far. Stocks had been jumping on hopes the U.S. economy can continue to grow despite a slowdown in the job market, as the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates to give it more juice. The Fed last month lowered its main interest rate for the first time in more than four years, and it’s indicated it will deliver more cuts through next year. The dominant question hanging over Wall Street is whether the cuts will ultimately prove to be too little, too late after the Fed earlier kept rates at a two-decade high in hopes of braking on the economy enough to stamp out high inflation. A discouraging report arrived Tuesday, showing U.S. manufacturing weakened by more in September than economists expected. Another threat to the economy could lie in a strike by dockworkers at 36 ports across the eastern United States that could snarl supply chains and drive up inflation. The workers are asking for a labor contract that doesn’t allow automation to take their jobs, among other things. Supply chain experts say consumers won’t see an immediate impact because most retailers have stocked up on goods, moving ahead shipments of holiday gift items. An encouraging update from Europe showed inflation among the 20 countries that use the euro came in below 2% in September, the first time that’s happened in more than three years. That could give the European Central Bank leeway to cut interest rates more quickly.	https://apnews.com/article/stocks-markets-rates-strike-iran-3c147dc46c6ef60cd1e16dd099c4be3e	2024-10-01T19:19:27-07:00	
After pressing an Israel-Hezbollah cease-fire, the Biden administration shifts its message	WASHINGTON (AP) — The Biden administration says there is a significant difference between Israeli actions that have expanded its war against the Iranian-backed militant groups Hamas and Hezbollah and Iran’s retaliatory missile attack against Israel, which it condemned as escalatory. In carefully calibrated remarks, officials across the administration are defending the surge in attacks by Israel against Hezbollah leaders in Lebanon, while still pressing for peace and vowing retribution after Iran fired about 200 ballistic missiles at Israel on Tuesday. President Joe Biden praised the U.S. and Israel militaries for defeating the barrage and warned, 'Make no mistake, the United States is fully, fully supportive of Israel.' Secretary of State Antony Blinken called the Iranian missile attack 'totally unacceptable, and the entire world should condemn it.' There was little criticism that Israel may have provoked Iran's assault. 'Obviously, this is a significant escalation by Iran,' national security adviser Jake Sullivan said. Just a week after calling urgently for an immediate cease-fire between Israel and Hezbollah to avoid the possibility of all-out war in the Middle East, the administration has shifted its message as Israel presses ahead with ground incursions in Lebanon following a massive airstrike Friday in Beirut that killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and Iranian Revolutionary Guard Gen. Abbas Nilforushan. U.S. officials stress that they have repeatedly come out in support of Israel’s right to defend itself and that any change in their language only reflects evolving conditions on the ground. And, officials say the administration’s goal — a cease-fire — has remained constant. The U.S. has been quick to praise and defend Israel for a series of recent strikes killing Hezbollah leaders. In contrast to its repeated criticism of Israel's war in Gaza that has killed civilians, the U.S. has taken a different tack on strikes that targeted Nasrallah and others but also may have killed innocent people. At the Pentagon, Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder made it clear that while the U.S. is still 'laser focused' on preventing a wider conflict in the Middle East, he carved out broad leeway for Israel to keep going after Hezbollah to protect itself. 'We understand and support Israel’s right to defend itself against Hezbollah,' Ryder said. 'We understand that part of that is dismantling some of the attack infrastructure that Hezbollah has built along the border.' He said the U.S. is going to consult with Israel as it conducts limited operations against Hezbollah positions along the border 'that can be used to threaten Israeli citizens.' The goal, he said, is to allow citizens on both sides of the border to return to their homes. Part of the ongoing discussions that the U.S. will have with Israel, Ryder said, will focus on making sure there’s an understanding about potential 'mission creep' that could lead to tensions to escalate even further. State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said Tuesday that Israel’s targeting of senior Hamas and Hezbollah leaders as well as its initiation of ground incursions into Lebanon are justified because they were done in self-defense. 'If you look at the actions that they have taken, they were bringing terrorists to justice, terrorists who have launched attacks on Israeli civilians,' Miller said. By contrast, he said that Iran’s response was dangerous and escalatory because it was done in support of Hamas and Hezbollah, both of which are U.S.-designated terrorist organizations that Iran funds and supports. 'What you saw (was) Iran launching a state-on-state attack to protect and defend the terrorist groups that it built, nurtured and controlled,' Miller said. 'So there is a difference between the actions.' The full-throated defense of Israel, however, may come with risks. So far, there is little evidence that the Biden administration's push for a cease-fire and warnings of broadening the conflict have had much impact on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. In commentary Monday, Jon Alterman, director of the Middle East program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said that U.S. influence on Netanyahu seems to be waning and that he 'seems to have blown by U.S. cautions about starting a regional war.' The White House must 'worry that a sustained inability to make diplomatic progress weakens U.S. influence in the Middle East and around the world,' Alterman said, adding that 'Netanyahu’s assurance that the United States will stand by Israel in any circumstance emboldens Israel to take more risks than it otherwise would.' ___ Associated Press writer Tara Copp in Washington contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/middle-east-israel-hezbollah-united-states-8bed0f7a37b5059ba4c94552ff750f34	2024-10-01T19:10:56-07:00	
Republicans are more likely than Democrats to see Israel as a US ally: AP-NORC poll	WASHINGTON (AP) — After a year of war between Israel and Hamas, U.S. public opinion on the conflict remains polarized, a new survey by the Pearson Institute and The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research finds, with Democrats more likely to be critical of Israel, while Republicans remain more supportive. There are a few points of relative consensus — about half of U.S. adults, for example, say Hamas bears 'a lot' of responsibility for the continuation of the war, while about one quarter says it has 'some' responsibility and about 2 in 10 say it has 'not much' responsibility or 'none at all.' But U.S. adults remain divided on the extent to which the Israeli government is responsible for the conflict continuing. And the findings indicate that the past year of war hasn’t done much to widen or narrow the partisan gulf that existed early in the conflict. Democrats remain more sympathetic toward the Palestinians than Republicans and more critical of Israel, while Republicans are more likely to sympathize with the Israelis and view Israel as a U.S. ally that shares the United States' values and interests. However, it’s unclear from this survey if public opinion will shift as the war in the Middle East expands beyond Gaza. It was conducted from Sept. 12 to 16, before Israel’s military significantly escalated its operations against Hezbollah in Lebanon and before Iran launched missiles at Israel on Tuesday. Hamas, based in Gaza, and Hezbollah, based in Lebanon, are militant groups allied with Iran. Americans largely don't blame the US government President Joe Biden has maintained crucial U.S. military support to Israel throughout the Gaza war, while repeatedly trying — and failing — to broker a cease-fire. Americans are most likely to place 'a lot' of blame on Hamas for the continuation of the war between Israel and the militant group, followed by the Israeli government, and the Iranian government and groups backed by Iran. They place much less responsibility on their own country. Only about 1 in 10 Americans say the U.S. government bears 'a lot' of responsibility for the continuation of the war between Israel and Hamas, while about 4 in 10 say it bears 'some' responsibility, and 45% say the U.S. bears 'not much' or no responsibility at all. Democrats are slightly more likely than Republicans to say the U.S. has 'some' responsibility, but overall the partisan differences on this question are small. Brian Grider, a 48-year-old Republican from Moscow, Ohio, isn't sure how the U.S. could defuse the conflict. 'I don’t know if there’s anything we can do,' he said. 'It would be nice if we could and we might want to try, but is it going to work? Probably not.' Republicans more likely than Democrats to see Israel as an ally The year of fighting appears to have calcified the partisan divide on the war and the U.S. relationship with Israel. About half of Republicans view Israel as an ally of the U.S. that shares its values and interests, while about half of Democrats think Israel is a partner that the U.S. should cooperate with but that doesn't share American values and interests. More than half of Democrats also say the Israeli government bears 'a lot' of responsibility for the continuation of the war, compared to about 4 in 10 Republicans. Brian Becker, a 49-year-old Democrat in Colorado, says his views of the war shifted after hearing more on social media about Palestinians and Palestinian Americans who were harmed by the war. 'I didn’t feel like that was fair for them,' Becker said. 'So that did start to change my mind a little bit, started to give that waver of support to Palestine,' he said. 'Where before I probably would have been just, ‘Yeah, go Israel.'’ On the other hand, about half of Republicans say they sympathize more with the Israelis than the Palestinians, while Democrats are more likely to say they sympathize with both groups equally. Grider, the Ohio Republican, thinks Israel responded appropriately to the Oct. 7 attack, comparing it to the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks in the U.S. 'I definitely don't think Israel is doing too much in response to what happened to them,' he said. Overall views of the war remain stable Views of the Israel-Hamas conflict, and the U.S. role in mediating it, haven't shifted much over the course of the year. Support for the establishment of an independent Palestinian state rose slightly, from around 2 in 10 in August 2023 to about 3 in 10 now. (About half of Americans currently say they neither favor nor oppose an independent Palestinian state, and about 2 in 10 are opposed.) There was also a slight uptick in the share of Americans who think the U.S. is too supportive of Israel. But about 4 in 10 U.S. adults continue to say the U.S. is spending 'too much' on military aid to Israel in the war, while a similar share say the U.S. is spending 'the right amount.' About 1 in 10 say the U.S. is spending 'too little,' which is in line with an AP-NORC poll conducted in early 2024. The mix of U.S. opinions on the Gaza war reflects the complexity of a conflict where Americans may see bad actors and innocent victims on both sides, according to Paul Poast, a political scientist at the University of Chicago and a research affiliate of the Pearson Institute. 'This leads to people having very strong views on both sides, which, of course, we’ve seen,' Poast said. And it doesn’t, he added, make for 'a consistent narrative of, ‘We’ve got to support Israel,' or 'We’ve got to support the Palestinians.’' Hamas killed about 1,200 people in Israel on Oct. 7 and took hostages, some of whom are still being held in Gaza. Israel’s military campaign in Gaza has killed more than 41,000 Palestinians. Gaza health officials do not distinguish between civilians and combatants in their death toll but say many of those killed are women and children. Charles Jolivette, a 42-year-old Democrat in New Orleans who developed concerns about Israel’s offensive through discussions with friends and colleagues who have Palestinian heritage, has observed a kind of echo-chamber effect, where people on the different sides of the issue seem to only hear views that reflect their own beliefs. 'But I would love to have some more,' Jolivette said, referring to exchanges of view with people who see the conflict differently. And for 'not only mainstream media, but the mainstream American populace, to have that ability to have these real conversations.' ___ The poll of 1,111 adults was conducted using a sample drawn from NORC’s probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population. The margin of sampling error for all respondents is plus or minus 3.95 percentage points. __ Ellen Knickmeyer contributed.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-hezbollah-iran-20b070612a8a76ee1d4d6c47864a2355	2024-10-01T19:05:17-07:00	
Palestinians in West Bank risk crossing Israel's separation barrier to flee failing economy	YATTA, West Bank (AP) — At dawn in mid-May, Sayyed Ayyed and dozens of other unemployed Palestinian men gathered at the foot of the towering wall of concrete and barbed wire dividing the occupied West Bank from Israel. A smuggler was there with a ladder and ropes. Each man handed over the equivalent of $100. Ayyed waited his turn as others clambered over. The 30-year-old father of two young daughters hadn’t found work for a year. Debts were mounting. Rent had to be paid. On the Israeli side, there was the lure of work on a construction site. He just had to get over the wall. 'When we reach the point where you see that your children do not have food,' he said, 'the barrier of fear is broken.' A year of war in Gaza has reverberated across the West Bank, where the World Bank warns the economy is at risk of collapse because of Israeli restrictions barring Palestinian laborers from entering the country for work, and the biggest wave of violence in decades. Unemployment has skyrocketed, reaching 30% from around 12% before the war. The past year, some 300,000 Palestinians in the West Bank, many of whom worked in Israel, have lost their jobs, the Palestinian Economy Ministry says. Over the first quarter of 2024, the territory’s economy contracted by 25%, according to the World Bank. Desperate for jobs, some Palestinians are resorting to smuggling themselves at great personal risk through the guarded barrier and into Israel. When they find them, Israeli security forces arrest them — or at times open fire. There are no official figures from Palestinian authorities about workers killed or injured by Israeli gunfire trying to cross the barrier. The Associated Press spoke to families of three Palestinians who said their relatives were killed trying to sneak across. 'These people are being shot at trying to go to work,' said Assaf Adiv, director of MAAN, a worker’s association that focuses on Palestinian labor rights. Wedding debt cost one Palestinian his life Before the war, some 150,000 Palestinians from the West Bank were crossing legally every day into Israel to work, mainly in construction, manufacturing and agriculture. After Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, Israeli authorities barred entry to most Palestinians, saying it was necessary for security. Tens of thousands of Palestinians became jobless overnight. Eyad al-Najjar, a 47-year-old laborer from a village near the West Bank town of Yatta, slipped into Israel through a barbed-wire section of the barrier in July, earning the equivalent of $650 for a week’s work, his family said. Then his son got married. The wedding set the family back $8,000. So al-Najjar tried his luck again. He approached a hole in the barrier Aug. 26, three days after the wedding. Israeli troops spotted al-Najjar and opened fire, killing him with a shot to the head, his relatives said. 'His children will have to work to close this debt in the future,' relative Jawadat al-Najjar said. 'No one helps in these difficult days.' The Israeli military told the AP it couldn't comment on the shooting without specific coordinates of where relatives said it happened. 'The IDF forces work to prevent illegal infiltrations and to maintain the security of the barrier and the safety of residents,' it said in a statement. 'The forces conduct proactive ambushes along the barrier, arresting infiltrators and infiltrator smugglers and operate both overtly and covertly to protect the barrier area.' Labor rights experts say infiltrations happen daily, often involving dozens of Palestinians at a time. Under restrictions, livelihoods have dried up Many Palestinians found their livelihoods gutted by the restrictions. Some sold possessions. On West Bank roadsides, children hawk tissues, bottled water and air fresheners. Some men have tried their hand at selling sandwiches at makeshift street stalls. It isn't just the cutoff from jobs in Israel. The military also tightened its grip in the West Bank, implementing a network of new military checkpoints that have hampered the movement of commerce and workers. Vehicles can wait for hours as soldiers inspect everyone, unlike before the war, when many were waved through. Other roads are shut off completely. In one case, the army closed a road linking 12 villages to the southern town of Dura, said local activist Badawi Jawaed. Many workers couldn’t reach their jobs and were laid off, he said. Violence has surged, with increased Israeli raids targeting armed groups. More than 700 West Bank Palestinians have been killed by Israeli fire, the Palestinian Health Ministry says. Many were shot dead in armed clashes, others for throwing stones at troops. But some appear to have posed no apparent threat. In Israel, Palestinians can earn double or triple a West Bank salary. Standing in their way is Israel’s barrier, running some 700 kilometers (400 miles) long and peaking at 7-meters (23-feet) tall. Many climb over with ladders and ropes. Others hide in trucks that pass through checkpoints. Some slip through holes in fencing, workers and experts said. Ayyed once worked for an Israeli construction company that paid 7,000 shekels ($1,850) monthly. Cut off from the job since the war began, he searched for work in his home city of Jenin, in the northern West Bank. Ayyed said he tried grocery stores and restaurants, but no one was hiring. To get by, he borrowed money from friends, racking up around $1,600 in debt. He cut back on water and electricity. By spring, he had no one left to borrow from and a $500 monthly rent bill to pay. So he decided to risk it. As he scaled the wall, the ladder slipped. Ayyed fell to the ground on the West Bank side, breaking his leg. He limped home penniless. Smuggling rings run by gangs Palestinian smugglers or middlemen linked to gangs on both sides of the barrier arrange the crossings. They provide ladders and rope, as well as vehicles on the Israeli side to whisk workers away from the patrolled barrier. They charge 300 to 1,000 shekels ($79 to $260), said Arafat Amro, a Palestinian labor rights expert. Once through, work isn't hard to find, due to a labor shortage across Israel, mostly in construction and agriculture, Palestinian workers and Amro said. To evade Israeli authorities, Palestinian workers are 'sleeping in the fields, they sleep in the farms, they sleep under the trees, at the construction sites,' Amro said. Raouf Adra, a laborer from Yatta, said he found two week’s work on a construction site in the southern Israeli town of Dimona that would have paid 350 shekels ($65) daily. After climbing the barrier and reaching the site, he was told he was forbidden to leave after his shifts, to prevent discovery. The next day, Israeli police stormed the site, arresting Adra and several other Palestinians. The Israeli site manager was nowhere to be seen. 'He ran away,' Adra said. Adra was handed a 40-day prison sentence and fined 1,500 shekels ($390). Once released, he was transported back to the West Bank and banned from entering Israel for three years. Desperate for work, this Palestinian would do it again Unable to walk after his fall in May, Ayyed said he had to sell the gold his family gave his wife as a wedding present and then his car. 'I know people who sold their furniture,' he said. Four months later, his broken leg is almost completely healed. Asked if he would try again, he replied: 'If the situation remains the same, I will consider it.'	https://apnews.com/article/jobs-palestinians-israel-barrier-economy-west-bank-2971f01fd6fd878399911cef00bfa087	2024-10-01T19:04:21-07:00

In India, warming climate pressures scientists to keep developing tougher seeds	BENGALURU, India (AP) — Unpredictable rains and increasing heat aren't just making life more difficult for the people of Rayanpet, a village in India's arid south. They're also taking a toll on the thousands of acres of rice grown here. 'We used to know when it would rain and for how long and we sowed our seeds accordingly,' said P. Ravinder Reddy, a former soldier who turned to farming on his family's land 16 years ago. 'Now it’s so unpredictable and many times the seeds don’t sprout either because there’s too much rain or it’s completely dry.' Fortunately for Reddy, agricultural research organizations in India have been working for years to engineer rice seeds that can better withstand the vagaries of climate. He's been experimenting with the new varieties for the past five years, and said they're giving better yields with less water and are more disease-resistant. 'I have planted them across a quarter of my 25-acre field because there’s still demand for older varieties but I think in a few years, we will use only these tougher seeds,' Reddy said. India is one of the world’s largest producers and consumers of wheat and rice. Research organizations here, like their counterparts around the world, have long worked to produce seeds that increase yields, withstand drought or resist plant diseases. It's a growing need as a changing climate leads to more extreme and unpredictable weather. According to a United Nations report released earlier this year, more than 700 million people went hungry last year and over a third of the global population is unable to afford a healthy diet, thus increasing the urgency for resilient seeds that can produce food reliably. Apart from India, other programs including a United States government program and privately funded projects are helping develop climate-resilient crops in Africa, Central America and other Asian countries. As India is among the countries most vulnerable to climate impacts, these new seeds are essential in ensuring it produces enough food for its people as well as for export. Defending against climate shocks As climate change intensifies, India’s nearly 120 million farmers — most with less than 5 acres of land — are seeing their livelihoods threatened by erratic rainfall patterns, rising temperatures and increased pest infestations. Some are taking to what is called natural farming — techniques like using natural fertilizers and planting crops alongside trees and other plants that can protect crops from wind, erosion and some extreme weather — to deal with climate change. But that can mean reduced yields, and India’s federal government is also promoting the use of climate-resilient seeds that don’t compromise yields. Increasing salinity in groundwater, heavy rainfall over short periods, prolonged droughts and even increasing nighttime temperatures can affect rice seeds, experts say. 'We really need these seeds to deal with these multiple issues created by global warming,' said Ashok Kumar Singh, former director of New Delhi-based Indian Agriculture Research Institute and a scientist who specializes in plant genetics and breeding. Singh has overseen the creation of multiple successful rice varieties to withstand pests and various plant diseases. And his organization, with funding from the federal agriculture ministry, has released more than 2,000 climate-resilient seed varieties in the last decade. Earlier this year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi released 109 climate-resilient seeds across crops that included cereals, pulses and oilseeds like peanuts. India’s federal government has announced plans to ensure at least 25% of land tilled for paddy in the country will be sowed with climate-resilient seeds in the coming 'kharif' or winter crop season. 'We are breeding for multiple stressors, including heat and disease resistance,' said Janila Pasupuleti of International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics, based in Hyderabad. Pasupuleti said that this approach not only stabilizes yields but also enhances the nutritional quality of crops, benefiting both farmers and consumers. Logistical issues that need ironing out Even as scientists are creating climate-resilient seeds regularly, making sure the seeds reach the maximum number of farmers is critical. Ensuring that farmers know about such seeds, can afford them, and are trained to use them properly is as important as creating the seeds, said Aditi Mukherji, director for climate change adaptation and mitigation at the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research and an author of several United Nations climate reports. Mukherji noted that India’s green revolution in agriculture, which took place in the 1960s when agriculture was modernized to ensure food security and increase yields of food grains such as wheat and rice across the country, succeeded because such services were available and well-coordinated by state and federal governments at that time. Agriculture scientists also say there's a need for more funding for research and development — equivalent to at least 1% of the agricultural gross domestic product, said Singh, the agriculture scientist. In Rayanpet village, Reddy is preparing to sow rice seeds for the winter season in a few weeks, and says he hopes to expand the area that gets the climate-resilient seeds. 'It’s good to keep trying new seeds as after some time all of them will have some issue or the other. If the government can also make sure we get good prices for our crops after harvest, that would help farmers like us a great deal,' he said. ___ Follow Sibi Arasu on X at @sibi123 ___ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Indian soccer team refuses to travel to Iran for game because of security fears	KOLKATA, India (AP) — India’s Mohun Bagan Super Giants has refused to travel to Iran to play Tractor SC in an Asian Champions League Two match scheduled for Wednesday because of the escalating security problems in the country and region. The Kolkata club asked the Asian Football Confederation to reschedule the match, which was due to take place in the northwestern city of Tabriz. The teams play in the continent’s second-tier competition. The organization released a statement on Tuesday that said: 'The matter will be referred to the relevant AFC Committees with further updates to be communicated in due course.' In the top-tier Asian Champions League Elite, four-time champion Al-Hilal of Saudi Arabia made it two victories from two with a 5-0 win over Al-Shorta of Iraq. Marcos Leonardo, signed from Benfica as cover for the injured Neymar, opened the scoring after 11 minutes. Aleksandar Mitrovic made it 2-0 four minutes later. Salem Al-Dawsari, Nasser Al-Dawsari and Mohamed Kanno each scored in the second half. Elsewhere, Qatar’s Al-Gharafa of Qatar defeated Al-Ain of the United Arab Emirates 4-2. The 24 teams in the revamped tournament are divided into two groups of 12 — one based in the west and one in the east — with the top eight from each progressing to the round of 16. In the eastern zone, Gwangju FC of South Korea won a second game in its first appearance in Asia with a 1-0 win at Kawasaki Frontale of Japan. Jasir Asani’s first-half penalty was enough. Also from South Korea, three-time champion Pohang Steelers recovered from an opening-round loss to beat Shanghai Port 3-0. City rival Shanghai Shenhua lost by the same scoreline to Johor of Malaysia while Thailand’s Buriram United won 2-1 at Australia’s Central Coast Mariners. ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer	https://apnews.com/article/asian-champions-league-iran-9e83299d8cfc3aac5b5e711cca11450c	2024-10-01T13:27:39-07:00	
A plane carrying Brazil President Lula lands safely at Mexico City airport after circling for hours	ZUMPANGO, Mexico (AP) — An airplane carrying Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva back to Brasilia landed safely on Tuesday at Mexico City’s Felipe Angeles airport after circling for hours due to a technical problem. Brazil's air force confirmed the safe landing of the aircraft, an Airbus A319, at 7:16 p.m. local time after four hours circling the airport. 'We landed and everyone is well,' Brazil's press secretary José Chrispiniano told The Associated Press in a telephone interview. The aircraft had departed earlier in the afternoon following the inauguration of Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, but experienced a technical problem after leaving Mexico City. The Brazilian air force said in a statement that the aircraft had to consume enough fuel to allow it to land again safely. It landed almost five hours after it took off. Lula planned to board another plane to return to Brasilia later on Tuesday. The Brazilian air force said in its statement that 'security procedures for the problem' were performed successfully, but pilots must 'wait for the necessary fuel consumption so the airplane returns to the same airport it took off from.' A source who was traveling in the plane said Lula was calm but worried throughout the flight, which was carrying 16 people, including first lady Rosângela Lula da Silva, members of the Cabinet, lawmakers and crew. The source spoke under condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the matter. Lula arrived in Mexico on Sunday and had a meeting with former President Andrés Manuel López Obrador. He left for Brazil after attending Sheinbaum's inauguration Tuesday morning. The commercial airport was built on a military base by López Obrador after he canceled the larger partially-built airport closer to the city. Foreign dignitaries, including U.S. first lady Jill Biden, had flown into the airport for the Mexican president's inauguration. Brazilian media reported that members of Lula's staff in the plane believe a bird strike may be behind the technical problem. Aviation experts have said about similar incidents that the protocol for landing after a bird strike requires pilots to fly close to an airport as they get rid of fuel. In January, an airplane carrying Lula's security team was not able to take off as it encountered a technical problem during a trip to the northeastern Brazilian state of Paraiba. Brazil's presidency said after the incident that the staffers were never at risk. ___ Savarese reported from Sao Paulo. ____ Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america	https://apnews.com/article/brazil-lula-airplane-mexico-city-baf4e4a690a62f2b3f3b32534560b771	2024-10-01T13:18:09-07:00	
Daniel Day-Lewis ends acting retirement for a movie directed by his son	NEW YORK (AP) — Daniel Day-Lewis is coming out of retirement, seven years after his last movie, for a film directed by his son Ronan Day-Lewis. The project was announced Tuesday by Focus Features and Plan B, who are partnering on 'Anemone.' The film, Ronan Day-Lewis' directorial debut, will star his father along with Sean Bean and Samantha Morton. The film was co-written by the two Day-Lewises. Earlier Tuesday, Daniel Day-Lewis and Bean were spotted driving a motorbike through Manchester, England, stoking intrigue about his impending return to acting. After making Paul Thomas Anderson's 2017 film 'Phantom Thread,' the 67-year-old had said he was quitting acting. 'All my life, I’ve mouthed off about how I should stop acting, and I don’t know why it was different this time, but the impulse to quit took root in me, and that became a compulsion,' he told W Magazine in 2017. 'It was something I had to do.' Since then, his appearances in public have been infrequent. In January, though, he made a surprise appearance at the National Board of Review Awards to present an award to Martin Scorsese, who directed him in 'Gangs of New York' (2002) and 'The Age of Innocence' (1993). 'Anemone,' currently in production, is described as exploring 'the intricate relationships between fathers, sons and brothers, and the dynamics of familial bonds.' Ronan Day-Lewis, 26, is a painter who has previously exhibited his works in New York. His first international solo exhibition debuts Tuesday in Hong Kong. 'We could not be more excited to partner with a brilliant visual artist in Ronan Day-Lewis on his first feature film alongside Daniel Day-Lewis as his creative collaborator,' said Peter Kujawski, chair of Focus Features. 'They have written a truly exceptional script, and we look forward to bringing their shared vision to audiences alongside the team at Plan B.'	https://apnews.com/article/daniel-daylewis-comeback-anemone-9683ca22582383fed172bad8b68a7c22	2024-10-01T12:51:02-07:00	
What to know about Hezbollah's capabilities after its recent losses	BEIRUT (AP) — Hezbollah has suffered some of the heaviest losses in its history over the past two weeks, chief among them the killing of its longtime leader, Hassan Nasrallah, in an Israeli airstrike. Two weeks ago, thousands of communications devices used by Hezbollah members exploded, killing 39 people and wounding nearly 3,000 in an apparent remotely detonated attack that Hezbollah blamed on Israel. The Lebanese militant group has lost nearly 500 fighters since it started attacking Israeli military posts in support of its ally, Hamas, last October. And hundreds more were likely killed in Israel's bombardment of Lebanon over the past week, which has killed a number of high-ranking commanders and officials. Still, Hezbollah has continued to launch rockets at central Israel. The group's chief spokesman, Mohammed Afif, warned Tuesday that those attacks were only the beginning and that the militant group is waiting for invading forces to enter Lebanon to confront them. Iran, which backs Hezbollah, fired dozens of missiles into Israel on Tuesday and referenced Nasrallah’s death in a statement on state television claiming responsibility for the attack. The bombardment came a day after Israel said it had begun limited ground operations against Hezbollah in southern Lebanon. Here's a look at where Hezbollah stands after its recent losses. Where are Hezbollah's forces deployed? Hezbollah’s tens of thousands of fighters have been battle-hardened in regional conflicts, including in Syria, where the militant group helped tip the balance of power in the 13-year conflict in favor of President Bashar Assad. Hezbollah has five main units, each consisting of several thousand fighters. The Nasr and Aziz units are deployed in areas bordering Israel, with Nasr controlling the southeastern region including the edge of the Israeli-annexed Golan Heights. The Aziz unit is deployed in the southwest, including along the Mediterranean coast. Nasr and Aziz commanders were killed in Israeli airstrikes earlier this year but were believed to have been replaced. The Badr unit is deployed in an area that includes Apple province, a mountainous region overlooking large parts of southern Lebanon that has been a Hezbollah stronghold since the late 1980s. The Haidar unit is in the eastern Bekaa Valley while the Dahiyeh unit is in Beirut’s heavily populated southern suburb that housed the group’s headquarters where Nasrallah was killed Friday. The group also has the elite Radwan Force of several thousand fighters, part of which is deployed along the border with Israel. Hezbollah’s Al-Manar TV said in a report Monday that invading Israeli troops will get to know the experienced fighters of Radwan Force if they decide to launch a ground invasion. Which Hezbollah commanders are still in control? In recent weeks, Hezbollah has lost some of its most experienced military commanders, including Ibrahim Akil, who was in charge of the Radwan Force, and Ibrahim Kobbeisi, who was the group’s missiles commander. The commander of Hezbollah’s drones unit, Mohammed Surour, and the commander of Hezbollah forces in south Lebanon, Ali Karaki, were also killed in air strikes. In late July, Israel killed Hezbollah's top military commander, Fouad Shukur. Among the group’s commanders who are still active is Talal Hamieh, who is in charge of Hezbollah’s external operations, and Khodor Nader, who heads the group’s security unit. Hezbollah denied Israeli statements that claimed to have killed senior military commander known as Abu Ali Rida, commander of the Badr unit. The group’s strongman, Hashem Safieddine, Nasrallah’s maternal cousin, is also alive and widely expected to replace Nasrallah as Hezbollah secretary-general. Safieddine is close to Iran and his son, Rida, is married to Zeinab Soleimani, the daughter of an Iranian general who was killed in a U.S. airstrike in Iraq in 2020. What types of weapons does Hezbollah still have? Hezbollah has an arsenal of more than 150,000 rockets and missiles as well as surveillance and explosive drones of different types. Over the past year, Hezbollah has used a small type of guided missile known as Almas, or Diamond, as well as short-range Falaq and Burkan rockets from areas several kilometers (miles) from the border. Over the past week, Hezbollah introduced the middle-range Fadi rockets, attacking the outskirts of Tel Aviv and the northern city of Haifa. Hezbollah has yet to use all the weapons it is believed to possess, including its precision-guided missiles and surface-to-sea missiles such as the Russian-made Yakhont. Israeli officials say its bombardment of large swaths of Lebanon over the past week aimed to take out Hezbollah's supplies of weapons. However, since the escalation began, Hezbollah has continued to launch attacks across the border and even unveiled new types of weapons. On Tuesday, Hezbollah said it fired middle-range Fadi-4 rockets toward the headquarters of Israel’s Mossad intelligence agency. Hours later, the group said it fired similar rockets toward an air base in a Tel Aviv suburb. The group has used surface-to-air missiles and shot down or chased off Israeli drones on several occasions — including in the past week. Most of the incoming fire has either been intercepted or landed in open areas. But Israeli military officials warn that the country's air defenses are not hermetic.	https://apnews.com/article/lebanon-israel-hezbollah-nasrallah-ground-operation-c14b6079a847fde6f7f9ce148ea55053	2024-10-01T09:56:10-07:00	
Christmas starts in Venezuela, but the festive mood is nowhere to be found	CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) — It doesn’t feel like Christmas in Venezuela. At least not yet. Even if the president wants it to be. Residents of Caracas, the capital, woke up Tuesday to a towering Christmas tree standing in a popular public square, weeks after President Nicolás Maduro declared the jolly season would start earlier this year in the South American country. Workers rushed to set up decorations in various neighborhoods, but the mood was far from festive. 'I think it’s terrible because it’s October,' said Desiré Aguiar, 32, before setting up her jewelry and accessories booth in a local market. 'Halloween hasn’t even passed, and it’s already Christmas? Are we celebrating them together?' Venezuelans, particularly those who remember life at the turn of the century, have long associated Christmas with careless shopping and bulging wallets thanks to profit-sharing and holiday bonuses employers paid at the end of the year. Employees often received three times their monthly salary all at once. The smell of fresh paint even signaled the arrival of Christmas because so many put a new coat on their walls. These days, however, meager wages and bonuses resulting from the country’s economic collapse have turned the season into a time of have and have-nots. And this year, the season arrived amid a collective pessimism that followed the July 28 election. 'If they start paying... the Christmas bonus in advance, we won’t have anything left in December,' Aguiar lamented. 'I think it’s a really bad idea.' It remains unclear whether public and private employers will make changes to bonus payments this year. Maduro, whom electoral authorities handed a third six-year term, surprised the country on Sept. 2 when he declared on state television that the Christmas season would start earlier than ever. Mockery followed Maduro’s decree across social media, but on the streets, few dared to say anything about the decision — another sign of the chilling effect resulting from the repression campaign unleashed by the government after the highly anticipated election. Thousands of people, including minors, took to the streets across Venezuela hours after ruling party-loyal electoral authorities declared Maduro the winner without showing any vote tallies. The protests were largely peaceful, but demonstrators also toppled statues of Maduro’s predecessor, the late leader Hugo Chávez, threw rocks at law enforcement officers and buildings, and burned police motorcycles and government propaganda. Maduro and his ruling party allies, who control all aspects of government, responded to the demonstrations with full force. Security forces detained more than 2,000 people, including minors, and more than 20 protesters were killed. Maduro also called on Venezuelans to denounce election doubters via a government-run app originally created to report power outages and complaints about state-provided services. This prompted people to delete photos, videos, memes, messages and apps from their phones to avoid prosecution. On Tuesday, while some rejected Maduro’s decree for economic or political reasons, others rejected it for puritanical reasons. 'Christmas is in December. We must be clear about that, we celebrate the birth of our Lord Jesus Christ,' Wilfredo Gutiérrez, 61, said while observing a group of workers setting up decorative lights along a main avenue in Caracas. 'The one good thing is that they picked up the trash. Normally, this place is dirty.' ___ Garcia Cano reported from Mexico City.	https://apnews.com/article/venezuela-christmas-maduro-election-repression-70c691563a257284d6a5a056bafac452	2024-10-01T09:42:27-07:00	
Watchdog blasts DEA for not reporting waterboarding, torture by Latin American partners	MIAMI (AP) — A federal government watchdog is blasting the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration for failing to timely report human rights violations committed by Latin American law enforcement partners who admitted to waterboarding, suffocating and torturing crime suspects. The management advisory memorandum published Tuesday by the Justice Department’s Office of the Inspector General centers on the DEA’s obligations under what’s known as the Leahy Act, which prohibits the U.S. from providing foreign assistance to security forces that violate human rights. Foreign police officers and units working closely with the DEA in the frontlines of the war on drugs must undergo vetting to comply with the law, one of the U.S.’ most important tools to promote respect for human rights among security forces. The Inspector General, as part of an ongoing audit of the DEA's use of polygraph examinations as part of the vetting process, found five instances in which the DEA failed to notify the State Department of potential violations that it turned up last year. In one instance, three officers from an unidentified Central American nation admitted to waterboarding and placing plastic bags over the heads of suspects to obtain information, the watchdog said. Another, also from Central America, and who was previously approved to receive training from another federal U.S. agency, acknowledged using a Taser until suspects passed out or vomited. Finally, an officer from a DEA-run unit in a South American country admitted to beating a detained suspect while they were handcuffed to a chair. In all five instances, the DEA waited until the Inspector General raised concerns — in one case almost nine months — before reporting their findings to the State Department. The DEA did not immediately respond to a request for comment. But as part of the audit, it told the Inspector General that at the time of the incidents it did not have a policy, procedures and training in place to ensure the potential violators are brought to the attention of the State Department. It has since updated its policies to train agents in the Leahy Law's guidelines and ensure violators are identified in a timely fashion. Last week the Inspector General published a 49-page report detailing how the DEA in recent years has hired almost 300 special agents and research analysts who either failed to pass a required polygraph exam during the onboarding process or provided disqualifying information during the examination. While polygraph exams are typically not admissible in court proceedings, they are frequently used by federal law enforcement agencies and for national security clearances. The DEA had long been a holdout among federal law enforcement agencies in not requiring applicants to pass a lie detector test before being hired. But in 2019, after a series of overseas scandals, including revelations that a once-star agent in Colombia who conspired with cartels was hired despite showing signs of deception on a polygraph, it tightened its procedures.	https://apnews.com/article/dea-human-rights-violations-drug-enforcement-a0d2edb7dd2146ae0cfd29f80a0b8a17	2024-10-01T08:57:15-07:00

Swiss glaciers are receding again after 2 punishing years and despite a good start to 2024	GENEVA (AP) — The volume of Switzerland's glaciers shrank again this summer, compounding the negative impact of climate change after a devastating two-year run that depleted the ice by more than 10%, scientific experts reported Tuesday. The cryosphere observation team at the Swiss Academy of Sciences reported that high temperatures in July and August, combined with the heat-absorbing impact of reddish-yellow dust blown northward from the Sahara Desert onto Swiss glaciers, led to a loss of 2.5% of their volume this year. The shrinkage came despite 'extremely favorable' conditions through June, the academy said, thanks to 30% more snowfall in the preceding winter compared to average levels, meaning that the glaciers had an extra layer of protective covering of snow — before temperatures rose. 'August saw the greatest loss of ice recorded since measurements began,' the academy said in a statement summarizing the findings. 'The retreat of the glacier tongues and their disintegration continue unabated as a result of climate change,' it said, adding that the 2.5% loss of volume was higher than the average levels over the last decade. Experts at the Glacier Monitoring in Switzerland network, known as GLAMOS, said that more than half of the glaciers it monitored completely lost their snow coverage throughout the summer. Several topmost measurement points on glaciers, such as Plaine Morte and Gries in the south and Silvretta in the east, recorded melt rates of a meter or more, the network said in a report for the Swiss Academy of Sciences. GLAMOS cited three factors: 'very high' average air temperatures in July and August; good weather in those months in which there was no fresh snow; and southwesterly winds in the winter and spring that dumped the Saharan dust onto the Alps, causing a warming effect on the ice. Switzerland is home to the most glaciers of any country in Europe, and saw 4% of its total glacier volume disappear last year. That was the second-biggest decline in a single year on top of a 6% drop in 2022. ___ Follow AP’s climate and environment coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/climate-and-environment	https://apnews.com/article/switzerland-glacier-melt-2024-climate-change-57afa74ffc3a95d02ce1ddb38db4e9af	2024-10-01T08:22:49-07:00	
French and US companies to invest $10 billion to extract oil off Suriname's coast	PARAMARIBO, Suriname (AP) — France’s TotalEnergies and U.S. hydrocarbon company APA Corp. plan to invest $10 billion to extract oil off the coast of Suriname in a historic investment for the South American country, officials announced Tuesday. The first oil is expected by mid-2028, with an anticipated production of 220,000 barrels per day, according to TotalEnergies CEO Patrick Pouyanné, who flew to Suriname to personally announce the investment, the country’s largest to date. The so-called GranMorgu project focuses on an offshore area believed to contain some 700 million barrels of oil. It is adjacent to a successful ExxonMobil project in waters belonging to neighboring Guyana. 'Today is a historic day for Suriname,' said a jubilant President Chan Santokhi, calling it 'a day that will determine our future.' TotalEnergies will partner with APA Corp, a holding company for Apache Corporation, a Texas-based hydrocarbon exploration business, and Staatsolie, the local national oil producer representing the Surinamese government. Staatsolie plans to issue bonds in 2025 to finance its participation, since it is entitled to a 20% stake under the production sharing contract. The company secured an initial $175 million payment and is now in talks with banks and planning a bond offer to complete a second payment, Jagesar said. Santokhi said the anticipated revenue from the project would be used to raise the standard of living in Suriname, a country of more than 640,000 people with a poverty rate of 18%, according to the Inter-American Development Bank. 'This is a game-changer,' he said. Suriname holds $3.5 billion in debt and is undergoing a three-year, $688 IMF restructuring program that led to austerity measures and sparked violent protests last year. Annand Jagesar, CEO of Staatsolie, said that the oil exploration deal means that 'Suriname will never be the same.' But he warned of potential poor governance, noting how Venezuela had plenty of reserves but still struggled economically since it did not develop other resources and was oil dependent. TotalEnergies has pledged to develop its project responsibly, utilizing advanced technologies to minimize greenhouse gas emissions.	https://apnews.com/article/france-us-suriname-oil-exploration-21019fc6255e6c1630f6c3d7e70f7c4a	2024-10-01T07:09:54-07:00	
US sanctions extremist West Bank settler group for violence against Palestinians	WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. on Tuesday imposed sanctions on Hilltop Youth, a group of extremist settlers in the Israeli -occupied West Bank who attack Palestinians and their property. In addition, the State Department placed diplomatic sanctions on two men—Israeli settler Eitan Yardeni, for his connection to violence targeting West Bank civilians and Avichai Suissa, the leader of Hashomer Yosh, a sanctioned group that brings young volunteers to settler farms across the territory, including small farming outposts that rights groups say are the primary drivers of settler violence across the territory. The sanctions, which expose people to asset freezes and travel and visa bans, come as violence against Palestinians in the West Bank has exploded since the start of the Israel-Hamas war, following the deadly terrorist attacks of October 7th. Palestinians report verbal and physical harassment, restriction of movement, and face intimidation by settlers circling their properties on motorbikes, cars or horses and spying via drones. The Treasury Department said Hilltop Youth has carried out killings and mass arson, while rights groups and Palestinians say the group is behind 'price tag' attacks – attacks on Palestinian villages in retaliation for perceived efforts to hamper settlement construction. The group may prove difficult to effectively sanction, as it is loosely organized and decentralized. In addition, Israel’s finance minister has previously vowed to intervene on sanctioned settlers’ behalf. In the past, sanctioned settlers have told the AP that the measures have had little impact on their finances. Hilltop Youth has already faced sanctions from the EU and UK. The Biden administration has been criticized for imposing relatively few sanctions on Israeli extremists. According to the Office of Foreign Assets Control, 27 extremists and entities have been sanctioned by the U.S. under President Joe Biden ’s February 2024 Executive Order related to maintaining West Bank stability. The Treasury's Acting Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Bradley T. Smith said that the U.S. 'will continue to hold accountable the individuals, groups, and organizations that facilitate these hateful and destabilizing acts.' State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said 'the actions of these individuals have contributed to creating an environment where violence and instability thrive. Their actions, collectively and individually, undermine peace, security, and stability in the West Bank.' ___ Associated Press writers Julia Frankel and Jack Jeffrey contributed to this report from Jerusalem.	https://apnews.com/article/hilltop-youth-sanctions-israel-gaza-settler-treasury-west-bank-extremist-53fb26077c8d88637b4bd366ad3343cb	2024-10-01T06:18:29-07:00	
The Latest: VP candidates Vance and Walz meet in last scheduled debate for 2024 tickets	Barring a late addition to the schedule, Tuesday night's vice presidential debate between J.D. Vance and Tim Walz could be the last debate of the 2024 campaign between the Republican and Democratic tickets. Both Vance, a GOP senator from Ohio, and Walz, the Democratic governor of Minnesota, have embraced the traditional role of attack dog for the person at the top of the ticket. That could be on full display during the vice presidential debate in New York hosted by CBS News. Although conventional wisdom says the matchup between the candidates with second billing on the ticket seldom have much impact, polls are so tight that it could sway voters on the margins. It also could be the last head-to-head matchup between the tickets because Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, and former President Donald Trump, the Republican nominee, haven't agreed to a second meeting. A new AP-NORC poll found that Walz is better liked than Vance, potentially giving the Republican an added challenge. Although Vance has said he didn’t 'have to prepare that much' for the debate because he had 'well-developed views on public policy,' he had been doing debate prep sessions with his wife, Usha Vance, senior aides, and Rep. Tom Emmer, R-Minn., who has played Walz, according to a person familiar with his preparations who requested anonymity to discuss strategy. Walz’s debate prep included sessions hunkered down in a Minneapolis hotel, with Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg standing in for Vance, according to a person familiar with the process who requested anonymity to discuss the campaign’s internal dynamics. — Follow the AP’s Election 2024 coverage at: https://apnews.com/hub/election-2024. Here’s the latest: 2 former GOP governors back Trump during rally at Wisconsin metal manufacturer Two former Wisconsin Republican governors who together won seven elections told Trump supporters at a rally Tuesday that it’s critical for the former president to bolster GOP turnout in one of the most liberal counties in the battleground state. Former Govs. Tommy Thompson and Scott Walker told hundreds of Trump supporters inside a metal manufacturer in Waunakee that winning Wisconsin means campaigning in Democratic areas like Dane County. Trump was to speak there later Tuesday. President Joe Biden won 75% of the vote in 2020 in Dane County, beating Trump by 181,000 votes in the county while carrying the state by fewer than 21,000. Thompson, who was elected governor four times, said he told Trump to win Wisconsin he had to 'go where the opposition is,' including Dane County, which is home to liberal state capital of Madison. 'And, the retort was, ‘Isn’t Madison very liberal?’' Thompson said. 'Yes, but Dane County has the third most Republican votes in the state of Wisconsin and all we have to do is increase them.' Walker, who won two elections and a recall election, encouraged Trump supporters in Dane County to 'go beyond your comfort zone' and talk with people who don’t normally vote Republican. 'Remind them with this simple truth: life was better when Donald J. Trump was president of the United States,' Walker said. Trump campaigns in battleground Wisconsin ahead of VP debate Trump was scheduled to speak about the economy Tuesday in the critical swing state of Wisconsin. The former president was visiting a manufacturing facility in Waunakee, a suburb of Wisconsin’s capital city of Madison in the Democratic stronghold of Dane County. Later he planned to hold an event at a museum in the state's largest city of Milwaukee, with hopes of reaching that city's conservative suburbs, where his support has softened. Dane County, the location of Trump’s first stop, is Wisconsin’s fastest-growing county and an economic engine for the state, fueled by jobs in the health care and tech industries. It is also home to the University of Wisconsin. 'President Trump’s appearance will be a big shot in the arm for demoralized conservatives here,' the Dane County Republican Party Chairman Brandon Maly posted on X, the social media platform, when the visit was announced. He has said Trump must get at least 23% of the vote in Dane County to have a chance of winning statewide. Democratic presidential candidates have long come to Dane County to hold massive rallies to fire up the base. Harris campaigned there on Sept. 20, holding a rally in Madison that attracted more than 10,000 people. Presidential candidates modify campaign plans due to Hurricane Helene In the aftermath of Hurricane Helene, Harris cut short a campaign visit to Las Vegas to return to Washington for briefings while Trump headed to Georgia to see the storm’s impact. Hurricane Helene’s death toll is more than 130 people and rising, with some of the worst damage caused by inland flooding in North Carolina. In addition to being humanitarian crises, natural disasters can create political tests for elected officials, particularly in the closing weeks of a presidential campaign. Presidents typically avoid racing toward disaster zones so they don’t interfere with recovery efforts. The White House said Harris would visit impacted areas 'as soon as it is possible without disrupting emergency response operations.' President Joe Biden planned to survey the devastation on Wednesday. Trump's hurricane relief fundraiser surpasses $1 million A GoFundMe campaign launched by former president Donald Trump to help the victims of Hurricane Helene has raised more than $1 million. The website calls the effort 'an official response for MAGA supporters to offer their financial assistance to their fellow Americans impacted by Hurricane Helene' and promises that all donations will be directed to those who have been impacted by the devastation. Trump earlier Monday paid a visit to Valdosta, Georgia, and said he had brought with him supplies, including fuel, that will be distributed by the Christian relief group Samaritan’s Purse. Trump slams US response to Helene. His own disaster-response record is marked by politics Former President Trump criticized the Biden administration’s response to the widespread devastation caused by Hurricane Helene, even as his supporters have called for cuts to federal agencies that warn of weather disasters and deliver relief to hard-hit communities. As president, Trump delayed disaster aid for hurricane-devastated Puerto Rico and diverted money from the Federal Emergency Management Agency in order to finance an effort to return undocumented migrants to Mexico. And Project 2025, backed by Trump supporters, would restructure FEMA to limit aid to states and says that the National Weather Service, which provides crucial data on hurricanes and other storms, 'should be broken up and downsized.' Read more here. Biden responds to Trump's false statements regarding the federal hurricane response President Biden criticized Trump for 'lying' about federal contacts with Georgia officials during the response to Hurricane Helene. Trump falsely claimed during a Monday tour of the damage that Biden hadn’t been in touch with the state’s Republican governor. 'He’s lying, and the governor told him he was lying.' 'I don’t know why he does this,' Biden continued. 'I don’t care about what he says about me, but I care what he what he communicates to people that are in need. He implies that we’re not doing everything possible. We are. We are.' North Carolina officials work to ensure those affected by Hurricane Helene have voting access State election officials in North Carolina are gathering information about options available to voters in the counties hardest hit by Hurricane Helene and plan a press conference for Tuesday. Karen Brinson Bell, executive director of the North Carolina State Board of Elections, said during an emergency board meeting on Monday that she will be providing more information, including details on how voters could declare 'natural disaster' as their reason for not being able to provide a photo ID. The board met Monday to approve a resolution granting counties flexibility for holding weekly meetings required under state law to review absentee ballots. These meetings are required to begin every Tuesday between now and Election Day, officials said. The resolution passed unanimously.	https://apnews.com/article/election-2024-harris-trump-walz-vance-debate-9d7e3087d38a0e4b308613c0e2a91a94	2024-10-01T06:17:04-07:00

Chanel show wrestles with designer void as actor Lupita Nyong'o talks diversity in fashion	PARIS (AP) — A giant empty cage greeted Chanel’s guests at its return to the Grand Palais on Tuesday. Though perhaps not intentionally symbolic, the décor seemed to capture the current state of the house itself: a majestic structure empty of creative direction. With Virginie Viard’s recent departure, Chanel finds itself at a crossroads, as the fashion world eagerly awaits the appointment of a new creative leader. Meanwhile, in a powerful step toward embracing diversity, Chanel announced Lupita Nyong’o as its newest ambassador. The appointment of the Oscar-winning actor, who is Kenyan Mexican, comes at a pivotal moment for the French fashion house that had faced criticism in the past for its lack of inclusivity. This move follows the widely-lauded appointment of British-Indian Leena Nair as Chanel’s global chief executive in 2022, making her the only woman of color at the helm of a major luxury brand. Here are some highlights of spring-summer ready-to-wear shows: Chanel: seeking a vision beyond the emp ty cage The spring collection delivered many familiar elements from Chanel’s vast repertoire — chiffon capes, slit skirts, embroidered transparent shirt dresses, trench coats adorned with multicolored feather prints, aviator jackets with Peter Pan collars, total pink or blue tweed looks, and the iconic little black dress that Chanel herself introduced to the world. Tweed, jersey, faille, transparent embroidery, sequins, fringe, pastel knits, and sparkling platform shoes all made an appearance, forming a showcase of the house’s signatures. Yet despite the breadth and richness of the offering, something was amiss. There was little cohesion, and at times, the collection lacked the unmistakable soul that once characterized Chanel’s shows. A series of foulard-printed gowns seemed out of place — as if borrowed clumsily from another narrative altogether. With a snip of scissors, Gabrielle 'Coco' Chanel freed women from their corsets. Today, Chanel itself needs liberation. The applause at the end of the show, which featured designs that often felt uninspired, was distinctly muted, with critics visibly shifting in their seats. Star appearances by Elvis Presley’s granddaughter Riley Keough, who capped the show with a funky vocal performance of a Prince hit from inside the gilded cage, as well the starry presence of Nyong’o, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Vanessa Paradis, Margaret Qualley and Naomi Campbell, seemed like an effort to divert attention from the elephant — or the empty cage — in the room. Chanel is unquestionably a fashion juggernaut, and it will weather this moment of transition. However, there is no overstating the importance of the decision the house now faces. Chanel must find a designer who can reshape and redefine its vision for the future. The industry is rife with speculation. Potential successors include Daniel Roseberry, known for his dramatic work at Schiaparelli, Marc Jacobs, a seasoned classicist with Paris experience, and Nadège Vanhée, the skilled designer from Hermès. Viard, ousted this summer, succeeded Karl Lagerfeld upon his death in 2019 and was his closest collaborator for decades. She had overseen record sales for Chanel, reaching a reported $19.7 billion last year. Ready-to-wear sales reportedly increased 23% during her tenure. Viard was only the third creative director in Chanel’s over 100-year history, following Lagerfeld and legendary founder Chanel herself. Lupita Nyong’o named Chanel ambassador Nyong’o shared her excitement and the deep sense of responsibility accompanying the new role. 'It’s a great honor,' she said. 'Chanel is a legacy brand with a long history. And to be the newest face of it feels monumental. I feel very, very proud and excited to take this new journey with a brand that I think is dynamic and always feminine and regal.' Nyong’o’s appointment comes as a breath of fresh air in an industry criticized for lack of diversity and reluctance to change. The number of Black designers leading heritage houses remains alarmingly low — currently only Balmain’s Olivier Rousteing and Louis Vuitton men’s designer Pharrell Williams hold such positions in Parisian legacy brands. For Nyong’o, joining Chanel is about more than wearing beautiful clothes — it’s about contributing to a narrative shift in fashion. 'The message that I bring naturally and deliberately to the role is that things have changed. And we don’t want them to go back to what they once were,' she said. Nyong’o drew inspiration from watching a recent documentary about Bethann Hardison, the iconic model and activist who was at the forefront of pushing for diversity in fashion during the 1960s and 1970s. Hardison, who rose to prominence after her appearance at the historic 1973 Battle of Versailles — a groundbreaking fashion show that brought American designers into the spotlight — became one of the first high-profile Black models and an outspoken advocate for change. 'In that documentary, I was really alarmed to see how much work had been done to diversify the fashion industry, but then how much it reverted to monoculture in the following years,' Nyong’o said. Hardison’s tireless efforts led to significant gains for Black models in the past, but the subsequent regression underscored how fragile those victories could be. Her fight for inclusivity in fashion serves as both a cautionary tale and a source of inspiration for Nyong’o, who now finds herself continuing Hardison’s legacy. 'It took a step back, so for me that was testament to the fact that it takes consciousness. It’s a conscious effort that has to be made on a daily basis and in present time. You don’t fix it once and then hope it stays that way,' Nyong’o added. She sees Chanel’s decision to name her as an ambassador as part of a broader, deliberate declaration: 'I feel like these movements that Chanel is making are part of declaring a desire to represent a more realistic world. And I’m proud to be one of those faces that is sending that message.' The importance of visibility in reshaping perceptions cannot be understated. 'When I was growing up, I didn’t see myself in ads for brands like this. It resulted in me going through quite the identity crisis and feeling undervalued by the world,' Nyong’o said candidly. She recounted those early days — staring at glossy magazine pages, searching for a face that mirrored her own, only to find none. Now, she imagines a little girl somewhere, watching her in a Chanel campaign, seeing someone who looks like her — someone who is elegant, celebrated, and valued. 'I would hope that there is a message for little girls,' she continued. 'My work as an actor and as an author, as a podcast maker, and now as a brand ambassador, is to change that by just occupying the space.' It is a powerful reminder of the transformative impact of representation; when someone finally occupies a space that was once empty, it changes the way people see themselves and the world around them. The luxury sector has frequently been accused of tokenism and superficial diversity efforts — making short-term gestures without genuine long-term change. Nyong’o is determined to make her role count, embodying the idea that representation must come with influence and purpose. Louis Vuitton blends opulence and chaos in a dazzling collection French fashion once again showcased its formidable strength at Nicolas Ghesquière’s spring collection for Louis Vuitton, blending savoir-faire with cultural resonance. 'French fashion is a formidable soft power, radiating a tradition of savoir-faire, an art de vivre – a cultural singularity,' the house said, and the designer delivered a spectacle that seemed like yet another a grand culmination of the house's journey across time, space, and style. A sheeny striped coat with a curved silhouette opened the show, its adornments and accessories teeming with a kind of futuristic couture—a theme Ghesquière has mastered over his tenure. The coat set the stage for a collection that often intentionally deceived and dazzled the eye, echoing Ghesquière’s penchant for 'colliding references' and reimagining the old as new. Giant petal-like fabrics encircled the necks of models, conjuring both South American flair and a nod to punk—the very hybrid aesthetic that makes Ghesquière’s work so unmistakable. The show leaned into religious undertones, featuring a priest-like robe with fluid proportions, accessorized with an almost comically oversized black chain adorned with a sort of crucifix. Yet, despite the individual flair of many pieces, the sheer divergence of styles sometimes felt overwhelming. One particular black-and-white floral split dress seemed to confuse the eye, its busy patterns making it difficult for spectators to discern where the dress ended and the underdress began. This tendency to merge multiple aesthetic elements occasionally crossed into visual overload. Miu Miu examines youth, uses A-listers as models If anyone can redefine fashion by dipping into the nursery wardrobe, it’s Miuccia Prada. This season, Miu Miu, Prada’s irreverent and intellectual baby sister, examined early youth — and with it, the liberating simplicity and honesty it brings to thinking and dressing. The brand is notorious for blurring the lines between sophistication and play, and it’s no surprise that a baby’s cotton chemisette took center stage and transformed, under Prada’s artful manipulation, into something altogether more complex. Opening with a crisp white cotton dress, this deceptively intricate collection borrowed directly from childhood is the fruit of a collaboration with Petit Bateau. Chemisette dresses, sweaters, and twisted shirts became subversive statements — folded, wrapped, and twisted in all the wrong ways to create something utterly fresh. The result? A glamour that Prada herself called 'dishonest' — a term almost mischievously fitting for Miu Miu’s rebellious ethos. It’s the spirit of a girl who refuses to conform, wearing her tights over her dress, her sweaters in unconventional ways, just because she can. The sense of playful contrast—an innocent wardrobe rendered provocative—captured one of Miu Miu’s long-standing narratives: youth is a state of being under construction, where rules are fluid, and experimentation is freedom. It’s a continuation of Prada’s love for subversion and polarity, whether it’s mixing raw imperfection with poise or twisting utilitarian comfort into a silhouette that exudes audacity. Prada called in a remarkable cast, including Alexa Chung, Willem Dafoe, Cara Delevingne, and Hilary Swank — household names from every corner of the artistic universe, as comfortable in front of the camera as they were here, treading the Miu Miu boards. Where Miuccia Prada excels is her ability to inject humor — a knowing wink — into serious fashion. And just as Prada herself once said, sometimes we must choose whether to be a child or a lady near death. This collection chose the former. ___ This article was corrected to show that Erykah Badu did not attend the Chanel fashion show.	https://apnews.com/article/chanel-paris-fashion-week-lupita-295f0d27ab9e2cfca5c3b1cb28eb5739	2024-10-01T04:59:37-07:00	
France's new prime minister vows to curb debt as he faced baptism of fire at heckled parliament	PARIS (AP) — Lawmakers gave new French Prime Minister Michel Barnier a rough ride, heckling him constantly, as he laid out his proposed policies in an inaugural speech to parliament on Tuesday, a baptism of fire that highlighted how difficult governing will be for his minority government. In a wide-ranging speech, Barnier, a veteran conservative, warned soberingly of France’s colossal debt, promised belt-tightening and more taxation to improve the nation’s finances, and said France will continue to support Ukraine in its defense against Russia’s invasion. But he also faced angry shouts from left-wing lawmakers and immediate criticism from the far right, now a powerful force in parliament after surprise elections three months ago, of not being tough enough against immigration. The address to the new legislature’s opening session was a crucial test for his new government, which has no clear majority in the parliament. The National Assembly after legislative elections produced no clear winner. The mood in the chamber was closely watched for signs of how difficult opposition lawmakers intend to make it for the 73-year-old veteran conservative and EU Brexit negotiator to get things done and keep power. Here's a look at Barnier's key proposals and consensual approach. More taxation and less expenses Barnier made a priority of remedying France's indebted public finances. 'The true sword of Damocles is our colossal debt,' he said. 'If we are not careful, it will take our country to the edge of the precipice.' Barnier announced an 'exceptional' tax on France's wealthiest individuals — but did not specify who, exactly, falls into that tax bracket. He also said an extra contributory 'effort' will be asked of large companies making big profits. France is under pressure from the European Union’s executive arm to reduce its debt. Still, tax hikes would go against the fiscal philosophy of French President Emmanuel Macron, who consistently cut taxes when he still had a government with a clear majority in parliament. Barnier also said he aims to curb spending, saying France has 'much to do' but adding: 'We must do with little.' He said his government will seek to reduce France’s deficit from an estimated 6% of Gross Domestic Product now to 5% next year and under 3% by 2029. To do so, he promised to cut state expenses, spend money more 'efficiently' and fight tax evasion and other frauds. Reign in immigration Barnier, who had pledged a hardline stance on migration, said he wanted to 'better control' the numbers of people coming to France. He proposed to 'facilitate' the detention of foreigners who are staying illegally in the country pending the implementation of deportation orders. He said France will continue 'as long as needed' to implement controls at its national borders in the passport-free area in Europe. In addition, Barnier suggested that the number of visas granted would be conditional on other nations’ ability to provide consular documents for their citizens being deported from France after arriving illegally. A similar move by Macron prompted a year-long dispute with Morocco in 2022. Stand by Ukraine France 'will remain at the side of the Ukrainian people,' Barnier said. He stressed Ukrainians are fighting 'to defend their sovereignty and freedom' but also to defend 'shared values' with France and Europe. He vowed to implement France’s multi-billion-euro plan to boost its military spending, spurred by the war in Ukraine, in the coming years. France 'will also remain active' in the Middle East, he added. 'The worsening situation in Lebanon ... requires our full mobilization with our partners in the region, the United States and Europeans, to put an end as quickly as possible to hostilities that are seriously threatening the stability of the entire region,' he said. Seeking compromises Barnier's speech covered his plans to tackle problems as diverse as mental health and aid for farmers to wind power and sexual violence. Yet, he carefully avoided to enter into divisive details, tiptoeing through the political minefield and using soft language. Left-wing lawmakers kept up a steady drumbeat of shouted comments throughout but failed to throw the veteran politician off his stride. He responded to the heckling with flashes of wry humor and said he aims to listen to and respect all lawmakers 'even if this respect is not always reciprocal.' He called on politicians to 'seek compromises,' overcome their 'divisions and quarrels' and 'act in the best interests of the country.' Bruno Lefebvre, a professor in political sciences at the University of Lille, said Barnier’s 'rather calming speech' took no risks. 'He knows he’s in an ejection seat,' Lefebvre said. 'He has very little room for maneuver.' Barnier vowed to fight racism and antisemitism. He also insisted his government won't restrict the right to abortion, just six months after France became the first country to guarantee in its constitution a woman’s right to voluntarily terminate a pregnancy. He said the parliament will start debating again next year a proposed bill to allow adults with terminal cancer or other incurable illness to take lethal medication, as public demands grow for legal options for aid in dying. A weakened government June-July legislative elections left the National Assembly split between three main blocs, none of them with enough legislators to govern alone. Barnier, appointed last month, primarily recruited ministers from Macron’s centrist alliance and the conservative Republicans to form his government. Most sharply opposed to Barnier is a loose grouping of left-wing parties, the New Popular Front. As a coalition, it secured the most seats in the legislative elections but fell short of a majority. To bring down the new government with a no-confidence vote, the New Popular Front would need support from legislators on the far right who, for the moment, are adopting more of a wait-and-see attitude toward Barnier. Far-right leader Marine Le Pen said Tuesday she could hear 'few solutions' in Barnier’s proposals. 'What will you really do to in the face of a booming legal and illegal immigration ... which you almost didn’t talk about?' she asked. Yet she confirmed her party, the National Rally, won’t support a no-confidence vote for now. Barnier described his address as a roadmap 'for the 2 1/2 years ahead of us' to the next presidential election scheduled in 2027. 'Never!' a lawmaker shouted back — reflecting widespread expectations that his government won’t last that long. ___ AP Writer Diane Jeantet contributed to the story.	https://apnews.com/article/france-parliament-prime-minister-michel-barnier-5071c8ab3c6657f3893aea133decd2b7	2024-10-01T04:30:48-07:00	
A Belarusian opposition leader hails Lithuania's decision to seek ICC investigation into president	THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — Belarus' exiled opposition leader hailed Lithuania's move to seek prosecution at the International Criminal Court of her country's authoritarian president and other officials, saying Tuesday that it will give fresh hope to her homeland. 'For me personally, this step means that I can now explain to Belarusians that the international justice system works, that there are countries who really want to help us,' Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya told The Associated Press. 'For the Belarusian people, it is important to prove that we are not abandoned, we are not forgotten,' she added at an event in The Hague a day after Lithuania formally accused President Alexander Lukashenko and others of crimes against humanity by forcing Belarusians to flee the country. The ICC's prosecutor said he would open a probe into the claims. Belarus is not a member state of the court, but Lithuania argues that the court has jurisdiction, citing a case brought by Bangladesh against Myanmar over persecution of the Rohingya people. In its referral to the ICC, Lithuania said there are 'reasonable grounds' to believe that Lukashenko’s government, police and armed forces have been involved in 'deportation, persecution and other inhumane acts' against Belarusian civilians for more than four years. Hundreds of thousands of Belarusians, including Tsikhanouskaya, have fled the country during an intense crackdown on opposition after huge protests arose against the 2020 presidential election, whose disputed results gave Lukashenko a sixth term in office. A large share of them went to Lithuania. Tsikhanouskaya was Lukashenko's main opponent in 2020, entering the race after her husband Siarhei Tsikhanouski was arrested after announcing plans to run. Authorities told her the day after the election to leave the country or face imprisonment. More than 65,000 people have been arrested over the last four years in Belarus in connection with the protests and opposition activity, with many of them severely beaten, according to the Belarusian human rights group Viasna. As Lukashenko seeks a seventh term next year to extend his three-decade rule, opposition leaders in exile say he is ramping up the pressure on Belarusians who moved abroad. The aim, they say, is to quash any opposition support from overseas. The Hague-based ICC last year issued an arrest warrant for Lukashenko's long-time ally and supporter Russian President Vladimir Putin alleging his personal involvement in abductions of children from Ukraine. Putin dismissed the warrant and last month visited Mongolia, an ICC member state that refused to arrest him and turn him over to the court. Another Belarusian opposition leader, Pavel Latushka, said last year that he had handed over to the ICC evidence that he said indicates that more than 2,100 Ukrainian children from at least 15 Russia-occupied Ukrainian cities have been forcibly taken to Belarus with Lukashenko’s approval. He expressed hope that the materials would prompt the ICC to issue a warrant for Lukashenko’s arrest.	https://apnews.com/article/belarus-icc-tsikhanouskaya-investigation-president-4a7cc764847a26655b1229513395b4e1	2024-10-01T03:24:37-07:00	
What to know as Israel says it has launched ground incursion into Lebanon	JERUSALEM (AP) — Israel said its ground troops crossed into Lebanon overnight, launching what the military described as 'localized' raids to root out Hezbollah fighters and infrastructure. Hezbollah, meanwhile, said it saw no sign of Israeli forces and its troops were ready to confront them. Israel said the incursion would be focused on the narrow strip of land just across the border. But it also issued evacuation warnings covering a wider swath of Lebanon, raising fears that a large-scale ground invasion was soon to come. In recent days, a wave of Israeli airstrikes has killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and several of his top commanders, while driving hundreds of thousands of Lebanese from their homes. Israel says a ground operation is now necessary to return tens of thousands of displaced Israelis to their homes in the north, pummeled by continuous rocket fire from Hezbollah since Oct. 8. Here's what we know: Did Israeli troops enter Lebanon? The military says that Israeli troops entered Lebanon late Monday. A military official who spoke on the condition of anonymity in line with military regulations declined to say whether troops were rotating in and out of the country or were stationed there for the foreseeable future. The Lebanese army and UNIFIL, a U.N. peacekeeping force stationed in the zone that Israeli forces purportedly entered, have not confirmed that Israeli troops crossed the border, although UNIFIL said it was notified that they were going to. How far into Lebanon are Israeli ground troops? The military official said that at this point Israeli ground troops are 'within walking distance' of the border, targeting the small Lebanese villages hundreds of meters (yards) from Israeli territory. The military says Hezbollah militants remain in the area, despite heavy Israeli bombardment over the past few weeks. It says they are using the areas to launch attacks on Israel and to store weapons. Have there been clashes between Hezbollah and Israeli troops? There were no signs of ground combat late Monday and early Tuesday in southern Lebanon. The military official said there have been no clashes between Hezbollah militants and Israeli troops so far. Meanwhile, cross-border fire continued. Hezbollah announced in statements that it had targeted groups of soldiers in several Israeli border areas with artillery shelling and rockets. Israel said no soldiers were injured and the targeting was unsuccessful. Still, Israeli artillery units pummeled targets in southern Lebanon through the night and the sounds of airstrikes were heard throughout Beirut. Hezbollah fired a rare volley of rockets toward central Israel on Tuesday, injuring one man, Israeli paramedics said. How extensive is the planned operation? Israel has not given a timetable for how long the incursion will last and has declined to specify how far troops will go. The military official said that marching to Beirut, as Israel did in its 1982 invasion of Lebanon, is 'not on the table.' At the time, the Israeli invasion was also pitched as a limited incursion to push the Palestine Liberation Organization back. He added that the operation in its current stages does not mirror Israel’s ground incursions in Gaza, where the military entered cities with heavy manpower, artillery and tanks. That could change, depending on whether Israel’s government decides to launch a more extensive ground operation. Chris Coyle, a resident of Israel’s north, told AP on Monday that Israeli tanks had been positioned along the border. Troops that entered Lebanon are from the 98th division, the military said. The division is responsible for some of the heaviest fighting inside Gaza and includes elite units specializing in attacks behind enemy lines. Meanwhile, Israel is expanding its evacuation warnings in southern Lebanon, sending hundreds of thousands of Lebanese fleeing from the south. On Tuesday, the Israeli military's Arabic-language spokesperson asked residents living in villages north of a U.N.-declared buffer zone to flee. Under a U.N. resolution that ended the 2006 war, the zone was supposed to be controlled by a U.N. peacekeeping force and the Lebanese military.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-lebanon-what-to-know-hezbollah-incursion-c44358cb4c70db69bdab4b254cb2ed76	2024-10-01T03:10:40-07:00	
Hundreds of firefighters battle a deadly forest fire raging in southern Greece for the third day	ATHENS, Greece (AP) — Hundreds of firefighters and volunteers in southern Greece battled a wildfire for a third day that has killed two people and devastated a large forested area, prompting pledges of assistance from other European Union countries. Three waterbombing aircraft from Italy and Croatia were due to arrive later Tuesday after Greece requested help through the 27-country bloc's emergency civil protection mechanism. The Greek fire service said more than 400 firefighters, assisted by 20 aircraft, were engaged against the blaze in the mountains of Corinthia in the Peloponnese region. The authorities were optimistic that progress had been made as the main front of the blaze was out, leaving a large number of scattered fires. However, it remained unclear whether that success could be expanded on before winds whipped up and spread the blaze again. Government spokesman Pavlos Marinakis said firefighters had been hampered in their initial response by the difficult terrain and poor road network. 'During the first, crucial stage of the fire, firetrucks had great difficulty approaching (the blaze) because of the narrow roads,' he said. 'The many ravines and the gale-force winds blowing that day greatly impeded' the firefighting effort, Marinakis added. Officials ordered that another village be evacuated as a precaution Tuesday, a day after half a dozen similar orders were issued. A major highway that was closed overnight as flames swept close by was reopened on Tuesday. The blaze destroyed a historic church in the mountains and reportedly damaged buildings outside the threatened villages, but the fire service was not immediately able to provide further details. The two victims were identified as local residents who got trapped late Sunday by the fast-advancing blaze. Greece, like other southern European countries, is plagued every summer by destructive wildfires that have been exacerbated by global warming. Over the past few months, the fire service has had to cope with more than 4,500 wildfires. This year's had been flagged as the most dangerous fire season in two decades after the countryside was left parched by a protracted drought and early summer heatwaves. Still, Greece's big investments in extra water-bombing aircraft, warning drones and other equipment have led to most blazes being extinguished shortly after they broke out.	https://apnews.com/article/greece-wildfire-peloponnese-forest-cfeb415e491edbdce660490bae5aeb3f	2024-10-01T01:49:32-07:00	
Myanmar's military government launches a census seen as a way to gather information about opponents	BANGKOK (AP) — A nationwide census was launched Tuesday by Myanmar’s military government, which says it will be used to compile voter lists for a general election promised for next year, even though much of the country is engulfed in civil war. Census takers, most of them schoolteachers and local administrative workers, began going door-to-door in the capital, Naypyitaw, accompanied by soldiers and police. A group that leads the struggle against military rule, the shadow National Unity Government, has advised people to use 'caution' in complying with the survey, and pro-democracy guerrillas have warned that those who help collect information will face reprisals. Several were attacked and killed during a similar smaller-scale survey last year. The military government is widely seen as hoping the polls will legitimize its rule, which began after it seized power from the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi in February 2021. In a televised speech in early September, Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, the head of the military government, said the census information being gathered from Oct. 1 to Oct. 15 is crucial for compiling voter lists for a general election, but did not specify a date for the polls. He previously pledged to hold an election in 2025. He also said that people must answer all the questions without anxiety or doubt. The census is widely seen as an effort to gather information to more closely monitor opponents of military rule. The Ministry of Immigration and Population says more than 42,000 census workers will gather information from more than 13 million households across the country. The survey contains 68 questions on matters such as the number of people living in each home, their education, disabilities, types of houses and access to water, electricity and toilets. It also includes questions about the occupants' backgrounds, family members who have been away from home and the cause of death of family members, all highly sensitive matters for those who joined the armed resistance or the civil disobedience movement. A 33-year-old nurse from Yangon, the country’s biggest city, who joined the civil disobedience movement in 2021 said she was worried about her safety because the census contains detailed questions about her job history and the military might use it to punish her. Like others who agreed to be interviewed, she spoke on condition of anonymity because she feared arrest. A 29-year-old man who took up arms to fight against the army in the southeastern state of Kayin said he had suggested to his family back in his hometown in Mon state that they visit relatives in other townships to avoid the survey. A 26-year-old gym trainer from Yangon told the AP that he believed the authorities are gathering information not only for the census but also to obtain details of men who are eligible for military service. The military activated conscription in February after it was forced into the defensive against pro-democracy militants as well as ethnic militias seeking autonomy. Independent analysts believe the military government controls much less than half of Myanmar's territory. It would be difficult to organize an election while the country is at war, and critics see no way for the polls to be free and fair. At a meeting at the end of July, Min Aung Hlaing said the census would be prioritized in areas under the military’s control. 'Whether they are doing it for the fake elections or census, they are doing it to terrorize the people, so don’t collaborate with them in these matters,' said Kyaw Zaw, a spokesperson for the National Unity Government. 'I would like to say that all those who cooperate with the military council will be punished according to the law because their action is similar to encouraging and cooperating with the military’s terrorist activities.' The Chin Brotherhood Alliance, which comprises five ethnic Chin militias from the northwestern Chin state, and the Dawei Defense Team, a group from the southern Tanintharyi region, warned in statements last month that they will take strong action against military government personnel who participate in the survey. Such guerrilla groups, which often target people associated with the military, carried out attacks during a three-week survey to compile voter lists in January 2023, when elections were still expected later that year. About a dozen people including two police officers and local officials were killed and four military personnel were captured during the attacks. The U.N. Population Fund, the major collaborator in the previous census in 2014, announced in late 2023 that it was unable to support the 2024 census due to Myanmar's political strife and conflict. The military government said in August this year that China, a close ally, had pledged to give technical support for the census.

Australia's online dating industry adopts code of conduct to keep users safer	MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — A code of conduct will be enforced on the online dating industry to better protect Australian users after research found that three-in-four people suffer some form of sexual violence through the platforms, Australia’s government said on Tuesday. Bumble, Grindr and Match Group Inc., a Texas-based company that owns platforms including Tinder, Hinge, OKCupid and Plenty of Fish, have agreed to the code that took effect on Tuesday, Communications Minister Michelle Rowland said. The platforms, which account for 75% of the industry in Australia, have until April 1 to implement the changes before they are strictly enforced, Rowland said. The code requires the platforms’ systems to detect potential incidents of online-enabled harm and demands that the accounts of some offenders are terminated. Complaint and reporting mechanisms are to be made prominent and transparent. A new rating system will show users how well platforms are meeting their obligations under the code. The government called for a code of conduct last year after the Australian Institute of Criminology research found that three-in-four users of dating apps or websites had experienced some form of sexual violence through these platforms in the five years through 2021. 'There needs to be a complaint-handling process. This is a pretty basic feature that Australians would have expected in the first place,' Rowland told Australian Broadcasting Corp. on Tuesday. 'If there are grounds to ban a particular individual from utilizing one of those platforms, if they’re banned on one platform, they’re blocked on all platforms,' she added. Bumble said it shared the government’s hope of eliminating gender-based violence and was grateful for the opportunity to work with the government and industry on what the platform described as a 'world-first dating code of practice.' 'We know that domestic and sexual violence is an enormous problem in Australia, and that women, members of LGBTQ+ communities, and First Nations are the most at risk,' a Bumble statement said. 'Bumble puts women’s experiences at the center of our mission to create a world where all relationships are healthy and equitable, and safety has been central to our mission from day one,' Bumble added. The other platforms that signed up to the code did not immediately respond to request for comment on Tuesday. All helped design the code. Platforms that have not signed up include Happn, Coffee Meets Bagel and Feeld. The government expects the code will enable Australians to make better informed choices about which dating apps are best equipped to provide a safe dating experience. The government has also warned the online dating industry that it will legislate if the operators fail to keep Australians safe on their platforms.	https://apnews.com/article/australia-online-dating-sexual-violence-apps-safety-a6cba10c81e60f1cb8866a2a1201c163	2024-10-01T01:06:55-07:00	
Israel calls for evacuations in Lebanon as Hezbollah denies ground incursion began	JERUSALEM (AP) — The Israeli military on Tuesday warned people to evacuate nearly two dozen Lebanese border communities hours after announcing what it said were limited ground operations against Hezbollah. The militant group denied Israeli troops had entered Lebanon, but hours later the Israeli army announced it had also carried out dozens of ground raids into southern Lebanon going back nearly a year. Israel released video footage purporting to show its soldiers operating in homes and tunnels where Hezbollah kept weapons. There was no immediate confirmation, but if true it would be another humiliating blow for Iran-backed Hezbollah, the most powerful armed group in the Middle East. Hezbollah has been reeling from weeks of targeted strikes that killed its leader, Hassan Nasrallah, and several of his top commanders. Israel advised people to evacuate to the north of the Awali River, some 60 kilometers (36 miles) from the border and much farther than the Litani River, which marks the northern edge of a U.N.-declared zone that was intended to serve as a buffer between Israel and Hezbollah after their 2006 war. 'You must immediately head north of the Awali River to save yourselves, and leave your houses immediately,' said the statement posted by the Israeli military on the platform X. The warning applied to communities south of the Litani. The border region has largely emptied out over the past year as the two sides have traded fire. But the scope of the evacuation warning raised questions as to how deep Israel plans to send its forces into Lebanon as it presses ahead with a rapidly escalating campaign against Hezbollah. Anticipating more rocket attacks from Hezbollah, the Israeli army announced new restrictions on public gatherings and closed beaches in northern and central Israel. Questions raised over whether Israeli forces entered An Associated Press reporter saw Israeli troops operating near the border in armored trucks, with helicopters circling overhead, but could not confirm ground forces had crossed into Lebanon. Ahead of the Israeli announcement of an incursion, U.S. officials on Monday said Israel had described launching small ground raids inside Lebanon as it prepared for a wider operation. Neither the Lebanese army nor a U.N. peacekeeping force known as UNIFIL, which patrol southern Lebanon, have confirmed that Israeli forces entered. UNIFIL said any such cross-border operation would be a 'dangerous development' and a violation of Lebanese sovereignty. In its first statement since Israel announced the start of ground operations, Hezbollah spokesman Mohammed Afif dismissed what he said were 'false claims' of an Israeli incursion. He said Hezbollah is ready for 'direct confrontation with enemy forces that dare to or try to enter Lebanon.' Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, the Israeli military’s top spokesperson, claimed troops were conducting 'localized ground raids' on Hezbollah positions in southern Lebanon to ensure that Israeli citizens could return to their homes in the north. 'We’re not going to Beirut,' he said. 'We’re only going to areas next to our border and will do what is necessary to dismantle and demolish Hezbollah infrastructure.' He said Israel had carried out dozens of small raids inside Lebanon going all the way back to Oct. 8, when Hezbollah began firing rockets into Israel after the outbreak of the war in Gaza. He said Israeli forces had crossed the border to collect information and destroy Hezbollah infrastructure, including tunnels and weapons. Israel has said Hezbollah was preparing its own Oct. 7-style attack into Israel. It was not immediately possible to confirm those claims. An Israeli military official said troops taking part in the latest incursion were within walking distance of the border, focused on villages hundreds of meters (yards) from Israel. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity in line with military regulations, said there had been no clashes yet with Hezbollah fighters. The Israeli military was accused of lying to media in 2021 when it released a statement implying that ground troops had entered Gaza. The military played down the incident as a misunderstanding, but well-sourced military commentators in Israel said it was part of a ruse to lure Hamas into battle. Israel strikes more targets and Hezbollah fires rockets Israeli artillery units pounded targets in southern Lebanon through the night and the sounds of airstrikes were heard throughout Beirut. The Israeli military official said Hezbollah had launched rockets at central Israel, setting off air raid sirens and wounding a man in his 50s. Hezbollah said it fired salvos of a new kind of medium-range missile, called the Fadi 4, at the headquarters of two Israeli intelligence agencies near Tel Aviv. Afif, the Hezbollah spokesman, said the missile attack 'is only the beginning.' The Israeli military official said Hezbollah had also launched projectiles at Israeli communities near the border, targeting soldiers without wounding anyone. Hezbollah began firing rockets into northern Israel shortly after Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack into Israel ignited the war in Gaza. Israel has launched retaliatory airstrikes and the conflict has steadily escalated. In recent weeks Israel has unleashed a punishing wave of airstrikes across large parts of Lebanon. Hagari said the U.N. Security Council resolution that ended the last Israel-Hezbollah war in 2006 had not been enforced and that southern Lebanon was 'swarming with Hezbollah terrorists and weapons.' That resolution had called for Hezbollah to withdraw from the area between the border and the Litani River and for the Lebanese army and U.N. peacekeepers to patrol the region. Israel says those and other provisions were never enforced. Lebanon has long accused Israel of violating other terms of the resolution. Israeli official says no plans to march on Beirut Lebanon’s Prime Minister Najib Mikati said Monday that his country is willing to deploy the army in support of the resolution if there is a cease-fire. Lebanon’s armed forces would not be able to impose an agreement on the far more powerful Hezbollah. The military statements indicated that Israel might focus its ground operation on the narrow strip along the border, rather than launching a larger invasion aimed at destroying Hezbollah, as it has done in Gaza against the Palestinian Hamas. Hezbollah and Hamas are close allies backed by Iran, and each escalation over the past year has raised fears of a wider war in the Middle East that could draw in Iran and the United States, which has rushed military assets to the region in support of Israel. The incursion follows weeks of heavy blows by Israel against Hezbollah — including an airstrike that killed its longtime leader Nasrallah — and seeks to step up the pressure on the group. There was no word on how long the operation would last. Over 1,000 people have been killed in Lebanon in Israeli strikes over the past two weeks, nearly a quarter of them women and children, according to the Health Ministry. Hundreds of thousands of people have fled their homes. Hezbollah is a well-trained militia, believed to have tens of thousands of fighters and an arsenal of 150,000 rockets and missiles. The last round of fighting in 2006 ended in a stalemate, and both sides have spent the past two decades preparing for their next showdown. Recent airstrikes wiping out most of Hezbollah’s top leadership and the explosions of hundreds of pagers and walkie-talkies belonging to Hezbollah indicate that Israel has infiltrated deep inside the group’s upper echelons. Hezbollah vowed Monday to keep fighting even after its recent losses. The group’s acting leader, Naim Kassem, said in a televised statement Monday that Hezbollah commanders killed in recent weeks have already been replaced. European countries have begun pulling their diplomats and citizens out of Lebanon. A British government-chartered flight is due to leave Beirut on Wednesday to evacuate U.K. nationals. The U.K. has also sent 700 troops to a base in the nearby island nation of Cyprus to prepare for a potential evacuation of the estimated 5,000 British citizens in Lebanon. ___ Mroue reported from Beirut.

A likely Russian artillery strike kills at least 6 at a Ukrainian market	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — An apparent Russian artillery strike hit a market in the southern Ukraine city of Kherson on Tuesday, killing at least six people and wounding three others, authorities said, on a morning when Ukrainians across the country were observing a minute’s silence for their military and war dead. The strike happened as shoppers made their way between stalls at the city center market, regional Gov. Oleksandr Prokudin said. He published a video showing the blurred corpses of people in civilian clothes lying near a stall with tomatoes and other vegetables. Ukraine’s General Prosecutor’s Office said the strike was 'most likely' carried out by Russian artillery and hit close to a public transport stop. It initially reported that seven people were killed but later corrected that toll to six, saying a severely wounded person thought to be dead was in intensive care at a local hospital. The city has not recently been a hotspot in the war, now deep into its third year, as the fiercest battles have been taking place in Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region where Russia’s army is pushing hard to take ground ahead of the winter. The hilltop Donetsk town of Vuhledar, an important Ukrainian stronghold for the past two years and part of a belt of strategic garrisons, appears to be on the brink of falling into Russian hands. Fighting for control of Vuhledar has advanced nearly into the town center, making it almost impossible to deliver humanitarian aid, Donetsk regional Gov. Vadym Filashkin said on national television Tuesday. There are still 107 people left in the town, although all children have been evacuated, he said. Ukrainian forces have struck back with an incursion into Russia’s Kursk border region, but the government is waiting to hear what further Western military and financial support it can count on. The Kherson region was one of four, also including Donetsk, Luhansk, and Zaporizhzhia, that Moscow illegally annexed in September 2022 and is partly occupying. Russian President Vladimir Putin wants Ukraine to withdraw completely from those regions. Ukraine refuses. Kherson fell into Russian hands after Moscow’s full-scale invasion in February 2022. A Ukrainian counteroffensive recaptured western areas of the Kherson region, including the regional capital of the same name, nine months later. The market attack came on the same morning as Ukraine celebrated Defenders Day, an annual public holiday that honors the country’s armed forces, veterans and war dead. Across Ukraine, traffic stopped and people on sidewalks came to a halt at 9 a.m. to commemorate those defending Ukraine and those who have sacrificed their lives for the country. People gathered at Independence Square in Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv, carrying pictures of fallen Ukrainian soldiers. 'For others, life goes on, but unfortunately for us it stopped when my brother’s heart stopped,' said Angelina Stashenko, holding a portrait of her 30-year-old brother, Denys Stashenko, who was killed in action in May in the Donetsk region. 'I hope future generations will never forget the price our loved ones paid for their freedom. … I hope Ukraine’s future will be bright,' his mother, Halyna Stashenko, said. The national holiday was established in 2014 and first celebrated in 2015, following Russia’s annexation of Crimea and occupation of parts of the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions of Ukraine. Though no official or reliable statistics are available, tens of thousands of Ukrainian soldiers and civilians are believed to have died fighting Russia over the past 10 years. Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy used the occasion to appeal for further support from his country’s Western partners, following his visit last week to the United States. 'The daily Russian terror, the daily attempts to destroy life — all this can be stopped,' Zelenskyy wrote on Telegram following the strike on Kherson, adding that 'Ukrainian strength and the determination of our partners must be greater than Putin’s desire to spread terror.' In an address to the military, Zelenskyy thanked troops for their sacrifices. 'You dedicate yourselves so that Ukraine is not surrendered. Both those who were born warriors and those who became warriors. You changed your own lives so that our freedom remains unchanged,' Zelenskyy said. 'We see your courage. We see it every day and every night. On weekdays and weekends. In heat and frost. Always. Every minute. A minute whose value you know better than anyone else.

More than 20 are feared dead after a school bus catches fire in suburban Bangkok	BANGKOK (AP) — A bus carrying young students and their teachers on a school trip caught fire in suburban Bangkok on Tuesday, leaving more than 20 feared dead, officials and rescuers said. The bus with 45 passengers — six teachers and 39 elementary and junior high school students — was traveling from the central Uthai Thani province when it caught fire in Pathum Thani province, a northern suburb of Thailand's capital, acting police commissioner Kitrat Phanphet said. The fire was first reported around noon and was put out less than an hour later, but rescuers said they could not get on board for hours as the heat inside the natural gas-fueled vehicle could have caused more explosions. Police were still working to identify the dead but three teachers and 20 students remain unaccounted for, Kitrat said. The cause of the blaze was not immediately known. Kitrat said the initial investigation indicates a tire had exploded and caused sparks, which ignited a blaze that spread through the bus. He did not elaborate. No other vehicles were involved, he said. There were discrepancies in reports on the number of the people aboard the bus. Rescuers cited teachers who survived as saying there were three buses from the school for this trip and that along the way, some students had moved to different buses than the ones they were initially on. Videos posted on social media showed the entire bus engulfed in a fire with black smoke pouring out of the bus on the side of a road. Piyalak Thinkaew, a rescuer from the Ruam Katanyu Foundation, told reporters that most of the bodies were found in the middle and back seats, leading them to assume the victims had moved back and that the fire had started at the front of the bus. The police were looking for the driver who appeared to have fled the scene, Kitrat said, adding that the bus company and individuals involved may be charged if they are found responsible. 'Such an incident causes a great sorrow and grief,' he told reporters at a news conference. 'There is no way we will distort the fact or help anyone' escape justice, Kitrat said and added that 16 students were treated for minor injuries and been sent home while three others were hospitalized. The nearby patRangsit Hospital said three girls were initially treated there, one with burns to the face, mouth and eyes. Surgeon Anocha Takham said the doctors would do their best to save the girl, who is around 7, from losing her sight. The girls were later moved to other hospitals for further treatment. Kitrat said a teacher who survived told police the fire had spread so quickly she didn't even have the time to grab her mobile phone. Some on board managed to escape through the door while others jumped out through the windows. Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra offered her condolences in a post on the social media platform X, promising the government would cover the medical expenses and help the victims’ families. She later visited the injured in hospital. When reporters asked her about the fire at the Government House, Paetongtarn was overcome by emotion and burst into tears. She became prime minister in August and is the mother of two children. The accident prompted criticisms over the safety of children traveling long hours across provinces on roads notorious for high rate of traffic accidents and deaths. The World Health Organization estimates that every year, 20,000 people are killed and a million are injured in road accidents in Thailand.	https://apnews.com/article/thailand-bus-fire-students-dead-658c09c22d5b24963d2a5cec3f3d5694	2024-09-30T22:24:30-07:00	
Asian markets mixed, Japanese stocks rally from Monday's slump	HONG KONG (AP) — Asian shares were mixed on Tuesday, with Japan’s Nikkei 225 index regaining some of its sharp losses from a day earlier. A quarterly 'tankan' survey by the Bank of Japan showed business confidence among large manufacturers remained steady at 13, indicating an improved outlook for business conditions. A positive number indicates that more companies maintain an optimistic outlook on business conditions than those who feel pessimistic. The survey is closely monitored for clues about the impact of the Bank of Japan’s interest rate decisions, especially after the central bank ended negative rates in March and raised its short-term rate to 0.25% in July. Japan also reported that its unemployment rate for August fell to 2.5% from 2.7% in July, in line with market expectations. Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 rallied 1.5% in early Tuesday to 38,476.33, as the yen weakened. The dollar is trading at 144.00 yen, up from 143.62 yen. On Monday, the Nikkei tumbled nearly 5% as markets reacted to the selection of Shigeru Ishiba to be Japan's next prime minister. Ishiba was due to take office Tuesday following the resignation of Prime Minister Fumio Kishida. Ishiba, an expert on defense and on domestic economic issues, was seen as a less favorable choice than some of his rivals in the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, partly because he has voiced support for raising interest rates. That caused the Japanese yen to briefly jump in value against the dollar, which would hurt profits of large export manufacturers. Australia’s S&amp;P/ASX 200 dipped nearly 0.7% to 8,214.80 after the data showed that retail sales in August rose 3.1% from the same period last year, which is above expectation. Markets in China and South Korea were shut for holidays. Mainland Chinese markets, which had their best day since 2008 on Monday, will remain closed until Oct. 7 for the National Day break. On Monday, the S&amp;P 500 climbed 0.4% to reached an all-time high at 5,762.48 and clinched its fifth straight winning month and fourth straight winning quarter. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added less than 0.1% to 42,330.15. The Nasdaq composite rose 0.4% to 18,189.17. Wall Street has catapulted to records on hopes the slowing U.S. economy can keep growing while the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates to offer it more juice. A big test will arrive Friday, when the U.S. government offers its latest monthly update on the job market. An overriding worry on Wall Street is whether the economy may already be heading for a recession. Even though the Fed cut rates earlier this month and has indicated more relief is on the way, U.S. employers have already begun paring back on their hiring. Before this month, the Fed had kept interest rates at a two-decade high in hopes of slowing the economy enough to stamp out high inflation. In the bond market, U.S. Treasury yields rose after investors took comments from Fed Chair Jerome Powell as a hint that coming cuts to interest rates may be more traditional sized. The Fed began its rate cuts with a larger-than-usual reduction of half a percentage point, and many traders expect the next meeting in November could yield a similar sized reduction. Fed policy makers already had indicated they were planning two more cuts this year of the traditional size of a quarter of a percentage point. But Powell said again on Monday that rate cuts are not something the Fed needs to work quickly on. After his comments, traders were betting on just a 35% probability the Fed will cut rates by another half a percentage point in November. That’s down from a 53% chance seen the day before, according to data from CME Group. The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 3.78% from 3.75% late Friday. In other dealings Tuesday, benchmark U.S. crude oil added 10 cents to $68.27 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, rose 15 cents at $71.85 per barrel. The euro was trading at $1.1137, up from $1.1134. ___ AP Business Writer Stan Choe contributed.	https://apnews.com/article/stock-markets-rates-japan-fed-6b846be540b1ede94c2a2cb8410e6f15	2024-09-30T20:58:17-07:00	
NATO's long-time chief hands over to a former Dutch premier	BRUSSELS (AP) — One of NATO’s longest serving top officials, Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, steps down on Tuesday and will hand over the reins to former Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, as the military alliance confronts some of the biggest challenges in its history. Stoltenberg, NATO’s 13th secretary-general, took over in 2014, the year that 'little green men' from Russia infiltrated Ukraine. Moscow annexed the Crimean Peninsula, sparking a defense spending buildup at the world’s biggest security alliance that gathered pace over his term. His tenure was surpassed only by Dutch diplomat Joseph Luns, who spent 12 years in charge of NATO. A series of events to mark the handover will be held at NATO headquarters in Brussels, Belgium. NATO secretaries-general run the HQ, drive the alliance's working agenda, and speak on behalf of the 32-nation organization with one unifying voice. Continuity is usually the key word when they take up office. Rutte becomes NATO’s top civilian official as Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine approaches the 1,000-day mark. Political uncertainty within the organization is also high, as election fever roils the United States, its unofficial 'chairman of the board' and most powerful member. Russian forces are making advances in eastern Ukraine. Ukraine’s army has a shaky hold on part of the Kursk region in Russia, which has provided a temporary morale boost, but as casualties mount it remains outmanned and outgunned. Rutte will have to find new ways to encourage support for Ukraine among the allies, whose ranks have swelled to 32 countries since the invasion as Finland and Sweden joined to seek protection from Russia under NATO's security umbrella. Across the Atlantic, surveys suggest the U.S. election in November will be a close race. It could see a return to the White House of Donald Trump, whose bluster during his last term of office about low defense spending among European allies and Canada undermined trust of NATO member countries. It became an existential challenge, as smaller members feared that the U.S. under Trump would renege on NATO’s security pledge that all countries must to come to the rescue of any ally in trouble, the foundation stone the alliance is built on. Trump has been critical of U.S. aid to Ukraine, and he suggested last week that President Volodymyr Zelenskyy should have made concessions to Russian leader Vladimir Putin before he launched his invasion in 2022.	https://apnews.com/article/nato-stoltenberg-rutte-ukraine-3cdef166024f303e1ccb964d31c294a7	2024-09-30T20:26:32-07:00	
Rescuers search for people still missing in Nepal after flooding and landslides that killed 217	KATHMANDU, Nepal (AP) — Rescuers on Tuesday searched for people still missing and tried to recover bodies of those killed in weekend flooding and landslides in Nepal that killed more than 200 people. Weather continued to improve, and workers were clearing the highways that were blocked by landslides. Sections of several highways next to raging rivers were washed away, however, and those repairs will likely take longer. The disaster came just ahead of the country’s biggest festival Dasain, which begins on Thursday when people return home to celebrate with their families. The damage to roads is likely to hamper festival travel plans for many. The government has said it was focusing on helping people who were stranded and who have lost their homes in the flooding and landslides. Nepal police said the death toll by Tuesday had reached 217 while 143 people had been injured. There were still 28 people who were reported missing and searches were continuing for them. Prime Minister Khadga Prasad Oli returned home Monday afternoon from attending the U.N. General Assembly meeting and immediately called an emergency meeting of his Cabinet. Police and soldiers were assisting with rescue efforts, while heavy equipment was used to clear the landslides from the roads. Schools and colleges were closed until Tuesday to help clean up the premises and students to be able to recover. The days of heavy rain came toward the end of Nepal's monsoon season, which began in June and usually ends by mid-September.	https://apnews.com/article/nepal-flood-landslide-deaths-3d8622e5e258920b013976ce37e155e1	2024-09-30T20:22:53-07:00	
Drone boat hits ship in Red Sea as missile strikes another in likely assaults by Yemen Houthi rebels	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — An explosive-loaded drone crashed into one ship Tuesday in the Red Sea as a missile exploded against another, the British military and private security officials said, marking the latest suspected attacks by Yemen’s Houthi rebels. The attacks likely are the rebels’ first assaults on commercial shipping in weeks as the Israel-Hamas war threatens to become a regional conflict. They come as Israeli ground forces entered Lebanon after days of Israeli airstrikes that killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and other top officials, and earlier explosions of sabotaged electronic devices used by the Shiite militia. The Houthis threatened 'escalating military operations' targeting Israel on Monday after they apparently shot down a U.S. military drone flying over Yemen. The first attack took place some 110 kilometers (70 miles) off the port city of Hodeida. A captain on a ship saw four 'splashes' near his vessel, the British military’s United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations center said in a warning. That likely would have been missiles or drones launched at the vessel that missed. The UKMTO later said the first ship it reported on was later damaged by a drone boat that punctured one of its ballast tanks in another attack. Those tanks control a ship’s buoyancy. Houthi strikes in the past have targeted ships at their waterline to disable the vessels. The private security firm Ambrey also identified the drone as a drone boat, which have been increasingly used by the Houthis. The ship had been heading north to the Suez Canal with armed private security guards aboard, the firm said. Another attack with a missile targeted a separate ship also heading north to the Suez Canal with armed security on board, Ambrey said. The Houthis did not immediately claim responsibility for the attacks. However, they sometimes take hours or days to acknowledge their assaults. Instead, Houthi military spokesperson Brig. Gen. Yahya Saree said in a prerecorded video Tuesday that the rebels had launched drones targeting Israel — attacks unreported by Israel as it faces incoming fire from Hezbollah. The Houthis have exaggerated claims in the past. The Red Sea has become a battlefield for shippers since the Houthis began their campaign targeting ships traveling through the waterway, which once saw $1 trillion a year of cargo pass through it. Houthis have targeted more than 80 merchant vessels with missiles and drones since the war in Gaza started last October. They have seized one vessel and sunk two in the campaign that has also killed four sailors. Other missiles and drones have either been intercepted by a U.S.-led coalition in the Red Sea or failed to reach their targets, which have included Western military vessels. The rebels maintain that they target ships linked to Israel, the U.S. or the United Kingdom to force an end to Israel’s campaign against Hamas in Gaza. However, many of the ships attacked have little or no connection to the conflict, including some bound for Iran. The last attack on a merchant ship by the Houthis was on Sept. 2. The Houthis claimed responsibility for an attack targeting American warships last week. The rebels fired more than a half dozen ballistic missiles and anti-ship cruise missiles and two drones at three U.S. ships that were traveling through the Bab el-Mandeb Strait, but all were intercepted by the Navy destroyers, a U.S. official said Friday. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss details not yet publicly released. The Houthis also continue to launch missiles targeting Israel, drawing retaliatory airstrikes from the Israelis this weekend on Hodeida.	https://apnews.com/article/yemen-houthi-rebels-red-sea-attacks-israel-hamas-war-2faa48176d4f773003b6a4a3ad5ca73d	2024-09-30T20:03:34-07:00	
A former hostage fought for her own life in Gaza. A year on, she fights for her husband's freedom	TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — As a hostage in Gaza, Aviva Siegel found herself begging for food and water. Since her release, she has found herself begging for her husband to be set free from his own ongoing captivity. Siegel has come to embody the disaster that befell Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. Armed Hamas militants snatched her from her home and thrust her into Gaza’s web of tunnels. Released during a brief cease-fire in November, she returned to find her community destroyed and became one of tens of thousands of Israelis displaced by conflict. She has emerged as a prominent voice in the struggle to free the remaining hostages, fighting tirelessly for her husband’s release. But as her ordeal reaches the one-year mark, Israel’s attention is focused not on the plight of the hostages and their families, but on fighting Hezbollah in Lebanon. It's the latest diversion to chip away at Siegel's hope that she may reunite with her husband of 43 years anytime soon. 'The hostages, they are being left to die. To die slowly. How can I handle that? I just don’t know how to handle it anymore,' she said, sitting beside a poster of her husband, Keith, a 65-year-old American Israeli originally from Chapel Hill, North Carolina. Her torment is all the more acute because she knows firsthand what her husband is enduring. 'Hostages were chained, tortured, starved, beaten up into pieces. I saw that in front of my eyes. That’s what they did to us,' she said from a short-term rental apartment in Tel Aviv, one of the many places she has lived since her return during the November cease-fire, the first and only deal reached between Israel and Hamas during the war. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to continue the war until 'total victory' over Hamas and pledged to bring home the hostages, but has faced widespread criticism that dozens remain captive a year after the attack. Netanyahu has also argued that the pressure on Hezbollah will, in turn, lead to pressure on its ally Hamas and help speed up the release of the hostages. The Siegels were jolted awake on Oct. 7 at their home in Kibbutz Kfar Aza, one of the hardest-hit communities that day, by a burst of air raid sirens. Like so many others, they took cover in their safe room, built to protect against rocket attacks, that turned out to be no match for the rifle- and grenade-toting Hamas militants who stormed their home. In its attack, Hamas kidnapped roughly 250 people, including women, children and older people. It killed some 1,200 people — most of them civilians — according to Israeli authorities. The war the attack sparked has killed more than 41,000 Palestinians, over half of them women and children, according to health officials in Gaza. Hamas has said the hostages are treated humanely, but multiple accounts from freed hostages contradict that. The militants led the Siegels out of their house, shoved her husband, breaking his ribs, and shot him in the hand, Siegel said. They were forced into their own car and driven into Gaza, where crowds of onlookers cheered at their capture. Their first stop was a home with a living room that opened up into an underground tunnel. 'And there’s somebody underneath the hole, in the hole underneath the ground, that’s waiting with a smile, happy as can be. I’ll never forget his face,' she said. They climbed down a steep ladder into the tunnel, one of several they were held in throughout Siegel’s 51 days in captivity. All told, Siegel was moved around 13 times, held in both tunnels and militants’ homes, she said. On the first day, they were joined by other hostages and they were brought pita and cheese, which hardly anyone ate because they were all in shock. But throughout her captivity, food was scarce and Siegel said there were entire days when she wasn’t brought anything to eat. 'They used to starve us while they ate in front of us and not bring us water for hours and days. I had an infection in my stomach, I was dehydrated. We had to beg — beg — for water. Beg and beg for food.' The first tunnel had light — others did not — as well as a fan that labored to circulate the scant air. Seven hostages were held in a room Siegel described as being about the size of three yoga mats. She found comfort in having her husband by her side throughout. She brushed her teeth four times over those weeks and washed herself the same amount, in salt water. 'It’s disgusting. We were filthy. Dirty. The smell that came out of us is the worst that you can imagine,' she said. But worse was the treatment from the guards. Siegel, a 63-year-old grandmother of five, said she was pushed and yanked by the hair and shoved into cars. Her captors told her that Hamas had taken over her kibbutz and that Israel didn’t care about freeing her. So she was in disbelief when freedom came on Nov. 26. But it came at a price: Her husband was to remain behind. Her parting words to him were, 'Be strong for me,' and she promised to be strong for him. Since their painful goodbye, she has crisscrossed Israel and the world, sharing her story and pleading for her husband's release. She has met Netanyahu, United States President Joe Biden and United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, among others. She has spoken repeatedly to Israeli lawmakers and become a fixture at weekly protests in support of the hostages. But her energetic advocacy has been beaten down by the horrific twists and turns of the war. Since her release, she has watched multiple rounds of hostage negotiations collapse. Hostages have been killed by Hamas but also mistakenly by Israeli forces, and some have been rescued. The fighting in Israel’s north, and the stunning assassination of Hezbollah’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah, feels like another blow to her struggle, which has faded from the public consciousness. Siegel said she can’t bring herself to watch a video of her husband that Hamas released in April. Clearly filmed under duress, he says he is OK, but breaks down in tears and lays his head on his knees, sobbing. She finds the strength to soldier on by thinking about him, a vegetarian who loves reading books to his grandchildren and studied Arabic so he could converse with workers from Gaza who were employed in the kibbutz. But a year on, her hope is wearing thin. 'I don’t know why I get up,' she said. 'But I do know that I have to get up for Keith.' ___ Follow AP’s war coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war	https://apnews.com/article/hostages-gaza-tunnels-hamas-israel-war-d8ecb415268e911cea09518acdaf7ba2	2024-09-30T19:36:39-07:00	
WikiLeaks' Julian Assange to make first public statement since his release from prison	LONDON (AP) — Wikileaks founder Julian Assange will make his first public statements since he was released from prison when he addresses the Council of Europe on Tuesday. Assange, 53, is expected to give evidence to the legal affairs and human rights committee of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe in Strasbourg, France. The Parliamentary Assembly, which includes parliamentarians from 46 European countries, said the hearing will discuss Assange's detention and conviction 'and their chilling effect on human rights' ahead of a debate on the topic on Wednesday. WikiLeaks said in a statement that Assange will attend the hearing in person 'due to the exceptional nature of the invitation.' Assange was released in June after five years in a British prison after he pleaded guilty to obtaining and publishing U.S. military secrets in a deal with Justice Department prosecutors that concluded a drawn-out legal saga. Prior to his time in prison, he had spent seven years in self-imposed exile in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, where he claimed asylum on the grounds of political persecution. The Australian internet publisher was accused of receiving and publishing hundreds of thousands of war logs and diplomatic cables that included details of U.S. military wrongdoing in Iraq and Afghanistan. His activities were celebrated by press freedom advocates, who heralded his role in bringing to light military conduct that might otherwise have been concealed. Among the files published by WikiLeaks was a video of a 2007 Apache helicopter attack by American forces in Baghdad that killed 11 people, including two Reuters journalists. But critics say his conduct put American national security and innocent lives — such as people who provided information to U.S. forces in Iraq and Afghanistan — at risk, and strayed far beyond the bounds of traditional journalism duties. The years-long case ended with Assange entering his plea in a U.S. district court on the Northern Mariana Islands, an American commonwealth in the Pacific. Assange pleaded guilty to an Espionage Act charge of conspiring to unlawfully obtain and disseminate classified national defense information. A judge sentenced him to the five years he had already spent behind bars in the U.K. fighting extradition to the United States. Assange returned to Australia a free man in late June. At the time his wife, Stella, said he needed time to recuperate before speaking publicly. His appearance on Tuesday comes after the Council of Europe's Parliamentary Assembly published a report on Assange's detention in a high-security U.K. prison for five years. The assembly's human rights committee said Assange qualified as a political prisoner and issued a draft resolution expressing deep concern at his harsh treatment.	https://apnews.com/article/julian-assange-statement-council-europe-5373cfb854474deba0e5799b23cb8d2e	2024-09-30T19:23:26-07:00	
Claudia Sheinbaum to be sworn in as 1st female president of Mexico, a country with pressing problems	MEXICO CITY (AP) — Claudia Sheinbaum will take the oath of office Tuesday as Mexico’s first female president in more than 200 years of independence, promising to protect an expanded social safety net and fight for the poor like her predecessor, but facing pressing problems. The 62-year-old scientist-turned-politician will receive a country with a number of immediate challenges, foremost among them stubbornly high levels of violence, a sluggish economy and hurricane-battered Acapulco. Sheinbaum romped to victory in June with nearly 60% of the vote, propelled largely by the sustained popularity of her political mentor, former President Andrés Manuel López Obrador. He took office six years ago declaring 'For the good of all, first the poor,' and promising historical change from the neoliberal economic policies of his predecessors. Sheinbaum promised continuity from his popular social policies to controversial constitutional reforms to the judiciary and National Guard rammed through during his final days in office. Despite her pledge of continuity, she is a very different personality. 'López Obrador was a tremendously charismatic president and many times that charisma allowed him to cover up some political errors that Claudia Sheinbaum will not have that possibility of doing,' said Carlos Pérez Ricart, a political analyst at Mexico’s Center for Economic Research and Teaching. 'So, where López Obrador was charismatic, Claudia Sheinbaum will have to be effective.' He is not leaving her an easy situation. Her first trip as president will be to the flood-stricken Pacific coast resort of Acapulco. Hurricane John, which struck as a Category 3 hurricane last week and then reemerged into the ocean and struck again as a tropical storm, caused four days of incredibly heavy rain that killed at least 17 people along the coast around Acapulco. Acapulco was devastated in October 2023 by Hurricane Otis, and had not recovered from that blow when John hit. Sheinbaum must also deal with raging violence in the cartel-dominated northern city of Culiacan, where factional fighting within the Sinaloa cartel broke out after drug lords Ismael 'El Mayo' Zambada and Joaquín Guzmán López were apprehended in the United States after they flew there in a small plane on July 25. López Obrador has long sought to avoid confronting Mexico’s drug cartels and has openly appealed to the gangs to keep the peace among themselves, but the limitations of that strategy have become glaringly apparent in Culiacan, the capital of Sinaloa state, where gun battles have raged on the city’s streets. Local authorities and even the army — which López Obrador has relied on for everything — have essentially admitted that the fighting will only end when the cartel bosses decide to end it. But that’s only the latest hotspot. Drug-related violence is surging from Tijuana in the north to Chiapas in the south, displacing thousands. While Sheinbaum inherits a huge budget deficit, unfinished construction projects and a burgeoning bill for her party’s cash hand-out programs — all of which could send financial markets tumbling — perhaps her biggest looming concern is the possibility of a victory for Donald Trump in the Nov. 5 U.S. presidential election. Trump has already vowed to slap 100% tariffs on vehicles made in Mexico. Though that would likely violate the current U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement, there are other things Trump could do to make life difficult for Sheinbaum, including his pledge of massive deportations. Things with its northern neighbor were already tense after López Obrador said he was putting relations with the U.S. embassy 'on pause' after public criticism of the proposed judicial overhaul. First lady Jill Biden struck an optimistic tone for relations with the incoming Sheinbaum administration saying at a reception Monday that, 'Under Dr. Sheinbaum’s presidency I know we will continue to build a more prosperous, safe and democratic region — and take the steps in our U.S.-Mexico partnership.' There are areas where Sheinbaum could try to take Mexico in a new direction. For example, she has a Ph.D. in energy engineering and has spoken of the need to address climate change. López Obrador built a massive new oil refinery and poured money into the state-owned oil company. But his budget commitments do not leave her much room to maneuver. Jennifer Piscopo, professor of gender and politics at the Royal Holloway University of London who has studied Latin America for decades, said Mexico electing its first female leader is important because it will show girls they can do it too, but it can also create unrealistic expectations. 'Woman firsts are powerful symbols, but they do not gain magic power,' she said. 'Especially when the governance challenges are so large, expecting magic solutions overnight can also generate outsized disappointment.' ____ Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america	https://apnews.com/article/mexico-president-claudia-sheinbaum-7d3599b39a7298df46e7eda34d80afee	2024-09-30T19:13:54-07:00

South Korea unveils its most powerful missile, which could reach North Korea's underground bunkers	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea unveiled its most powerful ballistic missile and other weapons targeting North Korea during a massive Armed Forces Day ceremony Tuesday, as the South's president warned the North's regime would collapse if it attempts to use nuclear weapons. South Korea’s weapons displays and warning against North Korea came after its northern rival recently rose regional animosities by disclosing its uranium-enrichment facility and tested missiles ahead of the U.S. presidential election in November. 'If North Korea attempts to use nuclear weapons, it will face the resolute and overwhelming response of our military and the (South Korea)-U.S. alliance,' President Yoon Suk Yeol told thousands of troops gathered at a military airport near Seoul. 'That day will be the end of the North Korean regime.' 'The North Korean regime must abandon the delusion that nuclear weapons will protect them,' Yoon said. During the ceremony, the South Korean military displayed about 340 military equipment and weapons systems. Among them was its most powerful Hyunmoo-5 ballistic missile, which observers say is capable of carrying an 8-ton conventional warhead that can penetrate deep into the earth and destroy underground bunkers in North Korea. It was the first time for South Korea to disclose that missile. The U.S. flew a long-range B-1B bomber during the ceremony in an apparent demonstration of its security commitment to its Asian ally. South Korea also flew some of its most advanced fighter jets. Later Tuesday, South Korea will parade its troops and weapons through the streets of Seoul, the capital, as part of efforts to boost military morale and demonstrate its deterrence capabilities against potential North Korean aggressions. Also Tuesday, South Korea launched its strategic command that officials say integrates South Korea’s conventional capabilities with U.S. nuclear weapons. South Korea has no nuclear weapons. Since taking office in 2022, Yoon, a conservative, has put a stronger military alliance with the U.S. and an improved trilateral Seoul-Washington-Tokyo security cooperation at the center of his security polices to cope with North Korea’s advancing nuclear program. In recent years, North Korea has performed a provocative of missile tests and threatened to use nuclear weapons preemptively in potential conflicts with South Korea and the United States. Last month, concerns about North Korea’s bomb program further grew after it published photos of a secretive facility to enrich uranium for nuclear weapons. It was North Korea’s first unveiling of a uranium-enrichment facility since it showed one at the country’s main Yongbyon nuclear complex to visiting American scholars in 2010. South Korean officials say North Korea will likely try to further dial up tensions with provocative weapons tests ahead of the U.S. election to increase its leverage in future diplomacy with a new U.S. government. Experts say North Korea likely thinks an expanded nuclear arsenal would help it win bigger U.S. concessions like extensive sanctions relief. Earlier Tuesday, North Korea’s vice defense minister, Kim Kang Il, slammed the U.S. for its temporary deployments of powerful military assets to South Korea and vowed strong responses. He cited the recent visit of a U.S. nuclear-powered submarine and Tuesday's B-1B flyover. Kim threatened to bolster North Korea's 'powerful war deterrent,' an apparent reference to its nuclear capability, and take unspecified steps to stoke security concerns to the security of the U.S. mainland. Observers say his comments implies North Korea may consider test-firing an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of reaching the U.S. mainland. ___ Follow AP's Asia-Pacific coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/asia-pacific	https://apnews.com/article/south-korea-missile-north-nuclear-7f2f8774b8ebbe697e611b14c06c1de5	2024-09-30T19:01:40-07:00	
Knife attack in Shanghai supermarket kills 3, injures 15 others	BEIJING (AP) — A knife attack at a supermarket in Shanghai killed three people and injured 15 others, local police said. A 37-year-old man surnamed Lin was taken into custody by police responding to the report of the attack Monday evening, the local Songjiang police branch said in a statement Tuesday. Eighteen people were sent to hospital for treatment, and three later died. Police said Lin had personal financial disputes and came to Shanghai to 'vent his anger,' and that further investigation is underway. The attack took place in a suburban district southwest of Shanghai and comes on the eve of the weeklong National Day holidays. Several knife attacks have occurred in China this year. Last month, a 10-year-old Japanese student died after being stabbed near his school in southern China. This follows another knife attack at a school bus stop for a Japanese school that killed a Chinese national who tried to stop the attacker, and injured a Japanese mother and child. Earlier this year, a Chinese man stabbed four U.S. university instructors at a public park in Jilin in the northeast and a Chinese person who tried to intervene. The four instructors from Cornell College were teaching at Beihua University. Their injuries were not critical.	https://apnews.com/article/china-knife-stabbing-attack-shanghai-5a70923e123cf88ca8edffe5efdf787f	2024-09-30T18:31:01-07:00	
Indian-controlled Kashmir votes in final phase of polls to elect local government	SRINAGAR, India (AP) — The final phase of voting to choose a local government in Indian-controlled Kashmir wrapped up Tuesday, the first such vote since Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government stripped the disputed region of its special status five years ago. Over 3.9 million residents were eligible to cast ballots to choose 40 lawmakers out of 415 candidates in the region’s seven districts during the third — and last — phase of the election. It’s the first such vote in a decade and the first since Modi’s Hindu nationalist government scrapped the Muslim-majority region’s semi-autonomy in 2019. Thousands of armed government forces patrolled the voting districts and guarded over 5,000 polling stations. Lines of voters stretched across the stations. The region’s chief electoral office said about 69% turnout was recorded on Tuesday. India's unprecedented move in 2019 downgraded and divided the former state into two centrally governed union territories, Ladakh and Jammu-Kashmir. Both are ruled directly by New Delhi through its appointed administrators along with unelected bureaucrats. The move — which largely resonated in India and among Modi supporters — was mostly opposed in Kashmir as an assault on its identity and autonomy. The region has since been on edge with civil liberties curbed and media gagged. India and Pakistan each administer a part of Kashmir, but both claim the territory in its entirety. The nuclear-armed rivals have fought two of their three wars over the territory since they gained independence from British colonial rule in 1947. In Jammu areas, tens of thousands of Pakistani Hindu refugees are voting for the first time in any regional election since their migration in 1947. The refugees, officially called West Pakistan Refugees, have long been recognized as Indian citizens with voting rights in national elections. However, before the 2019 changes, Kashmir’s special status allowed only descendants from residents of the territory in 1934 to vote and own property. At a polling station in Jammu’s R S Pura area, scores of these refugees lined up to cast their votes. 'It’s a Diwali for us,' said the first-time voter Vikram Choudhary, 26, comparing the vote to the Hindu festival of light symbolizing the victory of light over darkness. 'We feel liberated.' 'Our children will have a secure future and a say in local affairs now,' said another voter, 76-year-old Satpal Choudhary. India’s ruling BJP has a strong political base in the region’s Hindu-dominated areas of Jammu that largely favor the 2019 changes and has won multiple seats from there in the past elections. But it is weak in the Kashmir Valley where the BJP has never won a seat. The party has fielded only 19 candidates for the 47 seats in the valley while it is contesting all 43 seats in Jammu. Modi’s party is not officially aligned with any local group, but many politicians believe it is tacitly supporting some parties and independent candidates in the valley who privately agree with it. The region’s main pro-India political parties say the BJP is trying to manipulate the election and fragment the valley’s vote through independents. About 43% of 503 candidates contesting the vote in the Kashmir Valley are independents, compared to 35% of 359 candidates in Jammu. As in the previous phases of the elections, many voters in the valley said people were frustrated over the absence of their own representatives for so many years. The ballot was the only means for them to express anger at India's actions in the region, they said. 'Truth is that it’s the central government has been the real ruler here even before 2019,' said Syed Altaf after casting his vote in the Kashmir Valley’s Pattan area. Voting began Sept. 18 with about 61% turnout. In the second phase of voting on last Wednesday, overall turnout was about 55%. There were no incidents reported in either phase. Authorities said the region's overall turnout was 63% in the three phases. Votes will be counted next Tuesday, with results expected later that day. The multistage election will allow Kashmir to have its own truncated government and a local legislature, called an assembly, rather than being directly under New Delhi’s rule. However, there will be a limited transition of power from New Delhi to the 90-seat assembly as Kashmir will remain a 'union territory' — directly controlled by the federal government — with India’s Parliament as its main legislator. Kashmir’s statehood must be restored for the new government to have powers similar to other states of India. Militants in the Indian-controlled portion of Kashmir have been fighting New Delhi’s rule since 1989. Many Muslim Kashmiris support the rebels’ goal of uniting the territory, either under Pakistani rule or as an independent country. India insists the Kashmir militancy is Pakistan-sponsored terrorism. Pakistan denies the charge, and many Kashmiris consider it a legitimate freedom struggle. Tens of thousands of civilians, rebels and government forces have been killed in the conflict. ___ Associated Press journalist Channi Anand contributed to this story from Jammu, India. ___ Follow AP’s Asia-Pacific coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/asia-pacific	https://apnews.com/article/kashmir-election-phase-3-india-pakistan-419006d6b3e53bb931751a20134a82eb	2024-09-30T17:47:57-07:00	
Japan’s parliament elects Shigeru Ishiba, newly elected governing party leader, as prime minister	TOKYO (AP) — Japan’s parliament on Tuesday formally elected Shigeru Ishiba, head of the governing Liberal Democratic Party, as the country’s new prime minister. Ishiba was chosen as the party's leader on Friday to replace Fumio Kishida, who then stepped down earlier on Tuesday to pave the way. Ishiba will announce his new Cabinet later on Tuesday. Kishida took office in 2021 but left so his party could have a fresh leader after his government was dogged by scandals. Ishiba plans to call a parliamentary election for Oct. 27. 'I believe it is important to have the new administration get the public’s judgment as soon as possible,' Ishiba said Monday in announcing his plan to call a snap election. Opposition parties criticized Ishiba for allowing only a short period of time for his policies to be examined and discussed in parliament before the national election. Kishida had announced in August he would resign at the end of his three-year term. Kishida and his ministers stepped down at a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday morning, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi said. Kishida left his office after a brief send-off ceremony in which he was presented a bouquet of red roses and applauded by his staff and former Cabinet members. 'As we face a critical moment in and outside the country, I earnestly hope key policies that will pioneer Japan's future will be powerfully pursued by the new Cabinet,' Kishida said in a statement, citing the need to bolster security amid a deepening global divide, such as Russia's war in Ukraine, while tackling a declining birthrate and population, as well as economic and political reforms at home. Ishiba earlier announced his party's leaders ahead of naming his Cabinet. Former Environment Minister Shinjiro Koizumi, who came in third in the party leadership race, will head the party’s election task force. He is expected to name defense experts Takeshi Iwaya as foreign minister and Gen Nakatani as defense chief. The majority of his Cabinet ministers, like Ishiba, are expected to be unaffiliated with factions led and controlled by party heavyweights, and none are from former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's powerful group linked to damaging scandals. Ishiba's lack of stable power base could also mean a fragility of his government, and 'could quickly collapse' even though Ishiba hopes to build up party unity as it prepares for the upcoming election, the liberal-leaning Asahi newspaper said. The move is also seen as revenge by Ishiba, who was largely pushed to the side during most of Abe's reign. Ishiba has proposed an Asian version of the NATO military alliance and more discussion among regional partners about the use of the U.S. nuclear deterrence. He also suggested a more equal Japan-U.S. security alliance, including joint management of U.S. bases in Japan and having Japanese Self Defense Force bases in the United States. Ishiba outlined his views in an article to the Hudson Institute last week. 'The absence of a collective self-defense system like NATO in Asia means that wars are likely to break out because there is no obligation for mutual defense. Under these circumstances, the creation of an Asian version of NATO is essential to deter China by its Western allies,' he wrote. Ishiba proposes combining of existing security and diplomatic groupings, such as the Quad and other bilateral and multilateral frameworks involving the United States, Australia, New Zealand, South Korea and the Philippines. He also noted that the Asian version of NATO can also consider sharing of the control of U.S. nuclear weapons in the region as a deterrence against growing threats from China, North Korea and Russia. Ishiba on Friday stressed Japan needs to reinforce its security, noting recent violations of Japanese airspace by Russian and Chinese warplanes and repeated missile launches by North Korea. He pledged to continue Kishida’s economic policy aimed at pulling Japan out of deflation and achieving real salary increases, while tackling challenges such as Japan’s declining birthrate and population and resilience to natural disasters. The LDP has had a nearly unbroken tenure governing Japan since World War II. The party members may have seen Ishiba’s more centrist views as crucial in pushing back challenges by the liberal-leaning opposition and winning voter support as the party reels from corruption scandals that drove down Kishida’s popularity. Ishiba, first elected to parliament in 1986, has served as defense minister, agriculture minister and in other key Cabinet posts, and was LDP secretary general under Abe. ___ Follow AP's Asia-Pacific coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/asia-pacific	https://apnews.com/article/japan-cabinet-kishida-ishiba-fa7f80b614a8bf298852b6766dbf6403	2024-09-30T15:51:20-07:00	
Humberto Ortega, Nicaragua's ex-military chief who later turned critic of his brother, dies at 77	MEXICO CITY (AP) — Nicaraguan guerrilla fighter Humberto Ortega, a Sandinista defense minister who later in life became a critic of his older brother President Daniel Ortega, died Monday at 77, Nicaragua's army said. The younger Ortega became the head of the Sandinista army and the country’s defense minister after the overthrow of dictator Anastasio Somoza in 1979. Later in life, Humberto Ortega publicly criticized some actions of his brother’s increasingly repressive administrations. He had been ill and effectively under house arrest for some time. He died Monday at a military hospital, the Nicaraguan military posted on social media. A cause of death was not provided, but a government statement said he had had a prolonged illness. It also praised his bravery in 'revolutionary military actions.' Local media reported in May that police had surrounded Humberto Ortega’s home, the same day online news outlet Infobae published a lengthy interview with him, in which he discussed his at times tense relationship with his brother. He also characterized his brother’s current administration as 'authoritarian, dictatorial' in explaining that when the leader of such a government dies, it is very difficult for there to be continuity with the immediate group in power. At the time, police said in a statement that the Health Ministry had visited 77-year-old Humberto Ortega, who suffered from heart problems, in his home and evaluated his health without ever saying why he was under police guard. Venezuela President Nicolás Maduro expressed his condolences in a statement, praising Humberto Ortega as a freedom fighter. Dissident and former presidential hopeful turned political exile Juan Sebastián Chamorro told the Associated Press 'the legacy of Humberto Ortega is intrinsically linked with the war.' While Chamorro blamed the government for contributing to Ortega's death, he said he also had a hand in the state of the country today. 'He has a lot of responsibility, above all what has happened in the past 40-some years, and particularly in was policy that brought a lot death and destruction to the country,' Chamorro said. The younger Ortega joined the fighters of the Sandinista National Liberation Front and was wounded in the arm in 1969 during an operation to free Carlos Fonseca, the Sandinista commander, from a Costa Rican prison. When the revolution succeeded in overthrowing dictator Anastasio Somoza in 1979, Humberto Ortega was made the head of the Sandinista army and defense minister. He made military service obligatory and would later say in interviews that he had mobilized more than 320,000 young recruits as the Sandinistas battled the United States-backed 'Contra' rebels in a war that began in 1981 and ended in 1990, leaving at least 35,000 dead. Even after his brother’s surprising election loss to Violeta Chamorro in 1990, Humberto Ortega stayed on as leader of Nicaragua’s army for another five years, professionalizing its ranks and making it subordinate to civilian leadership. Humberto Ortega’s political thinking evolved as he moved from guerilla fighter to businessman. In 1981, he threatened to 'hang the bourgeoisie from the light posts,' but by 1996 he was defending his fortune saying he wasn’t going to leave government 'on a bicycle.' After his retirement in 1995, he split time between Nicaragua and Costa Rica, focusing on his business interests and penning essays that advocated a more centrist position and a national conciliation government. Humberto Ortega’s more moderate positions eventually became uncomfortable for his brother who returned to the presidency in 2007. When widespread street protests in April 2018 became demonstrations against Daniel Ortega’s government, the president responded with brutal repression from the police and paramilitary forces. Humberto Ortega called for an end to the use of paramilitaries and accused security forces of 'indiscriminate repression' that left at least 355 dead. 'The army must speak with Daniel Ortega' to control the situation, Humberto Ortega said in a local interview at the time. In 2019, Humberto Ortega spoke out again after the arrest of some 168 opposition figures. His brother responded publicly, saying 'some traitors and sellouts who had said that there wouldn’t be enough lightposts to hang all of the rich, now come out saying that these gentlemen are not terrorists.' In February 2022, he also criticized his brother’s administration with the death of former guerrilla and retired general Hugo Torres after eight months in a notorious Managua prison. Torres had split from Ortega’s government years earlier and was an outspoken critic. Humberto Ortega wrote in a local news outlet that Torres had died at age 73 in a 'cruel imprisonment.' President Ortega visited his younger brother in December, according to a government report that described his condition as serious. The younger Ortega, author of several books of history and military strategy, had suffered from heart problems and was hospitalized in October 2021. ___ AP reporter Megan Janetsky and former reporter Gabriela Selser contributed to this report.

China marks 75 years of Communist Party rule as economic challenges and security threats linger	BEIJING (AP) — China is marking the 75th year of Communist Party rule as economic challenges and security threats linger over the massive state. No festivities have been announced for the occasion Tuesday, save for a flag-raising ceremony at Tiananmen Square, with an honor guard marching from the entrance of the sprawling palace that in past centuries was the home of Chinese emperors. The entirely state-controlled media ran constant reports on China's economic progress and social stability, with no mention of challenges ranging from a declining birth rate to the disruption in supply chains that has harmed the largely export-driven economy. Commemorations were also held in the former British colony of Hong Kong and Portugal's former territory of Macao, both of which returned to Chinese sovereignty in the late 1990s in a key indication of Beijing's determination to overcome what it has called a 'Century of Humiliation.' In recent decades, China has mounted military parades and displays of the country's economic might only at the turn of decades, such as for the 60th and 70th anniversaries. The world’s second largest economy has struggled to regain momentum after the COVID-19 pandemic. A prolonged property slump led to a spillover effect on other parts of the economy, from construction to sales of home appliances. Last week, China announced a slew of measures to boost the economy, including lower interest rates and smaller down payment requirements for mortgages. Party leader and head of state Xi Jinping has largely avoided overseas travel since the pandemic, while continuing with his purges at home of top officials considered insufficiently loyal or being suspected of corruption or personal indiscretions. 'The road ahead will not be smooth, there will definitely be difficulties and obstacles, and we may encounter major tests such as high winds and rough seas, or even stormy waves' Xi warned during a banquet on the eve of the anniversary. 'We must be vigilant in times of peace, plan ahead, and rely closely on the entire Party, the entire army, and people of all ethnic groups across the country' he said, 'no difficulties can stop the Chinese people from moving forward.' The anniversary also comes as China is facing growing frictions with neighbors including Japan, South Korea and the Philippines over territorial claims and their close relationships with Beijing’s chief rival, the United States. The Communists under Mao Zedong seized power in 1949 amid a civil war with the Nationalists, also known as the KMT, led by Chiang Kai-shek, who shifted their political, economic and military power to the now self-governing island democracy of Taiwan. Beijing continues to insist Taiwan must be annexed under Communist Party rule, by force if necessary, while the U.S. has provided arms to ensure its defense. China, meanwhile, has involved itself in disputes over its claims to most of the South China Sea and uninhabited islands held by Japan, the Philippines, Vietnam and other neighboring nations. China's military buildup and its recent launch of a nuclear capable ballistic missile into the Pacific Ocean have raised concerns about a possible conflict. At home, Xi has made himself effectively leader for life by ending term limits and extending his power over key government and party bodies. China allows no competitive elections and the party retains near total control over the media that informs its 1.4 billion people.	https://apnews.com/article/china-communist-party-foundation-day-russia-south-china-sea-5f140a2c8db38029ea0c0f2769e9f619	2024-09-30T15:20:23-07:00	
US opts out of running for reelection on UN Human Rights Council	WASHINGTON (AP) — The Biden administration has decided not to seek a second consecutive term on the much-maligned U.N. Human Rights Council, the State Department said Monday. The administration had made U.S. membership on the Geneva-based council a priority when it took office in 2021 after former President Donald Trump had withdrawn from the body, citing anti-Israel bias. Since returning to the council, the administration has frequently taken issue with its votes on the Middle East and other issues. 'We decided not to seek another (term) on the Human Rights Council at this time because we are engaged with our allies about the best way to move forward,' State Department spokesman Matthew Miller told reporters. Elections for the 47-member council are held by the U.N. General Assembly with candidate countries coming from various geographic groups. The three other candidates — Iceland, Spain and Switzerland — from the U.S. geographic group known as Western Hemisphere and Others, or WEOG, would be able to represent American interests and values, Miller said. 'All of them are countries with a very strong record of support for human rights,' he said. 'We thought they would carry the flag forward, but we will continue to remain engaged on human rights issues.' The council was created in 2006 to replace a human rights commission discredited because of some members’ poor rights records. But the new council soon came to face similar criticism, including that rights abusers sought seats to protect themselves and their allies. The U.S. has criticized the selection of candidates with poor rights records on uncontested slates. The U.S. has been the most vocal defender of Israel and has repeatedly joined it in denouncing alleged anti-Israel bias in the U.N. rights body. Spain, meanwhile, was one of three European countries to announce they would recognize a Palestinian state — a move Israel criticized. What the U.S. saw as the council's excessive criticism of Israel culminated in the Trump administration’s withdrawal from it in June 2018. In announcing the Biden administration would reverse Trump's decision, Secretary of State Antony Blinken criticized the withdrawal, saying it 'did nothing to encourage meaningful change, but instead created a vacuum of U.S. leadership, which countries with authoritarian agendas have used to their advantage.'	https://apnews.com/article/us-un-human-rights-council-dafc1b0484cab70d0661460c163f7bba	2024-09-30T11:31:24-07:00	
Aid group says Congo had 25,000 victims of sexual violence last year	KINSHASA, Congo (AP) — Doctors Without Borders treated more than 25,000 victims of sexual violence in the Congo last year, by far the highest level it has seen there and most of it in the east where armed groups vie for power, the aid group said Monday. The vast majority of victims — averaging more than two per hour — were treated in displacement camps near Goma. the capital of Congo's eastern province of North Kivu, the group said. 'According to the testimonies of our patients, two-thirds of them were assaulted at gunpoint,' Christopher Mambula, the group’s program manager in Congo, said in the report. Eastern Congo has struggled with armed violence as more than 120 armed groups fight for power, land and valuable mineral resources while others try to defend their communities. Some armed groups have been accused of mass killings, rapes and other human rights violations. The violence has displaced some 6 million people in the east. Congo alleges that neighboring Rwanda has been involved in aggression and war crimes in the region. It also accuses Rwanda of giving military backing to the M23 rebel armed group. Rwanda denies the claim, but in February admitted that it has troops and missile systems in eastern Congo to safeguard its security, pointing to a buildup of Congolese forces near the border. M23, of the March 23 Movement, is a rebel military group mainly made up of ethnic Tutsis that broke away from the Congolese army just over a decade ago. They staged a large offensive in 2012 and took over the provincial capital of Goma near the border with Rwanda, the same city they are threatening again. Earlier this week, Human Rights Watch said both Rwanda and Congo’s army have killed displacement camp residents, committed rapes and obstructed aid. 'While the massive presence of armed men in and around displacement sites explains this explosion of sexual violence, the inadequacy of the humanitarian response and the inhumane living conditions in these sites fuel the phenomenon,' Doctors Without Borders said in its report. High numbers of sexual assaults have also been recorded this year by the charity, which treated more than 17,000 victims between January and May in the North Kivu province alone. ——————- Banchereau reported from Dakar, Senegal	https://apnews.com/article/congo-sexual-violence-doctors-without-borders-74aeb67d4b76088ea43257f9321f96f8	2024-09-30T11:21:51-07:00	
On a day when isolated nations get their say at the UN, North Korea reups condemnation of US	UNITED NATIONS (AP) — North Korea condemned the United States and its allies Monday for 'stirring up military confrontations still further' by engaging in war games in the Asia-Pacific region and 'talking unceasingly' about regime change in the diplomatically isolated nation. U.N. Ambassador Kim Song said North Korea was taking unspecified steps to defend itself better. The words from Kim, while sharp, did not appear to represent any notable departure from Pyongyang's usual rhetoric. He spoke on the final day of the U.N. General Assembly's high-level meeting of world leaders — a day when some of the world's most diplomatically isolated nations took the rostrum alongside a diverse roster of leaders from nations like Canada and the United Arab Emirates. Kim said the United States, trying to dominate world affairs, was not acting fairly to the community of nations and was misusing the ostensibly multilateral United Nations for its own ends. 'They are stirring up military confrontations still further,' Kim said, accusing Washington of hypocrisy — another common charge from North Korea. 'Who has developed and used nuclear weapons for the first time in human history? ... Who is talking unceasingly about the end of a regime of a sovereign state?' He added: 'The United Nations is misused for the political aims of an individual country. Such realities should no longer be tolerated and allowed.' As he spoke, a lone U.S. diplomat intently scrawled notes on paper. There was no immediate response from the U.S. North Korea is responding to U.S.-South Korea drills U.S. and South Korean troops held a large-scale exercise last month aimed at strengthening their combined defense capabilities against nuclear-armed North Korea, which again accused the allies of practicing an invasion. The annual summertime exercise came amid heightened tensions on the Korean Peninsula as the pace of both North Korea’s weapons demonstrations and the U.S.-South Korea combined military exercises have intensified. At the time, the North released a statement calling the exercises 'provocative war drills' and said they justified Pyongyang's nuclear ambitions. In a rebuttal later in the assembly hall, a South Korean diplomat called the North's claims groundless and said its pursuit of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles was the root of the tensions. 'It is our duty, like any member state, to protect the lives and safety of our people from the DPRK's military threat by maintaining a robust South Korea-U.S. combined defense and deterrence posture,' said deputy U.N. Ambassador Sangijn Kim, using an abbreviation for the North’s formal name, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. Kim's speech resembled his previous one at the same lectern last year, when he said the United States was trying to provoke a nuclear war. He also said that Pyongyang was bolstering its defenses to match the 'hegemony' it says threatens it. 'We continue to increase our war deterrence capabilities,' Kim said. The 1950-53 Korean War ended with an armistice instead of a peace treaty, leaving the Korean Peninsula divided and — technically — still in a state of war. Some players weren't there to speak Notably absent from the 190 speakers who addressed the assembly over six days: representatives from Myanmar and Afghanistan, both of which are in U.N. limbo after new regimes took over in recent years. Afghanistan wasn't totally absent from the debate Monday. Irish Foreign Minister Seán Fleming demanded a 'non-negotiable' commitment to gender equality there. And Canada's foreign minister criticized the ruling Taliban for their restrictive policies toward women and the impact such laws have on Afghan society. 'The Taliban,' Melanie Joly said, 'cannot make international law disappear through simple decrees.' On a morning peppered with denunciations of 'hegemony,' Burkina Faso’s top diplomat said the U.N.’s treasured concept of multilateralism – broad-scale decision-making that gives all countries a voice on the issues facing the planet – is 'exhausted,' its reputation 'neutered, time and time again, by predatory actions by certain member states who have decided that they are the masters of the world.' 'The harmony and cohesion of our world is at stake,' Foreign Minister Karamoko Jean Marie Traore said. 'We’d like to appeal to the powers of our world to prioritize an inclusive global governance which is rid of hegemonizing visions. And if we can do that, the U.N.’s glory will again be restored.' Less powerful nations criticize U.N., West Syrian Foreign Minister Bassam Sabbagh, who represents another relatively isolated nation, also said the U.N.'s brand of multilateralism has stopped working — if, he said, it ever had. He cited what he called 'terrorist' crimes of Israel since Hamas attacked Israelis on Oct. 7, 2023, and Israel responded swiftly and fiercely in Gaza. Israel says it is only defending itself. 'Chaos is spreading,' Sabbagh said. 'All that has happened has revealed the true intentions of the collective West. The United States has prevented the (Security) Council from fulfilling its responsibility to confront threats to international peace and security.' Said the United Arab Emirates' foreign minister, Shekh Shakhboot Nahyan al-Nahyan, on the same topic: 'Even wars have rules.' Meanwhile, the foreign minister of Nicaragua, Valdrack Ludwing Jaentschke Whitaker, said small nations like his would never back down — even in the face of major powers. To 'our invaders, those interventionists that are dressed in sheepskin, that have the faces of wolves,' he said, 'we are peoples rich in culture, resources and community models. We are rich in values that have been disowned, distorted, slandered or worn down. We will not allow ourselves to be converted into needy beggars.' ___ See more of AP’s coverage of the U.N.

Epic Games sues Google and Samsung over phone settings, accusing them of violating antitrust laws	LOS ANGELES (AP) — Video game maker Epic Games sued Google and Samsung on Monday, accusing the tech companies of coordinating to block third-party competition in application distribution on Samsung devices. At issue is Samsung's 'Auto Blocker' feature, which only allows for apps from authorized sources, such as the Samsung Galaxy Store or Google Play Store, to be installed. The feature is turned on by default but can be changed in a phone's settings. The tool prevents the installation of applications from unauthorized sources and blocks 'malicious activity,' according to Samsung. In a lawsuit filed in San Francisco federal court — Epic's second against Google — the company said Auto Blocker 'is virtually guaranteed to entrench Google’s dominance over Android app distribution.' Epic, developer of the popular game 'Fortnite,' filed the lawsuit to prevent Google from 'negating the long overdue promise of competition in the Android App Distribution Market,' according to the complaint. 'Allowing this coordinated illegal anti-competitive dealing to proceed hurts developers and consumers and undermines both the jury’s verdict and regulatory and legislative progress around the world,' Epic Games said in a post on its website. Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Samsung said it 'actively fosters market competition, enhances consumer choice, and conducts its operations fairly.' 'The features integrated into our devices are designed in accordance with Samsung’s core principles of security, privacy, and user control, and we remain fully committed to safeguarding users’ personal data. Users have the choice to disable Auto Blocker at any time,' Samsung said, adding that it plans to 'vigorously contest Epic Game’s baseless claims.' Epic launched its Epic Games Store on iPhones in the European Union and on Android devices worldwide in August. The company claims that it now takes 'an exceptionally onerous 21-step process' to download a third-party app outside of the Google Play Store or the Samsung Galaxy Store. A support page on Epic's website shows a four-step process to remove the Auto Blocker setting. Epic said those steps, combined with Google’s and Samsung’s 'install flow,' are part of the 21 steps to download the Epic Games Store. Epic won its first antitrust lawsuit against Google in December after a jury found that Google’s Android app store had been protected by anti-competitive barriers that damaged smartphone consumers and software developers. The game maker says the 'Auto Blocker' feature was intentionally crafted in coordination with Google to preemptively undermine the jury’s verdict in that case. 'Literally no store can compete with the incumbents when disadvantaged in this way,' Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney said on X. 'To have true competition, all reputable stores and apps must be free to compete on a level playing field.'	https://apnews.com/article/epic-games-google-samsung-d5acc9f1412251335a9e9cf08ce3e98c	2024-09-30T09:09:23-07:00	
Hunger in Haiti reaches famine levels as gangs squeeze life out of the capital and beyond	PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) — Nearly 6,000 people in Haiti are starving, with nearly half the country's population of more than 11 million people experiencing crisis levels of hunger or worse as gang violence smothers life in the capital of Port-au-Prince and beyond, according to a new report released Monday. The number of Haitians facing crisis, emergency and famine levels of hunger increased by 1.2 million in the past year as gang violence disrupts the transportation of goods and prevents people from venturing out of their homes to buy food, according to the report by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification. In addition, 2 million Haitians are facing severe hunger, according to the report. 'This is shocking,' said Martine Villeneuve, Haiti director for the nonprofit Action Against Hunger. 'We were not expecting that level. Two million…is massive.' Villeneuve told The Associated Press that she also was surprised that some of the 2 million people hit by hunger don't even live in places directly affected by gang violence. While much of the hunger is directly tied to gang violence, double-digit inflation also has limited what many Haitians can afford to buy, with food now representing 70% of total household expenditures. The cost of a food basket increased more than 11% in the past year, with inflation hitting 30% in July. In addition, parts of Haiti are still struggling to recover from the August 2021 earthquake, various drought episodes, and Hurricane Matthew, which struck Haiti as a Category 4 storm in 2016. Gang violence, however, accounts for most of the hunger, with gangs controlling 80% of Port-au-Prince and the roads that lead to and from northern and southern Haiti. From April to June, at least 1,379 people were reported killed or injured, and another 428 kidnapped. In addition, gang violence has left more than 700,000 people homeless in recent years. 'Haiti continues to face a worsening humanitarian crisis, with alarming rates of armed gang violence disrupting daily life, forcing more people to flee their homes and levels of acute food insecurity to rise,' the report stated. Those experiencing famine live in makeshift shelters in the metropolitan area of Port-au-Prince, with 70% of people in shelters overall experiencing crisis levels of hunger or worse, the report found. Among them is Joceline St-Louis, a 28-year-old mother of two boys, 5 and 1. 'Food doesn’t come around very often,' she said, adding that she depends on others to feed her children. 'When an organization does provide food, there’s a major fight,' she said. St-Louis said she has to take her 1-year-old to a clinic so he can receive a peanut butter mix 'so that his body doesn’t collapse in my arms.' 'I’m sometimes so depressed that I sometimes want to kill the kids and myself,' she said in a soft voice as she cradled the 1-year-old in her arms while the 5-year-old played with his friends. In another shelter nearby, Judeline Auguste, 39, said she depends solely on remittances to feed herself and her 8-year-old boy, but the money barely lasts a week. 'It’s very rare that I can get a meal a day,' she said. 'My situation is hard not because of me, but because of my son. He looks at other people eating all the time, and he starts crying, ‘Mommy, I’m hungry.’' Meanwhile, those facing urgent levels of hunger live in Haiti’s northern, central and southern regions, as well as in the capital. Jean Yonel, who fled his home with his family after gangs raided their neighborhood, said there are days that he, his wife and their seven children eat only white rice or spaghetti. 'I can’t provide every day for these children,' Yonel said. 'Sometimes we take just a spoonful of food and leave the rest of the food for the kids so they don’t die.' Yonel used to work as a mason, but with construction jobs drying up, he is now forced to search for wood to make charcoal. His wife sells second-hand clothes. On days when they can’t afford a proper meal for their children, she mixes flour with spinach to keep their stomachs from rumbling.	https://apnews.com/article/haiti-hunger-starving-report-af625f8d80698788624dfbcc30c656a4	2024-09-30T08:35:52-07:00

Belarusian authorities pressure pardoned political prisoners, rights groups say	TALLINN, Estonia (AP) — Belarusian human rights activists Monday accused the government of pressuring political prisoners who have been pardoned by authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko and forcing them to cooperate with authorities. During the past three months, Lukashenko has pardoned 115 activists who were convicted for taking part in the protest against his rule. Those pardoned were a small fraction of more than 1,300 political prisoners in Belarus, according to the Viasna human rights center. They include the group’s founder and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Ales Bialiatski and Polish newspaper journalist Andrzej Poczobut, whose release Poland is seeking. At least six political prisoners have died behind bars, Viasna said. Viasna and other rights groups said Monday that those amnestied were barred from leaving the country and forced to take part in propaganda videos. Andrei Stryzhak of the BYSOL rights group said that some of the amnestied had their phones infested with software intended to spy on the opposition. 'We categorically condemn the authorities' pressure on the former political prisoners,' he said. Viasna representative Pavel Sapelka said the Belarusian law enforcement agencies have threatened those amnestied with repeat conviction or reprisals against their relatives to force them to cooperate with the authorities. In 2020, Belarus was rocked by its largest-ever protests following an election that gave Lukashenko a sixth term in office but was condemned by the opposition and the West as fraudulent. According to Viasna, 65,000 people have been arrested since the protests began and hundreds of thousands have fled Belarus.	https://apnews.com/article/belarus-lukashenko-political-prisoners-pardons-crackdown-cfe0623a07b64512c901b03edc72e040	2024-09-30T08:06:41-07:00	
The US is sending a few thousand more troops to the Middle East to boost security	WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. is sending a 'few thousand' troops to the Middle East to bolster security and to defend Israel if necessary, the Pentagon said Monday. The announcement follows word that Israel has already launched limited raids across the border into Lebanon. The additional forces would raise the total number of troops in the region to as many as 43,000. The increased presence will involve multiple fighter jet and attack aircraft squadrons, Pentagon spokeswoman Sabrina Singh told reporters. U.S. officials said the total includes small numbers of other troops to augment the presence as well. It follows recent strikes in Lebanon and the assassination of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, a significant escalation in the war in the Middle East, this time between Israel and Hezbollah. The additional personnel includes squadrons of F-15E, F-16, and F-22 fighter jets and A-10 attack aircraft, and the personnel needed to support them. The jets were supposed to rotate in and replace the squadrons already there. Instead, both the existing and new squadrons will remain in place to double the airpower on hand. On Sunday, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin announced that he was temporarily extending the USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group and its embarked air wing in the region. A U.S. official said the extension will be for about a month. A second carrier, the USS Harry S. Truman, departed Virginia last week and is enroute to Europe. It will head to the Mediterranean Sea and will again provide a two-carrier presence in the broader region. It's not expected to arrive for at least another week. At the White House, President Joe Biden said Monday that 'I’m more aware than you might know' about reports that Israel is planning a limited ground incursion into Lebanon after nearly a year of fighting with Hezbollah, and said he wants a cease-fire immediately. Asked about the reports, Biden said, 'I’m more aware than you might know, and I’m comfortable with them stopping. We should have a cease-fire now.' ___ Zeke Miller contributed from Washington.	https://apnews.com/article/us-troops-middle-east-israel-hezbollah-e37e2dbef573e33c0f8fb6a8103f27f1	2024-09-30T07:00:41-07:00	
The world’s longest-serving death row inmate acquitted in Japan mulls suing the government	TOKYO (AP) — A lawyer for the world’s longest-serving death row inmate — who was acquitted in a Japan ese retrial last week of a 1966 quadruple murder — said Tuesday that the defense team is considering filing a damage suit against the government over the fabrication of evidence that ruined the man’s life and his mental health by keeping him in prison for 48 years. Iwao Hakamada, an 88-year-old former boxer, was found not guilty last Thursday by the Shizuoka District Court which concluded that police and prosecutors collaborated in fabricating and planting evidence against him. The court said he was forced into confession by violent, hours-long closed interrogations. The acquittal made him the fifth death row inmate to be found not guilty in a retrial in postwar Japan, where prosecutors have a more than 99% conviction rate and retrials are extremely rare. Hakamada was convicted of murder in the 1966 killing of an executive and three of his family members, and setting fire to their home in central Japan. He was sentenced to death in 1968 but was not executed, due to the lengthy appeal and retrial process in Japan’s notoriously slow-paced criminal justice system. He spent more than 45 years on death row — making him the world’s longest-serving death row inmate, according to Amnesty International. Hakamada is entitled to receive compensation of up to about 200 million yen ($1.4 million) when prosecutors accept the ruling, making the acquittal final. His lawyer Hideyo Ogawa told reporters that the defense team is also considering filing a damage suit against the government because investigators and the police collaborated in fabricating evidence, despite knowing fully well that it could send the man to the gallows and that would be 'totally unforgivable.' Ogawa also demanded that a recording of the investigation process should be made mandatory in the future. Hakamada’s 91-year-old sister Hideko Hakamada said she has been trying to explain the victory to her brother but he seems still not convinced that he is now a free man. The sister, who devoted nearly half of her life to winning her brother’s innocence, said when she told him about his acquittal, as soon as she returned home, he was silent. The next morning, she showed him newspaper stories about him. 'I told him, ‘You see, it’s true, what you kept telling us really came true,’ but he seemed still skeptical,' she said, citing his mental issue and deep suspicion due to his years-long solitary confinement for the crime he was wrongfully accused. 'I will keep reminding him of his acquittal every day' until he can finally believe it. On Sunday, Hakamada, accompanied by his sister, joined his cheering supporters in a meeting in Shizuoka near his hometown of Hamamatsu, in his rare public appearance, and even made a short comment. 'Finally, I have won full and complete victory. Thank you,' Hakamada said. His sister said it was a big surprise as she thought if he could say thank you that was good enough. She says she thinks he is still not fully convinced. It took 27 years for the top court to deny his first appeal for retrial. His second appeal for a retrial was filed in 2008 by his sister, and that request was granted in 2014, when a court ruled there was evidence suggesting he was wrongfully accused. The court did not clear his conviction but released him from his solitary death-row cell, allowing him to await retrial at home because his poor health and age made him a low risk for escape. The case has since bounced along several courts until Thursday. Since his release, he seemed to be in his own imaginary world, and 'I never expected him to say such a thing,' Hideko Hakamada said, referring to his remark Sunday. 'I imagine he must have rehearsed the phrase while in prison for 48 years so he can say it when he wins acquittal one day.' The case is not fully closed for them yet because prosecutors can still technically appeal the decision, while his lawyers and human rights activists are condemning such a move and have started a petition drive. It also sparked calls from law associations and rights groups to demand a legal revision to lower hurdles for retrials. Japan and the United States are the only two countries in the Group of Seven advanced nations that retain capital punishment. In Japan, executions are carried out in secrecy and prisoners are not informed of their fate until the morning they are hanged.	https://apnews.com/article/japan-boxer-death-sentence-acquittal-87094a030d36d5800b5bd960cc0d973c	2024-09-30T06:21:59-07:00	
The Latest: Harris, Trump shift plans after Hurricane Helene's destruction	Hurricane Helene is shifting the presidential candidates’ plans this week. Democratic nominee Kamala Harris is cutting short a campaign visit to Las Vegas to return to Washington for briefings. Republican candidate Donald Trump is heading to Georgia to see the storm’s impact. Hurricane Helene’s death toll is more than 100 people and rising, with some of the worst damage caused by inland flooding in North Carolina. In addition to being humanitarian crises, natural disasters can create political tests for elected officials, particularly in the closing weeks of a presidential campaign. Presidents typically avoid racing toward disaster zones so they don’t interfere with recovery efforts. The White House said Harris would visit impacted areas 'as soon as it is possible without disrupting emergency response operations.' President Joe Biden spoke about his administration’s response to Hurricane Helene and plans to visit areas affected by the storm later this week. — Follow the AP’s Election 2024 coverage at: https://apnews.com/hub/election-2024. Here’s the latest: Trump slams US response to Helene. His own disaster-response record is marked by politics Former President Trump criticized the Biden administration’s response to the widespread devastation caused by Hurricane Helene, even as his supporters have called for cuts to federal agencies that warn of weather disasters and deliver relief to hard-hit communities. As president, Trump delayed disaster aid for hurricane-devastated Puerto Rico and diverted money from the Federal Emergency Management Agency in order to finance an effort to return undocumented migrants to Mexico. And Project 2025, backed by Trump supporters, would restructure FEMA to limit aid to states and says that the National Weather Service, which provides crucial data on hurricanes and other storms, 'should be broken up and downsized.' Read more here. Biden responds to Trump's false statements regarding the federal hurricane response President Biden criticized Trump for 'lying' about federal contacts with Georgia officials during the response to Hurricane Helene. Trump falsely claimed during a Monday tour of the damage that Biden hadn’t been in touch with the state’s Republican governor. 'He’s lying, and the governor told him he was lying.' 'I don’t know why he does this,' Biden continued. 'I don’t care about what he says about me, but I care what he what he communicates to people that are in need. He implies that we’re not doing everything possible. We are. We are.' North Carolina officials work to ensure those affected by Hurricane Helene have voting access State election officials in North Carolina are gathering information about options available to voters in the counties hardest hit by Hurricane Helene and plan a press conference for Tuesday. Karen Brinson Bell, executive director of the North Carolina State Board of Elections, said during an emergency board meeting on Monday that she will be providing more information, including details on how voters could declare 'natural disaster' as their reason for not being able to provide a photo ID. The board met Monday to approve a resolution granting counties flexibility for holding weekly meetings required under state law to review absentee ballots. These meetings are required to begin every Tuesday between now and Election Day, officials said. The resolution passed unanimously. White House pushes back against assertion by Trump that Biden has been unresponsive in aftermath of Hurricane Helene The White House on Monday pushed back against an assertion by Donald Trump that President Joe Biden has been unresponsive to Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene. Trump earlier on Monday praised Kemp for doing a 'very good job' but said he was 'having a hard time getting the president on the phone.' Trump added both Biden and the federal government are 'not being responsive' White House Karine Jean-Pierre during her daily press briefing noted that Kemp himself told reporters that he spoke to Biden on Sunday and that the president asked him what Georgia needed. The president’s homeland security adviser, Liz Sherwood-Randall, said that Biden made clear that he offered Kemp 'anything' Georgia needed for its response to the storm and remains available to the governor. 'So, if the governor would like to speak to the president again, of course, the president will take his call,' Sherwood-Randall said. Trump makes false claims about federal response while campaigning in area ravaged by Hurricane Helene Donald Trump repeatedly spread falsehoods Monday about the federal response to Hurricane Helene despite claiming not to be politicizing the disaster as he toured hard-hit areas in south Georgia. Trump criticized Vice President Kamala Harris for 'campaigning and looking for money.' He also levied attacks against the federal government for being 'non-responsive' to the disaster, claiming Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp has been struggling to get President Joe Biden on the phone. This is despite the White House announcing that Biden spoke by phone on Sunday night with Kemp. And North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper. Kemp, meanwhile, expressed appreciation on Monday for federal response to the storm. Valdosta representative says hurricane relief is non-political ATLANTA — Dexter Sharper, a Democratic state representative whose district includes most of Valdosta, didn’t journey downtown to see Trump Monday. He said he was sitting in his truck outside his powerless home, charging his cell phone while trying to coordinate ways to get hot meals to people who also lack electricity. 'To me, it’s a non-factor whether Donald Trump is here or if any of those people are here,' Sharper told the Associated Press by phone. He praised both Republican Gov. Brian Kemp and U.S. Rep. Austin Scott and Democratic U.S. Sen. Jon Ossoff for visiting Valdosta, saying they helped bring needed aid. 'I’m helping ensure that there’s going to be a bipartisan effort to help Georgia get all the funds we need so we can get back to normal,' Sharper said. 'it’s nonpolitical with us.' Georgia officials say they welcome the federal response and will work in a bipartisan way on disaster relief ATLANTA — Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp and U.S. Rep. Rick Allen, both Republicans, did not attack the federal response Monday morning at a news conference in hard-hit Augusta. 'Just know that we will work in a bipartisan way on disaster relief in this state with our federal, state and local partners,' said Kemp, who has often been the subject of attacks by Trump before the former president and Kemp recently patched things up. The two-term governor said he spoke directly to Biden on Sunday evening and has 'been playing phone tag' with Harris. 'The president just called me yesterday afternoon and I missed him and called him right back and he just said ‘Hey, what do you need?’ And I told him, you know, we’ve got what we need, we’ll work through the federal process,' Kemp said. 'He offered if there are other things we need just to call him directly, which I appreciate that. But we’ve had FEMA embedded with us since a day or two before the storm hit in our state operations center in Atlanta. We’ve got a great relationship with them.' Kemp said the state has submitted a request for an expedited emergency declaration to get federal aid for governments and individuals. Normally, the federal government doesn’t start issuing aid until state and local governments have completed damage assessments. Kemp said FEMA acknowledged the request. Allen, a five-term congressman who said a tree is 'resting' on the roof of his home after the storm, also said storm relief would be bipartisan 'This is not a Democrat or Republican issue,' said Allen, who represents the Augusta area. 'This is an American issue. This is a Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina issue.' Trump says he is going to Georgia with lots of relief material Trump says is he heading to Valdosta, Georgia, and bringing along 'lots of relief material, including fuel, equipment, water, and other things' to help those struggling in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene. Trump says in a post on his social media site that he will be joined by 'Many politicians and Law Enforcement,' including evangelist Franklin Graham, whose organization, Samaritan’s Purse, has been helping with disaster relief, and Valdosta’s mayor. He adds that he was going to stop into North Carolina, and has 'lot of supplies ready for them,' but that he is postponing that part of his trip because 'access and communication is now restricted' and so that local emergency management 'is able to focus on helping the people most affected, and not being concerned with me.' In typical Trump fashion, though, he also tried to exacerbate political fault lines, claiming, without evidence, that the federal government and the state’s Democratic governor were 'going out of their way to not help people in Republican areas.' There is no evidence that is the case. Asheville, one of the hardest-hit parts of the state, is solidly Democratic, as is the rest of Buncombe County. Trump campaign is lowering expectations ahead of Tuesday's vice presidential debate Ahead of Tuesday night’s vice presidential debate, the Trump campaign is lowering expectations that the former president’s running mate Ohio Sen. JD Vance to have a decisive performance, telling reporters in a teleconference on Monday that Walz is a seasoned politician who is nimble on the debate stage. 'Tim Walz is very good in debates, really good. He’s been a politician for nearly 20 years. He’ll be very well prepared for tomorrow night,' said Jason Miller, a senior adviser to Trump. He predicted the Democratic governor of Minnesota will be much more 'buttoned up' than he is on the campaign trail and ready to defend his record, but said, 'that’s not to say that JD Vance won’t be prepared tomorrow, or that somehow he isn’t up to the challenge.' Miller was joined on the call by Rep. Tom Emmer, R-Minn., who has been helping Vance prepare for the debate by playing Walz in debate prep sessions. Emmer said he has spent the last month reviewing all of Walz’s past debate performances, studying his mannerisms and policies, and declared that 'JD Vance is prepared to wipe the floor with Tim Walz and expose him to the radical liberal he is.' Harris recalls morning after President Biden told her he was leaving the presidential race Harris says that when President Biden called and told her he was leaving the presidential race in July, it left her with some trouble sleeping. 'Everything was in speedy, speedy motion' and 'I was not sleeping so well,' she said on an episode of the 'All the Smoke' podcast. She laughed and added, 'I like to sleep.' She recalled that, the morning after that phone call, Harris said she wasn’t able to sleep. So she got up and started marinating a pot roast for her family. 'Everybody was asleep. I just got up and started cooking,' she recalled. Harris tells podcast she has been clear about her racial identity and background Vice President Kamala Harris says she’s been clear about her racial identity and background and doesn’t listen to questions about it raised by critics, including her presidential race opponent, Republican Donald Trump. Asked about criticism about her identity on an episode of the 'All the Smoke' podcast that was released Monday, Harris responded, 'I don’t listen to it.' 'I’m really clear about who I am,' she said. 'And if anybody else is not they have to go through their own level of therapy.' Harris said she’s happy to discuss her identity more fully, but that really doing so would require an hours-long discussion about the role of race in America. 'My mother was very clear. She was raising two Black girls to be two proud Black women,' Harris said. 'And it was never a question.' Harris tells podcast ‘All the Smoke’ about the blind date where she met her husband Vice President Kamala Harris says of the infamous blind date where she met her husband, Doug Emhoff, 'I just have a really bossy best friend.' Set up by especially persuasive friends, Harris told an episode of the 'All the Smoke' podcast that was released Monday that Emhoff picked her up for the date in a BMW. He immediately divulged, 'I’m a really bad driver,' she recalled. 'I guess he was trying to create a little expectation,' Harris said. She said the pair then went to Emhoff’s favorite restaurant where people who worked there 'were like, ‘Hey Doug.’' She didn’t name the restaurant. Harris and Trump address Hurricane Helene on the campaign trail At the beginning of a rally in Las Vegas on Sunday, Harris said 'we will stand with these communities for as long as it takes to make sure that they are able to recover and rebuild.' Trump, speaking in Erie, Pa., on Sunday, described the storm as 'a big monster hurricane' that had 'hit a lot harder than anyone even thought possible.' He criticized Harris for attending weekend fundraising events in California while the storm hit. 'She ought to be down in the area where she should be,' Trump said. The White House said Harris would visit impacted areas 'as soon as it is possible without disrupting emergency response operations.' She also spoke with Gov. Roy Cooper of North Carolina, and she received a briefing from Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator Deanne Criswell while she was traveling.	https://apnews.com/article/kamala-harris-donald-trump-hurricane-helene-election-b2d906b9828f720b2a9bf0a1f92068ef	2024-09-30T05:50:28-07:00	
Top Hamas commander killed in Lebanon was UNRWA employee placed on administrative leave	GENEVA (AP) — The UN agency for Palestinian refugees said a top Hamas commander killed in Lebanon Monday was one of its employees but had been suspended since allegations of his ties to the militant group emerged in March. Fatah Sharif's connection to Hamas appeared set to ratchet up pressure on UNRWA, already facing a $80 million funding shortfall this year. Critics have repeatedly blasted the agency, saying it wasn’t doing enough to root out Hamas militants from its ranks. The U.N.’s internal watchdog has been investigating UNRWA since Israel in January accused 12 of its staffers of being involved in the Oct. 7 attack on Israel, in which armed militants killed 1,200 people and abducted some 250 others. The allegations led more than a dozen donor countries to suspend their funding, causing an initial cash crunch of about $450 million dollars. Since then, all donor countries except for the United States have decided to resume funding the agency. Hamas said Sharif was killed with his wife, son and daughter in an airstrike on Al-Buss refugee camp, one of 12 dedicated to Palestinian refugees in the country, in the southern port city of Tyre. The Israeli military confirmed it had targeted him. Sharif was not open about his affiliation with the group and its armed wing. Israel has previously alleged the UNRWA has been infiltrated by the Palestinian militant group. Israel’s diplomatic mission in Geneva posted on X saying that Hamas announced Sharif's death, 'And guess what was the second job of Mr Sharif? He was a principal, head of @UNRWA teachers association in Lebanon.' The mission added: 'This case proves that there is a deep problem in @UNRWA, the way they do due diligence about who they are hiring.' UNRWA Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini said he learned in March of allegations that Sharif had been a 'member of the political party of Hamas' and decided to suspend him and launch an investigation 'from day one.' Lazzarini said he hadn't heard Sharif might be a Hamas 'commander' until Monday. 'So he was suspended, had no function, was not paid and was under investigation,' Lazzarini told reporters in Geneva. 'We are still an agency with due process — I mean, respecting due process and the principle of rule of law. So the investigation was ongoing.' Lazzarini said he had received a letter from Israeli authorities listing the names of some 100 people allegedly linked to Hamas, and he took it 'very seriously.' But he said Israeli authorities never responded to UNRWA requests for more information so that it might launch investigations into those cases. 'A list is not proof of anything,' he said. A Hamas statement praised Sharif for his 'educational and jihadist work' and called him 'a successful teacher and an outstanding principal' for generations of Palestinian refugees. The UNRWA teachers’ union and other Palestinian groups had periodically staged protests in front of the U.N. agency's office in Beirut since Sharif’s suspension, alleging it targeted him for his political stances. Earlier this month, the union staged a sit-in during a visit to Lebanon by Lazzarini, saying it awaited 'positive and fair outcomes' in the case of his suspension. Israel has been sharply critical of UNRWA and Lazzarini's leadership of it. In July, David Mencer, a spokesman in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government, called the longtime Swiss diplomat 'one of the bad guys, a terrorist sympathizer, a Jew-killing enabler, a liar.' U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric responded by saying the comments were 'reprehensible' and threatening. UNRWA has 32,000 staff in Lebanon, Syria, Jordan and the Palestinian territories, including 13,000 in Gaza who provide education, health care, food and other services to several million Palestinians and their families. Its facilities in Gaza, where thousands of Palestinians have sought shelter, have been repeatedly attacked. Lazzarini said 223 UNRWA staffers have been killed in Gaza during the war, a toll that the United Nations says is the highest ever in a single conflict for employees of the world body. The Israeli offensive in Gaza has killed 41,615, according to the Gaza Health Ministry which doesn’t distinguish between civilians and combatants. ___ Associated Press Writer Abby Sewell in Beirut contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/lebanon-hamas-commander-killed-unwra-employee-israel-999ec22c1fef953f4f1b8b40a4c95b35	2024-09-30T05:23:28-07:00	
Analysis: Iran reluctant so far to retaliate against Israel after airstrike kills Hezbollah leader	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Iran lost its most reliable ally in the Middle East when an Israeli airstrike killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah. But Iran isn’t leading the charge to retaliate. That's put Tehran in a bind: Not responding could see it alienate the militias it relies on in the region. Meanwhile, any possible retaliation risks a wider war as its theocracy faces intense challenges at home. 'By the grace and power of God, Lebanon will make the transgressing, malicious enemy regret its actions,' Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said in the wake of Nasrallah's death Friday. But the 85-year-old paramount ruler in Iran gave no mention of his country taking action over the death of a man he once praised as 'an exceptional face in the world of Islam' after the Israel-Hezbollah war in 2006. That reluctance continued into Monday, as Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesman Nasser Kanaani told journalists that 'the Islamic Republic of Iran and the Iranian people are not after war' but rather 'peace and stability in the region.' Though Kananni added that, 'any adventurous move or action against our national security or interests and our hands will never be tied,' at one point wearing a checkered Palestinian keffiyeh scarf during his remarks. These comments highlight a reticence in responding to Nasrallah’s death. Though his leadership of Hezbollah was the crown jewel in Iran’s decades-long strategy of arming regional militias to counter both Israel and the United States, Iran remains cautious about when — or if — it will strike back. That's not to say that it hasn't launched retaliatory strikes during the yearlong Israel-Hamas war that's riven the Middle East and threatens to erupt into a regional conflict. Iran launched an unprecedented direct attack on Israel in April. It even launched a missile strike against sites in Iraq, Syria and Pakistan in January. But those attacks stemmed from direct attacks on Iranian targets, like the suspected Israeli strike on an Iranian diplomatic post in Syria. 'Iran I think in its priorities have been very much misunderstood since Oct. 8,' said Sanam Vakil, the director of the Middle East and North Africa program at the London-based international affairs think tank Chatham House. 'There was a misconception Iran would pile in.' Instead, it hung back after Hamas — another militant group it has armed — launched its Oct. 7 attack on Israel that killed 1,200 people and saw another 250 taken hostage. Even as millions of Iranians purportedly volunteered online to fight on behalf of the Palestinians, Iran didn't enter the war as an Israeli offensive devastated the Gaza Strip, killing over 41,000 people. In the time since, an increasingly emboldened Israel has attacked Hezbollah, Yemen's Houthi rebels and other groups. In marking Nasrallah's killing, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu cited a line in the Jewish Talmud fitting that strategy — 'If someone rises up to kill you, kill him first.' For Netanyahu, whose political career has revolved around the threat he perceives from Iran, that includes striking back at those Iranian allies Tehran refers to as the 'Axis of Resistance.' Those militias grew in prominence and power in the chaos that followed the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq, the 2011 Arab Spring and the rise of Yemen's Houthi rebels. That created what Iran's opponents feared would become a 'Shiite crescent' of influence that Tehran would be able to wield, something Israel may be aiming to roll back. 'An increasingly emboldened Israel appears to be considering a more expansive plan to confront Iran across the Middle East with the ambition of creating a new regional order,' said Julien Barnes-Dacey, the director of the Middle East and North Africa program at the European Council on Foreign Relations. 'This is a dangerous illusion. Despite Iran’s current weakness, this will be seen as an existential threat by Tehran and its regional allies.' Iran could encourage more asymmetric attacks, targeting Jewish tourists, synagogues or Israeli diplomatic missions as it has done in the past. Netanyahu issued a warning Monday to Iran likely over that risk, saying: 'There is nowhere in the Middle East Israel cannot reach.' Tehran also could weaponize its nuclear program. It already enriches uranium to near-weapons-grade levels after the collapse of its 2015 nuclear deal with world powers. Hard-line voices within Iran's theocracy, like its daily Kahyan newspaper, already are calling for a response 'harsher' than its April attack, which caused very little damage. That, however, runs directly counter to the plans of Iran's new reformist President Masoud Pezeshkian, who campaigned on a promise to get crushing economic sanctions lifted against Iran. That's grown in importance as energy prices continue to fall and Iran likely sells its oil at a discount due to being locked out of many nations. If nuclear deal 'commitments are implemented fully and in good faith, dialogue on other issues can follow,' Pezeshkian told the United Nations General Assembly last week. Ending the sanctions requires a deal with the West on the nuclear program, something that will become nearly impossible if Iran enters an all-out war with Israel. Relieving that economic pressure remains crucial for Iran's domestic stability as well, as authorities remember the months of protests that followed the 2022 death of Mahsa Amini. 'For the time being it appears the president and the supreme leader, the latter who is abundantly cautious, want to keep the line open to dialogue and negotiations,' Vakil said. And to keep that line open, Iran needs someone else to take the lead against Israel. 'Tehran apparently is content to allow Hezbollah to respond to the Nasrallah killing on its own, and perhaps in concert with the Houthi movement in Yemen, which has recently begun firing some of their Iran-supplied missiles against Israel,' the New York-based Soufan Center security think tank said Monday. ___ EDITOR’S NOTE — Jon Gambrell, the news director for the Gulf and Iran for The Associated Press, has reported from each of the Gulf Cooperation Council countries, Iran and other locations across the world since joining the AP in 2006.	https://apnews.com/article/iran-israel-mideast-tensions-hezbollah-lebanon-analysis-5020aeed3c88790d5483fdf40c9ba392	2024-09-30T05:13:09-07:00	
81-year-old South Korean falls short in a bid to become oldest Miss Universe contestant	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — An 81-year-old model fell short in her bid to become the oldest Miss Universe contestant after competing in the South Korean pageant against much younger rivals. Dressed in a beaded white gown, the silver-haired Choi Soon-hwa strutted across the stage and performed in a singing contest at the Miss Universe Korea pageant held Monday at a hotel in South Korea’s capital, Seoul. She missed out on the crown but did take home the 'best dresser' award. Han Ariel, a 22-year-old fashion school student, won the contest and will head to Mexico City for the Miss Universe pageant in November. Choi, a former hospital care worker who began her modeling career in her 70s, was announced as a Miss Universe Korea finalist earlier this month along with 31 other contestants. 'Even at this age, I had the courage to grab onto an opportunity and take on a challenge,' Choi told The Associated Press hours before Monday's pageant. 'I want people to look at me and realize that you can live healthier and find joy in life when you find things you want to do and challenge yourself to achieve that dream.' It would have been impossible for Choi to compete in the pageant a year ago as Miss Universe had limited the participation to women between 18 and 28. The age limit, which had long drawn criticism, was lifted this year ato make the competition more modern and diverse. Organizers of the Korean pageant also removed the swimsuit competition and eligibility requirements related to education, height and foreign language abilities to open the contest to more women.	https://apnews.com/article/korea-beauty-contestant-81-years-miss-universe-c7da720e54e8b006e2c48359ad7f3e44	2024-09-30T05:10:49-07:00	
NYC Mayor Eric Adams accepted harmless 'courtesies,' not bribes, his lawyer says	NEW YORK (AP) — New York City Mayor Eric Adams launched a legal attack on the federal corruption case against him Monday, with his attorney asking a judge to toss out bribery charges and then holding a combative news conference accusing prosecutors of ethical lapses. Adams, a Democrat, pleaded not guilty Friday to charges that he accepted lavish travel benefits and illegal campaign contributions from a Turkish official and other foreign nationals, and in return performed favors including pushing through the opening of a Turkish consulate building. The mayor’s attorneys said in a motion filed early Monday that the cheap flights to overseas destinations, seat upgrades, free meals and free hotel rooms he got were not bribes, as that crime has been defined by federal law. 'Congressmen get upgrades, they get corner suites, they get better tables at restaurants, they get free appetizers, they have their iced tea filled up,' his attorney, Alex Spiro, said at a subsequent news conference. 'Courtesies to politicians are not federal crimes.' While not disputing that Adams accepted flight upgrades and deeply-discounted or free travel, Spiro said his client had never promised to take action on behalf of the Turkish government in exchange for the perks, which prosecutors say were worth more than $100,000. 'There was no quid pro quo. There was no this for that,' Spiro said. The mayor has vowed to continue serving while fighting the charges, which he has suggested — without providing evidence — are politically motivated. On top of the case against Adams, federal prosecutors are believed to be leading separate ongoing investigations into several top city officials with deep ties to the mayor. The drumbeat of searches and subpoenas in recent weeks has prompted the resignation of the city’s police commissioner and schools chancellor, along with some calls for the mayor to resign. Gov. Kathy Hochul, a fellow Democrat who has the power to remove Adams from office, told reporters Monday that she had spoken to the mayor about 'what my expectations are' but also indicated she wasn't ready to give up on his administration. 'I am giving the mayor an opportunity now to demonstrate to New Yorkers — and to me — that we are righting the ship, that we have the opportunity to instill the confidence that I think is wavering right now and to power forward with an effective government,' she said. U.S. Attorney Damian Williams, whose office brought the case, has said that politics played no role. At a news conference on an unrelated topic Monday, Williams declined to comment on Spiro's remarks, saying prosecutors would speak through its court filings going forward. Prosecutors say Adams accepted at least seven free and steeply discounted flights, along with luxury hotel stays, high-end meals, entertainment and illegal foreign donations, from a Turkish official and others seeking to buy his influence. In September 2021, the official sought to cash in on the favors by asking Adams to expedite the opening of the 36-story Manhattan consulate building, which fire safety inspectors said was not safe to occupy, ahead of an important state visit by the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, according to the indictment. Adams then sent a series of text messages to the fire commissioner pushing for him to open the building — something that Spiro also did not dispute. At the time, Adams was still serving as Brooklyn borough president, a largely ceremonial position, but had already won the mayoral primary and was widely expected to become mayor. Prosecutors said Adams did not disclose most of the free or heavily discounted trips he took while borough president, as required by city conflict-of-interest laws. At the news conference, Spiro initially said Adams was not legally obligated to disclose any of the trips or upgrades, but later acknowledged — after reporters noted city rules that required some types of gifts and travel perks to be reported — that he was not an expert in the city’s conflict-of-interest law. Defense attorneys claim the additional charges against Adams — that he solicited and accepted foreign donations and manipulated the city’s matching funds program — would soon be revealed as 'equally meritless.' They said a former Adams staffer had lied to prosecutors to make it seem like the mayor had firsthand knowledge of the illegal donations. 'Eventually New Yorkers, being New Yorkers, are going to wise up to all this,' Spiro said. Adams is due back in court Wednesday for a conference.	https://apnews.com/article/nyc-mayor-eric-adams-3613e485989f57a4c1eaf8643fe57cac	2024-09-30T04:21:36-07:00	
Russia targets 11 Ukrainian regions as it steps up its drone attacks	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Russia fired missiles and drones at 11 regions of Ukraine, the Ukrainian air force said Monday, in a 33rd consecutive night of aerial attacks behind the front line and set a new monthly record of drone barrages. In Kyiv, multiple explosions and machine gun fire could be heard throughout the night as the Ukrainian capital’s air defenses fought off a drone attack for five hours. No casualties were reported in Kyiv or elsewhere, though a 'critical infrastructure object' caught fire in the southern Mykolaiv region, Gov. Vitalii Kim said, without elaborating. Russia has increasingly deployed Shahed drones, rather than more expensive missiles, in its aerial bombardment of Ukrainian cities since its full-scale invasion of its neighbor in February 2022. It launched more than 1,300 Shahed drones at Ukraine in September alone — the highest number of drone attacks in a single month since the war began. Ukraine, too, has developed a new generation of drones for the battlefield and for long-range strikes deep inside Russia. More than 100 Ukrainian drones were shot down over Russia on Sunday, Russian officials said. Also Monday, Russian President Vladimir Putin released a video marking the second anniversary of the annexation of four Ukrainian territories and again accused the West of turning Ukraine into 'a military base aimed at Russia.' Putin was speaking to mark the annexation of the Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions of Ukraine after a referendum held in 2022 which was denounced by the West as a sham. Russia also illegally annexed Crimea in 2014. Since 2022, Putin said, businesses in the occupied areas are being 'actively restored' and hospitals and schools are being rebuilt. Thousands of Ukrainians fled from the four regions as a result of Russia’s invasion, but Putin said Russia’s military operation in the country was to defend residents’ 'well-being' and the 'future for our children and grandchildren.' ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-drones-missiles-attack-kyiv-b971c84a5a303f7d6849de0b303c8244	2024-09-30T02:04:41-07:00

Hezbollah's acting leader vows to fight on after Nasrallah's death	BEIRUT (AP) — Hezbollah's acting leader vowed Monday to continue battling Israel and said the militant group was prepared for a long fight even after much of its top command was wiped out, including its leader, Hassan Nasrallah. Israeli strikes have killed Nasrallah and six of his top commanders and officials in the last 10 days, and have hit what the military says are thousands of militant targets across large parts of Lebanon. Over 1,000 people have been killed in Lebanon in the past two weeks, nearly a quarter of them women and children, according to the Health Ministry. Early Monday, an airstrike hit a residential building, wiping out one apartment, damaging others, and killing three Palestinian militants in central Beirut, as Israel appeared to send a clear message that no part of Lebanon is out of bounds. Despite the heavy blow Hezbollah has suffered in recent weeks, acting leader Naim Kassem said in a televised statement that if Israel decides to launch a ground offensive, the group's fighters are ready — noting that the commanders killed have already been replaced. 'Israel was not able to affect our (military) capabilities,' Kassem said in his first speech since Nasrallah was killed. 'There are deputy commanders and there are replacements in case a commander is wounded in any post.' He added that Hezbollah anticipated 'the battle could be long.' A founding member of Hezbollah who had been Nasrallah’s longtime deputy, Kassem will remain in his acting position until the group’s leadership elects a replacement. The man widely expected to take over the top post is Hashem Safieddine, a cousin of Nasrallah who oversees the group’s political affairs. Hezbollah has significantly increased its rocket attacks in the past week to several hundred daily, but most have been intercepted or fallen in open areas. Several people have been wounded in Israel. There have been no fatalities since two soldiers were killed near the border on Sept. 19. But Hezbollah’s capabilities remain unclear. As recently as two weeks ago, a strike like Monday's in central Beirut — outside of the main areas where Hezbollah operates and next to a busy transportation hub normally crowded with buses, taxis and vans — would have been seen as a major escalation and likely followed by a long-range Hezbollah strike into Israel. But the unspoken rules of the long-running conflict are no longer clear. It's possible that Hezbollah is holding back to save resources for a bigger battle, including a threatened Israeli ground invasion. But the militant group might also be in disarray after Israeli intelligence apparently penetrated its highest levels. In the past week, Israel has frequently targeted Beirut’s southern suburbs, where Hezbollah has a strong presence — including the massive strike on Friday that killed Nasrallah — but had not hit locations closer to the city center. The strike early Monday killed three members of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, a small, leftist faction that has not been meaningfully involved in months of fighting between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon. Israel has not claimed the strike but is widely assumed to have carried it out. Also Monday, Hamas announced that its top commander in Lebanon, Fatah Sharif, was killed with his family in an airstrike on the Al-Buss refugee camp in the southern port city of Tyre. The Israeli military confirmed that it had targeted him. Hezbollah began firing rockets, drones and missiles into northern Israel after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack from Gaza into Israel sparked the war there. Hezbollah and Hamas are allies and both supported by Iran, and Hezbollah said it would continue the attacks in solidarity with the Palestinians until there was a cease-fire in Gaza. Israel has responded to the rockets with airstrikes in Lebanon, where Hezbollah is based, and the fighting has steadily escalated over the past year. The Lebanese government says the fighting may have displaced up to a million people, although the U.N. estimate is around 200,000. Tens of thousands of Israelis have also been displaced. Israel has vowed to keep fighting until the attacks stop and its citizens can return to their homes. The United States and its allies have called for a cease-fire, hoping to avoid further escalation that could draw in Iran and set off a wider war. But Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has shown little interest, as his country racks up military achievements against a longtime foe. Some Israelis broke into spontaneous celebrations after Nasrallah’s death was announced. Videos circulated of crowds at bars singing a song in Hebrew mocking him. A news anchor on a pro-Netanyahu station sang and danced as the studio audience joined in with him while a commentator on Israel’s largest TV station offered co-panelists celebratory shots. Hezbollah, which boasts tens of thousands of battle-hardened fighters and long-range missiles capable of hitting anywhere inside Israel, has long been seen as the most powerful militant group in the region and a key partner to Iran in both threatening and deterring Israel. Hezbollah fought Israel to a monthlong stalemate in their 2006 war, But Hezbollah has never faced an onslaught quite like this one, which began with a sophisticated attack on its pagers and walkie-talkies in mid-September that killed dozens of people and wounded around 3,000 — including many fighters but also many civilians. White House national security spokesman John Kirby said Israel's airstrikes in Lebanon had 'wiped out' Hezbollah’s command structure but warned that the group will work quickly to rebuild it. 'We’re watching to see what they do to try to fill this leadership vacuum. It’s going to be tough,' he told CNN’s 'State of the Union' on Sunday. ___ Melzer reported from Tel Aviv, Israel.

Britain's last coal-fired electricity plant is closing. It ends 142 years of coal power in the UK	LONDON (AP) — Britain’s last coal-fired power plant is closing on Monday, ending 142 years of coal-generated electricity in the nation that sparked the Industrial Revolution. The Ratcliffe-on-Soar station in central England is finishing its final shift at midnight after more than half a century of turning coal into power. The U.K. government hailed the closure as a milestone in efforts to generate all of Britain’s energy from renewable sources by 2030. Plant manager Peter O’Grady said it was 'an emotional day.' 'When I started my career 36 years ago, none of us imaged a future without coal generation in our lifetimes,' he said. The shutdown makes Britain the first country from the Group of Seven major economies to phase out coal — though some other European nations, including Sweden and Belgium, got there sooner. Owner Uniper says many of the 170 remaining employees will stay on during a two-year decommissioning process. Energy Minister Michael Shanks said the plant’s closure 'marks the end of an era and coal workers can be rightly proud of their work powering our country for over 140 years. We owe generations a debt of gratitude as a country.' 'The era of coal might be ending, but a new age of good energy jobs for our country is just beginning,' he said. The world’s first coal-fired electricity plant, Thomas Edison’s Edison Electric Light Station, opened in London in 1882. Ratcliffe-on-Soar, which opened in 1967, is a landmark whose eight concrete cooling towers and 199-meter (650-foot) chimney are seen by millions of people a year as they drive past on the M1 highway or speed by on trains. In 1990 coal provided about 80% of Britain’s electricity. By 2012 it had fallen to 39%, and by 2023 it stood at just 1%, according to figures from the National Grid. More than half of Britain’s electricity now comes from renewable sources such as wind and solar power, and the rest from natural gas and nuclear energy. 'Ten years ago, coal was the leading source of this country’s power — generating a third of our electricity,' said Dhara Vyas, deputy chief executive of trade body Energy U.K. 'So, to get to this point just a decade later, with coal’s contribution replaced by clean and low carbon sources, is an incredible achievement,' Vyas said. 'As we aim for further ambitious targets in the energy transition, it’s worth remembering that few back then thought such a change at such a pace was possible.' Coal has fueled civil strife as well as powering the country. Tens of thousands of miners walked out in 1984 over plans by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher’s Conservative government to close more than 20 coal pits. The strike lasted a year, divided communities and saw widespread violence as police clashed with pickets. The miners’ eventual defeat helped break the power of Britain’s trade unions and hasten the end of the mining industry and the communities that relied on it. Coal remains a combustible issue. Plans to open Britain’s first new coal mine in 30 years in northwest England divided residents, with some welcoming the promise of well-paid jobs and others opposing the pollution and carbon emissions it would bring. On Sept. 13 the High Court struck down planning permission for the mine that had been granted by the previous Conservative government in 2022. Another chapter in Britain’s carbon-burning industrial heritage ends Monday with the closure of the last blast furnace at one of the world’s biggest steelworks, in Port Talbot, Wales. Almost 2,000 jobs are being lost with the shutdown at the plant, owned by India’s Tata Steel. Tata plans to replace the blast furnace, which runs on the coal derivative coke, with a cleaner electric furnace that will emit less carbon and require fewer workers. At its 1960s peak, more than 18,000 people were employed at the Port Talbot steelworks, before cheaper offerings from China and other countries hit production. Roy Rickhuss, general secretary of the Community union, said the closure 'marks the end of an era, but this is not the end for Port Talbot.' 'We will never stop fighting for our steel industry and our communities in South Wales,' he said.	https://apnews.com/article/uk-last-coal-power-station-closing-9e6b792f27513e3b02904da1eaedfbf3	2024-09-29T23:12:03-07:00	
Japan's likely next leader says he will call an election for Oct. 27 once he takes office	TOKYO (AP) — Shigeru Ishiba, the head of Japan's governing party, plans to call a parliamentary election to be held on Oct. 27 after he is elected as prime minister on Tuesday. Ishiba was chosen as the Liberal Democratic Party's leader on Friday and is assured to also succeed Fumio Kishida as prime minister because the party's coalition controls parliament. Ishiba mentioned the election date as he announced his top party leadership lineup Monday ahead of forming his Cabinet. The plan is not official since he is not prime minister yet, but Ishiba said he mentioned the date early for the logistical convenience of those who have to prepare on relatively short notice. 'I believe it is important to have the new administration get the public's judgment as soon as possible,' Ishiba said. He appointed former Environment Minister Shinjiro Koizumi, who came in third in the party leadership race, to head the party's election task force. He is expected to name defense experts and his longtime confidantes Takeshi Iwaya as foreign minister and Gen Nakatani as defense chief once he takes office. Ishiba has proposed an Asian version of the NATO military alliance and more discussion among regional partners about the use of the U.S. nuclear deterrence. He also suggested a more equal Japan-U.S. security alliance, including joint management of U.S. bases in Japan and having Japanese Self Defense Force bases in the United States. The LDP has had a nearly unbroken tenure governing Japan since World War II. The party members may have seen Ishiba’s more centrist views as crucial in pushing back challenges by the liberal-leaning opposition and winning voter support as the party reels from corruption scandals that drove down Kishida's popularity. Ishiba on Friday stressed Japan needs to reinforce its security, noting recent violations of Japanese airspace by Russian and Chinese warplanes and repeated missile launches by North Korea. He pledged to continue Kishida’s economic policy aimed at pulling Japan out of deflation and achieving real salary increases, while tackling challenges such as Japan’s declining birthrate and population and resilience to natural disasters.

He says he plans to call a snap election for Oct. 27. Kishida’s popularity ratings were precarious during most of his three-year term due to damaging corruption scandals that eventually led him to bow out. At home, Kishida was seen as a leader without a vision who compromised with powerful conservative nationalists within the ruling Liberal Democratic Party to stay in power. But he has won respect outside Japan, especially from the United States, for pushing bold changes in Japanese defense and security policies and for standing tougher against Russia and China. Here is a lookback at Kishida’s leadership and his legacy: Distress at home After taking office in October 2021, Kishida made a number of major decisions, such as reversing Japan’s nuclear energy phase-out and pursuing a rapid military buildup. But he avoided controversial social issues related to gender and sexual diversity. As head of a smaller faction in the ruling party, his top priority appeared to be keeping a stable grip on power by avoiding clashes with members of the Liberal Democrats' powerful conservative group, led by the late Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. Abe’s assassination in July 2022 and subsequent major corruption scandals linked to Abe’s faction members left constantly in damage control mode, as his support ratings tumbled. Kishida himself narrowly escaped an explosives attack during a speech at a fishing port in western Japan's Wakayama in April, 2023. Investigations into Abe’s assassination led to revelations of the Liberal Democrats' decades-long links to South Korea's Unification Church. That was followed by a more damaging corruption scandal involving more than 80 LDP lawmakers, again mostly in Abe's faction, involving illegal slush funds. Several lawmakers, their aides and accountants were indicted in that scandal. Kishida led internal probes and moved to reform and tighten political funding laws, but opposition lawmakers and voters viewed the measures as inadequate. Public outrage over the slush funds scandal has caused the LDP to lose a few local elections this year and lawmakers within the party called for a fresh face to shake off the scandals in order to win the next national election. Kishida ends his term as a kingmaker who could remain influential behind the scenes after he helped lift Ishiba to a come-from-behind victory in the party's vote on Friday against staunch conservative Sanae Takaichi. Stronger defense Kishida, who long served as foreign minister under Abe, has won respect for his national security and foreign policies that significantly deepened ties with the United States and other partners such as Australia, the U.K., South Korea and the Philippines, while elevating the country’s international profile. In December 2022, Kishida’s government adopted a security and defense strategy involving a rapid buildup of Japan’s military power to acquire a 'counter-strike' capability with long-range cruise missiles, a major break from Japan’s post-World War II self-defense-only principle. Kishida’s government set a five-year goal to double Japan’s military spending to nearly 2% of GDP, eventually to about 10 trillion yen ($70 billion), making it the world’s third biggest spender after the United States and China. But it's unclear how Japan will fund that spending and balance it against other urgent needs such as coping with the country's shrinking population. In December, Kishida substantially eased Japan’s weapons export rules, allowing licensing of Japanese-made PAC-3 missile interceptors to the United States and future foreign sales of fighter jets that Japan is developing with the U.K. and Italy. Kishida quickly joined other G7 countries in sanctioning Russia and supporting Ukraine. He has repeatedly said 'Ukraine today may be East Asia tomorrow,' comparing the Russian invasion of Ukraine to China’s growing assertiveness in the Asia-Pacific region. He has worked on strengthening economic and security cooperation in the region. 'Although Kishida’s successes on foreign affairs were overshadowed by domestic political scandals involving his Liberal Democratic Party, as well as lackluster economic growth, he oversaw increases in Japan’s reputation and popularity in the region and globally, as well as the institutionalization of related partnership gains,' Mirna Galic, a senior policy analyst at the U.S. Institute of Peace, wrote in a recent article. Better ties with South Korea One of Kishida's diplomatic successes was Japan’s improved ties with South Korea, especially in regional security and in ties with their mutual ally, the United Sates, due to shared concerns about China and North Korea. Kishida, under pressure from Washington and with support from South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol, helped mend ties between the two Asian neighbors that have suffered over Japan’s colonial-era legacy of colonialism and atrocities. Stable relations are key to the U.S.-led united front in the Pacific. In April, Kishida made a state visit to Washington and spoke to Congress, stressing Japan's determination to stand by America as a global partner. In 2023, President Joe Biden invited him to a trilateral summit at Camp David with Yoon where they agreed to strengthen their trilateral security framework. When Kishida announced in August his plans to step down, Biden lauded Kishida’s leadership, saying he had helped take the U.S.-Japan alliance 'to new heights.' 'Guided by unflinching courage and moral clarity, Prime Minister Kishida has transformed Japan’s role in the world,' Biden said in a statement. Kishida’s 'courageous leadership will be remembered on both sides of the Pacific for decades to come,' he said. Kishida also recently helped work out a deal with Beijing to lift a Chinese ban on imports of Japanese seafood that Beijing imposed due to Japan's release of treated radioactive wastewater into the Pacific from its wrecked Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. Tensions over China's military activity near Japanese water and airspace persist. He also deepened ties with Southeast Asian countries, the Pacific Island nations as well as so-called Global South developing countries. G7 Hiroshima and nuclear disarmament Kishida represents a constituency in Hiroshima and hosting a summit of the Group of Seven wealthy nations in the city in May 2023 was a highlight of his time in office aligned with his career goal of working toward a world free of nuclear weapons. However, the G7 summit statement on nuclear disarmament defended the possession of nuclear weapons as a deterrence, disappointing and angering survivors of the U.S. 1945 atomic bomb attack. Kishida says he adheres to Japan’s principles of not developing, possessing or allowing the deployment of nuclear weapons in its territory. Ishiba, a former defense minister, has advocated deepening a discussion among regional partners about the U.S. nuclear deterrence strategy. 'New Capitalism' never took off Kishida espoused a 'new capitalism' economic strategy calling for more equitable distribution of national wealth, an alternative to Abe's heavy government spending and hyper-easy monetary policy. Neither policy has managed to get flagging growth back on track. Kishida’s defense and childcare policies would require big spending and the wage hikes he supported failed to keep pace with price increases. Government moves to try to reverse Japan’s falling birth rate involved mostly childcare allowances for married couples and didn't address the problems of the growing number of young Japanese reluctant to marry and start families due to bleak job prospects, the high cost of living and a corporate culture that is unfriendly to working mothers.	https://apnews.com/article/japan-us-kishida-security-05926b50f4f5a83a631f779d906cf06d	2024-09-29T21:49:36-07:00	
Israel-Hamas war latest: Israeli strike hits apartment building in central Beirut	An Israeli airstrike hit an apartment in a multistory building in central Beirut, killing three Palestinian militants, as Hezbollah's acting leader promised the group will fight on following the death of its long-time head Hassan Nasrallah. The early Monday airstrike — the first to hit central Beirut in nearly a year of conflict — killed three members of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, a small, leftist faction. Videos showed ambulances and a crowd gathered near the building in a mainly Sunni district with a busy thoroughfare lined with shops. Separately, an Israeli airstrike early Monday killed six people, including two sisters and a child, in central Gaza, Palestinian officials said. In the past week, Israel has frequently targeted Beirut’s southern suburbs, where Hezbollah has a strong presence — including a major strike on Friday that killed Nasrallah — but had not hit locations near the city center. Hezbollah's acting leader Naim Kassem said in a televised statement that if Israel decides to launch a ground offensive, the group’s fighters are ready — noting that the commanders killed have already been replaced. The Lebanese Health Ministry said at least 105 people were killed around the country in airstrikes on Sunday. Two strikes near the southern city of Sidon, about 45 kilometers (28 miles) south of Beirut, killed at least 32 people, the ministry said. Separately, Israeli strikes in the northern province of Baalbek Hermel killed 21 people and wounded at least 47. Lebanese media reported dozens of strikes in the central, eastern and western Bekaa and in the south, besides strikes on Beirut. Israel says it targets militants, but the strikes have hit buildings where civilians were living and the death toll was expected to rise. ___ Here is the latest: A Lebanese army soldier injured in an airstrike BEIRUT — A Lebanese army soldier suffered moderate injuries Monday when a motorcycle was targeted by an Israeli airstrike as it crossed an army checkpoint in the southern area of Wazzani, a Lebanese security official said. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he wasn't authorized to speak to reporters, said that at least 11 Lebanese army soldiers have been killed and 20 injured — most of them off duty and in their homes — since the escalating conflict between Israel and Hezbollah began nearly a year ago. The Lebanese army, which has a limited arsenal and has been struggling to maintain its forces and equipment due to a protracted economic crisis, has so far stood on the sidelines in the fighting. It is not clear how the army would react if Israel launched a threatened ground invasion into Lebanon. — By Abby Sewell Israeli defense minister hints at possible ground offensive in Lebanon TEL AVIV — Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant on Monday hinted at Israeli preparations for a ground offensive in Lebanon. Speaking to troops of the 188 Armored brigade and the Golani Infantry brigade on the northern border, Gallant said, 'The elimination of Nasrallah is a very important step, but it is not everything. We will use all the capabilities we have.' He added, 'If someone on the other side did not understand what the capabilities mean, it is all capabilities, and you are part of this effort.' Israeli airstrike kills 6 people, including 2 sisters and a child, in Gaza DEIR -AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — Palestinian medical officials say an Israeli airstrike killed six people, including two sisters and a child, in central Gaza. The strike early Monday hit a family home in the urban Nuseirat refugee camp, according to the Awda hospital, where the casualties were taken. The dead include a man, his two daughters and a grandchild, according to the hospital records. Earlier on Monday, an Israeli strike hit a house in the central town of Deir al-Balah, killing two children and their parents. Israel says it only targets militants and blames civilian casualties on Hamas because the militant group operates in residential areas. The military rarely comments on individual strikes, which often kill women and children. Gaza’s Health Ministry says at least 41,615 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since the start of the war. It does not distinguish between militants and civilians but says women and children make up a little more than half of the fatalities. The war began on Oct. 7, when Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israel, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians. Yemen’s Houthi rebels claim shooting down another US-made MQ-9 Reaper drone DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Yemen’s Houthi rebels claim they shot down another American-made MQ-9 Reaper drone over the country, with videos purportedly showing a surface-to-air missile striking it. The U.S. military did not immediately acknowledge losing any aircraft. The claimed attack comes as the one-year anniversary of the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip approaches. The Houthis have targeted ships traveling through the Red Sea over the war as U.S.-led airstrikes pound their positions in Yemen. That’s imperiled a waterway that typically sees $1 trillion of trade pass through it, as well as crucial shipments of aid to war-torn Sudan and Yemen. The Houthis also continue to launch missiles targeting Israel, drawing retaliatory airstrikes from the Israelis this weekend on the port city of Hodeida. The Houthi-run broadcaster Al-Masirah claimed shooting down the MQ-9, hours after video footage circulated online showing the purported missile striking the aircraft over Yemen’s Saada province. A single image online also appeared to show wreckage of the drone, with pieces resembling that of an MQ-9. Hezbollah’s deputy leader vows to fight on after Nasrallah’s death BEIRUT — Hezbollah’s deputy leader vowed to continue fighting Israel and said the militant group was prepared for a long war after much of its top command was wiped out, including its leader, Hassan Nasrallah. In his first speech since Nasrallah was killed, Naim Kassem said in a televised statement Monday that if Israel decides to launch a ground offensive, Hezbollah fighters are ready to fight and defend Lebanon. As deputy secretary-general, Naim Kassem now is the acting leader of Hezbollah until a replacement for Nasrallah is chosen. Kassem added that despite the killing of Hezbollah’s top military commanders over the past months, Hezbollah is relying on new commanders. 'Israel was not able to affect our (military) capabilities,' Kassem said. 'There are deputy commanders and there are replacements in case a commander is wounded in any post.' France delivers 12 tons of medical aid to Lebanon PARIS — France has delivered 12 tons of medical aid to Lebanon, including two mobile clinics that will be able to treat 1,000 seriously injured people currently in hospitals’ emergency wards across the country, according to a statement from the French Foreign Ministry on Monday. French military aircraft also delivered critical supplies of medicine to Lebanese emergency, pediatric and general hospitals and clinics, which have been overwhelmed with thousands of injured people since Israel’s bombardment of the country began over a week ago. During his visit to Beirut on Monday, France’s Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot said that Paris is also releasing 10 million euros ($11.1 million) in emergency humanitarian aid to support the work of local humanitarian organizations, particularly the Lebanese Red Cross. 'In the face of the escalating conflict between Israel and Hezbollah, France stands by Lebanon and remains committed to protecting civilians,' the statement said. Barrot is scheduled to meet with Lebanese leaders on Monday, including with Prime Minister Najib Mikati, Army chief Joseph Aoun and Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri. Lebanon asks those who lost relatives in recent airstrikes for DNA samples to match with unidentified remains BEIRUT — Lebanese officials have asked people who lost relatives in recent Israeli airstrikes to provide DNA samples to match with unidentified remains. Lebanon’s Internal Security Forces on Monday called on residents across the country to visit police stations with an identity card to give their samples. It said more than one person from each family should provide a sample, if possible. A wave of Israeli airstrikes across large parts of Lebanon have killed more than 1,030 people — including 156 women and 87 children — in less than two weeks, according to Lebanon’s Health Ministry. Satellite images show site of Israeli airstrike that killed Hezbollah leader DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Satellite images analyzed by The Associated Press show the site of the Israeli airstrike that killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah. The images, taken Sunday by Planet Labs PBC, show the site just some 2 kilometers (1.25 miles) northeast of Beirut’s Rafik Hariri International Airport. The images show multi-story buildings at the site now cratered in the densely populated predominantly Shiite southern Beirut suburb known as Dahiyeh. Israel said the Friday night strike targeted a meeting at an underground Hezbollah compound located beneath the towers and at least one empty lot at the site. Israeli airstrike kills family of 4 in central Gaza DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — Palestinian officials say an Israeli airstrike early Monday killed a family of four in central Gaza. The strike hit a house in the central town of Deir al-Balah, according to the al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital, which received the bodies. The dead included two children and their parents, according to hospital records. An Associated Press reporter counted the bodies at the hospital morgue. Israel says it only targets militants and accuses Hamas fighters of hiding among civilians, putting them in danger. It rarely comments on individual strikes, which often kill women and children. The war began on Oct. 7, when Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israel, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians. Hamas says one of its commanders was killed in an Israeli airstrike in Lebanon BEIRUT — The Palestinian militant group Hamas says one of its commanders has been killed in an Israeli airstrike in Lebanon. Fatah Sharif was killed early Monday in an airstrike on the Al-Buss refugee camp in the southern port city of Tyre, the group said in a statement. His wife, son and daughter were also killed in the strike, it said. Sharif was a commander in Lebanon and a member of Hamas’ command outside the Palestinian territories, Hamas said. Since the Israel-Hamas war began on Oct. 7, Israeli airstrikes have killed several Hamas officials in Lebanon.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hezbollah-hamas-latest-mideast-30-september-2024-0413c24b727837f295ada1e81642edfc	2024-09-29T21:13:01-07:00	
Wildfire burning through forest in southern Greece kills 2 people	ATHENS, Greece (AP) — Two people died overnight in a large wildfire burning through forestland in Greece near a seaside resort in the country's south, authorities said Monday. The fire service said about 350 firefighters, assisted by 18 water-dropping aircraft, were battling the blaze near Xylokastro in the Peloponnese region. While the initial large front was put out, scattered flare-ups continued to burn, forcing evacuation orders for three villages on Monday. Earlier, half a dozen villages were ordered evacuated overnight as a precaution after the blaze broke out on Sunday. There was no threat to Xylokastro. The flames were fanned by very strong winds blowing through forests left tinder-dry by a warm spring and hot summer, attributed to climate change. Civil protection officials warned that several parts of the country, including Rhodes and other southeastern Aegean Sea islands, would face a high risk of wildfires Tuesday. Authorities said the two dead men were believed to be residents who were declared missing late Sunday. No one else was reported missing. There were no immediate reports of burned homes in the affected area, located some 150 kilometers (93 miles) southwest of Greece's capital, Athens. Firefighters assisted by five water-dropping aircraft were also battling a forest fire that broke out Monday farther south, near Xerokambi in the central Peloponnese. Another wildfire near Andravida, in the western Peloponnese, was also brought under control on Monday, but firefighters remained on alert. Greece, like other southern European countries, is plagued by destructive wildfires every summer that have been exacerbated by global warming. Over the past few months, authorities have had to cope with more than 4,500 wildfires in countryside left parched by a protracted drought and early summer heatwaves, in what was considered the most dangerous fire season in two decades. A big investment in extra water-bombing aircraft, warning drones and other equipment have enabled firefighters to extinguished most blazes shortly after they broke out. However, in August, a ferocious wildfire swept through the mountains north of Athens, destroying scores of homes and killing one person. Still, authorities say this summer's expanses that have been burned are about 25% less in size than the annual average of the past 20 years.	https://apnews.com/article/greece-wildfire-deaths-xylokastro-a41a28d995f3f70a5d4a159d30845315	2024-09-29T20:52:53-07:00	
France's Le Pen denies wrongdoing as she and her party go on trial accused of embezzling EU funds	PARIS (AP) — French far-right leader Marine Le Pen denied violating any rules as she and her National Rally party and two dozen others went on trial on Monday, accused of embezzling European Parliament funds, in a case that has the potential to derail her political ambitions. Arriving at the court in Paris, Le Pen said 'we have not violated any political and regulatory rules of the European Parliament' and vowed to present 'extremely serious and extremely solid arguments″ in the trial.' The nine-week trial will be closely watched by Le Pen’s political rivals as she is a strong contender in the race to succeed Emmanuel Macron when the next presidential election takes place in 2027 It comes as a new government dominated by centrists and conservatives just came into office in the wake of June-July legislative elections. Some observers expect the trial could prevent National Rally lawmakers, including Le Pen herself, from fully playing their opposition role in Parliament as they would be busy focusing on the party's defense. Since stepping down as party leader three years ago, Le Pen has sought to position herself as a mainstream candidate capable of appealing to a broader electorate. Her efforts have paid off, with the party making significant gains in recent elections at both the European and national levels. But a guilty verdict could seriously undermine her bid to take the Elysee. The National Rally and 27 of its top officials are accused of having used money destined for EU parliamentary aides to pay staff who instead did political work for the party between 2004 and 2016, in violation of the 27-nation bloc’s regulations. The National Rally was called National Front at the time. Le Pen, whose party has softened its anti-EU stance in recent years, denies wrongdoing and claims the case is politically driven. 'Parliamentary assistants do not work for the Parliament. They are political assistants to elected officials, political by definition,' she argued in her defense. 'You ask me if I can define the tasks I assigned to my assistants; it depends on each person’s skills. Some wrote speeches for me, and some handled logistics and coordination.' If found guilty, Le Pen and her co-defendants could face up to 10 years in prison and fines of up to 1 million euros ($1.1 million) each. Additional penalties, such as the loss of civil rights or ineligibility to run for office, could also be imposed, a scenario that could hamper, or even destroy, Le Pen’s goal to mount another presidential bid after Macron’s term ends. Le Pen was runner-up to Macron in the 2017 and 2022 presidential elections. She served as party president from 2011 to 2021 and now heads the group of RN lawmakers at the French National Assembly. Despite her denial, her party has already paid back 1 million to the European Parliament, the Parliament’s lawyer Patrick Maisonneuve said. Of that amount, 330,000 euros were directly linked to Marine Le Pen’s alleged misuse of funds. A longstanding controversy The legal proceedings stem from a 2015 alert raised by Martin Schulz, then-president of the European Parliament, to French authorities about possible fraudulent use of European funds by members of the National Front. Schulz also referred the case to the European Anti-Fraud Office, which launched a separate probe into the matter. The European Parliament’s suspicions were further heightened when a 2015 organizational chart showed that 16 European lawmakers and 20 parliamentary assistants held official positions within the party — roles unrelated to their supposed duties as EU parliamentary staff. A subsequent investigation found that some assistants were contractually linked to different MEPs than the ones they were actually working for, suggesting a scheme to divert European funds to pay party employees in France. Alexandre Varault, a spokesperson for the National Rally who was elected to the European Parliament in June, told The Associated Press that Le Pen will attend the first day of the trial, adding that he hopes for the acquittal of all the defendants. Misuse of public funds alleged Investigating judges concluded that Le Pen, as party leader, orchestrated the allocation of parliamentary assistance budgets and instructed MEPs to hire individuals holding party positions. These individuals were presented as EU parliamentary assistants, but in reality, were allegedly working for the National Rally in various capacities. The European Parliament’s legal team is seeking 2.7 million euros in compensation for financial and reputational damages. This figure corresponds to the 3.7 million euros allegedly defrauded through the scheme, minus the 1 million euros already paid back. During the 2014 European elections, the National Front won a record 24 MEP seats, finishing first with 24.8% of the vote, ahead of the center-right and the Socialists. This surge resulted in a substantial financial windfall for the party, which faced severe financial problems at the time. An audit of the party’s accounts between 2013 and 2016 revealed that it was running a deficit of 9.1 million euros by the end of 2016. Yet, the party still had a cash balance of 1.7 million euros and had lent 1 million euros to Le Pen’s 2017 presidential campaign, while also holding 87,000 euros in loans to Cotelec, its funding association. At the time, the party was also indebted to a Russian bank for 9.4 million euros, a loan taken out in 2014 for 6 million euros. Suspected systemic practice The investigation uncovered many irregularities involving prominent party members. Thierry Légier, the long-time bodyguard of Le Pen’s father Jean-Marie, was listed as his parliamentary assistant. But his resume did not reference this role, and he made no mention of it in his 2012 autobiography. Légier admitted during the investigation that he was not interviewed and signed his employment contract without fully understanding his official role. Jean-Marie Le Pen, who led the National Front from 1972 to 2011, will not appear in court alongside his former colleagues due to health concerns. Now 96, he was deemed unfit to testify by a court in June. He has 11 prior convictions, including for violence against a public official and hate speech. He has denied wrongdoing during his time as party leader, stating that the 'pool' of assistants was common knowledge. 'I did not choose which assistants were assigned to me. That was decided by Marine Le Pen and others. I only signed the contracts,' he said. ___ Diane Jeantet in Paris contributed.

Top Kashmir leader says India has silenced dissenting voices as region votes in final phase of polls	SRINAGAR, India (AP) — Ahead of the final phase of a local election in Indian-controlled Kashmir, a key resistance leader says the regional polls to choose a local government will not resolve the decades-old conflict that is at the heart of a dispute between New Delhi and Pakistan. Mirwaiz Umar Farooq, who has spent most of the last five years under house detention, said the polls are being held as political voices contesting India’s sovereignty over the region remain silenced after Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Hindu nationalist government stripped the region of its long-held semi-autonomy in 2019. The detained leader said in a phone interview with The Associated Press that the election, touted by the Modi government as a ' festival of democracy ' in the region, cannot be an alternative to resolving the dispute. 'These elections cannot be the means to address the larger Kashmir issue,' said Mirwaiz, who is also an influential Muslim cleric and custodian of the six-century-old grand mosque in the region’s main Srinagar city, the urban heartland of anti-India sentiment. The multistage election, the last phase of which is being held Tuesday, will allow Kashmir to have its own truncated government and a regional legislature with limited powers. It is the first such vote in a decade and the first since 2019, when New Delhi downgraded and divided the former state into two centrally governed union territories — Ladakh and Jammu-Kashmir — both ruled directly by New Delhi through unelected bureaucrats. Authorities have said the election will bring democracy to the region after more than three decades of strife, but many locals see the vote as an opportunity not only to elect their own representatives but also to register their protest against the 2019 changes they fear could dilute the region’s demographics. India’s clampdown following the 2019 move 'has silenced people' in the region who 'feel dispossessed and disempowered,' Mirwaiz said. 'You may not see active turmoil like before 2019 but there is a strong, latent public resistance to all this,' he said. 'We have been forcibly silenced, but silence is not agreement.' India’s sudden move, which largely resonated in India and among Modi supporters, was mostly opposed in Kashmir as an assault on its identity and autonomy. Fearing unrest, authorities detained Mirwaiz and thousands of other political activists, including Kashmiri pro-India leaders who objected to India’s move, amid an unprecedented security clampdown and a total communication blackout in the region. The region has since been on edge, with civil liberties curbed and media gagged. Mirwaiz heads the All Parties Hurriyat Conference, an umbrella grouping that espouses the right to self-determination for the entire region, which is divided between India and Pakistan. According to Mirwaiz, the crackdown has restricted his group’s access to people and shrunk its 'space and scope for proactive involvement' like before. 'The massive assault has considerably weakened the organizational strength of the Hurriyat, but not its resolve,' he said. India and Pakistan have fought two of their three wars over Kashmir, and both countries control parts of the Himalayan territory divided by a heavily militarized frontier. After their first war in 1947, a United Nations referendum a year later gave Kashmir the choice of joining either Pakistan or India, but it never happened. The part of Kashmir controlled by India was granted semi-autonomy and special privileges in exchange for accepting Indian rule. However, Kashmiri discontent with India soon began taking root as successive Indian governments started chipping away at that pact. Local governments were toppled and largely peaceful anti-India movements were harshly suppressed. In the mid-1980s, an election that was widely believed to have been rigged led to public backlash and an armed uprising. Since then, rebels have been fighting in the Indian-controlled part for a united Kashmir, either under Pakistani rule or independent of both. Many Muslim Kashmiris support the rebels’ goal. India insists the Kashmir militancy is Pakistan-sponsored terrorism. Pakistan denies the charge, and many Kashmiris consider it a legitimate freedom struggle. Tens of thousands of civilians, rebels and government forces have been killed in the conflict. Mirwaiz's group believes only talks between India, Pakistan and the region’s people can end the conflict. In the past, he has held several rounds of talks with both New Delhi and Islamabad leaders, including their heads of government. However, under Modi, India has shifted its Kashmir policy and stopped engaging with the region’s pro-freedom leaders, including Mirwaiz. Previous elections in the region have been marred by violence, boycotts and vote-rigging, even though India called them a victory over separatism. This time, the pro-freedom groups, largely incapacitated with most of their leaders jailed, have issued no calls for boycotts. They also did not boycott India’s recent general election. Instead, some lower-ranking activists, who in the past dismissed voting as illegitimate under military occupation, are running for office as independent candidates. 'Boycott was the democratic means to express anger, reject this projection and draw attention towards the unsolved issue (of Kashmir),' Mirwaiz said. But India’s crackdown has left people 'powerless and disempowered' and in such a scenario a 'poll boycott cannot work anymore.' Mirwaiz has distanced himself from the election, but said it had been engineered in favor of Modi’s Hindu nationalist politics before it started on Sept. 18. He cited the government’s July amendment to legislation that gives sweeping executive powers to the federally appointed administrator even after a new local government comes to power in the region. He also referred to the redrawing of assembly districts in 2022 as 'electoral gerrymandering,' an act that gave more electoral representation to the Hindu-dominated Jammu areas over the region’s overwhelmingly Muslim-majority Kashmir Valley. Mirwaiz, however, hoped Kashmiri groups, including pro-India parties, would jointly seek a resolution of the conflict. He expressed his willingness to engage in talks with India but warned that the election should not be seen as public acceptance of New Delhi’s changes in the region. Public participation in the election, Mirwaiz said, 'is a release of their pent-up emotions and a means to oppose these disempowering and dispossessing measures, besides hoping to get some relief and redressal for their bread and butter issues.'	https://apnews.com/article/kashmir-election-india-pakistan-ae53746027853ec36bdb0b39ab580264	2024-09-29T19:57:24-07:00	
China factory surveys show economy weakening, as Beijing steps up support	China's economy weakened further in recent weeks, according to surveys released Monday, signaling the need for more support as the government ratchets up stimulus. The Caixin purchasing managers survey showed new manufacturing orders fell at the fastest pace in two years in September. 'Operating conditions in China’s manufacturing sector deteriorated in September after improving during August,' the report said. 'Furthermore, firms lowered their hiring and purchasing activity.' An official survey released by the National Bureau of Statistics showed a less drastic decline but it marked a fifth straight month of contraction. The purchasing managers index was at 49.8 in September, up from a six-month low of 49.1 in August. The index is on a scale where figures above 50 indicate expansion. The survey showed that factory output rose while new orders fell. Chinese stock markets surged Monday, reflecting enthusiasm over a barrage of policy measures announced last week, including lower interest rates and smaller down payment requirements for mortgages and a cut in required bank reserves. 'There is no doubt that the coordinated and emphatic policy stimulus measures announced by Beijing have justifiably invoked optimism,' Tan Boon Heng of Mizuho Bank in Singapore said in a commentary. The main index smaller market in Shenzhen soared 8.2% while the Shanghai Composite index jumped 5.7% 'The stimulus package announced last week should help shore activity over the coming months,' Gabriel Ng of Capital Economics said in a report. But he noted that imbalances between excess supply of many products versus weak demand persist. And trade measures against China, such as higher tariffs on electric vehicles and other goods, also will weigh on the economy. 'In this environment, a meaningful cyclical recovery would require sizeable fiscal stimulus,' he said. 'There has yet to be any official announcement on fiscal support, though some media reports suggest that one could come soon.' Over the weekend, Beijing moved forward with the measures announced last week to support the property industry and revive languishing financial markets. The central bank announced on Sunday that it would direct banks to cut mortgage rates for existing home loans by Oct. 31. Meanwhile, the major southern city of Guangzhou lifted all home purchase restrictions over the weekend, while both Shanghai and Shenzhen revealed plans to ease key buying curbs. Property developers have struggled after the government cracked down on excessive borrowing for projects several years ago. Housing prices have continued to fall and the government has moved to ensure that developers deliver apartments that were paid for but not yet built. The downturn in the property sector has rippled throughout the world's second-largest economy, hitting many other industries that depended on booming housing construction, such as appliance makers and manufacturers of building materials. It has slowed China's recovery from the massive disruptions of the COVID-19 pandemic, adding to pressures on Chinese consumers worried over pay cuts, job losses and weaker asset prices. The economy expanded at a 4.7% pace in the last quarter, slightly below the government's target for about 5%.	https://apnews.com/article/china-economy-stocks-factory-jinping-e6db38661b131c9e32179cbe31a67136	2024-09-29T19:52:51-07:00	
Flooding toll in Nepal reaches 193 as recovery work is stepped up	KATHMANDU, Nepal (AP) — The number of people killed by flooding and landslides triggered by heavy rainfall over the weekend in Nepal has reached 193 while recovery and rescue work has been stepped up, officials said Monday. A police statement said there were 31 people who were still reported missing and 96 people were injured across the Himalayan nation. Many of the deaths were in the capital Kathmandu which got heavy rainfall and much of southern part of the city was flooded. At least three buses headed to Kathmandu and stuck in traffic jam on a highway were buried by a landslide that killed three dozen people. Weather improved on Sunday and Monday, allowing rescue and recovery work.	https://apnews.com/article/nepal-flood-landslide-deaths-94c25dd2a172cdcf51bc558c5df016aa	2024-09-29T19:31:06-07:00	
Montana man gets 6 months in prison for cloning giant sheep and breeding it	GREAT FALLS, Mont. (AP) — An 81-year-old Montana man was sentenced Monday to six months in federal prison for illegally using tissue and testicles from large sheep hunted in Central Asia and the U.S. to create hybrid sheep for captive trophy hunting in Texas and Minnesota. U.S. District Court Judge Brian Morris said he struggled to come up with a sentence for Arthur 'Jack' Schubarth of Vaughn, Montana. He said he weighed Schubarth's age and lack of a criminal record with a sentence that would deter anyone else from trying to 'change the genetic makeup of the creatures' on the earth. Morris also fined Schubarth $20,000 and ordered him to make a $4,000 payment to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Foundation. Schubarth will be allowed to self-report to a Bureau of Prisons medical facility. 'I will have to work the rest of my life to repair everything I've done,' Schubarth told the judge just before sentencing. Schubarth's attorney, Jason Holden, said cloning the giant Marco Polo sheep hunted in Kyrgyzstan in 2013 has ruined his client's 'life, reputation and family.' 'I think this has broken him,' Holden said. Holden, in seeking a probationary sentence, argued that Schubarth was a hard-working man who has always cared for animals and did something that no one else could have done in cloning the giant sheep, which he named Montana Mountain King or MMK. The animal has been confiscated by U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services and is being held in an accredited facility until it can be transferred to a zoo, said Richard Bare, a special agent with the wildlife service. Sarah Brown, an attorney with the U.S. Department of Justice, had asked that Schubarth be sentenced to prison, saying his illegal breeding operation was widespread, involved other states and endangered the health of other wildlife. The crime involved forethought, was complex and involved many illegal acts, she said. Schubarth owns Sun River Enterprises LLC, a 215-acre (87-hectare) alternative livestock ranch, which buys, sells and breeds 'alternative livestock' such as mountain sheep, mountain goats and ungulates, primarily for private hunting preserves, where people shoot captive trophy game animals for a fee, prosecutors said. He had been in the game farm business since 1987, Schubarth said. Schubarth pleaded guilty in March to charges that he and five other people conspired to use tissue from a Marco Polo sheep illegally brought into the U.S. to clone that animal and then use the clone and its descendants to create a larger, hybrid species of sheep that would be more valuable for captive hunting operations. Marco Polo sheep are the largest in the world, can weigh 300 pounds (136 kilograms) and have curled horns up to 5 feet (1.5 meters) long, court records said. Schubarth sold semen from MMK along with hybrid sheep to three people in Texas, while a Minnesota resident brought 74 sheep to Schubarth’s ranch for them to be inseminated at various times during the conspiracy, court records said. Schubarth sold one direct offspring from MMK for $10,000 and other sheep with lesser MMK genetics for smaller amounts. The total value of the animals involved was greater than $250,000 but less than $550,000, prosecutors said. Hybrid sheep were also sold to people in Alabama, Arkansas, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, Ohio, Oregon, South Dakota and West Virginia, prosecutors said. In October 2019, court records said, Schubarth paid a hunting guide $400 for the testicles of a trophy-sized Rocky Mountain bighorn sheep that had been harvested in Montana and then extracted and sold the semen, court records said. Sheep breeds that are not allowed in Montana were brought into the state as part of the conspiracy, including 43 sheep from Texas, prosecutors said. 'You were so focused on getting around those rules you got off track,' Morris said. Holden sought reduced restitution, saying Schubarth fed and cared for the hybrid sheep on his ranch until they could be slaughtered and the meat donated to a food bank. The remaining hybrid sheep with Marco Polo DNA on his ranch must be sent to slaughter by the end of the year with the meat also being donated, Morris said. Morris gave Schubarth until December 2025 to sell his Rocky Mountain bighorn hybrid sheep. Schubarth will not be allowed to breed game stock during the three years he is on probation, Morris said. The five co-conspirators were not named in court records, but Schubarth's plea agreement requires him to cooperate fully with prosecutors and testify if called to do so. The case is still being investigated, Montana wildlife officials said. Schubarth, in a letter attached to the sentencing memo, said he becomes extremely passionate about any project he takes on, including his 'sheep project,' and is ashamed of his actions. 'I got my normal mindset clouded by my enthusiasm and looked for any grey area in the law to make the best sheep I could for this sheep industry,' he wrote. 'My family has never been broke, but we are now.'	https://apnews.com/article/giant-sheep-clone-breed-trophy-hunt-d3a2b57886980266abeac69c44b70b2a	2024-09-29T19:19:13-07:00	
As big supermarkets pursue profits, new research shows growing exploitation of shrimp farmers	BANGKOK (AP) — Indonesian shrimp farmer Yulius Cahyonugroho operated more than two dozen ponds only a few years ago, employing seven people and making more than enough to support his family. Since then, the 39-year-old says the prices he gets from purchasers have fallen by half and he's had to scale back to four workers and about one-third the ponds, some months not even breaking even. His wife has had to take a job at a watermelon farm to help support their two children. 'It is more stable than the shrimp farms,' said the farmer from Indonesia’s Central Java province. As big Western supermarkets make windfall profits, their aggressive pursuit of ever-lower wholesale prices is causing misery for people at the bottom end of the supply chain — people like Cahyonugroho who produce and process the seafood, according to an investigation by an alliance of NGOs focused on three of the world's largest producers of shrimp provided to The Associated Press ahead of its publication Monday. The analysis of the industry in Vietnam, Indonesia and India, which provide about half the shrimp in the world's top four markets, found a 20%-60% drop in earnings from pre-pandemic levels as producers struggle to meet pricing demands by cutting labor costs. In many places this has meant unpaid and underpaid work through longer hours, wage insecurity as rates fluctuate, and many workers not even making low minimum wages. The report also found hazardous working conditions, particularly in India and parts of Indonesia, and even child labor in some places in India. 'The supermarket procurement practices changed, and the working conditions were affected — directly and rapidly,' said Katrin Nakamura of Sustainability Incubator, who wrote the regional report and whose Hawaii-based nonprofit led the research on the industry in Vietnam. 'Those two things go together because they're tied together through the pricing.' Tubagus Haeru Rahayu, the director general of aquaculture for Indonesia’s Maritime Affairs and Fisheries Ministry, said he was surprised by the report’s findings and had already reached out to people in the industry to investigate the price pressures. 'If there is pressure like that, there will definitely be a reaction — not only in Indonesia but in Vietnam and India too,' he told the AP in an interview at his Jakarta office. Indian and Vietnamese officials refused to comment. Supermarkets linked to facilities where exploited labor was reported by workers include Target, Walmart and Costco in the United States, Britain's Sainsbury's and Tesco, and Aldi and Co-op in Europe. Switzerland's Co-op said it had a 'zero tolerance' policy for violations of labor law, and that its producers 'receive fair and market-driven prices.' Germany’s Aldi did not specifically address the issue of pricing, but said it uses independent certification schemes to ensure responsibly sourcing for farmed shrimp products, and would continue to monitor the allegations. 'We are committed to fulfilling our responsibility to respect human rights,' Aldi said. Sainsbury's referred to a comment from the British Retail Consortium industry group, which said its members were committed to sourcing products at a 'fair, sustainable price' and that the welfare of people and communities in supply chains is fundamental to their purchasing practices. None of the other retailers named in the report responded to multiple requests for comment on the report, titled 'Human Rights for Dinner.' In Vietnam, researchers found that workers who peel, gut and devein shrimp typically work six or seven days a week, often in rooms kept extremely cold to keep the product fresh. Some 80% of those involved in processing the shrimp are women who rise at 4 a.m. and return home at 6 p.m., with the exception of pregnant women and new mothers who can stop one hour earlier. 'The work day for peelers consists of standing in a refrigerated and disinfected room and working extremely rapidly with a knife while taking care not to make a mistake,' researchers said. Wages are generally not disclosed ahead of time and are based upon production. Sometimes workers make minimum wage, but frequently they do not. The Vietnam Association of Seafood Exporters and Producers issued a statement calling the allegations in the report 'unfounded, misleading and detrimental to the reputation of Vietnam’s shrimp exports.' It cited government labor policies in a four-page statement but did not specifically address the findings, and did not respond to queries. After food supply chain disruptions during the COVID-19 pandemic, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission reported earlier this year that some grocers have used the situation 'as an opportunity to further raise prices to increase their profits, which remain elevated today.' The demands for lower wholesale shrimp prices — combined with rising production costs and an oversupply — means farmers often must sell their products under cost just to keep operations going, the Sustainability Incubator analysis found. Cahyonugroho said he's stuck selling his shrimp at the price offered by middlemen who then sell it to factories for processing. He can't scrape together the startup costs needed to sell directly to factories or markets to earn more. 'The opportunity is there,' he said, 'but you need a lot of capital if you want to jump into something like that.' The middlemen who buy the shrimp obfuscate the true sources of shrimp that appear in Western supermarkets, so many retailers may not be following ethical commitments they've made about procuring shrimp. Only about 1,000 of the 2 million shrimp farms in the major producing countries of India, Indonesia, Vietnam, Ecuador, Thailand and Bangladesh are certified by either the Aquaculture Stewardship Council or the Best Aquaculture Practices ecolabel. 'With the yield from most certified shrimp farms being very small, it is mathematically impossible for certified farms to produce enough shrimp per month to supply all of the supermarkets that boast commitments to purchasing certified shrimp,' the report said. Ideally, supermarkets should pay higher wholesale prices and ensure that the extra money makes it all the way down the supply chain, Nakamura said. U.S. policymakers could use antitrust and other laws already in place to establish oversight to ensure fair pricing from Western retailers, rather than adding punishing tariffs on suppliers for labor violations, she said. Awareness about the trends hurting suppliers is growing. In July, the European Union adopted a new directive requiring companies to 'identify and address adverse human rights and environmental impacts of their actions inside and outside Europe.' Britain's Groceries Code Adjudicator office published a 'deep dive' into views of suppliers about the conduct of supermarkets, saying they had chosen to conduct 'warfare' with suppliers. Higher wholesale prices don't have to mean higher prices for consumers, Sustainability Incubator said. 'Prices to farmers would be at least 200% higher than today if the shrimp sold in Global North supermarkets was made at minimum wage rates and in compliance with applicable domestic laws for labor, workplace health, and safety,' the report said. 'This would not necessarily mean higher consumer prices, because supermarkets are already profiting at existing consumer prices.' Researchers from the Corporate Accountability Lab found that Indian shrimp industry workers face 'dangerous and abusive conditions' and that highly-salinated water from newly-dug hatcheries and ponds, tainted with chemicals and toxic algae, are contaminating surrounding water and soil. Unpaid labor prevails, including salaries below minimum wage, unpaid overtime, wage deductions for costs of work and 'significant' debt bondage, the report found. Child labor was also identified, with girls aged 14 and 15 being recruited for peeling work. In Indonesia, three non-profit research organizations found that shrimp workers' wages have declined since the pandemic and now average $160 per month, below Indonesia's minimum wage in most of the biggest shrimp-producing provinces. Shrimp peelers were found to be routinely required to work at least 12 hours per day to meet minimum targets. Still, given widespread poverty most workers said they're happy to have their jobs, said lead researcher Kharisma Nugroho of the Migunani Research Institute. 'It’s exploitation of the vulnerability of the workers, because they have a lack of options,' he said. 'They’re paid the minimum wages but they have to work 150% of the normal,' he told the AP. 'Can they live? Yes. Can they move? Yes. Do they make a complaint? No. They’re still there.' The regional report compiled more than 500 interviews conducted in-person with workers in their native languages, in India, Indonesia and Vietnam, supplemented with secondary data and interviews from Thailand, Bangladesh and Ecuador. After the Indonesia country report was issued recently, government officials asked to meet with the authors, and Nugroho said they showed a 'genuine willingness to improve the situation.' Vietnamese officials have also engaged with Sustainability Incubator to talk about the findings. Government and industry intervention has already helped in Thailand, which has been criticized after the AP exposed serious labor abuses in the shrimp industry in the past. That, however, has led to higher prices for Thai shrimp, leading some buyers to shift sourcing to India and Ecuador. Ecuador has an industrial approach to shrimp farming — unlike the smaller, often family-run operations in Southeast Asia — and is now the world's largest exporter of shrimp. It has the lowest prices, followed by India; China, which wasn't included in the report; then Vietnam and Indonesia. But with the demand for lower wholesale prices, while Ecuador’s exports rose 12% in volume in 2023, they fell 5% in value. India’s exports rose 1% but dropped nearly 11% in value. Meantime, with their relatively higher prices, Vietnam's exports were down 25% in 2023 in volume Indonesia's dropped 9.5%. 'Labor exploitation in shrimp aquaculture industries is not company, sector, or country-specific,' the report concluded. 'Instead, it is the result of a hidden business model that exploits people for profit.' ___ AP journalist Edna Tarigan in Jakarta, Indonesia, contributed to this report. ___ This story was supported by funding from the Walton Family Foundation.

A powerful typhoon is lashing northern Philippine islands	MANILA, Philippines (AP) — A powerful typhoon was lashing the northernmost islands of the Philippines Monday, prompting officials to evacuate villagers, shut down schools and inter-island ferries and warn of 'potentially very destructive' damage to coastal villages. Typhoon Krathon was last tracked over the coastal waters of Balintang island off the provinces of Cagayan and Batanes with sustained winds of up to 175 kph (109 mph) and gusts of up to 215 kph (133 mph), according to government forecasters. The slow-moving Krathon was blowing westward and could strengthen into a super typhoon when it veers northeastward Tuesday toward Taiwan, they said. There were no immediate reports of casualties or damage Guilmar Cabejo, a police officer on the island of Sabtang in typhoon-prone Batanes, said the streets were deserted in the town of more than 1,800 people as the ferocious wind rattled roofs, walls and trees. 'There’s nobody outside, zero, because the wind is so strong,' Cabejo told The Associated Press by cellphone. 'Nobody could stand normally outside in this wind, it will force anybody down to the ground.' Residents, locally renowned for their resilience against seasonal storms, strengthened their roofs with ropes, covered windows with wooden boards and secured their fishing boats away from the sea two days before the typhoon hit, he said. The weather agency warned of 'moderate to high risk of life-threatening storm surge' in the next 48 hours in the coastal villages of Batanes, the nearby Babuyan islands and Cagayan province and said fierce winds could rip off roofs, topple trees, damage farmlands and whip up high waves. 'The situation is potentially very destructive to the community,' it said. Hundreds of villagers were evacuated away from the coast and flood-prone communities in Cagayan province, where power outages were reported. Classes in all levels were suspended Monday in several northern provinces as a precaution, officials said. Sea voyages were also halted in northern towns and provinces being battered or threatened by the typhoon, locally called Julian, officials said. About 20 storms and typhoons batter the Philippines each year. The archipelago also lies in the 'Pacific Ring of Fire,' a region along most of the Pacific Ocean rim where many volcanic eruptions and earthquakes occur, making the Southeast Asian nation one of the world’s most disaster-prone. In 2013, Typhoon Haiyan, one of the strongest recorded tropical cyclones in the world, left more than 7,300 people dead or missing, flattened entire villages, swept ships inland and displaced more than 5 million in the central Philippines.	https://apnews.com/article/typhoon-krathon-philippines-taiwan-de393349970fa4907ccedb9f22cecd8f	2024-09-29T16:15:28-07:00	
Kris Kristofferson, singer-songwriter and actor, dies at 88	LOS ANGELES (AP) — Kris Kristofferson, a Rhodes scholar with a deft writing style and rough charisma who became a country music superstar and an A-list Hollywood actor, has died. Kristofferson died at his home on Maui, Hawaii, on Saturday, family spokeswoman Ebie McFarland said in an email. He was 88. McFarland said Kristofferson died peacefully, surrounded by his family. No cause was given. Starting in the late 1960s, the Brownsville, Texas native wrote such country and rock ‘n’ roll standards as 'Sunday Mornin' Comin' Down,' 'Help Me Make it Through the Night,' 'For the Good Times' and 'Me and Bobby McGee.' Kristofferson was a singer himself, but many of his songs were best known as performed by others, whether Ray Price crooning 'For the Good Times' or Janis Joplin belting out 'Me and Bobby McGee.' He starred opposite Ellen Burstyn in director Martin Scorsese's 1974 film 'Alice Doesn’t Live Here Anymore,' starred opposite Barbra Streisand in the 1976 'A Star Is Born,' and acted alongside Wesley Snipes in Marvel’s 'Blade' in 1998. Kristofferson, who could recite William Blake from memory, wove intricate folk music lyrics about loneliness and tender romance into popular country music. With his long hair and bell-bottomed slacks and counterculture songs influenced by Bob Dylan, he represented a new breed of country songwriters along with such peers as Willie Nelson, John Prine and Tom T. Hall. 'There's no better songwriter alive than Kris Kristofferson,' Nelson said at a 2009 BMI award ceremony for Kristofferson. 'Everything he writes is a standard and we're all just going to have to live with that.' Kristofferson retired from performing and recording in 2021, making only occasional guest appearances on stage, including a performance with Cash's daughter Rosanne at Nelson's 90th birthday celebration at the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles in 2023. The two sang 'Loving Her Was Easier (Than Anything I’ll Ever Do Again),' a song that was a hit for Kristofferson and a longtime live staple for Nelson, another great interpreter of his work. Nelson and Kristofferson would join forces with Johnny Cash and Waylon Jennings to create the country supergroup 'The Highwaymen' starting in the mid-1980s. Kristofferson was a Golden Gloves boxer, rugby star and football player in college; received a master’s degree in English from Merton College at the University of Oxford in England; and flew helicopters as a captain in the U.S. Army but turned down an appointment to teach at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, New York, to pursue songwriting in Nashville. Hoping to break into the industry, he worked as a part-time janitor at Columbia Records’ Music Row studio in 1966 when Dylan recorded tracks for the seminal 'Blonde on Blonde' double album. At times, the legend of Kristofferson was larger than real life. Cash liked to tell a mostly exaggerated story of how Kristofferson landed a helicopter on Cash’s lawn to give him a tape of 'Sunday Mornin’ Comin’ Down' with a beer in one hand. Over the years in interviews, Kristofferson said with all respect to Cash, while he did land a helicopter at Cash’s house, the Man in Black wasn’t even home at the time, the demo tape was a song that no one ever actually cut and he certainly couldn’t fly a helicopter holding a beer. In a 2006 interview with The Associated Press, he said he might not have had a career without Cash. 'Shaking his hand when I was still in the Army backstage at the Grand Ole Opry was the moment I’d decided I’d come back,' Kristofferson said. 'It was electric. He kind of took me under his wing before he cut any of my songs. He cut my first record that was record of the year. He put me on stage the first time.' One of his most recorded songs, 'Me and Bobby McGee,' was written based on a recommendation from Monument Records founder Fred Foster. Foster had a song title in his head called 'Me and Bobby McKee,' named after a female secretary in his building. Kristofferson said in an interview in the magazine, 'Performing Songwriter,' that he was inspired to write the lyrics about a man and woman on the road together after watching the Frederico Fellini film, 'La Strada.' Joplin, who had a close relationship with Kristofferson, changed the lyrics to make Bobby McGee a man and cut her version just days before she died in 1970 from a drug overdose. The recording became a posthumous No. 1 hit for Joplin. Hits that Kristofferson recorded include 'Watch Closely Now,' 'Desperados Waiting for a Train,' 'A Song I’d Like to Sing' and 'Jesus Was a Capricorn.' In 1973, he married fellow songwriter Rita Coolidge and together they had a successful duet career that earned them two Grammy awards. They divorced in 1980. The formation of the Highwaymen, with Nelson, Cash and Jennings, was another pivotal point in his career as a performer. 'I think I was different from the other guys in that I came in it as a fan of all of them,' Kristofferson told the AP in 2005. 'I had a respect for them when I was still in the Army. When I went to Nashville they were like major heroes of mine because they were people who took the music seriously. To be not only recorded by them but to be friends with them and to work side by side was just a little unreal. It was like seeing your face on Mount Rushmore.' The group put out just three albums between 1985 and 1995. Jennings died in 2002 and Cash died a year later. Kristofferson said in 2005 that there was some talk about reforming the group with other artists, such as George Jones or Hank Williams Jr., but Kristofferson said it wouldn’t have been the same. 'When I look back now — I know I hear Willie say it was the best time of his life,' Kristofferson said in 2005. 'For me, I wish I was more aware how short of a time it would be. It was several years, but it was still like the blink of an eye. I wish I would have cherished each moment.' Among the four, only Nelson is now alive. Kristofferson's sharp-tongued political lyrics sometimes hurt his popularity, especially in the late 1980s. His 1989 album, 'Third World Warrior' was focused on Central America and what United States policy had wrought there, but critics and fans weren’t excited about the overtly political songs. He said during a 1995 interview with the AP he remembered a woman complaining about one of the songs that began with killing babies in the name of freedom. 'And I said, ‘Well, what made you mad — the fact that I was saying it or the fact that we’re doing it? To me, they were getting mad at me ’cause I was telling them what was going on.' As the son of an Air Force General, he enlisted in the Army in the 1960s because it was expected of him. 'I was in ROTC in college, and it was just taken for granted in my family that I’d do my service,' he said in a 2006 AP interview. 'From my background and the generation I came up in, honor and serving your country were just taken for granted. So, later, when you come to question some of the things being done in your name, it was particularly painful.' Hollywood may have saved his music career. He still got exposure through his film and television appearances even when he couldn’t afford to tour with a full band. Kristofferson’s first role was in Dennis Hopper’s 'The Last Movie,' in 1971. He had a fondness for Westerns, and would use his gravelly voice to play attractive, stoic leading men. He was Burstyn's ruggedly handsome love interest in 'Alice Doesn’t Live Here Anymore' and a tragic rock star in a rocky relationship with Streisand in 'A Star Is Born,' a role echoed by Bradley Cooper in the 2018 remake. He was the young title outlaw in director Sam Peckinpah’s 1973 'Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid,' a truck driver for the same director in 1978’s 'Convoy,' and a corrupt sheriff in director John Sayles' 1996, 'Lone Star.' He also starred in one of Hollywood biggest financial flops, 'Heaven’s Gate,' a 1980 Western that ran tens of millions of dollars over budget. And in a rare appearance in a superhero movie, he played the mentor of Snipes' vampire hunter in 'Blade.' He described in a 2006 AP interview how he got his first acting gigs when he performed in Los Angeles. 'It just happened that my first professional gig was at the Troubadour in L.A. opening for Linda Rondstadt,' Kristofferson said. 'Robert Hilburn (Los Angeles Times music critic) wrote a fantastic review and the concert was held over for a week,' Kristofferson said. 'There were a bunch of movie people coming in there, and I started getting film offers with no experience. Of course, I had no experience performing either.' ___ Hall reported from Nashville.

Stuck NASA astronauts welcome SpaceX capsule that'll bring them home next year	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) — The two astronauts stuck at the International Space Station since June welcomed their new ride home with Sunday’s arrival of a SpaceX capsule. SpaceX launched the rescue mission on Saturday with a downsized crew of two astronauts and two empty seats reserved for Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, who will return next year. The Dragon capsule docked in darkness as the two craft soared 265 miles (426 kilometers) above Botswana. NASA switched Wilmore and Williams to SpaceX following concerns over the safety of their Boeing Starliner capsule. It was the first Starliner test flight with a crew, and NASA decided the thruster failures and helium leaks that cropped up after liftoff were too serious and poorly understood to risk the test pilots’ return. So Starliner returned to Earth empty earlier this month. The Dragon carrying NASA’s Nick Hague and the Russian Space Agency’s Alexander Gorbunov will remain at the space station until February, turning what should have been a weeklong trip for Wilmore and Williams into a mission lasting more than eight months. Two NASA astronauts were pulled from the mission to make room for Wilmore and Williams on the return leg. NASA likes to replace its station crews every six months or so. SpaceX has provided the taxi service since the company’s first astronaut flight in 2020. NASA also hired Boeing for ferry flights after the space shuttles were retired, but flawed software and other Starliner issues led to years of delays and more than $1 billion in repairs. Starliner inspections are underway at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center, with post-flight reviews of data set to begin this week. 'We’re a long way from saying, ‘Hey, we’re writing off Boeing,’' NASA’s associate administrator Jim Free said at a pre-launch briefing. The arrival of two fresh astronauts means the four who have been up there since March can now return to Earth in their own SpaceX capsule in just over a week. Their stay was extended a month because of the Starliner turmoil. Although Saturday's liftoff went well, SpaceX said the rocket's spent upper stage ended up outside its targeted impact zone in the Pacific because of a bad engine firing. The company has halted all Falcon launches until it figures out what went wrong. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.

Who were the 7 high-ranking Hezbollah officials killed over the past week?	BEIRUT (AP) — In just over a week, intensified Israeli strikes in Lebanon killed seven high-ranking commanders and officials from the powerful Hezbollah militant group, including the group's leader, Hassan Nasrallah. The move left Lebanon and much of the Mideast in shock as Israeli officials celebrated major military and intelligence breakthroughs. Hezbollah had opened a front to support its ally Hamas in the Gaza Strip a day after the Palestinian group's surprise attack into southern Israel. The recent strikes in Lebanon and the assassination of Nasrallah are a significant escalation in the war in the Middle East, this time between Israel and Hezbollah. Lebanon's most powerful military and political force now finds itself trying to recuperate from severe blows, having lost key members who have been part of Hezbollah since its establishment in the early 1980s. Chief among them was Nasrallah, who was killed in a series of airstrikes that leveled several buildings in southern Beirut. Others were lesser-known in the outside world, but still key to Hezbollah’s operations. Hassan Nasrallah Since 1992, Nasrallah had led the group through several wars with Israel, and oversaw the party's transformation into a powerful player in Lebanon. Hezbollah entered Lebanon's political arena while also taking part in regional conflicts that made it the most powerful paramilitary force. After Syria's uprising 2011 spiraled into civil war, Hezbollah played a pivotal role in keeping Syrian President Bashar Assad in power. Under Nasrallah, Hezbollah also helped develop the capabilities of fellow Iran-backed armed groups in Iraq and Yemen. Nasrallah is a divisive figure in Lebanon, with his supporters hailing him for ending Israel's occupation of southern Lebanon in 2000, and his opponents decrying him for the group's weapons stockpile and making unilateral decisions that they say serves an agenda for Tehran and allies. Nabil Kaouk Kaouk, who was killed in an airstrike Saturday, was the deputy head of Hezbollah’s Central Council. He joined the militant group in its early days in the 1980s. Kaouk also served as Hezbollah’s military commander in south Lebanon from 1995 until 2010. He made several media appearances and gave speeches to supporters, including in funerals for killed Hezbollah militants. He had been seen as a potential successor to Nasrallah. Ibrahim Akil Akil was a top commander and led Hezbollah's elite Radwan Forces, which Israel has been trying to push further away from its border with Lebanon. He was also a member of its highest military body, the Jihad Council, and for years had been on the United States' wanted list. The U.S. State Department says Akil was part of the group that carried out the 1983 bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Beirut and orchestrated the taking of German and American hostages. Ahmad Wehbe Wehbe was a commander of the Radwan Forces and played a crucial role in developing the group since its formation almost two decades ago. He was killed alongside Akil in an airstrike in Beirut's southern suburbs that struck and leveled a building. Ali Karaki Karaki led Hezbollah's southern front, playing a key role in the ongoing conflict. The U.S. described him as a significant figure in the militant group's leadership. Little is known about Karaki, who was killed alongside Nasrallah. Mohammad Surour Surour was the head of Hezbollah's drone unit, which was used for the first time in this current conflict with Israel. Under his leadership, Hezbollah launched exploding and reconnaissance drones deep into Israel, penetrating its defense systems which had mostly focused on the group's rockets and missiles. Ibrahim Kobeissi Kobeissi led Hezbollah's missile unit. The Israeli military says Kobeissi planned the kidnapping and murder of three Israeli soldiers at the northern border in 2000, whose bodies were returned in a prisoner swap with Hezbollah four years later. Other senior commanders killed in action Even in the months before the recent escalation of the war with Hezbollah, Israel's military had targeted top commanders, most notably Fuad Shukur in late July, hours before an explosion in Iran widely blamed on Israel killed the leader of the Palestinian Hamas militant group Ismail Haniyeh. The U.S. accuses Fuad Shukur of orchestrating the 1983 bombing in Beirut that killed 241 American servicemen. Leaders of key units in the south, Jawad Tawil, Taleb Abdullah, and Mohammad Nasser, who over several decades became instrumental members of Hezbollah’s military activity were all assassinated. Who is left? Nasrallah’s second-in-command Naim Kassem is the most senior member of the organization. Kassem has been Hezbollah’s deputy leader since 1991, and is among its founding members. On several occasions, local news networks were quick to assume that an Israeli strike in southern Beirut may have targeted Kassem. Kassem is only top official of the militant group who has conducted interviews with local and international media in the ongoing conflict. The deputy leader appears to be involved in various aspects of the militant group, both in top political and security matters, but also in matters related to Hezbollah’s theocratic and charity initiatives to the Shia Muslim community in Lebanon. Meanwhile, Hashim Safieddine who heads Hezbollah’s central council, is tipped to be Nasrallah’s successor. Safieddine is a cousin of the late Hezbollah leader, and his son is married to the daughter of Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani, who was slain in a U.S. drone strike in 2020. Like Nasrallah, Safieddine joined Hezbollah early on and similarly wears a black turban. Talal Hamieh and Abu Ali Reda are the two remaining top commanders from Hezbollah who are alive and apparently on the Israeli military’s crosshairs. — Jeffery reported from Jerusalem.	https://apnews.com/article/hezbollah-lebanon-nasrallah-israel-8b2ae56a54d641c6910a79e9e5699824	2024-09-29T11:27:44-07:00	
Biden says he'll speak with Israeli leader, vowing all-out war in the Middle East must be avoided	DOVER AIR FORCE BASE, Del. (AP) — President Joe Biden said Sunday he would speak with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and believes that an all-out war in the Middle East must be avoided. 'It has to be,' Biden told reporters as he boarded Air Force One for Washington. 'We really have to avoid it.' The president’s statements come as Israeli airstrikes across Lebanon killed dozens of people on Sunday. He would not say when he planned to speak with Netanyahu. The Iran-backed Hezbollah sustained a string of deadly blows to its command structure, including the killing of its overall leader, Hassan Nasrallah, as part of a wave of increasingly brazen Israeli strikes meant to undercut the group's capacity to attack its territory. Tens of thousands of Israelis and Lebanese have been forced to evacuate near the Israel-Lebanon border as Hezbollah has launched near-daily rocket volleys at Israel over the past 11 months and Israel has countered with its own strikes. With tens of thousands of civilians displaced on both sides, the Biden administration has tried to bring about a negotiated resolution that would allow them to return home and prevent a wider regional conflict. Earlier Sunday, White House national security spokesman John Kirby said Israel has 'wiped out' Hezbollah’s command structure with a barrage of airstrikes that has taken out Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and several of the group’s leaders.. But Kirby warned Hezbollah will work to rebuild quickly. 'I think people are safer without him walking around,' said Kirby, referring to Friday’s strike killing Nasrallah. 'But they will try to recover. We’re watching to see what they do to try to fill this leadership vacuum. It’s going to be tough.' Kirby sidestepped questions about whether the administration agreed with how the Israelis are going about targeting Hezbollah leaders, who the Israelis say have built command structures and other facilities adjacent to or underneath civilian sites. The strikes, according to Lebanese officials, have also killed many innocent civilians. The White House continues to call on Israel and Hezbollah to agree to a 21-day temporary cease-fire that was floated by the U.S., France and other countries last week as world leaders gathered for the U.N. General Assembly. 'If you want to get those folks back home safely and sustainably, we believe that a diplomatic path is the right course,' Kirby said. He made the comments during an appearance on CNN’s 'State of the Union.'	https://apnews.com/article/biden-israel-hezbollah-war-af76d9ff367a9ebbc8685628276c484b	2024-09-29T10:06:36-07:00	
Israel's prime minister appoints a former rival to strengthen his hold on office	JERUSALEM (AP) — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu appointed Sunday a former rival, Gideon Saar, as a member of his Cabinet, expanding his coalition and strengthening his hold on office. Under their agreement, Netanyahu said Saar would serve as a minister without portfolio and serve in the Security Cabinet, the body that oversees the management of the ongoing war against Israel's enemies across the Middle East. Saar, 57, had hoped to replace Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, another rival of Netanyahu’s. But a deal to become defense minister fell through several weeks ago after fighting intensified with Hezbollah along Israel's northern border, leaving the popular Gallant in office for the time being. Saar is a veteran politician who himself has had a strained relationship with the prime minister. He was once a rising star in Netanyahu’s Likud party, but angrily left it four years ago after accusing the prime minister of turning it into a 'cult of personality' as he battled corruption charges. Since then, however, Saar has struggled as leader of a small conservative party, enjoying little support with the broader public. While he and Netanyahu have little love for one another, they share a hard-line ideology toward Israel’s Arab adversaries. In recent months, Saar has said Israel must fight until Hamas is destroyed. He also has called for tougher action against Hezbollah's sponsor, Iran. And like Netanyahu, he strongly opposes the establishment of a Palestinian state. In a joint statement, they said they had put their differences aside for the good of the nation. Netanyahu’s decision appears to have been driven in part by domestic politics. He faces a number of key political battles in the coming weeks — including the contentious issue of drafting ultra-Orthodox men into the army, passing a budget and taking the stand in his long-running corruption trial. Saar is expected to help Netanyahu on many of these issues. His appointment also will likely scale back the influence of ultranationalist members of his coalition. Bezalel Smotrich, the Israeli finance minister, and Itamar Ben-Gvir, Israel’s minister of national security, are religious ideologues who have threated to bring down the government if Netanyahu makes too many concessions in any cease-fire deal. Ben-Gvir has also drawn international criticism for provocative visits to a contested Jerusalem holy site. Sunday's agreement gives Saar, who hopes to be prime minister one day, an opportunity to revive his political career, while expanding Netanyahu’s majority coalition to 68 seats in the 120-seat parliament.	https://apnews.com/article/netanyahu-saar-israel-politics-cabinet-ee441a9a75780e5c2740ccaeacc461e9	2024-09-29T09:32:50-07:00	
Pope Francis suggests Israel's actions in Gaza and Lebanon are disproportionate and immoral	ABOARD THE PAPAL PLANE (AP) — Pope Francis suggested Sunday that Israel's attacks in Gaza and Lebanon have been 'immoral' and disproportionate, saying its military domination has gone beyond the rules of war. Francis was asked en route home from Belgium about Israel’s targeted killing of one of Hezbollah’s founding members, Hassan Nasrallah. Friday's strike in Beirut targeted an area greater than a city block and reduced several residential buildings to rubble, and at least six other deaths have been confirmed. Francis didn’t mention Israel by name and said he was speaking in general terms. But he said that 'the defense must always be proportionate to the attack.' 'When there is something disproportionate, there is a dominating tendency that goes beyond morality,' he said. 'A country that does these things — and I’m talking about any country — in a superlative way, these are immoral actions.' He said that even if war itself is immoral, there are rules that 'indicate some morality.' 'But when you don’t do this … you see the bad blood of these things,' he said. The death of Nasrallah has sent shockwaves throughout Lebanon and the Middle East, where he has been a dominant political and military figure for more than three decades. U.S. President Joe Biden said the Israeli strike was a 'measure of justice' for victims of Hezbollah’s 'reign of terror.' Francis has tried to strike a balance in his comments on the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel and the conflicts in Gaza and southern Lebanon that have ensued. He has called for an immediate cease-fire, for the release of hostages taken by Hamas and for humanitarian aid to get to Gaza. Francis repeated that he calls the Catholic parish in Gaza every day to see how they are doing. ___ Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

Norway is mulling building a fence on its border with Russia, following Finland's example	HELSINKI (AP) — Norway may put a fence along part or all of the 198-kilometer (123-mile) border it shares with Russia, a minister said, a move inspired by a similar project in its Nordic neighbor Finland. 'A border fence is very interesting, not only because it can act as a deterrent but also because it contains sensors and technology that allow you to detect if people are moving close to the border,' Justice Minister Emilie Enger Mehl said in an interview with the Norwegian public broadcaster NRK published late Saturday. She said the Norwegian government is currently looking at 'several measures' to beef up security on the border with Russia in the Arctic north, such as fencing, increasing the number of border staff or stepping up monitoring. The Storskog border station, which has witnessed only a handful of illegal border crossing attempts in the past few years, is the only official crossing point into Norway from Russia. Should the security situation in the delicate Arctic area worsen, the Norwegian government is ready to close the border on short notice, said Enger Mehl, who visited neighboring Finland this summer to learn about how the entire 1,340-kilometer (830-mile) Finnish-Russian land border was closed. The Finnish government was prompted to close all crossing points from Russia to Finland in late 2023 after more than 1,300 third-country migrants without proper documentation or visas — an unusually high number — entered the country in three months, just months after the nation became a member of NATO. To prevent Moscow using migrants in what the Finnish government calls Russia’s 'hybrid warfare,' Helsinki is currently building fences with a total length of up to 200 kilometers (124 miles) in separate sections along the border zone that makes up part of NATO’s northern flank and serves as the European Union’s external border. Finnish border officials say fences equipped with top-notch surveillance equipment — to be located mostly around crossing points — are needed to better monitor and control any migrants attempting to cross over from Russia and give officials time to react. Inspired by Finland’s project, Enger Mehl said that such a fence could also be a good idea for Norway. According to NRK, her statement was supported by police chief Ellen Katrine Hætta in Norway’s northern Finnmark county. 'It’s a measure that may become relevant on all or part of the border' between Norway and Russia, Enger Mehl said. The Storskog border station is currently surrounded by a 200-meter (660-foot) -long and 3.5-meter (12-foot) -high fence erected in 2016 after some 5,000 migrants and asylum-seekers had crossed over from Russia to Norway a year earlier. Norway, a nation of 5.6 million, is a NATO member but isn't part of the European Union. However, it belongs to the EU's Schengen area, whose participants have abolished border controls at their mutual borders, guaranteeing free movement of citizens.	https://apnews.com/article/norway-russia-border-fence-finland-migrants-arctic-dad4878a24fa550dd9eac9d1a6532274	2024-09-29T04:56:55-07:00	
Profiles in clean energy: Former Shell VP helps create a new way of making clean electricity	When Cindy Taff was a vice president at the giant oil and gas company Shell in Houston, her middle schooler Brianna would sometimes look over her shoulder as she worked from home. 'Why are you still working in oil and gas?' her daughter asked more than once. 'Is there a future in it? Why aren’t you moving into something clean?' The words weighed on Taff. 'As a parent you want to give direction, and was I giving her the right direction?' she recalled. At Shell, Taff was in charge of drilling wells and bringing them into production. She worked on oil and natural gas that's called unconventional in the industry, because the oil or natural gas is difficult to get out of the ground — it doesn't naturally gush out like in movies. It's a term often used for oily shale rock. Taff was somewhat unconventional for the industry, too. Her coworkers used to tease her for driving an efficient hybrid. 'You’re not helping oil and gas prices by driving a Prius,' they'd say. ______ EDITOR’S NOTE: This is part of an occasional series of personal stories from the energy transition — the change away from a fossil-fuel based world that largely causes climate change. ______ Taff wanted Shell to pursue the energy that comes from the Earth's natural heat — geothermal. Her team looked into it, but Shell never greenlit any of those projects, saying it would take too much time to recoup the investment. When Brianna went to college, she was passionate about energy too, but she wanted to work on renewables. After her sophomore year, in the summer of 2020, she got an internship at a geothermal company — one that in fact had just been launched by Taff's former colleagues at Shell — Sage Geosystems in Houston. Now it was Taff looking over her daughter's shoulder and asking question as she worked from home during the pandemic. And Sage executives were talking to Brianna, too. 'We could use your mom here,' they said. 'Can you get her to come work for us?' Brianna recalled recently. That's how Cindy Taff left her 36-year career at Shell to become chief operating officer at Sage. 'I didn't understand why Shell wasn't pursuing it,' she said about applying the company's drilling expertise to heat energy. 'Then I got this great opportunity to pivot from oil and gas and work with these guys that I have the utmost respect for. And also, I wanted to make my daughter proud, quite frankly.' Brianna Byrd, now 24, is the operations engineer and spokesperson at the company. She's glad her mother, now CEO, left oil and gas. 'Of course I’m biased, she’s my mom, but I don’t think Sage would be where it is without her,' she said. The United States is a world leader in electricity made from geothermal energy, but this kind of electricity still accounts for less than half a percent of the nation’s total large-scale generation, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. In 2023, most geothermal electricity came from California, Nevada, Utah, Hawaii, Oregon, Idaho and New Mexico, where there are reservoirs of steam, or very hot water, close to the surface. The Energy Department estimates this next generation of geothermal projects, like what Sage is doing, could provide some 90 gigawatts by 2050 — enough to power 65 million homes or more. That hinges on private investment, and on companies like Sage introducing this form of energy to regions where, until now, it’s been thought to be impossible. How it works Sage has two main technologies: The first makes electricity out of heat. The company drills wells and fractures hot, dry rock. Then electric pumps push water into those fractures, heating it up, and the hot water gets jettisoned to the surface where it spins a turbine. But a funny thing happened during testing in Starr County, Texas. In late 2021, the team realized much of their technology could also be used to store energy. If that works, it could be a big deal. Currently, to store energy at large scale, the United States is adding batteries, mostly lithium-ion type, to solar and wind projects, so they can charge up and send electricity back to the electric grid when the sun is not shining or the wind is not blowing. These batteries typically supply four hours maximum power. Sage envisions some of its technology placed at solar and wind farms, too. When electricity demand is low, they'll use extra energy from a solar or wind farm to run electric pumps, pumping water into the underground fractures, leaving it there until demand for electricity increases — storing the energy beneath the Earth's surface for hours, days or even weeks. It's a novel way to use the technology, said Silviu Livescu, lead author on a report looking at the future of geothermal in Texas. Livescu knows Taff and has followed the company's progress. 'It’s the right moment for companies like Sage with a purpose, with a mission and with the technology to show that geothermal indeed is the energy source we need to address climate change,' said Livescu, who co-founded a different geothermal startup in Austin, Texas. These days, Taff is often out in front, talking with politicians and policymakers about the potential of geothermal. She attended the United Nations COP28 climate talks last year to share her vision for this kind of energy. Sage has raised $30 million so far and is growing. It's building a small (3-megawatt), geothermal energy storage system at San Miguel Electric Cooperative, Inc., south of San Antonio this year. It's working with U.S. military facilities in Texas that see geothermal as a way to power their bases securely. Sage recently announced partnerships for heating communities in Bucharest, Romania; clean electricity from geothermal for Meta's data centers, and energy storage and geothermal projects in California. The company is final-testing a proprietary turbine to more efficiently convert heat to electricity. Because of her oil and gas background, Taff said she knows geothermal will only be adopted widely if the cost comes down. The mantra at Sage is: It's going to be clean and it's going to be cheap. She's excited to be working in a field she feels is on the cusp of playing a big role in cleaning and stabilizing the electrical grid. 'I’ve never looked back,' she said. 'I love what I’m doing and I think it’s going to be transformative.' ___ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Humanitarians enlist entertainers and creators to reach impassioned youth during United Nations week	NEW YORK (AP) — A lively discussion broke out backstage during Climate Week NYC between a TikTok comedian, a buzzed-about actress, a Latin cuisine entrepreneur and a cooking content creator. Convened by World Food Program USA to educate the panel's audiences — over 1.8 million Instagram followers combined — about hunger, the four weighed best practices for authentically breaking down weighty topics on social media. 'I want to force myself to be more active on TikTok,' said ' Avatar: The Way of Water ' star Bailey Bass. Users 'have a thought, and they are talking on their phone, and they post it. It feels very palpable.' 'But how do you know this is true?' asked Manolo Gonzalez Vergara, who co-founded the culinary brand Toma with his mother and actress Sofia Vergara. 'This is just a person talking.' 'But it’s someone you can relate with, so there’s a level of trust,' added Drea Okeke, a Nigerian-American engineer turned social media star with over 6 million TikTok followers. The exchange underscored the questions faced by the humanitarian establishment as they try to reach younger, more environmentally conscious generations who — they routinely acknowledged throughout the many events unfolding this week alongside the United Nations General Assembly in New York — are tasked with digging the world out of the hole left by years of climate inaction. Billionaire Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates acknowledged as much at a Thursday Q&amp;A promoting his new Netflix show. 'We have left some real challenges for this next generation,' acknowledged Gates, who runs one of the world’s largest philanthropic foundations. Young people with large online followings can be good 'placeholders' for older institutions seeking relevance with new generations, said Wawa Gatheru. The Kenyan-American activist regularly uses Instagram to promote Black Girl Environmentalist, the national community she founded to diversify the climate movement’s leadership pipeline. But Gatheru cautioned against looping 'any young person who is visible online as an influencer' or, alternatively, cheapening youth leaders’ expertise simply because they are active online. 'In order to do it well and effectively and not be tokenistic, it’s so important to see young people as collaborators, young people as capable,' she told The Associated Press. 'Content creator' lanyards hung from some Clinton Global Initiative attendees’ necks in a new feature of the yearly gathering hosted by the former First Family's philanthropic foundation. The two-day event marked the first time that organizers intentionally dedicated space for influencers to collaborate. It came from the recognition that creators help shape how 'millions of people relate to others and understand their world,' according to Clinton Foundation Chief Brand and Digital Officer Francesca Ernst-Khan. There, during a conversation about diverse storytelling’s impact on social movements, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton asked Shonda Rhimes how to propel people toward action when their attention is splintered across so many different platforms. Rhimes, the award-winning showrunner behind television hits 'Scandal' and 'Grey’s Anatomy,' said that 'if you can entertain people, you can teach them anything.' Supplementary videos on apps like TikTok, she said, can reach people that the original content was 'never going to reach.' 'If you can place an emotional narrative on any issue — if you can put a face to it, if you can create a character for it, if you can show a struggle that inspires — you can really grab someone’s attention,' Rhimes said. It's an approach long championed by Global Citizen, the international antipoverty nonprofit that returned to New York's Central Park on Saturday for its annual music festival headlined this year by Post Malone. Emceed by longtime ambassador Hugh Jackman, the festival featured appearances from celebrities and new commitments from world leaders. Bill Nye 'The Science Guy,' renowned conservationist Jane Goodall and DJ Khaled all graced the stage at different points. English pop star Ed Sheeran surprised the crowd by performing several hits with Coldplay’s Chris Martin in an unbilled late-night set. The event generated $1 billion, according to Global Citizen. Denmark Minister of Finance Nicolai Wammen announced his nation would send over $491 million to the World Bank’s International Development Association. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen pledged a combined $530 million for global vaccine alliance Gavi and food-focused humanitarian aid. Organizers focused on mobilizing young people and offered free entry on the mobile app in exchange for acts such as volunteering or signing petitions. 'I know so many of you joined me in taking action to earn your tickets to be here tonight,' Grammy-winning rapper-singer Doja Cat said in the middle of her set. 'But we can't stop now. Please keep using your voice to help those fleeing violence to get the food, shelter and education they need and very, very much deserve.' Calls to action are needed more often in online spaces, according to Navin Durbhakula. The Harvard senior's nonprofit seeks to build more sustainable food systems. Durbhakula finds that much of the climate-related information shared on social media is 'geared towards cynicism,' which he said is an important 'wake-up call.' 'We know that there are not many things that we can do as people who are young and probably don't have access to the same spaces' as professionals,' he said. 'But how do we use our voice to raise awareness, to spread more of the important information?' The four members of the World Food Program USA's Zero Hunger Activist Council shared clips over the weekend from their Climate Week panel. Bass said WFP — which describes itself as the largest humanitarian organization implementing school-meal programs — has very little name recognition despite its vast work. Bass said it's especially 'vital' to spread its message because WFP does not have the funds to meet its current goals. Rebecca Middleton, World Food Program USA's chief advocacy and engagement officer, said the goal is to leverage young peoples' influence across age ranges. 'They get a sense of frustration with some of the older generations. I’m Gen X and we didn’t fix it,' she told AP. 'It’s not that Gen Z is going to fix it. But I think that Gen Z is going to be the catalyst for the solutions we’re looking for as a country and as a world.' ___ Associated Press coverage of philanthropy and nonprofits receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

AP images offer a close-up look at the smoldering site of Nasrallah's assassination	BEIRUT (AP) — More than two days after a massive Israeli airstrike that killed the leader of the Hezbollah militant group, smoke is still rising from the smoldering wreckage. Israel said the Friday night strike targeted a meeting at an underground Hezbollah compound. The blasts leveled multiple high-rise apartment towers in the densely populated predominantly Shiite southern Beirut suburb known as Dahiyeh. Hezbollah confirmed in a statement Saturday that its longtime leader, Hassan Nasrallah, was killed in the strike — a huge blow for the group he had led for 32 years. On Sunday, Associated Press journalists saw smoke still rising over the rubble as people flocked to the site, some to check on what’s left of their homes, others to pay respects and pray. Some were there to simply inspect the destruction. Residents of Beirut heard up to 10 explosions following the Friday strike that targeted an area greater than a city block, reducing several residential buildings to a jumble of pancaked concrete and twisted steel. The buildings sank into the ground, leaving a cleared-out area bigger than a soccer field. Israel on Saturday released videos it said were of the warplanes that took part in the strike, showing at least eight F-15Is, but it didn't provide any comment on the type or number of bombs used. Experts said the blasts and destruction left behind were consistent with the 2,000-pound (900-kilogram) -class bombs, likely designed to explode after penetrating structures. Onlookers at the site Sunday clambered over large slabs of concrete, surrounded by high piles of twisted metal and wreckage. Several craters, likely used by rescuers to penetrate under the site of the explosion were visible, some of them apparently up to 30 meters (100 feet) deep. A few Hezbollah workers were using a bulldozer to excavate around one of the craters, some of them apparently dug by rescuers to reach the dead. State security and investigators were nowhere to be seen. The AP footage provided one of the closest looks at the site of the assassination and the extent of the destruction it caused. So far, six deaths have been confirmed at the site, along with dozens of injuries, but it is not clear if the diggers are still looking for bodies. Some people on the scene Sunday said their relatives were still missing. A woman wearing the black head-to-toe robe known as the chador stood on one side, reading from the Islamic holy book, the Quran, as a group of bystanders sobbed. One man collapsed in tears after seeing the immense destruction. 'Ya Sayyed, Ya Sayyed!' he cried, his head resting against a wall, as he referred to Nasrallah by his honorific title. 'Our morale is high and the struggle shall continue,' said Ali Rahhal, 30. 'From here, from the heart of Dahiyeh, we say ‘labbayka ya, Nasrallah’,' he said. The Arabic phrase, which means 'at your service, Nasrallah,' was often chanted by supporters at Hezbollah rallies. ___ Associated Press writer Fadi Tawil contributed reporting.	https://apnews.com/article/lebanon-hezbollah-beirut-nasrallah-israel-airstrike-dahiyeh-7ebf675d75e4d49c7b307864cdbc7dc1	2024-09-29T03:14:14-07:00	
U.S. airstrikes on Syria kill 37 militants affiliated with extremist groups	BEIRUT (AP) — In Syria, 37 militants affiliated to the extremist Islamic State group and an al-Qaeda-linked group were killed in two strikes, the United States military said Sunday. Two of the dead were senior militants, it said. U.S. Central Command said it struck northwestern Syria on Tuesday, targeting a senior militant from the al-Qaeda-linked Hurras al-Deen group and eight others. They say he was responsible for overseeing military operations. They also announced a strike from earlier this month on Sept. 16, where they conducted a 'large-scale airstrike' on an IS training camp in a remote undisclosed location in central Syria. That attack killed 28 militants, including 'at least four Syrian leaders.' 'The airstrike will disrupt ISIS’ capability to conduct operations against U.S. interests, as well as our allies and partners,' the statement read. There are some 900 U.S. forces in Syria, along with an undisclosed number of contractors, mostly trying to prevent any comeback by the extremist IS group, which swept through Iraq and Syria in 2014, taking control of large swaths of territory. U.S. forces advise and assist their key allies in northeastern Syria, the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, located not far from strategic areas where Iran-backed militant groups are present, including a key border crossing with Iraq.	https://apnews.com/article/syria-militants-killed-airstrike-us-central-command-8921f045b25d621143778730d78bd4e4	2024-09-29T02:20:30-07:00	
Could a doping probe strip Salt Lake City of the 2034 Olympics? The IOC president says it's unlikely	PARK CITY, Utah (AP) — In his first visit back to Utah since awarding Salt Lake City the 2034 Winter Games, the International Olympic Committee president sought to ease worries that the city could lose its second Olympics if organizers don't fulfill an agreement to play peacemaker between anti-doping authorities. Thomas Bach on Saturday downplayed the gravity of a termination clause the IOC inserted into Salt Lake City’s host contract in July that threatens to pull the 2034 Games if the U.S. government does not respect 'the supreme authority' of the World Anti-Doping Agency. Olympic officials also extracted assurances from Utah politicians and U.S. Olympic leaders that they would urge the federal government to back down from an investigation into a suspected doping coverup. Utah bid leaders, already in Paris for the signing ceremony, hastily agreed to the IOC's conditions to avoid delaying the much anticipated announcement. Bach characterized the contract language Saturday as a demonstration of the IOC's confidence that the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency will fall in line with WADA. He implied that WADA, not the Olympic committee, would be responsible in the unlikely occasion that Salt Lake City loses the Winter Games. 'This clause is the advice to our friends in Salt Lake that a third party could make a decision which could have an impact on our partnership,' Bach said. Tensions have grown between WADA and its American counterpart as the U.S. government has given itself greater authority to crack down on doping schemes at international events that involve American athletes. U.S. officials have used that power to investigate WADA itself after the global regulator declined to penalize nearly two dozen Chinese swimmers who tested positive for performance-enhancing drugs at the Tokyo Olympics in 2021. With its contract curveball, the IOC attempted to use its little leverage to ensure that WADA would be the lead authority on doping cases in Olympic sports when the U.S. hosts in 2028 and 2034. Salt Lake City's eagerness to become a repeat host — and part of a possible permanent rotation of Winter Olympic cities — is a lifeline for the IOC as climate change and high operational costs have reduced the number of cities willing and able to welcome the Winter Games. The Utah capital was the only candidate for 2034 after Olympic officials gave it exclusive negotiating rights last year. Utah bid leaders should have the upper hand, so why did they agree to the IOC's demands? Gene Sykes, chairman of the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee, said he doesn't view the late change to the host contract as a strong-arm tactic, but rather a 'reasonable accommodation' that secured the bid for Utah and brought him to the table as a mediator between agencies. He expects the end result will be a stronger anti-doping system for all. 'It would have been incredibly disturbing if the Games had not been awarded at that time,' Sykes told The Associated Press. 'There were 150 people in the Utah delegation who’d traveled to Paris for the single purpose of being there when the Games were awarded. So this allowed that to happen in a way that we still feel very confident does not put Utah at any real risk of losing the Games.' 'The IOC absolutely does not want to lose Utah in 2034,' he added. Sykes is involved in an effort to help reduce tensions between WADA and the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency, while making sure the U.S. stands firm in its commitment to the world anti-doping system that WADA administers. The White House's own director of national drug control policy, Rahul Gupta, sits on WADA's executive committee, but the global agency this month has tried to bar Gupta from meetings about the Chinese swimmers case. For Fraser Bullock, the president and CEO of Salt Lake City's bid committee, any friction between regulators and government officials has not been felt on a local level. His decades-long friendship with Bach and other visiting Olympic leaders was on full display Saturday as he toured them around the Utah Olympic Park in Park City. 'There's no tension — just excitement about the future of the Games and the wonderful venues and people of Utah,' Bullock told the AP. 'We are 100%.'	https://apnews.com/article/utah-winter-olympics-doping-investigation-5a8ec7f335acfa2d8d86b2dbb147624b	2024-09-29T01:11:34-07:00	
Russia downs over 100 Ukrainian drones in one of the largest barrages of the war	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — More than 100 Ukrainian drones were shot down over Russia Sunday, officials said, sparking a wildfire and setting an apartment block alight in one of the largest barrages seen over Russian skies since Moscow invaded Ukraine in February 2022. Russia’s Ministry of Defense reported that it had shot down 125 drones overnight across seven regions. The southwestern region of Volgograd came under particularly heavy fire, with 67 Ukrainian drones reportedly downed by Russian air defenses. Seventeen drones were also seen over Russia’s Voronezh region, where falling debris damaged an apartment block and a private home, said Gov. Aleksandr Gusev. Images on social media showed flames rising from the windows of the top floor of a high-rise building. No casualties were reported. A further 18 drones were reported over Russia’s Rostov region, where falling debris sparked a wildfire, said Gov. Vasily Golubev. He said that the fire did not pose a threat to populated areas, but that emergency services were fighting to extinguish the blaze, which had engulfed 20 hectares (49.4 acres) of forest. Russian ground assault warnings Elsewhere, 16 civilians were injured in an overnight barrage on the southern Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia after Ukrainian military leaders warned that Moscow could be preparing for a new military offensive in the country’s south. The city was targeted by Russian guide bombs in 10 separate attacks that damaged a high-rise building and several residential homes, regional Gov. Ivan Fedorov wrote on his official Telegram channel. More people could still be trapped beneath the rubble, he said. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy also said that the Zaporizhzhia attack had damaged the city's transport links. 'Today, Russia struck Zaporizhzhia with aerial bombs. Ordinary residential buildings were damaged and the entrance of one building was destroyed. The city’s infrastructure and railway were also damaged,' Zelenskyy said in a post on X. The Ukrainian leader appeared Sunday at a memorial service to make the 83rd anniversary of the Babyn Yar massacre, one of the most infamous mass slaughters of World War II. Babyn Yar, a ravine in the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, is where nearly 34,000 Jews were killed within 48 hours in 1941 when the city was under Nazi occupation. 'Babyn Yar is vivid proof of the atrocities that regimes are capable of when led by leaders who rely on intimidation and violence. At any time, they are no different,' Zelenskyy said in a statement. 'But the world’s response should be different. This is the lesson the world should have learned. We must guard humanity, life, and justice.' The Ukrainian military warned Saturday that Russian forces may be preparing for offensive operations in the wider Zaporizhzhia region. Vladyslav Voloshyn, spokesperson for Ukraine’s southern military command, said that Russia was amassing personnel in this direction. Ukraine’s air force also reported that 22 Russian drones were launched over the country overnight. It said that 15 were shot down in Ukraine’s Sumy, Vinnytsia, Mykolaiv, and Odesa regions, and that five more were destroyed using electronic defenses. The fate of the remaining two drones was not specified. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-drone-attacks-voronezh-rostov-zaporizhzhia-f998200f2d4aee0ea7cbbe5725ed907a	2024-09-29T00:47:29-07:00	
Hezbollah confirms a 7th top commander was killed in Israeli strikes in recent days	JERUSALEM (AP) — The Israeli military said Sunday it has killed another high-ranking Hezbollah official in an airstrike as the Lebanese militant group was reeling from a string of devastating blows and the killing of its overall leader, Hassan Nasrallah. The military said Nabil Kaouk, the deputy head of Hezbollah's Central Council, was killed on Saturday. Hezbollah confirmed his death, making him the seventh senior Hezbollah leader slain in Israeli strikes in a little over a week. They include founding members who had evaded death or detention for decades. The Israeli military said it carried out another targeted strike on Beirut later on Sunday, with details to follow. Hezbollah had earlier confirmed that Ali Karaki, another senior commander, died in Friday's strike that killed Nasrallah. The Israeli military had earlier said that Karaki was killed in the airstrike, which targeted an underground compound in Beirut where Nasrallah and other senior Hezbollah figures were meeting. The military said at least 20 other Hezbollah militants were killed in the strike, including two close associates of Nasrallah, one of whom was in charge of his security detail. Hezbollah has also been targeted by a sophisticated attack on its pagers and walkie-talkies that was widely blamed on Israel. A wave of Israeli airstrikes across large parts of Lebanon has killed at least 1,030 people — including 156 women and 87 children — in less than two weeks, according to Lebanon's Health Ministry. Hundreds of thousands of people have been driven from their homes in Lebanon by the lastest strikes. The government estimates that around 250,000 are in shelters, with three to four times as many staying with friends or relatives, or camping out on the streets, Environment Minister Nasser Yassin told The Associated Press. Hezbollah has continued to fire rockets and missiles into northern Israel, but most have been intercepted or fallen in open areas. No Israelis have been killed since the latest wave of strikes on top Hezbollah leaders began on Sept. 20. Kaouk was a veteran member of Hezbollah going back to the 1980s and served as Hezbollah's military commander in southern Lebanon during the 2006 war with Israel. He often appeared in local media, where he would comment on politics and security developments, and he gave eulogies at the funerals of senior militants. The United States had announced sanctions against him in 2020. Hezbollah began firing rockets, missiles and drones into northern Israel after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack out of Gaza triggered the war there. Hezbollah and Hamas are allies that consider themselves part of an Iran-backed 'Axis of Resistance' against Israel. Israel has responded with waves of airstrikes, and the conflict has steadily ratcheted up to the brink of all-out war, raising fears of a region-wide conflagration. Israel says it is determined to return some 60,000 of its citizens to communities in the north that were evacuated nearly a year ago. Hezbollah has said it will only halt its rocket fire if there is a cease-fire in Gaza, which has proven elusive despite months of indirect negotiations between Israel and Hamas led by the United States, Qatar and Egypt. ___ Chehayeb reported from Beirut. ___ Follow AP’s war coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war	https://apnews.com/article/israel-lebanon-hezbollah-gaza-09-29-2024-4696e581e28d8c747f017221f2cf420f	2024-09-29T00:09:33-07:00	
Pope wraps troubled visit to Belgium by praising victims and demanding abusers be judged	BRUSSELS (AP) — Pope Francis demanded Sunday that sexually abusive clergy be judged and their bishops stop covering up their crimes as he ended a troubled visit to Belgium by responding to the outrage over the scandal here that has devastated the church’s credibility. 'Evil must not be hidden. Evil must be brought out into the open,' Francis told some 30,000 people at Belgium’s sports stadium, drawing applause repeatedly as the crowd took in what he was saying. Francis deviated from his prepared homily to respond to the meeting he held with 17 abuse survivors on Friday night, where he heard first-hand of the trauma and suffering they endured and the tone-deaf response of the church when they reported the crimes. Belgium has had a wretched legacy of abuse and cover-up, none more symbolic of the church's hypocrisy than the case of Bruges Bishop Roger Vangheluwe. He was allowed to quietly retire in 2010 after he admitted that he had sexually abused his nephew for 13 years. Francis only defrocked him this year — 14 years later — in a move clearly seen as finally dealing with a problem before his arrival in Belgium. Once here, he couldn't escape the criticism. Belgium’s king demanded the church work 'incessantly' to clean up the scandal, and the prime minister insisted that victims’ needs be placed first, in a remarkable dressing-down from the leadership of the once-staunchly Catholic country. 'In the church there is room for everyone, everyone, but everyone will be judged and there is no place for abuse. There is no place for the covering up of abuse,' Francis said in his homily. 'I ask the bishops not to cover up abuse. Condemn the abusers and help them to recover from this disease of abuse.' Expressions of outrage from Belgium's leaders Francis’ visit to Belgium was always going to be difficult, given the country’s history of clerical sexual abuse and overall secularizing trends which have emptied its majestic cathedrals and churches. But it’s unclear if he or his entourage expected such sharp public expressions of outrage or the pointed calls for reform from Belgium's intellectual elite. The main reason for the trip was to celebrate the 600th anniversary of the Leuven/Louvain Catholic University, the oldest Catholic university in the world and long the Vatican’s academic fiefdom in Belgium. But the rector of the Dutch campus told Francis that the abuse scandal had so harmed the church’s moral authority that it would do best to reform if it wants to regain credibility and relevance. Rector Luc Sels suggested that opening up greater roles for women – including the priesthood – and being more welcoming to LGBTQ+ Catholics would be a good place to start. Francis heard a similar call from the Francophone campus, where students staged a reading of an articulated critique of his landmark environmental encyclical 'Praised Be' in which they called for a 'paradigm shift' in the way the church views women. They noted that the encyclical virtually ignores women, cites no female theologians and contributes to women's 'invisibility' in the church and society. Women have long complained they have a second-class status in the church, barred from the priesthood and positions of power despite doing the lion’s share of the work educating the young, caring for the sick and passing on the faith. Catholic university rebukes the pope for his views on women Francis, an 87-year-old Argentine Jesuit, said he liked what they said. But he repeated his frequent refrain about women being the 'fertile' nurturers who complement men, and that regardless 'the church is woman.' His words drew a remarkable rebuke from the Catholic university that invited him. As soon as he finished speaking, Louvain issued a statement expressing its 'incomprehension and disapproval' of his views on women, which it said were 'deterministic and reductive.' 'We cannot agree on his position for sure,' said rector Françoise Smets. 'We are fighting against discrimination for women, and we would like women to have another role in the society and in the church also.' Valentine Hendrix, a 22-year-old international relations masters student at Louvain, told reporters that students had hoped that Francis might respond positively to their appeal. While others applauded at the end of Francis' remarks, she refused and said his comments on abortion and women’s role meant that he had 'given up on a committed dialogue.' 'We had expectations, even if we saw that he disappointed us in just a few hours,' she said. Francis has made several reforms during his 11-year pontificate, allowing women to serve as acolytes, giving them the vote in his periodic synods, or meetings, and appointing several women to high-ranking positions in the Vatican. He has said women must have greater decision-making roles in the church. But he has ruled out ordaining women as priests and has refused so far to budge on demands to allow women to serve as deacons, who perform many of the same tasks as priests. He has taken the women’s issue off the table for debate at the Vatican’s upcoming three-week synod because it’s too thorny to be dealt with in such a short time. He has punted it to theologians and canonists to chew over into next year. ___ Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

Climate change and harsh weather in France bring challenges to Chablis wine country	LIGNORELLES, France (AP) — On a brisk late September morning in the heart of Chablis wine country, grape pickers haul large and heavy buckets over their shoulders, drenched in sweat as they climb the very steep slope of the Vau de Vey vineyard. It's the final day of the harvest at the Domaine Roland Lavantureux winery, and workers are handpicking the last of the prized Chardonnay grapes that will eventually be transformed into the bright and high-end Premier Cru that is bottled by the estate. But wine lovers around the world may struggle to get their hands on the 2024 'millesime' — wine that comes from a single year's harvest. It will be available in smaller quantities than usual. Much of France’s wine country faced one of the wettest years on record in 2024 so far amid a changing climate, after years of challenges to vineyards and wine quality caused by drought and heat. At the Lavantureux estate, the picking lasted just nine days — about half the usual time — after a year of unpredictably harsh weather marked by frost, hail, record rainfall and the spread of a dangerous fungus that has left Chablis growers on edge. 'I have been working here since 2010. This is my most difficult year,' says winemaker David Lavantureux, who follows in the footsteps of his father Roland, a winemaker himself. 'And all the old-timers will tell you the same thing. It’s been a very difficult year because the weather has been so unpredictable. We have not been spared a single thing.' The ordeal began in April with the frost. Then in May, a double hailstorm pummeled the region. Then came relentless rain, right up to the harvest. According to the Burgundy wine federation, some 1,000 hectares (nearly 2,500 acres) of vines in the Chablis country were affected by the May storm. And the excess moisture allowed a destructive mildew fungus to thrive. Disease devastates the vineyard Once entrenched, the disease causes huge crop losses and can also affect wine quality. Together with his brother Arnaud, David fought hard to try and control mildew with various treatments, which were washed away by the rain and didn't prove effective. 'On our estate, we’re looking at losses of 60 to 65%,' David Lavantureux said. 'It’s going to be a low-yield year.' The weather impact wasn't confined to the Lavantureux estate. Wet conditions across France have wreaked havoc on many wine-growing regions this year. Mildew, combined with episodes of frost and hail, have reduced overall production. The French ministry of agriculture estimates that it will amount to 39.3 million hectoliters, below both 2023 levels (-18%) and the average for the past five years (-11%). 'It’s been a very tough year, both physically and mentally,' Arnaud says. 'We’re relieved the harvest is over. I'm exhausted.' The challenges of this year will inevitably influence the wines produced at the family winery, resulting in a 2024 vintage with distinct characteristics. 'Balances are not at all the same,' adds Arnaud. 'There’s more acidity. Maturity is less optimal. But the goal is to craft the wine so that, in the end, the balance is as perfect as possible.' Adapting to a changing climate Located in the northern part of the Bourgogne region, the vineyards of Chablis have traditionally benefited from a favorable climate — cold winters, hot summers and annual rainfall between 650-700 millimeters (25-27 inches). But climate change is altering those conditions, bringing unseasonably mild weather, more abundant rainfall, and recurrent spring frosts that were less common in the past. The frost damage is particularly frustrating. A similar phenomenon hit French vineyards in recent years, leading to big financial losses. And scientists believe the damaging 2021 frost was made more likely by climate change. 'There was a period when we thought that with global warming setting in, Chablis would be safe from frost,' David Lavantureux says. 'And finally, over the last 15 years, it’s come back even stronger.' To adapt, winemakers have been adopting creative solutions. Cutting the wines later helps delay bud burst and reduce the vulnerability to late frost, while keeping a larger foliage above the fruit shields the grapes from the scorching sun in hot summers. During frost threats, many growers use expensive methods such as lighting candles in the vineyards. They also install electric lines to warm the vines, or spray water on the buds to create a thin ice layer that ensures the blossom’s temperature remains around freezing point but doesn't dip much lower. Throughout the Burgundy region, anti-hail devices have also been deployed in a bid to lessen the intensity of hailstorms. 'It helps reduce risk, but it’s never 100% protection,' David Lavantureux says. 'We saw that again this year with several hailstorms, two of which were particularly severe.' Looking ahead Fortunately for the Lavantureux family, two very good years in 2022 and 2023 should help mitigate the financial losses induced by the reduced 2024 harvest as international demand for Chablis remains solid, especially in the United States. In June, the Burgundy wine association said that Chablis wine exports to the U.S. reached 3 million bottles, generating 368 million euros ($410 million), a 19% increase compared to the previous year. 'We’ve put this harvest behind us,' says Arnaud Lavantureux 'Now it's time to think on the next one.' ___ Marine Lesprit contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/climate-change-chablis-wine-france-84ffd41b546154acb8d2761a0b347ff8	2024-09-28T22:08:10-07:00	
At least 148 are dead in floods and landslides in Nepal	KATHMANDU, Nepal (AP) — Rescuers in Nepal recovered dozens of bodies from buses and other vehicles that were buried in landslides near the capital Kathmandu, as the death toll from flooding rose to at least 148 with dozens missing, officials said Sunday. The weather improved on Sunday following three days of monsoon rains, and rescue and clean-up efforts were underway. Kathmandu remained cut off Sunday as three highways out of the city were blocked by landslides. Rescuers retrieved 14 bodies overnight from two buses that were headed to Kathmandu when a landslide buried them. Another 23 bodies were dug out from vehicles Sunday on the same spot, about 16 kilometers (10 miles) from Kathmandu, and workers searched for others who may have been buried. A statement by the Nepal police said another 101 people were injured in the flooding and landslides while 50 are missing. The death toll was expected to rise as reports come in from villages across the mountainous country. Residents in the southern part of Kathmandu, which was inundated on Saturday, were cleaning up houses as water levels began to recede. At least 34 people were killed in Kathmandu, which was the hardest hit by flooding. Police and soldiers were assisting with rescue efforts, while heavy equipment was used to clear the landslides from the roads. The government announced it was closing schools and colleges across Nepal for the next three days. The monsoon season began in June and usually ends by mid-September.	https://apnews.com/article/nepal-kathmandu-floods-landslides-deaths-9e810fd32a53ca5bb0172438adcb21af	2024-09-28T19:56:14-07:00	
Hospital clowns bring joy to young Ukrainian cancer patients who survived Russian missile attack	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Their costumes are put on with surgical precision: Floppy hats, foam noses, bright clothes, and a ukulele with multicolored nylon strings. Moments later, in a beige hospital ward normally filled with the beeping sounds of medical machinery, there are bursts of giggles and silly singing. As Ukraine’s medical facilities come under pressure from intensifying attacks in the war against Russia's full-scale invasion, volunteer hospital clowns are duck-footing their way in to provide some badly needed moments of joy for hospitalized children. The 'Bureau of Smiles and Support' (BUP) is a hospital clowning initiative established in 2023 by Olha Bulkina, 35, and Maryna Berdar, 39, who already had more than five years of hospital clowning experience between them. 'Our mission is to let childhood continue regardless of the circumstances,' Bulkina, told The Associated Press. BUP took on new significance following a Russian missile strike on Okhmatdyt Children’s Hospital in Kyiv in July. The attack on Ukraine’s largest pediatric facility forced the evacuation of dozens of young patients, including those with cancer, to other hospitals in the capital – and the clowns did not stand aside. Together with first responders, Berdar and Bulkina helped with clearing the rubble after the attack and attended to the children who were relocated to other medical facilities. But even for them, the real heroes there were young patients. 'When the children were evacuated from Okhmatdyt after the missile attack, many of them were in extremely difficult medical conditions, but even in this situation they tried to support the adults,' said Berdar, recalling the events after the strike. The hospital clowns, who use traditional clown noses and bright costumes, are now visiting multiple hospitals in the Ukrainian capital region, including the National Cancer Institute, where patient numbers have surged after the Okhmatdyt attack. Tetiana Nosova, 22, and Vladyslava Kulinich, 22, are volunteer hospital clowns who go by Zhuzha and Lala and joined BUP more than a year ago. For them, hospital clowning is as challenging as it is rewarding. 'I volunteer so that children don’t think about their illness, even for a short moment, so that laughter replaces tears, and joy replaces fear, especially during medical procedures,' Kulinich said. In her practice, she stays together with children, sharing all their feelings, whether they are fear, pain, or joy. For Nosova, the process itself is what made her start clowning. 'I am motivated by joy. I simply enjoy it. All my life I studied to be an actress, all my life I enjoyed making people laugh. That’s enough motivation for me,' she said. In a city grappling with nightly air raid alerts and power outages, overworked doctors say the presence of the volunteers brings a much-needed distraction, often helping children who had been undergoing painful medical treatment to feel happy again. 'Clowns play a very important role in the treatment of children. They help distract the children, they help them forget about the pain, they help them not pay attention to the nurses or doctors who come to treat them,' Valentyna Mariash, a senior nurse on the Okhmatdyt cancer ward, told AP. The July attack complicated treatment plans for many families. Daria Vertetska, 34, was in Okhmatdyt with her 7-year-old daughter, Kira, when the missile exploded just outside their ward. Kira, who was diagnosed with rhabdomyosarcoma of the nasopharynx, was asleep, medicated with morphine. 'It saved her that she was covered with a blanket during the strike, but still, her head, legs, and arms were cut with small glass shards,' said Vertetska. She and Kira returned to Okhmatdyt in less than a week after the attack. Not all the children returned to the hospital. Some stayed in the medical facilities where they had been evacuated, while others were moved to apartments paid for by charity organizations and located in the hospital’s vicinity. Despite hospital clown initiatives like BUP across Ukraine, the need for their work grows exponentially. 'When I see how our work is needed in the large children’s hospitals located in Kyiv, I can only imagine what a great need there is in regional and district hospitals, where such (clown) activity, as for example in Okhmatdyt, to be honest, simply does not exist,' Berdar said. The World Health Organization, earlier this month, warned that the country faces a deepening public health crisis, largely due to devastating missile and drone strikes on the country’s electricity system as well as hospital infrastructure. Since the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022, WHO has recorded nearly 2,000 attacks on Ukraine’s health care facilities and says they are having a severe impact. Children are among the most vulnerable, but a mental health crisis affects the whole country. It means the clowns’ work has won broad support from medical professionals. Parents are simply happy to see a smile return to their children’s faces. 'With clowns, children learn to joke, they play with soap bubbles, their mood lifts. Today, Kira saw clowns playing the ukulele, now she wants one, too,' said her mother, Daria. ___ Associated Press writer Derek Gatopoulos contributed to this report. ___ Follow AP's coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine	https://apnews.com/article/ukraine-russia-war-hospital-clowns-children-okhmatdyt-7a5e88712053f7bb33e0983a7ecc21ab	2024-09-28T19:08:48-07:00	
Austrian far-right party hopes for its first national election win in a close race	VIENNA (AP) — Austria’s far-right Freedom Party could win a national election for the first time on Sunday, tapping into voters’ anxieties about immigration, inflation, Ukraine and other concerns following recent gains for the hard right elsewhere in Europe. Herbert Kickl, a former interior minister and longtime campaign strategist who has led the Freedom Party since 2021, wants to become Austria’s new chancellor. He has used the term 'Volkskanzler,' or chancellor of the people, which was used by the Nazis to describe Adolf Hitler in the 1930s. Kickl has rejected the comparison. But to become Austria's new leader, he would need a coalition partner to command a majority in the lower house of parliament. And a win isn’t certain, with recent polls pointing to a close race. They have put support for the Freedom Party at 27%, with the conservative Austrian People’s Party of Chancellor Karl Nehammer on 25% and the center-left Social Democrats on 21%. More than 6.3 million people age 16 and over are eligible to vote for the new parliament in Austria, a European Union member that has a policy of military neutrality. Kickl has achieved a turnaround since Austria’s last parliamentary election in 2019. In June, the Freedom Party narrowly won a nationwide vote for the first time in the European Parliament election, which also brought gains for other European far-right parties. In 2019, its support slumped to 16.2% after a scandal brought down a government in which it was the junior coalition partner. Then-vice chancellor and Freedom Party leader Heinz-Christian Strache resigned following the publication of a secretly recorded video in which he appeared to offer favors to a purported Russian investor. The far right has tapped into voter frustration over high inflation, the war in Ukraine and the Covid pandemic. It also been able to build on worries about migration. In its election program, the Freedom Party calls for 'remigration of uninvited foreigners,' and for achieving a more 'homogeneous' nation by tightly controlling borders and suspending the right to asylum via an 'emergency law.' Gernot Bauer, a journalist with Austrian magazine Profil who recently co-published an investigative biography of the far-right leader, said that under Kickl’s leadership, the Freedom Party has moved 'even further to the right,' as Kickl refuses to explicitly distance the party from the Identitarian Movement, a pan-European nationalist and far-right group. Bauer describes Kickl’s rhetoric as 'aggressive' and says some of his language is deliberately provocative. The Freedom Party also calls for an end to sanctions against Russia, is highly critical of western military aid to Ukraine and wants to bow out of the European Sky Shield Initiative, a missile defense project launched by Germany. The leader of the Social Democrats, a party that led many of Austria’s post-World War II governments, has positioned himself as the polar opposite to Kickl. Andreas Babler has ruled out governing with the far right and labeled Kickl 'a threat to democracy.' While the Freedom Party has recovered, the popularity of Nehammer’s People’s Party, which currently leads a coalition government with the environmentalist Greens as junior partners, has declined since 2019. During the election campaign, Nehammer portrayed his party, which has taken a tough line on immigration in recent years, as 'the strong center' that will guarantee stability amid multiple crises. But it is precisely these crises, ranging from the COVID-19 pandemic to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and resulting rising energy prices, that have cost the conservatives support, said Peter Filzmaier, one of Austria’s leading political scientists. Under their leadership, Austria has experienced high inflation averaging 4.2% over the past 12 months, surpassing the EU average. The government also angered many Austrians in 2022 by becoming the first European country to introduce a coronavirus vaccine mandate, which was scrapped a few months later without ever being put into effect. And Nehammer is the third chancellor since the last election, taking office in 2021 after predecessor Sebastian Kurz — the winner in 2019 — quit politics amid a corruption investigation. But the recent flooding caused by Storm Boris that hit Austria and other countries in Central Europe brought back the topic of the environment into the election debate and helped Nehammer slightly narrow the gap with the Freedom Party by presenting himself as a 'crisis manager,' Filzmaier said. Nehammer said in a video Thursday that 'this is about whether we continue together on this proven path of stability or leave the country to the radicals, who make a lot of promises and don't keep them.' The People’s Party is the far right’s only way into government. Nehammer has repeatedly excluded joining a government led by Kickl, describing him as a 'security risk' for the country, but hasn’t ruled out a coalition with the Freedom Party in and of itself, which would imply Kickl renouncing a position in government. The likelihood of Kickl agreeing to such a deal if he wins the election is very low, Filzmaier said. But should the People’s Party finish first, then a coalition between the People’s Party and the Freedom Party could happen, Filzmaier said. The most probable alternative would be a three-way alliance between the People’s Party, the Social Democrats and most likely the liberal Neos. ___ Associated Press videojournalist Philipp Jenne contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/austria-national-election-far-right-freedom-party-1a22057b230a2576e0ca0ee69607cf6e	2024-09-28T19:05:58-07:00	
Model makers in Madagascar are bringing history's long-lost ships back to life	ANTANANARIVO, Madagascar (AP) — A French trading ship that sank in the 17th century with treasure onboard is being brought back to life in a workshop in Madagascar with every stroke of Rafah Ralahy's small wood sander. Ralahy, eyes sparkling behind his glasses, has learned in 30 years as a craftsman at the Le Village model ship making company that recreating history in miniature form can't be rushed. It'll take time to get the shape of the hull just right on this model, to get it just as it was on the 1,000-ton original. The ship in question was called the Soleil d’Orient — the Eastern Sun — and it was one of the best in the French East India company. It sank in 1681 while carrying ambassadors and treasure sent by the King of Siam (now Thailand) to King Louis XIV of France. Anyone wanting an exact wooden replica from Le Village, albeit a few feet long, can get it for just over $2,500. That excludes the shipping costs. 'My job is to be as faithful as possible to the plan,' said 50-year-old Ralahy, referring to copies of the ships’ original building plans that Le Village acquires from maritime museums or other sources. 'At each stage we check so that the model we create is identical to the ship designed centuries ago.' Le Village has been making models of history's most famous vessels since 1993 and sending them to collectors across the world, some of them eminent. Prince Albert of Monaco has several models displayed in his palace, said Le Village co-owner Grégory Postel. The Spanish royal family also own Le Village creations. Pope Francis was gifted a model by Madagascar President Andry Rajoelina. Those royal customers are looking for a model ship 'that resembles what their ancestors knew,' said Postel, championing the company's attention to historic detail. Some of the high-end models sell for a princely sum of $10,000. Collectors with as much passion but less means can find something for around $150. Le Village has dozens of ships available for order, from celebrated to infamous to ill-fated. Some recently were shown at an exhibition in Venice, Italy, including one of the company’s showpieces, the British ship HMS Bounty that is renowned for a mutiny by its disgruntled crew. A model of perhaps the most famous ship ever, the Titanic, is of course available. Le Village's staff of more than two dozen model makers work in nine dusty workshops on the outskirts of the Madagascar capital of Antananarivo. Like Ralahy, many of them have been here for more than 20 years, crafting a reputation for an unusual company. Madagascar has hardly any shipbuilding tradition despite being the world's fourth largest island. So, Le Village's own story is one of endeavor. It was started by Frenchman Hervé Scrive, who arrived in Madagascar off the east coast of Africa with a passion. He sold it after 20 years to a family, but it hit choppy waters during the COVID-19 pandemic as Madagascar — already struggling with high levels of poverty — sank into a deep economic recession. Postel, his wife and another French couple bought it last year with the aim of bringing it out of financial trouble and, hopefully, expanding. Postel said they want to start a woodworking school to spread the craft on the island and create opportunities for others. They'd also like to build a maritime museum of their own. Ralahy, a house painter as a young man before finding another use for his nimble hands, sands the rough wood that will become the outer hull of the Soleil d’Orient model he’s started. Weeks of intricate work lie ahead for the team of crafters and some models take more than 1,000 hours of work. But the miniature sails will be hoisted on a new Soleil d’Orient nearly 350 years after tragedy befell the original and she sank with no survivors, sending her treasure to the ocean bottom. Each model passes through the different workshops and through the hands of different specialists. Husbands and wives work together at Le Village, as do other members of the same families. It's a tight-knit team. In another room, four women who craft and attach the tiny ropes, sails and other finishing touches, are working with a sense of urgency on one model. This one is nearing completion and has already been paid for. 'It’s a race,' said Alexandria Mandimbiherimamisoa as she gets mini flags ready to add to the ship. 'We have to send the boat to its buyer in a week.' Her husband, Tovo-Hery Andrianarivo, also works at Le Village, his fingernails blackened from a misplaced hammer blow or two over the years, an occupational hazard. He spoke of their collective pride when they see how far some of their models have traveled. Andrianarivo once watched a documentary on the recreation of a life-size version of the Hermione, an 18th-century frigate that carried French General Lafayette to the American War of Independence. It was rebuilt and launched again in 2014 to much fanfare. 'Behind the museum curator who was speaking, there was our model,' Andrianarivo said. 'The feeling I felt that day was incredible.' ___ For more news on Africa and development: https://apnews.com/hub/africa-pulse ___ The Associated Press receives financial support for global health and development coverage in Africa from the Gates Foundation.

What to know from the UN: China, Russia have their say, and a frog metaphor makes a cameo	UNITED NATIONS (AP) — China and Russia got their turns at the U.N. General Assembly podium on Saturday, but — per usual — their top leaders didn't speak. Instead, they turned to their foreign ministers, WANG YI and SERGEY LAVROV. Wang's speech, per usual for China at the U.N., didn't break much new ground. He weighed in on the importance of national sovereignty — a frequent talking point for Beijing — and insisted, as he usually does, that Taiwan incontrovertibly belongs to China. Wang warned fellow leaders against an 'expansion of the battlefield' in Russia’s war with Ukraine and said the Beijing government remains committed to shuttle diplomacy and efforts to push the conflict toward its end. He warned against other nations 'throwing oil on the fire or exploiting the situation for selfish gains,' a likely reference to the United States. Lavrov, meanwhile, waded into the topic of nukes three days after Russian President VLADIMIR PUTIN aired a shift in his country’s nuclear doctrine, 'I’m not going to talk here about the senselessness and the danger of the very idea of trying to fight to victory with a nuclear power, which is what Russia is,' he said. Later, holding court at a news conference, he accused the United States of seeking 'to preserve their hegemony and to govern everything.' He pointed to NATO’s deepening relations with four partners – New Zealand, Australia, South Korea and Japan — as well as the so-called Quad which groups the U.S., India, Australia and Japan. From the podium ELOQUENCE BLUE RIBBON: The leader of Grenada, DICKON MITCHELL, went personal in his speech about resilience, spinning it into a mini-memoir that started with his birth in a small hillside village without running water or electricity.

'My personal resilience, in the face of the many difficulties that crossed my path over the years, allowed me to achieve the dream I sought. Finally, I was in a position to give back to my community,' he said. But he emphasized: 'There is a limit to resilience.'

Hurricane Isaac and Tropical Storm Joyce move through the open Atlantic far from land	MIAMI (AP) — Hurricane Isaac was a Category 2 storm far from land in the North Atlantic on Saturday, while Tropical Storm Joyce continued its path over open water well to the east of the Caribbean. Isaac had maximum sustained winds of 100 mph (155 kph) and was about 645 miles (1,040 kilometers) west-northwest of the Azores archipelago, which lies west of mainland Portugal. It was moving toward the northeast at 18 mph (30 kph), according to the National Hurricane Center. Far to the south, Joyce had maximum sustained winds of 45 mph (75 kph), and its center was about 1,080 miles (1,735 kilometers) east of the Northern Leeward Islands, which are on the eastern ring of the Caribbean. It was heading to the west-northwest at 9 mph (15 kph), the hurricane center reported. Neither storm posed any threat to land, forecasters said, and both were expected to weaken in the coming days. Hurricane Helene, which made landfall as a Category 4 storm early Friday, left an enormous path of destruction across the southeastern United States and has left at least 56 dead.	https://apnews.com/article/tropical-weather-atlantic-hurricane-isaac-joyce-e877d4191f0b41c8eccbca631cc2bf32	2024-09-28T16:29:05-07:00	
Hermès brings unexpected autumnal hues to spring Paris spring collection with a geometric edge	PARIS (AP) — Nadege Vanhee-Cybulski set Hermès’ spring collection ablaze with golden beiges and autumnal hues, defying seasonal conventions. Sensual mesh, leather thin as air, and a touch of utilitarian chic came together in an elegantly modern vision. Hermès proved once again that luxury can be both adventurous and effortlessly refined. Here are some highlights of Saturday's ready-to-wear collections: Hermes' gentle geometry Nadège Vanhee-Cybulski’s Hermès collection reimagined spring with a palette of warm golden beiges and earthy autumnal hues, a bold choice that immediately set the collection apart. Gentle geometry shaped the garments — myriad squares and architectural forms that fused seamlessly with Hermès’ signature minimalism. This interplay was reinforced by the striking wooden backdrop, enhancing the atmosphere of sophisticated restraint. Vanhee-Cybulski leaned into a refined sensuality with sheer mesh trousers that transformed at a flick of a zip and featherweight leather jackets that seemed almost ethereal. These pieces paired athletic ease with luxury, demonstrating her skill in blending delicacy with bold, structured shapes. Utilitarian details, like buckled belts and boxy, pocket-laden shirts, underscored the collection’s grounding in practicality, even amid its more daring expressions of sensuality. Throughout, Vanhee-Cybulski captured the lightness that spring calls for—luxurious reinterpretations of Hermès’ iconic silk scarves, transformed into breezy shirtdresses and rompers, embodied a carefree spirit ready for sunlit escapes. Warm neutrals dominated, echoing a feeling of being sun-soaked, while her activewear-inspired pieces conveyed a relaxed, summer-ready attitude without compromising on elegance. The footwear, always a standout for Hermès, carried this ethos further. Sleek riding boots offered a solid foundation to the collection’s grounded luxury, while clog sandals brought a playful, modern twist. Westwood's controled chaos Vivienne Westwood’s spirit lived on in Paris this season, as Andreas Kronthaler brought a masterful interplay of rebellion, history, and glam rock energy to the runway. The spring collection opened with sparkling pants paired with a silky blue bodice, a nod to the late designer’s love of bold, unexpected contrasts—a brilliant start that practically screamed rock ‘n’ roll chic. Kronthaler clearly hasn’t lost his taste for the dramatic, diving headfirst into the kind of fierce, confrontational style that made Westwood an icon. A giant silver chain, dangling almost absurdly to the model’s knees, set the tone: a clear statement of raw, unapologetic power, in course with the punk ethos of the 80s that still courses through this house’s veins. And there, of course, were the signature Westwood suits and Grecian-style draped dresses—classic shapes that carried a dynamic energy and timeless rebellion, reminiscent of the archival references that have defined Kronthaler’s tenure. These silhouettes bore the same sense of timeless radicalism seen in Kronthaler’s reinterpretations of Westwood’s personal wardrobe last fall, where each garment seemed to transcend fleeting trends. Clashing checks—a staple of the Westwood lexicon—made their mark, giving the collection an urban, gritty edge that felt distinctly true to the house’s rebellious spirit. Whimsy had its moment in the shape of a giant tulle headpiece, soaring high and embodying an ’80s bridal punk vision—a dizzying height of contradiction that no one but Westwood’s house could make look so irreverently sophisticated. This playful chaos echoed past seasons, where Kronthaler has embraced an eclectic mishmash of themes—from historical doublets to modern macramé cloaks. This time, however, there was a sense of restraint. It was a more controlled affair, one that saw Kronthaler tightening his narrative, perhaps reflecting a shift toward emotional homage rather than spectacle alone. Elie Saab takes us on a sultry journey Elie Saab unveiled his spring collection on Saturday at the Palais de Tokyo, and let me tell you, any expectations of colonial nostalgia were swiftly blown away, just like the harmattan gusts he drew inspiration from. Instead, what we got was a mesmerizing journey through the African savannah that felt fresh, vibrant, and completely devoid of tired clichés. This was no ordinary safari chic—Saab took the concept and injected it with his signature luxury, letting it roar in all the right ways while keeping the camp firmly in check. Right from the start, Saab showed he wasn’t afraid to play with the safari staples—but with a twist. Safari suits, reimagined as roomy linen separates and sleek crepe jumpsuits, traded their usual khaki for the blazing red of fireball lilies, moody elephant gray, and the ochre dust of West Africa. It was a palette that brought the raw, natural beauty of the continent to life without falling into the predictable tropes. These looks weren’t the romanticized garb of the intrepid explorer; they were effortlessly chic, perfectly fitted for today’s cosmopolitan adventurer. Then came the raffia—oh, the raffia! Saab worked magic with this plant fiber, weaving it into low-slung skirts and minidresses with faint bubble hems that felt light and breezy, yet utterly luxurious. It also made an appearance as fern embroideries on floor-grazing tulle gowns, adding texture and depth that felt delightfully organic. It was these delicate, thoughtful touches that took this collection beyond just a thematic exercise and elevated it to something exquisite.	https://apnews.com/article/france-paris-fashion-week-408dc76f3d542340dc77daed228113db	2024-09-28T13:51:41-07:00	
Children learn to cooperate early, but world leaders at the UN struggle to get that done	NEW YORK (AP) — Our children are told when they're little: Play nicely. Work together. Don't hit. Use your words. Multiply that by nearly 200 countries, leaders of varied backgrounds and a preposterously complex set of 21st-century priorities and goals, and you come up with what exists in the world today: the United Nations. There, the word for 'play nicely' and 'work together' is a complex one — 'multilateralism' — and its goals often get lost in its syllables. But the principle remains the same: Unite to get more done, unite to offset bullies, unite to find outcomes that all can endorse and that benefit as many of the planet's human beings as possible — and can be the foundation for eventual lasting world peace. At the U.N. General Assembly this week, it's a principle that leaders — and, not surprisingly, leaders of smaller nations most of all — mention constantly. That's not just because the U.N. has stood for multilateralism since it rose from the dictator-inflicted rubble of World War II. It is because today, in an interconnected era where human fates lie more than ever in what other humans do in other places, cooperation isn't just an ideal but a necessary reality, whether anyone wants it or not. But the problem, many leaders say, is that despite the hope that the U.N. still offers, the aging model of multilateralism — 'a mirror that obstinately reflects the values of 1945,' according to Mexican Foreign Minister Alicia Bárcena — hasn't been retooled to be effective in an era it quite possibly never envisioned. 'We cannot ignore that our common multilateral progress is failing us in the hour of greatest need,' said Hilda Heine, president of the Marshall Islands. 'This old political shell of the post-1945 political order can barely contain the contradictions,' said Ralph Gonsalves, the prime minister of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. 'We cannot continue to rule in the old way, but the new is yet to be born.' The old model isn't working anymore Both of those nations are small ones, and that's no coincidence. Though many larger nations embraced multilateralism and still do — to a point, depending on their own strategic priorities — it is smaller states that embrace it most fervently. After all, they stand to benefit most from a united front in everything from military operations to development. 'For small states, multilateralism in international law is not an option. It is in fact an existential necessity,' Singapore’s foreign minister, Vivian Balakrishnan, said Saturday. Four generations after World War II ended, the challenges of the 21st century and — of late — the rising tide of populism have led many to conclude that old models of multilateralism aren’t working. But even leaders who still believe that working together and equally is ultimately the most effective and most secure way to do things lamented, one after another, that they are still waiting for the emergence of a fresh approach. António Guterres, head of the United Nations for the past seven years, has spent most of that time preaching passionately about the virtues of multilateralism — first patiently, then less so, then more urgently, now increasingly desperately. He knows things aren't working. He believes they still can — not in spite of an increasingly complex world but precisely because of its realities. 'I have no illusions about the obstacles to reform of the multilateral system,' Guterres told leaders this week. 'Those with political and economic power – and those who believe they have power – are always reluctant to change. But the status quo is already draining their power. Without reform, fragmentation is inevitable, and global institutions will become less legitimate, less credible and less effective.' Fragmentation. That's a key word here. The rise of the internet and the global economy and the subsequent repercussions stitched things together in some ways but tore them into a million pieces in others. Long-prevailing narratives are crumbling — for good and for ill. Putting the pieces back into a recognizable and productive mosaic — the core job of the United Nations — is a Sisyphean task. This is where most conversations about multilateralism tend to end up. The very things that make it strong — many voices, many backgrounds, diverse priorities — also make it, and the United Nations itself, almost impossible to wrangle. That has a particularly strong impact on those smaller states, which need that collaboration desperately in the face of larger, more muscular ones. Increasingly beleaguered Tuvalu can't solve the encroaching waters of climate change on its own. Saint Kitts and Nevis isn't going to figure out all the impact of AI alone. Without a thriving international economy, there are a lot more problems that descend upon everywhere from Kazakhstan to Suriname to Eswatini. African nations in particular have been seeking a permanent seat on the powerful U.N. Security Council so they can have a strong bloc of cooperation — and power — within the larger one. 'Multilateral institutions, including the Security Council, do not represent African needs and aspirations,' said Nangolo Mbumba, Namibia's president. New approaches — and fast — are seen as pivotal Because of the wide perception that multilateralism is at a breaking point, Guterres this year convened a summit that produced a 'Pact for the Future,' a wide-ranging plan that the secretary-general said was 'designed to bring multilateralism back from the brink.' He insisted that, unlike many other U.N. initiatives, this one must be more than talk and documents but must produce tangible, collaborative results in coming years. Essentially, it resembles a soft reboot of the United Nations itself to make it more relevant in an age of globalization, interconnectivity, fragmentation and artificial intelligence. Many speakers this week have seized upon precisely that kind of modernization across the board — what Mohamed Irfaan Ali, the president of Guyana, called 'enlightened multilateralism.' To nations like his, that notion would represent a more substantive inclusion, a world in which they are not simply partners but equal partners — not just being a member of the club of nations, but helping to run the clubhouse. Could the 'great powers' ever accept this? Could a reset, even a limited one, of the only truly global body of nations push the U.N. back on the path it has long envisioned? Everyone, including Guterres, insists that it's possible — but that time for a new and reinvigorated multilateralism is running out. 'The world stands fractious, polarized and frustrated. Conversations have become difficult; agreements even more so,' said Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar. 'This is surely not what the founders of the U.N. would have wanted of us.' The founders recognized that humans wouldn't always play nicely — but that they had to work together. And, ideally, not hit each other. And using their words? Even in a forum committed to dialogue and understanding (not to mention long equipped with real-time translation), that is becoming a taller order with each passing year. 'If we carry on like this,' Jaishankar said Saturday, 'the state of the world is only going to get worse.' ___ Ted Anthony, director of new storytelling and newsroom innovation for The Associated Press, has been writing about international affairs since 1995.

Hundreds rally in the streets of Paris to support world abortion rights	PARIS (AP) — Hundreds of people came out in Paris on Saturday, marching in support of the right to abortion for women across the world, just six months after France became the first country to guarantee in its constitution a woman's right to voluntarily terminate a pregnancy. The protest, organized by civil society groups to mark International Safe Abortion Day, also called for greater and easier access to abortion in France, denouncing budget cuts, staff reductions and the closure of abortion centers and maternity wards, which organizers say all contribute to penalizing women. Sarah Durocher, president of France’s not-for-profit family planning services, said French women sometimes have to travel to another region to access the medical services needed to abort, denouncing the 'obstacle course' they sometimes face. Thibault Thomas, 28, said the ongoing trial of a man who has confessed to drugging his wife so that dozens of men could rape her while she was unconscious, was one of the reasons that motivated him to attend the protest on Saturday. 'There’s a mood in France, a particular context with the Mazan trial,' he said, referring to the name of the small Provence town where the couple had bought their retirement home, and where the repeated rapes occurred. 'This sweeps away all the excuses, or all the mitigating circumstances that we thought could have existed before,' Thomas said. 'In fact it is something broader, generalized.' Earlier this year, France became the only country to explicitly guarantee a woman’s right to voluntarily terminate a pregnancy, when lawmakers overwhelmingly approved a bill to enshrine abortion rights in the constitution. Abortion in France has been legal since 1975 and enjoys wide support across most of the political spectrum. Enshrining the right in the Constitution sought to prevent the kind of rollback seen in the United States in recent years. Still, many in the protest Saturday said the right to abort could never be taken for granted, especially at a time when far-right nationalist parties are gaining influence, in France and other European countries. 'Every time the far right comes to power, sexual and reproductive rights are threatened. I don’t see why there would be a French exception,' said Durocher, stressing that every nine minutes, a woman dies somewhere in the world for not having been able to access safe abortion.. 'So obviously these rights are threatened.' Also in the march on Saturday was a small organization representing Colombian women in Paris, carrying a large purple banner with a feminist sign. 'In France, fortunately, it is enshrined in the constitution. But we know that when we exert pressure in France or in Latin America, we also help all women to say, ‘We are not alone,'' said 49 year-old Talula Rodríguez. 'We’re all going to fight for rights, rights over our bodies. It’s our choices.'	https://apnews.com/article/abortion-rights-france-paris-protest-women-553a060cb9e157b4d15dc830f81607b7	2024-09-28T07:50:39-07:00	
Biden and Harris call the Israeli strike killing Hezbollah’s Nasrallah a 'measure of justice'	REHOBOTH BEACH, Del. (AP) — The Israeli strike that killed Hezbollah’s Hassan Nasrallah was a 'measure of justice' for victims of a four-decade 'reign of terror,' President Joe Biden said Saturday. The comments came after Lebanon’s Hezbollah group confirmed earlier Saturday that Nasrallah, one of the group’s founders, was killed in an Israeli airstrike in Beirut the previous day. Biden noted that the operation to take out Nasrallah took place in the broader context of the conflict that began with Hamas’ massacre of Israelis on Oct. 7, 2023. 'Nasrallah, the next day, made the fateful decision to join hands with Hamas and open what he called a ‘northern front’ against Israel,' Biden said in a statement. He also noted that Hezbollah under Nasrallah’s watch has been responsible for the deaths of thousands of Americans, Israelis and Lebanese. Hezbollah attacks against U.S. interests include the truck bombing of the U.S. Embassy and multinational force barracks in Beirut in 1983 and the kidnapping of the Central Intelligence Agency chief of station in Beirut, who died while held captive. The U.S. said Hezbollah leaders armed and trained militias that carried out attacks on American forces during the war in Iraq. The White House sees the death of Nasrallah as a huge blow to the group. At the same time, the administration has sought to tread carefully as it has tried to contain Israel 's war with Hamas, which, like Hezbollah, is backed by Iran, from exploding into an all-out regional conflict. The White House and Pentagon were quick on Friday, shortly after the strike, to say publicly that Israel offered it no forewarning of the operation. 'President Biden and I do not want to see conflict in the Middle East escalate into a broader regional war,' Vice President Kamala Harris said in a statement Saturday that echoed Biden's description of a 'measure of justice.' She added, 'Diplomacy remains the best path forward to protect civilians and achieve lasting stability in the region.' The confirmation of Nasrallah's death comes during a week that began with Biden’s top national security aides working on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly to build support for a 21-day Israel-Hezbollah cease-fire that they hoped might also breathe new life into stalled efforts to secure a truce in Gaza. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu delivered a defiant speech Friday to the United Nations, vowing to keep up operations against Hezbollah until tens of thousands of Israeli citizens displaced by rocket attacks can return home. Shortly after, Israel carried out the strike killing Nasrallah. Biden reiterated on Saturday that he wants to see cease-fires both in Gaza and between Israel and Hezbollah. 'It is time for these deals to close, for the threats to Israel to be removed, and for the broader Middle East region to gain greater stability,' Biden said. Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian accused the United States of supporting the killing that took out Nasrallah and dozens of others. 'The world community will not forget that the order of the terrorist strike was issued from New York and the Americans cannot absolve themselves from complicity with the Zionists,' Pezeshkian was quoted as saying in a statement read on Iranian state television. The State Department on Saturday ordered the departure of the families of U.S. diplomats who are not employed by the embassy in Beirut and authorized the departure of those who are, as well as nonessential employees because of 'the volatile and unpredictable security situation' in Lebanon’s capital. The U.S. embassy in Beirut also posted a link to an online form that Americans in Lebanon can complete if they are interested in possible assistance leaving the country. The embassy stressed that it was not organizing evacuations and that there are still commercial means to leave, but the request for information appeared to suggest that such plans may be in the works. The State Department has previously advised American citizens to consider leaving Lebanon and reiterated its warning against all travel to the country. 'Due to the increased volatility following airstrikes within Beirut and the volatile and unpredictable security situation throughout Lebanon, the U.S. Embassy urges U.S. citizens to depart Lebanon while commercial options still remain available,' the department said in a statement Saturday. The State Department routinely orders or authorizes the departure of nonessential embassy staffers and the families of diplomats when security conditions deteriorate in the country where they are posted. An ordered departure is not technically an evacuation but does require those affected to leave. An authorized departure allows those affected to leave the country voluntarily at government expense. Biden, who was spending the weekend at his vacation home in Delaware, and Harris, who was campaigning in California, held a call with national security aides on Saturday to discuss the situation in the Middle East. In a brief exchange with reporters as he left church on Saturday, Biden did not directly respond to questions about the conflict potentially escalating further. 'It’s time for a cease-fire,' he said. The president on Friday directed the Pentagon to assess and adjust as necessary the U.S. force posture in the region to enhance deterrence, ensure force protection and support the full range of U.S. objectives. He called for the assessment after the Pentagon earlier in the week announced it was sending an unspecified number of additional U.S. troops to the region because of rising tensions.	https://apnews.com/article/biden-hezbollah-nasrallah-israel-lebanon-024756fb7c2b7bdda93454db97659a19	2024-09-28T07:45:48-07:00	
Hundreds of fleeing families sleep on beaches and streets after Israel's strikes shake Beirut	BEIRUT (AP) — Smoke was still rising from Beirut’s southern suburbs Saturday morning, visible to many of the families who had fled their homes there the night before to escape Israel’s massive bombardment. It had been a harrowing night — getting out amid earthshaking explosions, looking in vain for space in one of the overflowing schools-turned-shelters. By the morning, hundreds of families were sleeping in public squares, on beaches or in cars around Beirut. Lines of people trudged up to the mountains above the Lebanese capital, holding infants and a few belongings. Overnight, Israel unleashed a series of strikes on various parts of Dahiyeh, the predominantly Shiite collection of suburbs on Beirut’s southern edge where tens of thousands of residents live. The biggest blasts to hit Beirut in nearly a year of conflict killed the leader of Hezbollah, Hassan Nasrallah, Friday. The assault was part of a rapid escalation of Israeli strikes the past week that has killed more than 700 people in Lebanon. Israel has vowed to cripple Hezbollah and put an end to 11 months of its fire onto Israeli territory in what Nasrallah described as a 'support front' for his ally Hamas in Gaza. The newly displaced swell the numbers Beirut is absorbing The people escaping Friday night’s mayhem joined tens of thousands who have fled to Beirut and other areas of southern Lebanon the past week to escape Israel’s bombardment. For many residents of Dahiyeh, the forced evacuation was disconcertingly familiar. Some were Lebanese who had lived through the bruising monthlong war between Israel and Hezbollah in 2006, when Israel leveled large parts of the Beirut suburbs. Others were Syrians who had taken refuge from the long civil war in their own country. Fatima Chahine, a Syrian refugee, slept on the Ramlet al-Bayda public beach in Beirut with her family and hundreds of strangers. The night before she, her husband and their two children had piled onto a motorcycle and raced out of Dahiyeh, with 'bombing below us and strikes above us.' 'Thank God, no one was wounded,' she said. The government has opened up schools in Beirut to take in the displaced. But Syrians have reported that some sites turn them away to reserve the few spaces for Lebanese. Chahine said her family came directly to the beach. 'We only want a place where our children won’t be afraid,' she said. 'We fled from the war in Syria in 2011 because of the children and we came here, and now the same thing is happening again.' Since Monday, some 22,331 Syrians in Lebanon have crossed back into Syria, along with 22,117 Lebanese, according to Lebanese authorities. Chahine said returning is not an option for her family; she is from an opposition area and so could face reprisals from the Syrian government. At the beach, the displaced were spread out over the sidewalk or in cars parked by the curb. Others were camped out in beach pagodas or on blankets in the sand. 'We spent more than three hours going in circles between schools and shelters and we didn’t find one with room,' said Talal Ahmad Jassaf, a Lebanese man who slept on the beach with his family. He said he is considering going to the relative safety of Syria. But he worries about airstrikes on the road between Beirut and Damascus. Some people are left without aid The U.N. Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, or OCHA, said this week's escalation had more than doubled the number of people displaced by the conflict in Lebanon. There are now over 211,000 people displaced, including some of the humanitarian workers who should be responding to the crisis, it said. Around 85,000 of them are sleeping in shelters, it said. 'Humanitarian capacities to respond have been severely overstretched,' it added. Displaced people sleeping outside in Beirut largely told The Associated Press that they had not received assistance from any humanitarian organization. A stadium in the seaside neighborhood of Manara owned by the Nejmeh soccer club opened its doors to the displaced, who spent the night sleeping on bleachers. Among them was Mariam Darwish, her husband and five children. She fled her home in Dahiyeh earlier in the week when the first Israeli strikes hit there. Darwish said they had received water from the soccer club but that no organization had brought food, blankets or other supplies. 'People are helping each other out, family and friends are getting things for each other,' she said. She and her husband had fled during the 2006 war, when their oldest son was a baby, and returned to their home when the war ended. They hope their house will still be standing to return to this time, she said. 'We’re worried about our children and the schools, that they’ll lose out on their future,' she said. 'What can we do? We can only say thank God.' She added, 'May the resistance be victorious.' At the time of the interview, Hezbollah had not yet confirmed Nasrallah’s death. Despite their battered-down circumstances, others also struck a defiant tone. Jamal Hussein fled Dahiyeh at 3 a.m. with his extended family amid ongoing bombing and spent the night sleeping on the seaside promenade in Beirut’s upscale Ain Mreisseh district. 'Of course we aren’t afraid for ourselves, but we have children,' he said. 'We are steadfast and ready to sacrifice more than this.'	https://apnews.com/article/lebanon-israel-hezbollah-displaced-beirut-dahiyeh-children-583bbed45402d6802fa3643247924599	2024-09-28T07:07:54-07:00	
China, at UN, warns against 'expansion of the battlefield' in the Ukraine war	NEW YORK (AP) — Three days before his communist government turns 75, China's foreign minister warned fellow leaders Saturday against an 'expansion of the battlefield' in Russia's war with Ukraine and said the Beijing government remains committed to shuttle diplomacy and efforts to push the conflict toward its end. 'The top priority is to commit to no expansion of the battlefield. ... China is committed to playing a constructive role,' Wang Yi said. He warned against other nations 'throwing oil on the fire or exploiting the situation for selfish gains,' a likely reference to the United States. Wang's speech appeared to break no new ground, as is generally China's recent practice at the U.N. General Assembly's annual meeting of leaders. In fact, his boss, Chinese President Xi Jinping, has not participated in the leaders' meeting since 2021 — and then only virtually, during the pandemic. Xi has not attended in person for several years. On Friday, on the assembly sidelines, China and Brazil sought to build enthusiasm for their peace plan for Ukraine. They said about a dozen countries signed a communique that says they 'note' the six-point plan. The plan calls for a peace conference with both Ukraine and Russia and no expansion of the battlefield, among other provisions. Ukrainian officials have given the proposal a cold shoulder, but the countries that signed the communique are forming a group of 'friends for peace' for their U.N. ambassadors to keep the conversation going among themselves. Ranging from Algeria to Zambia, the members are largely African or Latin American countries. Wang made sure to note Friday that the group doesn’t decree individual countries’ policies. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said at a news conference Saturday that Russia was ready to provide assistance and advice to the group, adding that 'it’s important for their proposals to be underpinned by the realities and not just be taken from some abstract conversations.' Sovereignty has long been a talking point for China China has been an ally of Russia, a nation that has been accused of violating the U.N. Charter by Secretary-General António Guterres, the U.S. and many world nations. Moscow insists its so-called 'special military operation' is in self-defense, which is allowed in the U.N. Charter. China's continuing and vehement insistence on respect for other nations' sovereignty is not only a cornerstone of its foreign policy but a foundational ethos for the government of a nation that has traditionally struggled to maintain control at its edges — from Xinjiang and Tibet in the far west to Hong Kong and Taiwan off its east coast. China's current government was established on Oct. 1, 1949, when it was proclaimed by communist revolutionary-turned-leader Mao Zedong in Beijing's Tiananmen Square after a civil war with Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist government. The Nationalists began ruling Taiwan as a self-governed island, and that practice continues today — and is something that China rejects and insists is only a temporary situation for territory it considers sovereign. 'There is no such thing as two Chinas or one China-one Taiwan. On this matter there is no gray zone,' Wang said. 'Taiwan will eventually return to the embrace of the motherland. This is the overwhelming trend of history that no one can stop.' The Republic of China — the government in Taiwan established by Chiang Kai-shek — was a member of the United Nations until 1971, when the U.N. recognized the Beijing government. Since then, Beijing has worked to isolate Taiwan by rewarding nations that recognize it diplomatically and, sometimes, punishing those who do not. At every General Assembly high-level meeting, the leaders of scattered Taiwan-supporting nations — usually small ones — lament at the rostrum about the island's government being shunned by the international community. Wang's subjects in the speech varied Wang also weighed in with China's positions on increasing Mideast tensions and the situation on the Korean Peninsula. The latter has always been a key strategic priority for Beijing. THE MIDEAST: Saying that 'the question of Palestine is the biggest wound in human conscience,' Wang reiterated that China supports Palestinian statehood and full U.N. membership and insisted that a two-state solution is 'the fundamental way out.' He did not mention Israel by name or directly reference the war that began when Hamas fighters streamed across the Gaza border into Israel, killing hundreds and taking dozens hostage. THE KOREAN PENINSULA: As is China's policy, Wang expressed support for a transition 'from the armistice to a peace mechanism.' The two Koreas technically remain in a state of war since a 1950-53 conflict separated the peninsula into north and south. China has been a longtime backer of North Korea while the United States is a close ally of the South. He offered a veiled warning about others trying to pull strings in East Asia: 'We are firmly against the meddling of countries outside the region.' The Korean Peninsula broke into the U.S.-supported, capitalistic South Korea and the Soviet-backed, socialist North Korea after its liberation from Japan’s 35-year colonial rule at the end of the World War II in 1945. The two Koreas have the world’s most heavily fortified border. HUMAN RIGHTS: Wang repeated China's usual talking points, saying that 'no country should infringe on another’s internal affairs in the name of human rights' and insisting that China had chosen its own way, which is just as legitimate as others'. 'We have found a path of human rights development that suits China’s national condition,' Wang said. Other nations and international rights groups have long condemned Beijing's treatment of Tibetans, ethnic Uyghurs in the far-west region of Xinjiang and — more recently — activists in the 'special administrative region' of Hong Kong. ___ Associated Press writers Jennifer Peltz and Edith M.

Iran Revolutionary Guard general died in Israeli strike that killed Hezbollah leader, reports say	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — A prominent general in Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard died in an Israeli airstrike that killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut, Iranian media reported Saturday. The killing of Gen. Abbas Nilforushan marks the latest casualty suffered by Iran as the nearly yearlong Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip teeters on the edge of becoming a regional conflict. His death further ratchets up pressure on Iran to respond, even as Tehran has signaled in recent months that it wants to negotiate with the West over sanctions crushing its economy. Nilforushan, 58, was killed Friday in the strike in Lebanon that killed Nasrallah, the state-owned Tehran Times reported. Ahmad Reza Pour Khaghan, the deputy head of Iran’s judiciary, also confirmed Nilforushan's death, describing him as a 'guest to the people of Lebanon,' the state-run IRNA news agency said. Khaghan also reportedly said that Iran had the right to retaliate under international law. The U.S. Treasury had identified Nilforushan as the deputy commander for operations in the Guard. It sanctioned him in 2022 and said he had led an organization 'directly in charge of protest suppression.' Those sanctions came amid the monthslong protests in Iran over the death of Mahsa Amini following her arrest for allegedly not wearing her headscarf, or hijab, to the liking of police. Nilforushan also served in Syria, backing President Bashar Assad in his country’s decades-long war that grew out of the 2011 Arab Spring. Like many of his colleagues, he began his military career in the Iran-Iraq war of the 1980s. In 2020, Iranian state television called him a 'comrade' of Gen. Qassem Soleimani, the head of its expeditionary Quds Force who was killed in a U.S. drone attack in Baghdad that year. ___ Associated Press writer Nasser Karimi in Tehran, Iran, contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/iran-revolutionary-guard-general-dead-hezbollah-israel-airstrike-46d2133e594b9c4ce448a6b683802995	2024-09-28T04:33:47-07:00	
Tropical Weather Latest: Millions still without power from Helene as flooding continues	The remnants of Hurricane Helene dissipated Saturday but millions remain without power across the Southeast and officials warned that record-breaking river flooding is ongoing in parts of southern Appalachia. The storm has been blamed for at least 44 deaths across five states, including 19 people in South Carolina. But officials fear the death toll could rise as authorities continue to take stock of Helene's devastation. The hurricane roared ashore Thursday night as a Category 4 storm on Florida's Gulf Coast and then quickly moved Friday through Georgia, the Carolinas and Tennessee, uprooting trees, splintering homes and sending creeks and rivers over their banks and straining dams. Tropical Storm John made its second landfall along Mexico’s Pacific coast Friday, while in its wake authorities in the resort city of Acapulco called for help from anyone with a boat to deal with the flooding. It has since dissipated over Mexico. Follow AP’s coverage of tropical weather at https://apnews.com/hub/hurricanes. Here's the latest: Locals grateful no one was killed in Tampa neighborhood that saw unprecedented storm surge TAMPA, Fla. — Davis Islands, the Tampa neighborhood that star athletes like baseball’s Derek Jeter and football’s Tom Brady have called home, was cleaning up Saturday after Helene’s chest-high storm surge tore through its streets the day before. The two islands sit just off the city’s downtown and are home to about 5,000 people. The neighborhood had never seen storm surge like it had Friday. No one died, but homes, businesses and apartments were flooded. Authorities warned residents to evacuate, and many did, but some stayed behind. 'I don’t think anybody was expecting it,' Faith Pilafas told the Tampa Bay Times. 'We’ve kind of gotten accustomed to lots of talk about big storms, and never actually like feeling the effects of it. So for all the people who didn’t leave the island, I feel like they were all just expecting it to be a normal storm, anticlimactic. And wow, were we surprised.' A 24-year-old restaurant worker, she and her boyfriend watched from their second-floor apartment as the water rose to over 4 feet (1.2 meters). Her boyfriend used his kayak to help people get off the island. 'I mean, just every single business is, like, totally destroyed,' she told the newspaper. 'But we don’t know anybody who is seriously injured, and so we’re just really grateful that didn’t happen.' Debra Ogston returned to her Italian restaurant to find that its heavy coolers had been overturned. She said the job now will be to clean up and reopen. 'We’re resilient,' she told the newspaper. 'We’re going to go for progress, not perfection. ... The damage here is annoying, and a little heartbreaking. But it’s stuff. Stuff can be replaced.' Vice President Harris urges residents affected by Helene to heed local officials DOUGLAS, Ariz. — Vice President Kamala Harris on Friday urged residents impacted by Hurricane Helene to pay heed to local authorities as the storm continues to wreak havoc on a significant swath of the southeast. 'The storm continues to be dangerous and deadly, and lives have been lost and the risk of flooding still remains high,' Harris said at the start of a campaign speech in Douglas, Arizona. 'So, I continue to urge everyone to please continue to follow guidance from your local officials until we get past this moment.' Dam near North Carolina-Tennessee border not experiencing ‘catastrophic failure,’ officials say NASHVILLE, Tenn. — Tennessee Emergency Management Agency said Friday that a 'catastrophic failure' was not taking place at Walters Dam, also known as the Waterville Dam, which sits in North Carolina close to the Tennessee border. A local mayor had urged residents to evacuate due to the dam potentially breaking, but TEMA said in a statement that the 'dam has not failed' after talking to Duke Energy, which owns the nearly 100-year-old dam. Dozens rescued by helicopter from a flooded Tennessee hospital NASHVILLE — There have been hundreds of water rescues due to Helene, but perhaps none more dramatic than in rural Unicoi County in East Tennessee, where dozens of patients and staff were plucked by helicopter from the roof of a hospital that was surrounded by water from a flooded river. Some 54 people were moved to the roof of the Unicoi County Hospital while water rapidly flooded the facility, according to Ballad Health. Ballad Health said on social media that county officials had ordered an evacuation of the hospital Friday morning due to rising water in the Nolichucky River, including 11 patients. After other helicopters failed to reach the hospital because of the storm’s winds, a Virginia State Police helicopter was able to land on the roof. Three National Guard helicopters with hoist capabilities were sent and Ballad Health assisted with its own helicopter, officials said. After about four hours, all of the staff and patients had been rescued. ▶ Read more about Friday's dramatic rescue	https://apnews.com/article/hurricane-helene-latest-death-toll-aftermath-52162181c47f400351397fe1c71e32a6	2024-09-28T04:20:46-07:00	
Hassan Nasrallah, longtime leader of Lebanon’s Hezbollah, is killed by his archenemy Israel	BEIRUT (AP) — Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, who transformed the Lebanese militant group into a potent paramilitary and political force in the Middle East was killed in an Israeli airstrike, the group said. He was 64. Nasrallah, who spearheaded Hezbollah's war against Israel in 2006 and got the group heavily involved in neighboring Syria’s brutal conflict, was killed in a massive Israeli airstrike on the Beirut southern suburb of Haret Hreik Friday evening that knocked down several multi-story apartment buildings. 'His eminence Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, Hezbollah's secretary-general had joined his fellow great martyrs whom he had led for 30 years from one victory to another,' Hezbollah said in a statement. It added that Nasrallah 'fell as a martyr on the road to Jerusalem.' Fears of a regional war Nasrallah's death comes amid a dizzying escalation in the nearly yearlong conflict between Israel and Hezbollah, since the war in Gaza started, and more than three decades after he took leadership of the Iranian-backed militant group following the killing of his predecessor by an Israeli missile in 1992. Five years later, the United States designated Hezbollah a terrorist organization. Hezbollah has been firing rockets, missiles and drones into northern Israel in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza and Hamas, an allied Iran-backed militant group. Israel has responded with increasingly heavy airstrikes and the targeted killing of Hezbollah commanders while threatening a wider operation. This week has been the deadliest in Lebanon since the bruising 2006 monthlong war between Israel and Hezbollah. Thousands of pagers and walkie-talkies used mainly by Hezbollah members exploded in different parts of Lebanon, killing 39 people and wounding nearly 3,000, many of them civilians. Lebanon blamed Israel, but Israel did not confirm or deny responsibility. Nasrallah had promised to retaliate. Then, Israeli strikes on Lebanon killed more than 700 people in five days, including at least 150 women and children, according to Lebanese authorities. Nasrallah had said the barrages would continue — and Israelis wouldn't be able to return to their homes in the north — until Israel’s campaign in Gaza ended. Seen by his supporters as a charismatic and shrewd strategist, Nasrallah had reshaped Hezbollah into an archenemy of Israel, cementing alliances with the ayatollahs in Tehran and Palestinian militant groups such as Hamas. Idolized by his Lebanese Shiite followers and respected by millions of others across the Arab and Islamic world, Nasrallah held the title of sayyid, an honorific meant to signify the Shiite cleric's lineage dating back to the Prophet Muhammad, the founder of Islam. Nasrallah’s image appears on billboards in the group’s strongholds across Lebanon — especially in southern Beirut, Hezbollah's headquarters — and on trinkets in souvenir shops not only in Lebanon but also in countries such as Syria and Iraq. Despite the power he wielded, Nasrallah lived largely in hiding in the last years of his life for fear of an Israeli assassination, giving speeches to followers via a satellite link. A fiery orator viewed as an extremist in the U.S. and much of the West, as well as in some oil-rich Gulf Arab countries, he was also considered a pragmatist, compared to the firebrand militants who dominated Hezbollah after its founding in 1982, during Lebanon's civil war. War after war in the Middle East Under Nasrallah, Hezbollah fought Israel to a stalemate during the 34-day war in 2006 and was credited with leading the war of attrition that led to the withdrawal of Israeli troops from south Lebanon in 2000, after an 18-year occupation. Nasrallah's eldest son, Hadi, was killed in 1997, while fighting against Israeli forces. When Syria’s civil war erupted in 2011, Hezbollah fighters rushed in, siding with Syrian President Bashar Assad's forces — even though Hezbollah's popularity took a dive as the Arab world ostracized Assad. Along with Damascus' key allies Russia and Iran, Hezbollah played a major role in helping Assad stay in power and eventually retake territory lost in the early years of the conflict. Hezbollah saw its popularity among Arabs surge again when it came to the defense of Hamas, opening a front with Israeli forces along the Israel-Lebanese border barely a day after the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. The Hamas-led attack killed around 1,200 people in Israel and took about 250 hostage, triggering one of the most destructive military campaigns in modern history. Israel's subsequent aerial bombardment and ground invasion of the Gaza Strip killed tens of thousands of Palestinians. In June 2024, Nasrallah warned Israel that Hezbollah had new weapons and capabilities. Nasrallah also claimed that Hezbollah now has a far higher number of fighters than the 100,000 figure he gave three year earlier. The early years Nasrallah, the eldest of nine siblings, was born into a poor family in Beirut’s impoverished northern suburb of Sharshabouk. In 1975, the Lebanese civil war forced the family to flee south, to their ancestral home in Bazzouriyeh, a village near the ancient Phoenician port city of Tyre. There, Nasrallah joined the Amal movement, a political and paramilitary organization representing the once-marginalized Shiites in Lebanon, and soon began his rise as a revolutionary. At the age of 16, he went to Iraq's holy Shiite city of Najaf where the leader of Iran’s 1979 Islamic Revolution, the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, lived in exile at the time and taught theology. Later, Nasrallah studied in the city of Qom, the seat of Iran’s religious hierarchy. Nasrallah was among Hezbollah’s founders when the party was formed by Iranian Revolutionary Guard members who came to Lebanon in the summer of 1982 to fight invading Israeli forces. He built a power base as Hezbollah over time became part of a cluster of Iranian-backed factions and governments known as the Axis of Resistance. It was also the first group that Iran backed and used as a way to export its brand of political Islam. Two days after its leader, 39-year-old Sayyed Abbas Musawi, was killed in an Israeli helicopter gunship raid in south Lebanon, Hezbollah chose Nasrallah as its secretary-general in February 1992. Like Musawi, Nasrallah was committed to the struggle against Israel and Khomeini’s anti-Western teachings, and famously declared: 'America will remain the dreadful enemy and Israel a cancerous growth that should be uprooted.' A black-turbaned cleric or a militant leader? Wearing spectacles and sporting a bushy grey beard like many religious Shiite men, Nasrallah's image was far from that of a militant who commanded thousands of heavily armed, well-trained and battle-hardened followers. He often paused in his speeches to make jokes or break into local dialect and once, responding to a reporter asking about his monthly salary during a television interview, Nasrallah said it was about $1,300. Following the end of Lebanon’s 1975-90 civil war, Nasrallah gradually turned the organization into a 'state within a state,' with an elaborate social welfare network that provided schools, clinics, and housing in the impoverished and predominantly Shiite parts of Lebanon. After Israel's withdrawal from southern Lebanon in 2000, Nasrallah rose to iconic status both within Lebanon and throughout the Arab world. His messages were beamed on Hezbollah's own radio and satellite TV station. In a famous speech marking the Israeli withdrawal, he said: 'It (Israel) has a nuclear weapon and the strongest air force in the region, but in truth, it is weaker than a spider’s web.' As Israel, and later Syria, pulled their armies out of Lebanon, Nasrallah began to steer Hezbollah increasingly into the realm of politics. In the 2005 parliamentary elections, the first after Syria ended its 29-year military presence in Lebanon, Hezbollah made substantial gains and joined the Cabinet for the first time, holding two seats. Politics and war In July 2006, after Hezbollah captured two Israeli soldiers in a cross-border attack, Israel launched a monthlong massive air, sea and ground campaign against Lebanon. Nasrallah’s home and offices and much of the group’s infrastructure were destroyed, as well as much of south Lebanon and Beirut's southern suburbs. Hezbollah fired around 4,000 rockets into Israel and after 34 days of fighting, a truce took effect and Nasrallah declared a 'divine victory' over Israel. While he was cheered for standing up to the Israeli army, Nasrallah was criticized by many for providing the spark for that war during which more than 1,200 people died in Lebanon — most of them civilians — and 159 in Israel. Nasrallah later expressed regret — an unprecedented move for him — and said during a televised interview that Hezbollah had not expected 'even one percent' that the capture of the Israeli soldiers 'would lead to a war of this magnitude.' 'You ask me, if I had known ... that the operation would lead to such a war, would I do it? I say no, absolutely not,' he said. In May 2008, Hezbollah’s reputation suffered a setback when its fighters briefly seized much of west Beirut, turning their guns on local Lebanese foes after the government took measures against the group's private telecommunications network. In the years that followed, a U.N.-backed tribunal in the Netherlands sentenced three Hezbollah members in absentia to five concurrent life sentences over the 2005 assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri. Hezbollah ignored the tribunal and repeatedly denied its members were involved in the massive suicide bombing along the Beirut corniche that killed Hariri and 21 others, an attack that deeply divided Lebanon. During the Arab Spring uprisings against autocratic governments, Hezbollah's close alliance with Syria and Iran opened the group to accusations that it was merely a well-armed tool of Damascus and Tehran. Hezbollah was also pulled into the regional rivalry between Iran and Saudi Arabia and in 2016, the Saudi-led, six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council branded Hezbollah a terrorist organization. But Hezbollah's anti-Israel campaign remained at its forefront as the group continued to build up its arsenal of tens of thousands of missiles, including precision-guided missiles, as well as drones. After 2006, the Lebanon-Israel border remained mostly calm until Hamas' October 2023 deadly incursion into Israel. The next day, Hezbollah began attacking Israeli military posts and drawing Israeli fire in what became near-daily exchanges. Nasrallah said the aim was to ease the tension from the Gaza Strip. Nasrallah is survived by his wife, Fatima Yassin. He also has three sons Jawad, Mohammed-Mahdi and Mohammed Ali, and a daughter Zeinab, as well as several grandchildren.	https://apnews.com/article/obituary-nasrallah-lebanon-israel-2da3789a02fd4e2e88511a7f59174d19	2024-09-28T03:58:59-07:00	
9 dead as boat carrying migrants capsizes off Spain’s Canary Islands	MADRID (AP) — Nine people have died and another 48 are missing after a boat carrying migrants capsized during a rescue operation near the Canary Islands, Spanish authorities said Saturday. Spain’s maritime rescue service said that the tragedy occurred after it was alerted to the presence of a small boat loaded with people some 6 1/2 kilometers (4 miles) from the island of El Hierro. The boat turned over when too many people moved to one side during the rescue attempt, according to a statement by the rescue service. Rescuers have saved 27 people and confirmed nine dead. The service said that the scue operation was made more difficult because it was carried out during the night and under gusts of winds that reached 20 knots. Rescue craft and helicopters of the maritime rescue service, the Civil Guard, the Red Cross and the local government all participated in the operation. The Atlantic route for migrants from West Africa to the Canary Islands is one of the deadliest in the world. While there is no accurate death toll because of the lack of information on departures from West Africa, Spanish migrant rights group Walking Borders estimates the victims are in the thousands. Over 26,000 people have arrived via sea to the Canary Islands so far this year, compared to some 14,000 in the same period last year. Located nearer to Africa than mainland Spain, the archipelago seen by most as a step toward continental Europe. Many come from Mali as well as youth from Senegal, Mauritania and other West African countries seeking better job opportunities abroad or fleeing violence and political instability. ___ Follow AP coverage at: https://apnews.com/hub/migration	https://apnews.com/article/migrants-canary-islands-boat-spain-c0e23bb2e09e75e6538bebca71305b85	2024-09-28T03:57:57-07:00

The new top youth official at the UN talks about what's in it for young people	UNITED NATIONS (AP) — Dr. Felipe Paullier is quick to say he doesn't speak for the world's roughly 2 billion tweens, teens and young adults. But as the United Nations' first assistant secretary-general for youth affairs, he's tasked with advocating for young people and their concerns to be incorporated into the organization's work — a goal shared by young activists who don't always feel heard by the international community. Paullier, a pediatrician and former director general of Uruguay's National Youth Institute, started in in the job in December. He sat down with The Associated Press on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly this week to talk about his role, the U.N.'s new ' Pact for the Future,' what it means for young people — and whether their elders really mean it about including them. Here are excerpts from the interview, edited for length and clarity. ___ AP: Given the subject, let's start with this: How old are you? PAULLIER: I'm 33. When I started, I was 32. I'm getting old. AP: Your role is very new. PAULLIER: You know, the U.N. has been an organization championing the youth agenda for many, many decades. But in terms of really putting this at the global level and as a priority, I think this is a bit more recent. ...My role is not about representing the youth voices — because young people are too diverse to be represented by one person. But at the same time, I think the office is a testament to the recognition of youth at the global level. I think that’s our role. AP: What did the recent U.N. Summit of the Future and 'Pact for the Future' add to the picture? PAULLIER: I think there are two concrete commitment outcomes of this summit. Now, it’s always about these commitments being put into actions. But one is about governments committing to implement, at the national level, youth engagement mechanisms. And I think that’s a very important and very crucial point. And the second one is, at the global level, this idea of having a process to have common principles about meaningful youth participation. Because this is a relatively new concept. Ten or 15 years ago, you know, young people were just seen as beneficiaries of policies. And now I think the summit, the establishment of the office, there are many things changing that are showing institutions, decision-makers, are saying, 'OK, we need to engage with them as partners.' AP: At a leadup event for the summit, one young activist was quite frank about saying that it’s not just a matter of being invited to attend or speak at events — it's a matter of actually being heard and seeing something come out of it. How do you encourage young people to take the U.N. at its word that it wants to include them in a way that’s meaningful? PAULLIER: You know, I think this is a challenge of every traditional institution. And I'm saying 'traditionally' because our institutions were established in a different world. It’s true that in the last 10 or 15 years, the world has changed dramatically. Technology has brought to people a lot of power, and this is transforming the accountability systems, the way that people can organize themselves, express themselves, mobilize. That's something very positive. But at the same time, institutions need to align to these transformations.... So I think that the summit is essentially the recognition that this needs to be transformed. As an office, our role is that we push for changes for happen. And let's not see this only in the negative way of thinking. I tend to believe that these commitments from governments are a testament that they have willingness to really advance in this direction. AP: Do you feel like the goals of young people who want this change are realistic? PAULLIER: Completely. ___ See more of AP’s coverage of the U.N.

17 people have been killed in 2 mass shootings in the same town in South Africa	JOHANNESBURG (AP) — Seventeen people including 15 women were killed in two mass shootings that took place in close proximity to each other in a rural town in South Africa, police said Saturday. A search was underway for the suspects, national police spokesperson Brig. Athlenda Mathe said in a statement. The victims were 15 women and two men, she said. One other person was in critical condition in the hospital. The shootings took place Friday night in the town of Lusikisiki in Eastern Cape province in southeastern South Africa. Video released by police showed that the shootings occurred at two houses in the same neighborhood, which is a collection of rural homesteads on the outskirts of the town. Twelve women and a man were killed in one house and three women and a man were killed in the other house, police said. 'A manhunt has been launched to apprehend those behind these heinous killings,' Mathe said. Police did not give any details on a possible motive. South Africa has one of the highest homicide rates in the world and mass shootings have become increasingly common in recent years, sometimes targeting people in their homes. Ten members of the same family, seven of them women and one a 13-year-old boy, were killed in a mass shooting at their home in the neighboring KwaZulu-Natal province last April. South Africa's homicide rate is around 45 per 100,000 people, compared to around 6.3 per 100,000 in the United States. Most European countries' homicide rates are around 1 per 100,000 people. South Africa recorded more than 27,000 homicides in the 12 months from March 1, 2023, to Feb. 28, 2024, which is more than 70 a day in the country of 62 million people. Firearm laws are reasonably strict in South Africa, but authorities have often pointed to the large number of illegal, unregistered guns in circulation as a major problem. ___ AP Africa news: https://apnews.com/hub/africa	https://apnews.com/article/south-africa-mass-shootings-86e1fe1e481781793c76cc82f65049c7	2024-09-28T02:51:31-07:00	
Flooding in Nepal's capital kills at least 32 people	KATHMANDU, Nepal (AP) — Flooding caused by continuous rainfall has killed at least 32 people in Nepal's capital, and another 12 are missing, police said Saturday. Rains have been pounding since Friday night and are expected to continue over the weekend. Seventeen people were also injured while 1,053 were rescued across Kathmandu, according to Nepal Police spokesman Bishwo Adhikari. He said all police personnel across the nation have been ordered to help in the rescue efforts. The government had issued flood warnings across the Himalayan nation warning of massive rainfall. Buses were banned from traveling at night on highways and cars were discouraged from the roads. Security forces were ordered to high alert. Home Minister Ramesh Lekhak told reporters that there are reports of damage in other parts of the country, too, and officials are still collecting information. 'The government's priority right now is to rescue the people and help those who have been affected,' Lekhak said. Parts of Kathmandu were inundated by the swollen rivers with many houses flooded and residents forced to move to top floors. A huge area on the southern side of the city has been mostly flooded. An army helicopter was used to pick up four people who were unable to leave their houses. Most of Kathmandu was without power and internet for a period of time. There were reports of landslides and flooding in other parts of the country. The monsoon season that bring heavy rainfall began in June and usually ends by mid-September.	https://apnews.com/article/nepal-kathmandu-floods-e19bcf99e5930cc0813809e8a5946769	2024-09-28T00:16:20-07:00	
Russian strikes on a medical center kill 9 people in the Ukrainian city of Sumy	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Two consecutive Russian attacks on a medical center in the northeastern Ukrainian city of Sumy killed at least nine people on Saturday morning, officials said. The first strike killed one person. Russia attacked again while patients and staff were evacuating, said Ukraine’s Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko. Local officials in Sumy said Shahed drones were used in the attack. Twelve other people were wounded, Sumy's City Military administration said. Sumy lies some 20 miles (32 kilometers) from Russia’s Kursk region, where Ukrainian troops have been deployed since Aug. 6 in a bid to divert the Kremlin’s military focus away from the front line in Ukraine. Ukraine’s air force said it shot down 69 of 73 Russian drones launched overnight as well as two of the four missiles. City authorities in Kyiv said around 15 drones had been shot down over the Ukrainian capital and its outskirts. In Kryvyi Rih, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s home city, local officials said Saturday that a man’s body was found under the rubble of an administrative building hit by a Russian missile on Friday, bringing the death toll from that attack to four. In Russia, the Defense Ministry said Saturday that air defenses overnight had shot down four Ukrainian drones over the Belgorod region and one over the Kursk region, both areas bordering Ukraine. One person was killed in Ukrainian shelling of the Russian border city of Shebekino on Saturday, Belgorod regional Gov. Vyacheslav Gladkov said. Two other people were wounded. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-sumy-drones-a218e9c5650e633490c55c1907889a6a	2024-09-27T23:25:32-07:00	
Hezbollah confirms its leader Hassan Nasrallah was killed in an Israeli airstrike	BEIRUT (AP) — Lebanon’s Hezbollah group confirmed on Saturday that its leader and one of its founders, Hassan Nasrallah, was killed in an Israeli airstrike in Beirut the previous day. A statement said Nasrallah 'has joined his fellow martyrs.' Hezbollah vowed to 'continue the holy war against the enemy and in support of Palestine.' Nasrallah, who led Hezbollah for more than three decades, is by far the most powerful target to be killed by Israel in weeks of intensified fighting with Hezbollah. The Israeli military said it carried out a precise airstrike on Friday while Hezbollah leadership were meeting at their headquarters in Dahiyeh, south of Beirut. The Lebanese Health Ministry said six people were killed and 91 injured in the strikes, which leveled six apartment buildings. Ali Karki, the commander of Hezbollah’s Southern Front and other commanders were also killed, the Israeli military said. Iran announced Saturday that a prominent general in its paramilitary Revolutionary Guard sanctioned by the U.S. died in the same airstrike. Abbas Nilforushan, 58, who the U.S. identified as the deputy commander for operations in the Guard, was killed Friday, Iran’s state-run IRNA news agency reported. Lt. Col. Nadav Shoshani, an army spokesperson, said the airstrike was based on years of tracking Nasrallah along with 'real time information' that made it viable. He declined to say what munitions were used in the strike or provide an estimate on civilian deaths, only saying that Israel takes measures to avoid civilians whenever possible and clears strikes ahead of time with intelligence and legal experts. The Palestinian militant group Hamas in a statement issued condolences to its ally, Hezbollah. Nasrallah frequently described launching rockets against northern Israel as a 'support front' for Hamas and Palestinians in Gaza. 'History has proven that the resistance ... whenever its leaders die as martyrs, will be succeeded on the same path by a generation of leaders who are more valiant, stronger and more determined to continue the confrontation,' the Hamas statement said. It added that 'assassinations will only increase the resistance in Lebanon and Palestine in determination and resolve.' Immediately after the official confirmation from Hezbollah, people starting firing in the air in Beirut and other areas of the country, to mourn Nasrallah's death. Some were protesting that he was killed because of his support for the war in Gaza. 'Wish it was our kids, not you, Sayyid!' said one woman, using an honorific title for Nasrallah, as she clutched her baby in the western city of Baabda. Israel vows to keep up attacks on Hezbollah Israel’s Chief of Staff, Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi, said Saturday that the elimination of Nasrallah was 'not the end of our toolbox,' indicating that more strikes were planned. Defense Minister Yoav Gallant called it 'the most important targeted strike since the founding of the State of Israel.' Israel has vowed to step up pressure on Hezbollah until it halts its attacks that have displaced tens of thousands of Israelis from communities near the Lebanese border. The recent fighting has also displaced more than 200,000 Lebanese in the past week, according to the United Nations. The military said Saturday it was mobilizing additional reserve soldiers as tensions escalate with Lebanon, activating three battalions of reserve soldiers to serve across the country. It sent two brigades to northern Israel earlier in the week to train for a possible ground invasion. Shoshani, the army spokesperson, said that Israel has inflicted heavy damage on Hezbollah’s capabilities over the past week by targeting a combination of immediate threats and strategic weapons, such as larger, guided missiles. But he said much of Hezbollah’s arsenal still remains intact and that Israel would continue to target the group. The Israeli military updated guidelines for Israeli citizens, canceling gatherings of more than 1,000 people due to the ongoing threat. Approximately 60,000 Israelis have been evacuated from their homes along the Lebanese border for almost a year. Earlier this month, Israel's government said halting Hezbollah’s attacks in the country’s north to allow residents to return to their homes is an official war goal. Iran, Iraq call for support for Hezbollah Iranian state television read the announcement from Hezbollah confirming Nasrallah's death live, but there was no other immediate comment. Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei in a Saturday message said 'the resistance movement, heading by Hezbollah, will decide the fate of the region,' in a statement read on state TV. Iran is the main supporter of Lebanese Hezbollah and other militant groups in the region. Also on Saturday, Iran’s influential parliamentary committee of national security demanded 'strong' response to Israel following a meeting of the committee. State TV also said people staged anti-Israeli rallies in support of Hezbollah in major cities and town across the country. Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani of declared a three-day period of mourning in his country. Sudani came to power with the backing of a coalition of Iran-backed political factions, many of which have armed wings that are allied with Hezbollah. A year of hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah Hezbollah started firing rockets on Israel in support of Gaza on Oct. 8, a day after Hamas militants launched an unprecedented attack on Israel, killing some 1,200 people and abducting another 250. Since then, the two sides have been engaged in cross-border strikes that have gradually escalated and displaced tens of thousands of civilians on both sides of the border. Hostilities escalated dramatically last week when thousands of explosives hidden in pagers and walkie-talkies used by Hezbollah detonated, killing dozens of people and leaving thousands, including many civilians, with severe injuries to the eyes, face and limbs. Israel is widely believed to be behind the attack. Israel has also killed several top Hezbollah commanders in Beirut, especially in the past two weeks, in addition to the attack that killed Nasrallah. A window of opportunity for Israel, Lebanon Orna Mizrahi, a senior researcher at the Tel Aviv-based think tank Institute for National Security Studies and former intelligence analyst for the Israeli military and prime minister’s office, noted that Nasrallah was sometimes a 'voice of reason,' interested in engaging Israel in a war of attrition and holding the militant group back from using the full force of their formidable arsenal against Israel. Nasrallah's death could prompt some less senior members of Hezbollah to unleash much stronger weapons than have been used in the nearly yearlong exchange of hostilities between Hezbollah and Lebanon, she said. The biggest question mark right now, though, is how Iran will respond, said Mizrahi. She added that Nasrallah's death could provide a window of opportunity, while the organization is significantly weakened, for Lebanon to dilute Hezbollah’s far-reaching influence, especially in the south, that threatens to drag Lebanon into a full-scale war with Israel. Continuing strikes on both sides of the border On Saturday morning, the Israeli military carried out more than 140 airstrikes in southern Beirut and eastern Lebanon’s Bekaa Valley, including targeting a storage facility for anti-ship missiles in Beirut suburb of Dahiyeh. Israel said the missiles were stored underground beneath civilian apartment buildings. Hezbollah launched dozens of projectiles across northern and central Israel and deep into the Israel-occupied West Bank, damaging some buildings in the northern town of Safed. In Beirut’s southern suburbs, smoke rose and the streets were empty after the area was pummeled overnight by heavy Israeli airstrikes. Shelters set up in the city center for displaced people were overflowing. Many families slept in public squares and beaches or in their cars. On the roads leading to the mountains above the capital, hundreds of people could be seen making an exodus on foot, holding infants and whatever belongings they could carry. A total of 1,030 people — including 156 women and 87 children — have been killed in Israeli strikes in Lebanon in less than two weeks, the country’s health minister said Saturday. ___ Mroue reported from Beirut.

Israel-Hamas war latest: Smoke rises from Beirut’s southern suburbs after a night of Israeli attacks	Smoke rose from Beirut’s southern suburbs Saturday morning and the streets were empty after the area was pummeled overnight by heavy Israeli airstrikes. Attacks on Hezbollah targets by fighter jets Friday continued into the early hours Saturday after the army said it told residents to evacuate three buildings it was targeting. Hours before the strikes, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addressed the United Nations, vowing that Israel’s campaign against Hezbollah would continue — further dimming hopes for an internationally backed cease-fire. Netanyahu abruptly cut his United States visit short and returned to Israel. More than 720 people have been killed in Lebanon since the conflict escalated Monday, according to Lebanon’s health ministry. The United Nations says the number of those displaced by the conflict from southern Lebanon has more than doubled, with more than 211,000 people now displaced. At least 20 primary health care centers have shut down in hard-hit areas of Lebanon, the U.N. Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said. Hezbollah began firing rockets into northern Israel in support of Hamas after it stormed into Israel, sparking the Israel-Hamas war. Top Israeli officials have threatened to repeat the destruction of Gaza in Lebanon if the Hezbollah fire continues, raising fears that Israel’s actions in Gaza since Oct. 7 would be repeated in Lebanon. ___ Here’s the latest: Lebanon asks medical centers to make room for people from hard-hit Beirut suburbs BEIRUT — Patients in hospitals in Beirut’s southern suburbs will be evacuated to medical centers in the capital and the nearby Mount Lebanon region, Lebanon’s Health Ministry says. In a statement carried by state news agency early Saturday, the ministry called on hospitals in Beirut and Mount Lebanon to stop receiving cases that can be delayed in order to receive patients evacuating from the hard-hit southern suburb Dahiyeh. The ministry’s decision came after a night of Israeli airstrikes on Dahiyeh, a predominantly Shiite district. The ministry also called on hospitals and medical centers to care for ill people who fled Dahiyeh overnight as a result of the airstrikes. Israel targets areas around Beirut early Saturday BEIRUT — Smoke rose from Beirut’s southern suburbs Saturday morning and the streets were empty after the area was pummeled overnight by heavy Israeli airstrikes. Explosions rocked Beirut’s southern suburbs, with flames lighting up the pre-dawn darkness. Fire raged from at least one location, and smoke and flames were seen from above Beirut early Saturday. Residents reported jets flying overhead. In a short statement, the Israeli military described the sites it hit as belonging to Hezbollah. Authorities there did not immediately acknowledge if there were any casualties. Shelters set up in the city center for people displaced by the onslaught were overflowing. Many families slept in public squares and beaches, or in their cars. On the roads leading to the mountains above the capital, hundreds of people could be seen making an exodus on foot, holding infants and whatever belongings they could carry. Israel says it killed a Hezbollah missile unit commander and his deputy JERUSALEM — Israel’s military said it killed a Hezbollah missile unit commander and his deputy during a strike in southern Lebanon earlier in the week. Israel Defense Forces said in a statement that its air forces killed Muhammad Ali Ismail, who it said was responsible for directing 'numerous terror attacks' against Israel, including the firing of rockets towards Israeli territory. The Tuesday strike also killed the commander’s deputy, Hussein Ahmad Ismail, it said. There was no immediate confirmation from Hezbollah. 20 health care centers shut down amid escalating violence in Lebanon, UN says BEIRUT — The United Nations said the escalating violence between Israel and Hezbollah has forced at least 20 primary health care centers to shut down in hard-hit areas of Lebanon. The U.N. Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, or OCHA, said in the latest escalation that began earlier in the week, Israeli airstrikes impacted 25 water facilities, affecting access to clean water for nearly 300,000 in high-risk areas. The escalation since Sept. 23 has also more than doubled the number of those displaced by the conflict from southern Lebanon. There are now over 211,000 people displaced, some 85,000 of them now living in public schools and other shelters spread around the country’s north and east. A new phase of escalation began Friday, when Israel targeted Hezbollah’s leader in the southern suburb of Beirut, in one of the largest blasts to hit the Lebanese capital in years. The fate of the group’s leader is still unknown. After the initial strike early Friday evening, Israeli warplanes continued to pound buildings and targets in the southern suburb for over six hours. Smoke and balls of fire covered the Beirut skyline for hours.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hezbollah-hamas-latest-mideast-28-september-2024-bad4f10c71b1d060a8f98fe13037da20	2024-09-27T21:34:29-07:00	
Europeans, Arab and Muslim nations launch a new initiative for an independent Palestinian state	UNITED NATIONS (AP) — European, Arab and Islamic nations have launched an initiative to strengthen support for a Palestinian state and its institutions, and prepare for a future after the war in Gaza and escalating conflict in Lebanon, Norway’s foreign minister said Friday. Espen Barth Eide told The Associated Press that 'there is a growing consensus in the international community from Western countries, from Arab countries, from the Global South, that we need to establish a Palestinian Authority, a Palestinian government, a Palestinian state — and the Palestinian state has to be recognized.' Eide said many issues need to be addressed, including the security interests of Israel and the Palestinians, recognition and normalization of relations after decades of conflict and the demobilization of Hamas as a military group. 'These are pieces of a bigger puzzle,' Norway’s chief diplomat said. 'And you can’t just come in there with one of these pieces, because it only works if all the pieces are laid in place.' But even if the puzzle is completed, it's unlikely to gain traction with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Still, Eide believes that after decades of failed or stalled negotiations, 'we need to take a new approach' to achieving an independent Palestinian state. To accelerate work on these issues, Eide said almost 90 countries attended a meeting Thursday on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly’s current gathering of world leaders. He and Saudi Arabia’s foreign minister co-chaired the session to launch 'The Global Alliance for the Implementation of a Palestinian State and a Two-State Solution.' 'We have to see how we can come out of this deadlock and try to use this deep crisis also as an opportunity to move forward,' Eide told a U.N. Security Council meeting on Gaza later Friday. Norway is the guarantor of the 1993 Oslo Accords, hailed as a breakthrough in the decades-long conflict between Arabs and Jews, which created the Palestinian Authority and set up self-rule areas in the Palestinian Authority. Eide said more than 30 years later, Israel’s 'occupation' is continuing, and there there are no negotiations leading to a final settlement and an independent Palestinian state — which led to Norway’s decision in May to recognize a Palestinian state. Now, 149 of the U.N.’s 193 member nations have recognized a Palestinian state. Eide urged all countries 'to contribute to universal recognition' and strengthen Palestinian institutions so they live up to the expectations of people in the West Bank and are prepared to return to Gaza: 'We want one Palestine, not different Palestines,' he said. Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al-Saud told the U.N. Security Council on Friday that his country, the joint Islamic-Arab ministerial committee, Norway and the European Union launched the alliance 'because we feel responsible to act to change the reality of the conflict without delay.' EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell urged all countries to take practical measures 'to bring about the free Palestine next to a secure Israel.' Borrell said on X that the first meetings of the alliance would be in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, and Brussels. Borrell asked rhetorically of anyone who opposes a two-state solution: What is the solution, and can it be implemented? He stressed that work on this initiative will move ahead quickly. Eide said this new effort is built on the 2002 Arab Peace Initiative, 'but updated to today’s reality.' The 2002 initiative, endorsed by the Arab League and the 57-member Organization of Islamic Cooperation, offered Israel normalized relations in exchange for a full withdrawal from territories captured in 1967. He said efforts started long ago to build the institutions of a Palestinian state. 'It’s difficult,' Eide said. 'Their hands are tied in many ways. We’re seeing an increasing amount of illegal settlements and settle violence.' 'But still, there is an embryonic institution there that we have to strengthen,' he said. Eide said he chaired a meeting Thursday of the Ad Hoc Liaison Committee for the Building of Palestinian Institutions, with the United States, Canada, the EU and many Mideast and European countries contributing. 'None of these tools will solve the problem on their own, and we never pretended that, but we’re trying to build a body of instruments that will take us forward to a peaceful settlement,' Eide said. 'And I am convinced it will happen here.' ___ See more of AP’s coverage of the U.N.

In global game of influence, China turns to a cheap and effective tool: fake news	WASHINGTON (AP) — When veteran U.S. diplomat Kurt Campbell traveled to the Solomon Islands to counter Beijing's influence in the South Pacific country, he quickly saw just how far China would go to spread its message. The Biden administration’s Asia czar woke up one morning in 2022 to a long article in the local press about the U.S. running chemical and biological labs in Ukraine, a claim that Washington calls an outright lie. Started by Russia, the false and incendiary claim was vigorously amplified by China's vast overseas propaganda apparatus. It was another example of 'clearly effective Russian and Chinese disinformation,' Campbell told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in July. Two years later, the claim still reverberates online, demonstrating China's sprawling effort to reshape global perceptions. The campaign, costing many billions per year, is becoming ever more sophisticated thanks to artificial intelligence. China's operations have caught the attention of intelligence analysts and policymakers in Washington, who vow to combat any actions that could influence the November election or undermine American interests. The key tactic: networks of websites purporting to be legitimate news outlets, delivering pro-China coverage that often parallels official statements and positions from Beijing. Shannon Van Sant, an adviser to the Committee for Freedom in Hong Kong Foundation, tracked a network of dozens of sites that posed as news organizations. One site mimicked The New York Times, using a similar font and design in what she called an attempt at legitimacy. The site carried strongly pro-Chinese messages. When Van Sant researched the site's reporters she found no information. Their names didn't belong to any known journalists working in China, and their photos bore telltale signs of being created with AI. 'Manipulation of the media is ultimately a manipulation of readers and the audience, and this is damaging to democracy and society,' Van Sant said. Liu Pengyu, spokesman for the Chinese Embassy in the U.S., said allegations that China uses news websites and social media to spread pro-Beijing information and influence public opinion in the U.S. 'are full of malicious speculations against China, which China firmly opposes.' In addition to its state media, Beijing has turned to foreign players — real or not — to relay messages and lend credibility to narratives favoring the Communist Party, said Xiao Qiang, a research scientist at the School of Information at the University of California, Berkeley. Xiao also is editor-in-chief of China Digital Times, a bilingual news website that aggregates information from and about China. Beijing's methods are wide-ranging and links to the government are often difficult to prove, Xiao said. But whether it's journalists with American-sounding names or an Indian influencer, the consistently pro-Beijing messages give them away. 'The implicit message is the same — that the Chinese Communist Party works for its people,' Xiao said. Analysts at the cybersecurity firm Logically identified 1,200 websites that had carried Russian or Chinese state media stories. The sites often target specific audiences and have names that sound like traditional news organizations or defunct newspapers. Unlike Russia or Iran, which have displayed clear preferences in the U.S. presidential campaign, Beijing is more cautious and focused on spreading positive content about China. While the sites aren't owned by China, they run Chinese content. When Logically looked at content specifically about the U.S. election, 20% could be traced back to Chinese or Russian state media. 'There's a decent likelihood that these articles could influence U.S. audiences without them even knowing where it comes from,' said Alex Nelson, Logically's senior manager for strategy and analysis. According to the Gallup World Poll, more countries surveyed view the U.S. positively, but the share of countries where views of both the U.S. and China are negative overall is higher than 15 years ago, signaling the U.S. doesn’t appear to be making gains over China. Some U.S. officials want to increase spending to even the playing field. The House of Representatives this month approved a bill that would authorize $325 million annually through 2027 to counter China’s global influence, including its disinformation campaigns. The measure still needs Senate approval. 'We are in a global competition for influence with China, and if you want to win it, then you cannot do it on a middle-power budget,' said Rep. Gregory Meeks, a Democrat from New York. Chinese President Xi Jinping has demanded a systematic buildup of Chinese narratives that would give his country a global voice 'commensurate with' its international stature. Beijing has invested in state media such as the Xinhua news agency and China Central Television to convey its messages to global audiences in various languages and platforms. Media groups at the local level are creating 'international communication centers' to build an overseas presence with websites, news channels and social media accounts. Beijing also has struck media partnerships worldwide, and the article Campbell read in the Solomon Islands is likely a result of those. China’s outreach is tied to the global race for economic dominance in electric vehicles, computer chips, AI and quantum computing, said Jaret Riddick, a senior fellow at Georgetown University's Center for Security and Emerging Technology. 'The countries that lead on emerging technologies will be the countries that have a great advantage going forward,' Riddick said. To tell its story, Beijing has not shied away from using fake personas. A 2023 State Department report detailed the case of a published writer named Yi Fan, originally described as a Chinese foreign ministry analyst. Yi morphed into a journalist, then became an independent analyst. Yi's details changed, but the message did not. Through published commentaries and writings, Yi trumpeted close ties between China and Africa, praised Beijing’s approach to environmental sustainability and argued that China must counter distorted Western narratives. Then there was Wilson Edwards, a supposed Swiss virologist quoted in Chinese media as a COVID-19 expert who criticized the U.S. response. But Swiss officials found no evidence he existed. 'If you exist, we would like to meet you!' the Swiss Embassy in Beijing wrote on social media. ___ AP writer Amelia Thomson-DeVeaux contributed from Washington.	https://apnews.com/article/china-disinformation-fake-news-russia-3085f10d6edca36f6415d6410e5ef874	2024-09-27T19:13:24-07:00	
Money Gambians send home from Europe is a lifeline for their families but the sacrifices take a toll	KWINELLA, Gambia (AP) — Binta Bah met her husband last year on a dating app and instantly fell in love. They spent hours every day glued to their mobile phones and soon got married on a video call. But they've met in person only once, when Suleyman Bah came home to Gambia for a visit, months after the wedding. He is one of tens of thousands of West Africans who have undertaken the perilous journey to Europe, and is now working in a factory in Germany. Every month he sends money home. He is not alone — Gambians abroad send hundreds of millions of dollars a year in remittances, according to the World Bank. The remittances account for a fourth of the tiny country's economy — the highest such proportion on the African continent. Even as European countries increase their efforts to keep migrants out, Gambians and other West Africans keep risking the dangerous route, known locally as 'the backway,' in unsafe boats across the Atlantic Ocean — or trek hundreds of miles across the Sahara Desert and then cross the Mediterranean Sea. Almost 10% of Gambia’s population of 2.7 million has left the country, most of them young men from rural areas. The money they send is an economic lifeline for their families but their absence weighs heavily on their communities. 'It’s difficult to be apart,' the 24-year-old Binta Bah said of her long-distance marriage. 'But it’s good when the other person takes care of you.' 'Whenever I need something, like to see a doctor, he sends the money straight away,' added Bah, who lives with her mother-in-law. Life is increasingly difficult in their village of Kwinella, where villagers for centuries grew rice, maize, millet and peanuts to make a living. But ravages of climate change and outdated farming practices have made their traditional lifestyle unsustainable. Moustapha Sabally, deputy chief of Kiang Central province, which includes Kwinella, said the rains have become unpredictable for farming, which is still done by hand and without tractors. Few young men are around to do that work, he said, and estimated that about 70% of them left the province for the capital, Banjul, or for Europe. That leaves women and older people who struggle with the long and laborious work on the land, forcing the community to depend on remittances, Sabally said. Without the remittances, 'life would be very difficult,' he said. Gambia, the smallest country on the African mainland, is surrounded by Senegal except for a sliver of the coast where the Gambia River flows into the Atlantic Ocean. According to the World Bank, 75% of its population lives in poverty and there is virtually no industry. The economy relies on imports, and living costs have skyrocketed since the coronavirus pandemic. Nearly 60% of Gambians are under 25, and nearly half of them are unemployed. Despite European Union's efforts in West Africa to reduce the number of migrants, the lack of jobs reinforces the conviction of many that leaving is their only option. Last year alone, over 8,000 Gambians arrived in Europe, according to the International Organization for Migration. Many others die trying. Earlier this year, a boat carrying 300 migrants, mostly from Gambia and Senegal, capsized off Mauritania; more than a dozen were killed and at least 150 others went missing. Last year, a young man from Kwinella drowned on his way to Europe. Because the journey is so risky, most young men slip away for Europe without letting their loved ones know they're leaving. Musukebbe Manjang's 39-year-old husband left Kwinella for Italy 10 years ago, after he could no longer make enough money from construction work. She never encouraged him to leave, 'the risk was just too high,' she said. One evening, when Manjang was pregnant with their third child, her husband's younger brother called him from Italy, and he simply disappeared without a word. He later called to say he had left for Europe. Then she heard nothing for nine months, and her anger turning to fear. When he finally arrived in Italy, he called and explained that he had been kidnapped in Libya, long a key starting point for many Mediterranean crossings to Europe. These days, Manjang's husband sends around 14,000 dalasi, or $200, a month, enough to cover the children's school fees, food and clothes, she said. But on a personal level, it's been difficult. 'He misses all the important moments,' she said. 'He hasn't even met our youngest daughter.' Gambia's central bank says remittances amounted to over $730 million last year but experts warn that the rising costs of living will push more men to migrate abroad. Eliman Jallow, 42, the Gambia-born founder of a U.K.-based company that facilitates sending money home to Africa, says his clients are a mix, from highly skilled workers to manual laborers. The son of Ansumana Sanneh from Kaiaf, a village not far from Kwinella, was a teacher. He left for Europe because he could barely make a living on a teacher's monthly salary of 5,000 dalassi, about $70. His journey was cut short when he was kidnapped by a Libyan militia and Sanneh paid the equivalent of $700 in ransom before his son was freed and returned home. Sanneh believes the dreams of the young village men are fueled by the misguided idea of Europe as a promised land. But with rising costs of living in European countries, migrants today are able to send less money home than in the past, he said. The gamble is simply not worth the risks, Sanneh said. But stories of success journeys and evidence of what remittances can do often outweigh such words of caution — large concrete village homes built with money sent back are solid; images posted on social media by migrants who work in Europe appeal to the young men still in the village. Despite his ordeal, Sanneh's son hopes to find a way to leave Gambia again. Not far from their home, a group of teenagers practiced a dance routine in front of a stylish brick house, its driveway lined with spotless pink tiles. The teens were recording a video for TikTok, they said, and chose the prettiest — and largest — village house for the background. The house, they said, belongs to a family whose young man migrated to the United States, for many, the most coveted migrant destination. ___ For more news on Africa and development: https://apnews.com/hub/africa-pulse ___ The Associated Press receives financial support for global health and development coverage in Africa from the Gates Foundation.

What to know from the UN: Netanyahu says no cease-fire, but other countries keep asking	UNITED NATIONS (AP) — After a day filled with hopes of a cease-fire between Lebanon and Israel, the U.N. General Assembly meeting Friday was a harsh reality check. Israeli Prime Minister BENJAMIN NETANYAHU shut down the idea in a morning speech that he said he didn't initially intend to make. He said he had not planned to come to the meeting this year, because his country is at war, but 'after I heard the lies and slanders leveled at my country by many of the speakers at this podium, I decided to come here and set the record straight.' The week has been full of speakers calling for a cease-fire in both Lebanon and Gaza, continuing into Friday. But Netanyahu wasn't swayed. He said his nation will 'continue degrading Hezbollah' until achieving its goals along the Lebanon border, and would no longer tolerate daily rocket fire from the area. Shortly after Netanyahu wrapped up his speech, the Israeli military said it carried out a strike on Hezbollah’s headquarters in Beirut, which caused huge blasts in the city. Here’s your daily guide to what’s going on at the United Nations this week: From the podium MORE ANTI-WAR: Calls for Israel to stop its war in Gaza and back off from a growing conflict in Lebanon continued. The two speakers who preceded Netanyahu each made a point of calling out Israel for its actions. 'Mr. Netanyahu, stop this war now,' Slovenian Prime Minister ROBERT GOLOB said as he closed his remarks, pounding the podium. And Pakistani Prime Minister SHEHBAZ SHARIF, speaking just before the Israeli leader, declared of Gaza: 'This is not just a conflict. This is systematic slaughter of innocent people of Palestine.' He thumped the rostrum to audible applause. PROMISE FOR DEMOCRACY: Tanzania Prime Minister KASSIM MAJALIWA pledged that his country will uphold democracy and human rights ahead of next year’s presidential election. An opposition party official was killed in early September and two main opposition leaders were arrested among a dozen other opposition politicians while planning a youth rally and during protests against recent killing and arrest of opposition officials and members. President SAMIA SULUHU has condemned the killing of the opposition official Ali Kibao and promised justice. She’s serving out the term of the late President JOHN MAGUFULI, whose autocratic rule saw the ban on political rallies and detention of opposition leaders. POETRY IN POLICY: As Pakistan tries to climb out of an economic crisis, Sharif turned Friday to poetry to convey his country’s resolve. Addressing world leaders at the U.N. General Assembly, he read aloud part of 'Keep Going,' a 1921 piece by American poet Edgar A. Guest. It begins 'When things go wrong, as they sometimes will' — when, for example, 'the funds are low and the debts are high.' (Sharif substituted 'credits' for 'funds.') Pakistan’s debts are indeed substantial. The International Monetary Fund this week approved a $7 billion loan for the nation, which plunged into one of the worst economic crises in its history after flooding in 2022. Sharif's government raised electricity prices, saying the hike was necessary to meet conditions of the new loan. The increase spurred protests and a merchants’ strike. Sharif told the assembly that his government has 'taken some very difficult but necessary decisions that have rescued our economy from collapse.' Then he brought up the poem, saying it had bucked him up. He went through a stanza that ends: 'When care is pressing you down a bit, / Rest if you must, but don’t you quit.' 'This,' Sharif told the assembly, 'is how we have learned to face our challenges and negotiate the most daunting challenges that we have faced.' CUBA COMMENTS: For decades Cuba’s primary foreign-policy priority has been ending the U.S. trade embargo on the island. The country dedicates much of its General Assembly diplomacy to getting leaders to decry the embargo. According to Cuba’s U.N. mission, by 3:41 p.m. on Friday 25 countries had addressed the embargo at this year’s UNGA and 11 leaders had critiqued the U.S. inclusion of Cuba on the list of countries that sponsor terrorism, another sanction limiting international trade. Many of the countries that spoke have benefitted from another of Cuba’s trademark programs, sending its well-trained and highly educated doctors to developing countries across the world. Right after mentioning Ukraine and Gaza, Prime Minister ALLAH MAYE HALINA of Chad told the world that 'we can’t ignore the embargo on Cuba, which hurts its people and hinders its development.' On the sidelines Norwegian Foreign Minister ESPEN BARTH EIDE, who was in the General Assembly hall listening to Netanyahu, called his address 'a rather dark speech' that was 'very defiant.' Norway recognized the State of Palestine in May. Eide said there are many countries that would like to support Israel and normalize relations, including Saudi Arabia and others in region, 'but they are not able to do that as long as the Palestinian question remains unanswered.' FUNDRAISERS, ADVOCATES: As the meeting of world leaders unfolds at the United Nations, a crush of events unfold on the sidelines of the official high-level meetings, where nonprofits, advocates and fundraisers mingle and lobby world leaders, billionaires and funders — and plan their next steps with each other. A few examples: On Sunday, throngs of people streamed through a 'climate science fair ' showcasing work on nature, food and the energy transition, held across Manhattan on an elevated park that runs along old rail lines. On Monday, the BILL &amp; MELINDA GATES Foundation held a ceremony featuring Grammy-winning musician JON BATISTE performing in a gold sequin suit, and honoring Brazilian PRESIDENT LUIZ INÁCIO LULA DA SILVA for his work lifting millions out of poverty and significantly reducing malnutrition among children. Climate moment Papua New Guinea's prime minister, JAMES MARAPE, told the General Assembly that accessing money to fight climate change has been a challenge. 'It is for this reason I speak in solidarity with all forest nations, especially those in the Congo Basin and Amazon Basin, for adequate compensation if we are to preserve our forests which, in fact, are the lungs of Earth,' Marape said. Voices you might have missed 'It is regrettable that the Republic of China, Taiwan, continues to be excluded from the United Nations system.' —FELETI PENITALA TEO, prime minister of Tuvalu ___ Ugandan Prime Minister NABBANJA ROBINAH asked the assembly why the U.N. has failed to forge stronger international cooperation in response to collective global challenges. 'Urgent action is required to address global inequalities with regard to poverty, hunger and disease which continue to affect disproportionally the poorest and most vulnerable,' she said. Some thing you might not know If you're following along and confused by all the strange words, take a look at our brief vocabulary of U.N. terms.

Charismatic and shrewd: A look at longtime Hezbollah leader Hassan Narallah	BEIRUT (AP) — Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah has led the Lebanese militant group for the past three decades and transformed it into one of the most powerful paramilitary groups in the Middle East. Israeli airstrikes on Friday afternoon knocked out six buildings in Beirut’s southern suburb of Harek Hreik, the largest strike in the Lebanese capital in nearly a year of fighting between Israel and Hezbollah. The Israeli military said the strike, which killed and wounded dozens of people, hit the headquarters of Hezbollah in Beirut. Three major Israeli TV channels said Nasrallah was the target of the strikes in Beirut’s southern suburbs, which has not been officially confirmed by Israel. Hezbollah officials did not comment. Here's a look at the fiery, charismatic leader: Who is Hassan Nasrallah? Under the leadership of the 64-year-old Nasrallah, Hezbollah has fought wars against Israel and taken part in the conflict in neighboring Syria, helping tip the balance of power in favor of President Bashar Assad. A charismatic and shrewd strategist, Nasrallah reshaped Hezbollah into an archenemy of Israel, cementing alliances with Shiite religious leaders in Iran and Palestinian militant groups such as Hamas. Idolized by his Lebanese Shiite followers and respected by millions of others across the Arab and Islamic world, Nasrallah holds the title of sayyid, an honorific meant to signify the Shiite cleric’s lineage dating back to the Prophet Muhammad, the founder of Islam. A fiery orator viewed as an extremist in the U.S. and much of the West, he is also considered a pragmatist compared to the firebrand militants who dominated Hezbollah after its founding in 1982, during Lebanon’s civil war. Despite the power he wields, Nasrallah has lived largely in hiding in the past years for fear of an Israeli assassination. How he rose to power Born in 1960 into a poor Shiite family in Beirut’s impoverished northern suburb of Sharshabouk, Nasrallah was later displaced to south Lebanon. He studied theology and joined the Amal movement, a Shiite political and paramilitary organization, before becoming one of Hezbollah’s founders. Hezbollah was formed by Iranian Revolutionary Guard members who came to Lebanon in the summer of 1982 to fight invading Israeli forces. It was the first group that Iran backed and used as a way to export its brand of political Islam. Nasrallah built a power base as Hezbollah over time became part of a cluster of Iranian-backed factions and governments known as the Axis of Resistance. Two days after its leader, 39-year-old Sayyed Abbas Musawi, was killed in an Israeli helicopter gunship raid in south Lebanon, Hezbollah chose Nasrallah as its secretary-general in February 1992. Five years later, the United States designated Hezbollah a terrorist organization. Under Nasrallah, Hezbollah was credited with leading the war of attrition that led to the withdrawal of Israeli troops from south Lebanon in 2000, after an 18-year occupation. Nasrallah’s eldest son, Hadi, was killed in 1997, fighting against Israeli forces. After Israel’s withdrawal from southern Lebanon in 2000, Nasrallah rose to iconic status both within Lebanon and throughout the Arab world. His messages were beamed on Hezbollah’s own radio and satellite TV station. That status was further cemented when, in 2006, Hezbollah fought Israel to a stalemate during the 34-day war. When Syria’s civil war erupted in 2011, Hezbollah fighters rushed in, siding with Assad’s forces — even though Hezbollah’s popularity took a dive as the Arab world ostracized Assad. His role in the current conflict A day after the Israel-Hamas war started on Oct. 7, Hezbollah began attacking Israeli military posts along the border calling it a 'backup front' for Gaza. In speeches throughout the conflict, he has argued that Hezbollah’s cross-border strikes had pulled away Israeli forces that would otherwise be focused on Hamas in Gaza and insisted that Hezbollah would not halt its attacks on Israel until a cease-fire is reached in Gaza. Over the past weeks, he continued to strike a defiant tone as tension rose dramatically, with Israel announcing a new phase in the conflict intended to push Hezbollah back from the border to allow thousands displaced from northern Israel to return. It launched strikes killing top military commanders with the group and was blamed for the explosion of thousands of communications devices, mainly used by Hezbollah members, that killed 37 people and wounded thousands.	https://apnews.com/article/hezbollah-nasrallah-lebanon-israel-airstrikes-haret-hreik-7d89051bb420991cee29398243c250fe	2024-09-27T13:10:40-07:00	
Wrapping up mission, US troops will leave some longstanding bases in Iraq under new deal	WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. announced an agreement with the Iraqi government Friday to wrap up the military mission in Iraq of an American-led coalition fighting the Islamic State group by next year, with U.S. troops departing some bases that they have long occupied during a two-decade-long military presence in the country. But the Biden administration refused to provide details on how many of the approximately 2,500 U.S. troops still serving in Iraq will remain there or acknowledge it will mark a full withdrawal from the country. 'I think it’s fair to say that, you know, our footprint is going to be changing within the country,' Pentagon deputy press secretary Sabrina Singh told reporters Friday without providing specifics. The announcement comes at a particularly contentious time for the Middle East, with escalating conflict between Israel and two Iranian-backed militant groups — Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza — threatening a broader regional war. Bases housing U.S. forces and contractors have been regularly targeted by Iran-backed militias over the last several years, and those attacks intensified late last year and early this spring after the Israel-Hamas war broke out nearly a year ago. For years, Iraqi officials have periodically called for a withdrawal of coalition forces, and formal talks to wind down the U.S. presence in the country have been going on for months. U.S. officials who briefed reporters Friday said the agreement will bring about a two-phase transition in the troops assigned to Iraq that began this month. In the first phase, which runs through September 2025, the coalition mission against ISIS will end and forces will leave some longstanding bases. Following the November election, American forces will start departing from Ain al-Asad airbase in western Iraq and from Baghdad International Airport, according to Iraqi government officials who spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity. Those forces will be moved to Hareer base in Erbil, in northern Iraq's Kurdistan region. In the second phase, the U.S. will continue to operate in some fashion from Iraq through 2026 to support counter-ISIS operations in Syria, a senior Biden administration official and a senior defense official said on the condition of anonymity on a call with reporters to provide details ahead of the announcement. Ultimately, the U.S. military mission would transition to a bilateral security relationship, the U.S. officials said, but they did not indicate what that might mean for the number of American troops who remain in Iraq in the future. The Iraqi officials said some American troops may stay at Hareer base after 2026 because the Kurdistan regional government would like them to stay. 'We have taken an important step in resolving the issue of the international coalition to fight ISIS,' Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed al-Sudani said in a speech this month. He noted 'the government’s belief in the capabilities of our security forces that defeated the remnants of ISIS.' The continued presence of U.S. troops has been a political vulnerability for Sudani, whose government is under increased influence from Iran. Iraq has long struggled to balance its ties with the U.S. and Iran, both allies of the Iraqi government but regional archenemies. 'We thank the government for its position to expel the international coalition forces,' Qais Khazali, founder of Asaib Ahl al-Haq — an Iran-backed Iraqi Shia militia that has conducted attacks against U.S. forces in Iraq — said last week. But critics caution that this year’s surge of ISIS attacks in Syria across the desert border from Iraq suggest the drawdown in Iraq is a 'really significant cause for concern,' said Charles Lister, a senior fellow with the Middle East Institute research center in Washington. The U.S. withdrawal from Iraq isn’t because ISIS has disappeared, Lister said. 'The withdrawal is because there’s a significant proportion of the policy-making community in Baghdad that doesn’t want American troops on Iraqi soil.' The agreement marks the third time in the last two decades that the U.S. has announced a formal transition of the military's role there. The U.S. invaded Iraq in March 2003 in what it called a massive 'shock and awe' bombing campaign that lit up the skies, laid waste to large sections of the country and paved the way for American ground troops to converge on Baghdad. The invasion was based on what turned out to be faulty claims that Saddam Hussein had secretly stashed weapons of mass destruction. Such weapons never materialized. The U.S. presence grew to more than 170,000 troops at the peak of counterinsurgency operations in 2007. The Obama administration negotiated the drawdown of forces, and in December 2011, the final combat troops departed, leaving only a small number of military personnel behind to staff an office of security assistance and a detachment of Marines to guard the embassy compound. In 2014, the rise of the Islamic State group and its rapid capture of a wide swath across Iraq and Syria brought U.S. and partner nation forces back at the invitation of the Iraqi government to help rebuild and retrain police and military units that had fallen apart and fled. After ISIS lost its hold on the territory it once claimed, coalition military operations ended in 2021. An enduring U.S. presence of about 2,500 troops stayed in Iraq to maintain training and conduct partnered counter-ISIS operations with Iraq's military. In the years since, the U.S. has maintained that presence to pressure Iranian-backed militias active in Iraq and Syria. The presence of American forces in Iraq also makes it more difficult for Iran to move weapons across Iraq and Syria into Lebanon, for use by its proxies, including the Lebanese Hezbollah, against Israel. —- AP writer Ellen Knickmeyer contributed from Washington.	https://apnews.com/article/iraq-us-troops-military-withdrawal-iran-a79aa83dca8f776f87a138bfe5697fa3	2024-09-27T10:16:34-07:00	
At the UN, young people push to make sure the generational shift is faster — and more substantial	UNITED NATIONS (AP) — They were sharing the world stage to discuss a plan to give young people more input in decisions that shape lives. And 26-year-old Daphne Frias, talking to the head of the United Nations, had thoughts. 'Truly, it’s time for the people who do so much of the talking to do less of the talking,' the disability and climate activist told Secretary-General António Guterres. 'And to have the voices of my generation ... lead.' Their exchange this month, at a leadup event to the U.N. General Assembly's meeting of nations' leaders, was a measure of diplomacy's generation gap. A big young cohort is coming of age in a troubled world, and it's coming with ideas about inclusion, participation and authority. Those ideas are nudging the hierarchical, bureaucratic ways of an international order set up when their grandparents were kids or not even born. 'My generation messed up when it comes to the world today,' the 75-year-old U.N. chief told Frias and an audience of activists and others in the vast, coolly elegant assembly hall. The world needs a new generation that understands 'we are living to disaster' and can turn it around, Guterres said, adding emphatically: 'We cannot do that if your generation is not part of the decision-making process that is still controlled by my generation that messed up.' Passing the torch can be difficult But how to make that change in a global system and governments largely run by older people, and a United Nations that has tried to engage the young but still has some procedures, protocol — and even architecture — reflecting what was 'modern' more than seven decades ago? Does the U.N. matter, anyway, to a social-network-native generation with its own means of connecting and organizing across borders, and with a sense of urgency that chafes at the pace of intergovernmental accords? Marinel Sumook Ubaldo, a 27-year-old Filipina climate activist, has been involved in U.N. conferences and believes the world body can be a valuable platform for advocacy. But so can grassroots organizing and building public pressure outside big organizations, Ubaldo says. 'If the U.N. can shift from symbolic inclusion to truly empowering youth with decision-making authority and accountability mechanisms, I would say it would remain relevant,' she said. 'But if not, young people will continue to forge new paths.' Over 1.9 billion people — nearly a quarter of the world population — are between ages 10 and 24. But young people are sparse in the corridors of power. Under 3% of members of national legislatures are under 30, according to the Inter-Parliamentary Union, a global group of such bodies. Of course, today's young activists aren't the first to worry about the world they're inheriting, to yearn to be heard or to feel they can't wait patiently for the creaky wheels of change to turn. But this generation has been steeped in a particular brew of risks and crises: post-9/11 wars and security culture, a financial meltdown, a pandemic, billions of people living in conflict zones, a planet that's warming at the fastest rate ever measured. And, with the rise of social media, the generation's ideas about solutions to such challenges move around faster than ever before. As Frias puts it, 'we don’t have time for dues to be paid' to try to influence things. 'We constantly get told that we are inspirational, that we’re doing a great job, that we are the future,' Frias, an American-born daughter of Dominican immigrants, said in an interview. 'But inspiration doesn’t change the world. Action does.' There's growing momentum — to a point Over the years, the U.N. has made various overtures to young people. An assistant secretary-general for youth affairs, Felipe Paullier, was tapped last year. There had previously been a lower-level youth envoy. A roster of youth delegates, advisory groups and more have taken part in U.N. activities over the decades. Some have attracted considerable attention, including speeches by Afghan girls' education advocate and Nobel laureate Malala Yousafzai, climate activist Greta Thunberg and K-pop stars BTS. A 2018 initiative called 'Youth 2030' is meant to make young people 'full-fledged partners' in the U.N.’s work. A recent update said progress has been 'steady but slower than desired.' Now comes the ' Pact for the Future,' a wide-ranging document approved Sunday at a summit that kicked off this year’s big General Assembly gathering. The pact includes pledges to spend more on youth services, to create jobs and to promote 'meaningful youth participation' in national policymaking and U.N. processes. That might sound bland to the casual observer. But through a U.N. lens, devoting a chapter to youth and future generations in a laboriously negotiated global blueprint — and getting 193 nations to sign off — elevates and enshrines youths as a priority. 'Ten or 15 years ago, you know, young people were just seen as beneficiaries of policies,' Paullier, 33, said in an interview. 'There are many things changing that are showing institutions, decision-makers, are saying, 'OK, we need to engage with them as partners.'' There's still far to go, he notes. Participation must actually be meaningful Nudhara Yusuf, who co-chaired a civil society conference that helped prepare for the recent summit, says the U.N. has made 'a real turn' toward engaging young people. Now it's a question of making promises of 'meaningful' participation ... meaningful. 'How do you go beyond just putting someone on a panel? How do you ensure that they’re part of the dialogue offstage, as well?' asks Yusuf, 25. Born in Britain and raised in India, she's a researcher at the Stimson Center think tank in Washington. Young activists also may lack the resources to move in international circles when it entails far-flung travel. While many have started organizations and done fundraising, some say it's hard getting past a 'youth organization' rubric to tap bigger pools of grants, despite working on broader issues. Amani Joel Mafigi, who co-founded an entrepreneurship organization in Uganda, thinks the U.N. should establish a youth empowerment fund to back climate, social justice and innovation initiatives. The 27-year-old offered that suggestion to the secretary-general at the same event with Frias. In an interview, Mafigi added that he'd want young 'changemakers' to be central to structuring such a fund and steering its work. 'I have seen how much young people with little resources can do and can achieve within a minimum period of time, with less bureaucratic processes,' said Mafigi, who fled Congo as a refugee in 2008. Guterres told him, Frias and others in the assembly hall that the U.N. aims to add more young staffers and to give youths a voice 'when things are being decided, not when things have been decided.' 'But, I mean, let’s be clear: Power is never given. Power is taken,' Guterres said. 'So I encourage young people not to be afraid to fight for their rights.' ___ See more of AP’s coverage of the U.N.

Iranian operatives charged in the US with hacking Donald Trump's presidential campaign	WASHINGTON (AP) — The Justice Department unsealed criminal charges Friday against three Iranian operatives suspected of hacking Donald Trump's presidential campaign and disseminating stolen information to media organizations. The three accused hackers were employed by Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard and their operation also targeted a broad swath of targets, including government officials, members of the media and non-governmental organizations, the Justice Department said. The Trump campaign disclosed on Aug. 10 that it had been hacked and said Iranian actors had stolen and distributed sensitive internal documents. Multiple major news organizations that said they were leaked confidential information from inside the Trump campaign, including Politico, The New York Times and The Washington Post, declined to publish it. U.S. intelligence officials subsequently linked Iran to a hack of the Trump campaign and to an attempted breach of the Joe Biden-Kamala Harris campaign. They said the hack-and-dump operation was meant to sow discord, exploit divisions within American society and potentially influence the outcome of elections that Iran perceives to be 'particularly consequential in terms of the impact they could have on its national security interests.' Last week, officials also revealed that the Iranians in late June and early July sent unsolicited emails containing excerpts of the hacked information to people associated with the Biden campaign. None of the recipients replied. The Harris campaign said the emails resembled spam or a phishing attempt and condemned the outreach to the Iranians as 'unwelcome and unacceptable malicious activity.' The indictment comes at a time of heightened tensions between Washington and Tehran as Iran-backed Hezbollah and Israel escalate attacks against each other, raising concerns about the prospect of an all-out war, and as U.S. officials say they continue to track physical threats by Iran against a number of officials including Trump.	https://apnews.com/article/trump-hacking-iran-justice-department-1d7d83ccdc6c879be2802142f1c47191	2024-09-27T07:24:43-07:00	
Israel says it struck Hezbollah's headquarters in huge explosion that shakes Lebanese capital	BEIRUT (AP) — Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office says the Israeli leader is cutting short a visit to the U.S. and returning home. The office made the announcement shortly after a massive Israeli airstrike on Hezbollah’s headquarters in Beirut. Netanyahu, in New York to address the United Nations, had been scheduled to stay in the U.S. until Saturday night, after the end of the Jewish sabbath. Israeli politicians do not normally travel on the sabbath except for matters of great import. THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP’s earlier story follows below. BEIRUT (AP) — The Israeli military said Friday it struck the central headquarters of Hezbollah in Beirut, where a series of massive explosions leveled multiple buildings, sending clouds of orange and black smoke billowing in the skies. The strikes in the suburbs south of Lebanon's capital came shortly after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addressed the U.N., vowing that Israel's campaign against Hezbollah would continue. His comments further dimmed hopes for an internationally backed cease-fire aimed at preventing a spiral into all-out war. Three major Israeli TV channels said Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah was the target of the strikes. But the unsourced reports could not immediately be confirmed by The Associated Press, and the army declined comment. But given the size and timing of the blasts, there were strong indications that a high-value target may have been inside the buildings struck. To a degree unseen in past conflicts, Israel this past week has aimed to eliminate Hezbollah’s senior leadership. In another sign of the strike's importance, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant’s office said he was huddled with the head of Israel’s air force and other top commanders at military headquarters, following updates. Friday's bombings were the most powerful yet seen in the Lebanese capital the past year. Israeli army spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said the strikes targeted the main Hezbollah headquarters, located beneath residential buildings. Four buildings in the Haret Hreik neighborhood of Dahiyeh were reduced to rubble, Hezbollah’s Al-Manar TV reported. The blast rattled windows and shook houses some 30 kilometers (18 miles) north of Beirut. Ambulances were seen headed to the scene, sirens wailing. Officials at a nearby hospital said they received at least 10 wounded, three critically including a Syrian child. Israel dramatically intensified its airstrikes in Lebanon this week, saying it is determined to put an end to more than 11 months of Hezbollah fire into its territory. The scope of Israel’s operation remains unclear, but officials have said a ground invasion to push the militant group away from the border is a possibility. Israel has moved thousands of troops toward the border in preparation. At least 25 people were killed in Israeli strikes early Friday, Health Minister Firass Abiad said, bringing the death toll in Lebanon this week to more than 720. He said the dead included dozens of women and children. A predawn strike Friday in the mainly Sunni border town of Chebaa hit a home, killing nine members of the same family, the state news agency said. A resident identified the dead as Hussein Zahra, his wife Ratiba, their five children and two of their grandchildren. At the U.N., Netanyahu vowed to 'continue degrading Hezbollah' until Israel achieves its goals. Netanyahu’s comments have damped hopes for a U.S.-backed call for a 21-day truce between Israel and Hezbollah to allow time for a diplomatic solution. Hezbollah has not responded to the proposal. Iranian-backed Hezbollah, the strongest armed force in Lebanon, began firing rockets into Israel almost immediately after Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack, saying it was a show of support for the Palestinians. Since then, it and the Israeli military have traded fire almost daily, forcing tens of thousands of people to flee their homes on both sides of the border. An Israeli security official said he expects a possible war against Hezbollah would not last for as long as the current war in Gaza, because the Israeli military’s goals are much narrower. In Gaza, Israel has vowed to dismantle Hamas’ military and political regime, but the goal in Lebanon is just to push Hezbollah away from the border with Israel -- 'not a high bar like Gaza' in terms of operational objectives, said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity due to military briefing guidelines. The Israeli military said it carried out dozens of strikes over the course of two hours around the south on Friday, including in the cities of Sidon and Nabatiyeh. It said it was targeting Hezbollah rocket launchers and infrastructure. It said Hezbollah fired a volley of rockets toward the northern Israeli city of Tiberias. In the southern Lebanese city of Tyre, civil defense workers pulled the bodies of two women – 35-year-old Hiba Ataya and her mother Sabah Olyan – from the rubble of a building brought down by a strike. 'That’s Sabah, these are her clothes, my love,' one man cried out as her body emerged. Israel says its accelerated strikes this week have already inflicted heavy damage on Hezbollah’s weapons capabilities – and a string of its top commanders have been assassinated in strikes. Officials have suggested its limited fire of missile and rockets the past week show it has been set back. But the group boasted a large arsenal of rockets and missiles and its remaining capacities remain unknown. Hezbollah officials and their supporters remain defiant. Not long before the explosions Friday evening, thousands were massed in another part of Beirut’s suburbs for the funeral of three Hezbollah members killed in earlier strikes, including the head of the group’s drone unit, Mohammed Surour. Men and women in the giant crowd waved their fists in the air and chanted, 'We will never accept humiliation' as they marched marched behind the three coffins, wrapped in the group's yellow flag. Hussein Fadlallah, head of Hezbollah in Beirut, said in a speech that no matter how many commanders Israel kills, the group has endless numbers of experience fighters who are deployed all over the front lines. Fadlallah vowed that Hezbollah will keep fighting until Israel stops its offensive in Gaza. 'We will not abandon the support of Palestine, Jerusalem and oppressed Gaza,' Fadlallah said. 'There is no place for neutrality in this battle.'	https://apnews.com/article/lebanon-israel-hezbollah-airstrikes-suburb-617575d9c5d7c711bc02e7b81d2ba4ad	2024-09-27T06:34:31-07:00	
The Latest: Trump meets with Zelenskyy and Harris heads to US-Mexico border	Vice President Kamala Harris was making her first visit to the U.S.-Mexico border on Friday since becoming the Democratic presidential nominee and former President Donald Trump met in New York with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Harris was scheduled to appear in Douglas, Arizona, as Trump and his fellow Republicans pound her relentlessly over the Biden administration’s record on migration. Zelenskyy's visit with Trump came as public tensions have been rising between the two over Ukraine’s defense against Russia’s invasion. Follow the AP’s Election 2024 coverage at: https://apnews.com/hub/election-2024. Here’s the latest: Iranian operatives charged with hacking Trump campaign The Justice Department has announced criminal charges against Iranian operatives suspected of hacking Donald Trump’s presidential campaign and disseminating stolen information to media organizations. The indictment comes at a time of heightened tensions between Washington and Tehran as Iran-backed Hezbollah and Israel escalate attacks against each other, raising concerns about the prospect of an all-out war, and as U.S. officials say they continue to track physical threats by Iran against a number of officials including Trump. The Trump campaign disclosed on Aug. 10 that it had been hacked and said Iranian actors had stolen and distributed sensitive internal documents. Senate Democrats make a late push in red-leaning states Democrats looking to stay in the Senate majority are going on the offense in two U.S. Senate races in the Republican-leaning states of Texas and Florida. Sen. Gary Peters, chair of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, says the group is making a 'multi-million dollar investment' in television advertising in the two states and that he’s 'very confident there’s going to be more coming.' Republicans are portraying the investments as a sign that Democrats are worried that incumbent Sen. Jon Tester is in trouble in his bid to win reelection in Montana. Jews and Catholics warn against Trump’s latest loyalty test for voters Former President Donald Trump recently reissued his loyalty test to religious Americans, declaring that he can best protect their freedoms while preemptively blaming some if he loses the presidential election in November. He said Jews and Catholics can vote for him and ace the test, but those who don’t — in his words — 'need their head examined.' If he’s defeated, Trump added, Jewish people would bear blame for that result. Among the Jewish leaders appalled at Trump’s remarks was Rabbi Rick Jacobs, president of the Union for Reform Judaism. Jacobs said: 'It puts a target on American Jews. ... Stop.'	https://apnews.com/article/harris-trump-walz-vance-election-46c9bf1c35975f4a181c3585dd41c0d8	2024-09-27T05:56:17-07:00	
Netanyahu, at UN, vows that Israel will keep 'degrading Hezbollah' until its objectives are met	UNITED NATIONS (AP) — His leadership strained by conflicts on two fronts, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told world leaders at the United Nations on Friday that his nation will 'continue degrading Hezbollah' until achieving its goals along the Lebanon border, further dimming hopes for an internationally backed cease-fire to halt the spiral into an all-out regional war. He said his government would no longer tolerate daily rocket fire from the area. Shortly after Netanyahu wrapped up his speech, the Israeli military said it carried out a strike on Hezbollah's headquarters in Beirut, which caused huge blasts in the city. 'Israel has every right to remove this threat and return our citizens to their home safely. And that’s exactly what we’re doing ... we’ll continue degrading Hezbollah until all our objectives are met,' Netanyahu said to a gallery that — at least from the crowd noise — appeared replete with his supporters. 'Just imagine if terrorists turned El Paso and San Diego into ghost towns ... How long would the American government tolerate that?' he said, shaking his fist in emphasis. 'Yet Israel has been tolerating this intolerable situation for almost a year. Well, I’ve come here today to say: Enough is enough.' Netanyahu, armed with visual aids as he has been in the past, defended his nation's response to the Oct. 7, 2023, attacks by Hamas on Israel that triggered an Israeli military operation that has devastated the Gaza Strip. He said he traveled to the United Nations to refute the untruths he had heard from other leaders on the same rostrum earlier in the week. 'I didn’t intend to come here this year. My country is at war fighting for its life,' Netanyahu said. 'But after I heard the lies and slanders leveled at my country by many of the speakers at this podium, I decided to come here and set the record straight.' He insisted that Israel wanted peace but said of Iran: 'If you strike us, we will strike you.' He once again blamed Iran for being behind many of the problems in the region. 'For too long, the world has appeased Iran,' Netanyahu said. 'That appeasement must end.' As he spoke, the seats in the Iran delegation sat empty. Outside, protesters against Netanyahu and Israel's policies demonstrated behind police barricades. Israel is fighting on two fronts Israel’s campaign in Gaza has killed more than 41,500 Palestinians and wounded more than 96,000 others, according to the latest figures released Thursday by the Health Ministry. The ministry, part of Gaza’s Hamas government, doesn’t differentiate between civilians and combatants, but more than half the dead have been women and children, including about 1,300 children under the age of 2. Israel has maintained its military operations are justified and are necessary to defend itself. 'This war can come to an end now. All that has to happen is for Hamas to surrender, lay down its arms and release all the hostages,' Netanyahu said. 'But if they don’t – if they don’t – we will fight until we achieve total victory. Total victory. There is no substitute for it. ' He said Israeli forces have destroyed '90%' of Hamas’ rockets and killed or captured half of its forces. But he insisted nonetheless that he was pursuing peace. 'Israel has made peace and will make peace again,' he said. In recent days, Israel has turned its attention to the border with Lebanon, where it is has stepped up strikes targeting Hezbollah but has inflicted civilian casualties as well. Hezbollah began firing rockets into Israel almost immediately after the Hamas attack, saying it was a show of support for the Palestinians. That triggered Israeli counterfire and the two sides have traded fire almost daily for the 11 months since, driving tens of thousands of people from their homes on both sides of the border. Israel vows to drive Hezbollah away from the border to allow its citizens to return safely to their homes. Hezbollah says it won’t stop firing rockets until the Gaza war ends. Late Wednesday, the United States, France and other allies jointly called for an 'immediate' 21-day cease-fire to allow for negotiations as fears grow that this week’s escalation could spiral into an all-out war. Hezbollah hasn’t officially responded to the ceasefire proposal. The United Nations says over 90,000 people have been displaced by five days of Israeli strikes on Lebanon, bringing the total to 200,000 people who have been displaced in Lebanon since the cross-border exchanges began. His speech impacted the rest of the General Assembly Netanyahu also made a lengthy appeal for Israeli relations with Saudi Arabia — but did it without mentioning what’s blocking any action: Saudi Arabia’s demand for an independent Palestinian state. As Netanyahu took the stage Friday morning, there was enough ruckus in the audience that the presiding diplomat had to shout, 'Order, please.' The two speakers who preceded Netanyahu on Friday each made a point of calling out Israel for its actions. 'Mr. Netanyahu, stop this war now,' Slovenian Prime Minister Robert Golob said as he closed his remarks, pounding the podium. And Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, speaking just before the Israeli leader, declared of Gaza: 'This is not just a conflict. This is systematic slaughter of innocent people of Palestine.' He thumped the rostrum to audible applause. And after the Israeli leader left the stage, the next speaker, Prime Minister Mia Mottley of Barbados, started speaking but then paused for noises in the gallery, saying, 'We can wait.' She did so for about 20 seconds before she continued. It wasn't just Friday, either. On Thursday, the leader of the Palestinian Authority and a top Lebanese official both made their cases to fellow leaders — cases that included harsh words for Israel as well. Mahmoud Abbas' first words to the General Assembly were a sentence repeated three times in reference to Gaza: 'We will not leave. We will not leave. We will not leave.' He accused Israel of destroying Gaza and making it unlivable. And Abdallah Bouhabib, Lebanon's foreign minister, decried Israel's 'systematic destruction of Lebanese border villages.' 'The crisis in Lebanon threatens the entire Middle East,' Bouhabib said. 'We wish today to reiterate our call for a cease-fire on all fronts.' ___ See more of AP’s coverage of the U.N.

Somali-Canadian rapper K’naan charged with 2010 sexual assault in Quebec City	QUEBEC CITY (AP) — Canadian rapper K’naan, known for the global hit 'Wavin’ Flag,' has been charged over an alleged sexual assault in Quebec City dating back more than 14 years. A charge sheet filed at the courthouse in Quebec City on Thursday says the rapper, whose given name is Keinan Abdi Warsame, is charged with one count of sexual assault from July 2010. The arrest warrant alleges the assault took place between July 16 and July 17, 2010, dates that coincide with the musician’s appearance at Quebec City’s popular Festival d’été de Québec. The case was before the court, but the accused wasn't present. His lawyers weren’t immediately available for comment. The victim, whose identity is protected, was 29 at the time of the alleged assault. The Somalia-born musician grew up in Toronto, but resides in Brooklyn, New York, according to the charge sheet. K’naan was given the cultural impact award at Canada’s SOCAN Awards on Tuesday for the global resonance of the 2009 hit 'Wavin’ Flag.' ___ This story first moved on Sept. 26, 2024, and was retransmitted on Sept. 27, 2024, to remove an image that misidentified another person as K’naan.	https://apnews.com/article/knaan-sexual-assault-charge-quebec-city-canada-95e616d41fd196fd07dcb370ab423013	2024-09-27T04:26:45-07:00	
Czechs vote in the runoff election for a third of the seats in Parliament's upper house	PRAGUE (AP) — Czechs cast ballots on Friday in the second round of voting for a third of the seats in Parliament’s upper house, the Senate. The current ruling coalition led by Prime Minister Petr Fiala has a clear majority in the Senate though the main opposition group, led by former populist Prime Minister Andrej Babis, has the most candidates advancing from last week’s first round to the runoff for 27 seats in the 81-seat Senate. The top two finishers in each district faced each other in a head-to-head vote. Babis’ ANO, or YES in English, had 19 candidates advancing to the runoffs, the best first round result for the centrist movement. Five candidates reached the 50% threshold in the first round to win seats outright, leaving 22 seats to be decided in runoffs. Parliament’s lower house dominates the legislative process, but the Senate plays an important role in passing constitutional amendments and approving Constitutional Court judges. The results of the two-day vote will be known later on Saturday. In a separate vote last week, ANO also dominated Czech regional elections, winning 10 of the 13 regions contested. In another setback for the ruling coalition, a junior party, the Pirates, said earlier this week that it would leave the Cabinet over Fiala’s decision to fire the party leader. Fiala said he had lost trust in Ivan Bartos’s ability to deal with the problems linked to a new digital system for issuing building permits. Fiala’s government will retain a majority in Parliament’s lower house, even without the Pirates.	https://apnews.com/article/czech-senate-election-babis-d8ad948c4589e128575fedee51720504	2024-09-27T04:17:05-07:00	
Civil society groups nudge and cajole world leaders from the sidelines of United Nations week	NEW YORK (AP) — As the meeting of world leaders kicked off at the United Nations on Sunday, across Manhattan on an elevated park that runs along old rail lines, throngs of people streamed through a 'climate science fair' showcasing work on nature, food and the energy transition. Emerson Collective funds the nonprofits, advocacy organizations and companies at the fair and brought them all to town as counterprogramming to the U.N. General Assembly. The annual convening this year amounted to a shaky demonstration by nation states that they can still work together to solve the world's compounding crises. 'The U.N. and so many of those meetings, they are critical, but they are happening behind closed doors. And they’re very future looking, future facing and commitment based,' said Gabe Kleinman, a partner at Emerson Collective, which is billionaire Laurene Powell Jobs' philanthropy and investing organization. Kleinman said that in contrast to the U.N. events, the science fair was open to all and highlighted solutions for climate change that the organization thinks could be impactful right now. The fair is part of a crush of events every September that unfold on the sidelines of the official high-level meetings, where nonprofits, advocates and fundraisers mingle and lobby world leaders, billionaires and funders — and plan their next steps with each other. They gather in mostly elite spaces — in marble tiled rooms, under glass chandeliers, with snacks of fresh raspberries and glass bottles of sparkling water — to get their messages to the people with their hands on the levers of power. It’s a push and pull of influence games and negotiations with very high stakes. 'I’ve been doing this work for 40 years. I have never seen a world where we are faced with so many crises and not just so many crises, but also crises that are increasingly protracted,' said UNICEF deputy executive director of partnerships Kitty van der Heijden. The number of people who need humanitarian assistance has ballooned from 63 million in 2012 to 367 million, including 183 million children, as of March 2024, UNICEF said. Van der Heijden said she hopes the private sector and philanthropy will become even more involved in the multilateral system to meet the needs of children. Philanthropic money in particular can be more flexible, longer term and take on more risk than public funding, she said. But philanthropic dollars won't ever match the resources that governments can leverage. To that end, billionaire Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates called on nations to fully fund the vaccines alliance GAVI and invest in reducing malnutrition, especially among children at the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation's annual Goalkeepers event that tracks progress toward global development goals. In a ceremony on Monday that featured Grammy-winning musician Jon Batiste performing in a gold sequin suit, the foundation honored Brazilian president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, for his work during his first term lifting millions out of poverty and significantly reducing malnutrition among children. 'I think it’s commendable that executives like you create a foundation.' said da Silva, addressing Gates while on stage. 'But what will effectively solve the problem of extreme poverty is not through a foundation’s donation, which is important, but through public policies.' To follow the political commitments made by nation states, organizations like the antipoverty nonprofit Oxfam brought in technical experts to New York. They tracked changes word by word over multiple drafts of a pact that countries agreed on coming into a special two day gathering, the 'Summit of the Future,' where they recommitted to the Sustainable Development Goals, including gender equality, that were set back in 2015. Rebecca Shadwick, a policy and advocacy lead for Oxfam International, said one change that civil society groups advocated to get into the final draft was a commitment to 'achieve' gender equality rather than to 'accelerate the achievement of gender equality.' While civil society groups have no formal role in the negotiations, they see themselves as partners in the development of the goals. Practically, nonprofits play a major role in actually realizing these promises, which are significantly off track. Funders who prioritize efforts to combat gender-based violence gathered at the Free Future 2024 conference last week, hosted by the Ford Foundation, whose headquarters around the corner from the U.N. are built around a large indoor garden. They described constant and urgent demands for support from feminist organizations around the world. Abigail Erikson, chief of the UN Trust Fund, said her organization received $1.5 billion in requests for funding this year, while having only $13.5 million to grant out. Her fund is dedicated to addressing violence against women and girls. 'It’s overwhelming,' Erikson said, though she thinks of the potential if that demand was funded. 'Imagine if we had the money flows for that, the same way that the money is flowing to the anti-rights movement.' Elsewhere around town, money did flow. Under a soaring arched ceiling held up by stone pillars, the UN’s sexual and reproductive health agency convened ministers to announce $350 million in new funding for family planning and health services. As a part of that pledge, the British hedge fund billionaire Sir Chris Hohn announced a $100 million commitment through the Children’s Investment Fund Foundation, of which he is founder and chair. The funds will help expand access to contraception and health services in the Sahel and Democratic Republic of Congo. Describing contraception and support for women to make their own choices about when and if to have children as a 'best buy' in development, Hohn said it was 'stupidity' and a lack of empathy keeping governments from fully funding the work of the UN's sexual and reproductive health agency. Those sentiments — among the panel discussions, keynotes and one-on-one meetings, which start early and extend late — are what civil society groups want world leaders to hear, not just for the future of their groups, but also the people they serve all over the world. ___ Associated Press writer Eléonore Hughes contributed from Rio de Janeiro. ___ Associated Press coverage of philanthropy and nonprofits receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

Isaac strengthens into a hurricane in the Atlantic Ocean and could cause dangerous waves	MIAMI (AP) — Isaac strengthened Friday into a hurricane in the open waters of the Atlantic Ocean and could cause dangerous waves in parts of Bermuda, forecasters said. The storm was about about 980 miles (1,577 kilometers) east-northeast of Bermuda and about 1,175 miles (1,890 km) west of the Azores, with maximum sustained winds of 75 mph (121 kph). It was heading east at 12 mph (19 kph). There were no coastal watches or warnings in effect, but the waves could cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions in Bermuda, the Miami-based U.S. National Hurricane Center said. Potentially dangerous waves also could spread to the Azores, the center said. Isaac is expected to strengthen before gradually weakening by the end of the weekend. The storm has been churning in the ocean as Hurricane Helene made landfall in northwestern Florida as a Category 4 storm before weaking early Friday, leaving behind flooding, damage and power outages.	https://apnews.com/article/hurricane-isaac-bermuda-azores-waves-9a27e897969ae1e79fba52a740ba4538	2024-09-27T03:17:24-07:00	
Prince Harry’s Sentebale organization leading initiative to support young people in Southern Africa	NEW YORK (AP) — Prince Harry’s latest philanthropic move will gather world business leaders and philanthropists to work towards fostering prosperity in Southern African communities, specifically focused on young people. In early October, Harry’s charity organization Sentebale, which he co-founded with Prince Seeiso of Lesotho in 2006, will bring together leaders from Google’s charitable arm and several other companies and organizations for a series of meetings and discussions in Lesotho and Johannesburg. The gathering will be Harry’s first time visiting Southern Africa since 2019. He’s long been devoted to philanthropy work in the region in honor of his late mother, Princess Diana. The Duke of Sussex and the leaders will partner with local organizations and companies that are already actively brainstorming solutions to the roadblocks in place for young people in the region to succeed. Harry said in a news release that the organization has developed a 'profound understanding of local youth – their passions, their concerns, and their extraordinary creativity' through their extensive work in the area and their longstanding relationships with local communities. 'These young adults are eager and capable of driving meaningful change, yet significant barriers still stand in their way,' his statement continued, noting Sentebale is nearing its 20th anniversary. While the organization was initially established to help children and young people in Lesotho and Botswana affected by HIV/AIDS, it now works to establish solutions to broader problems impacting youth in the region, like health issues, wealth inequity, and climate. The organization’s name means ‘forget-me-not’ in the Sesotho language, and the princes established the charity in memory of their late mothers. The session, which will reunite the group after they previously convened in Miami for a session in April, will also feature a panel discussion in addition to the private work sessions, and they will complete a site visit to the 'mountain kingdom' of Lesotho. 'Over 50% of these young people are at risk of remaining economically vulnerable without urgent investment in digital skills, education, and job creation,' said Sentebale Board Chair, Sophie Chandauka in a release. 'The Duke’s return to Southern Africa, alongside our new American friends, marks a milestone as we collaborate with world-class organizations and local leadership to engage this critical youth cohort.' The announcement of the new initiative comes after the Duke of Sussex appeared at several humanitarian and philanthropic events that ran alongside the United Nations General Assembly Week.	https://apnews.com/article/prince-harry-philanthropy-charity-organization-9d6a513ed58befb1693f4df09d93c9d7	2024-09-27T03:00:57-07:00	
Myanmar's opposition rejects a military appeal for talks on a political solution to armed conflict	BANGKOK (AP) — The main group coordinating opposition to military rule in Myanmar rejected on Friday a surprise offer from the ruling generals to hold talks on a political solution to the country’s nationwide armed conflict. Nay Phone Latt, a spokesperson for the opposition’s shadow National Unity Government, told The Associated Press that a joint statement issued earlier this year by opposition groups has already paved the way for a negotiated political solution if the army agrees to its conditions. Padoh Saw Kalae Say, a spokesperson of the Karen National Union, which represents the Karen ethnic minority, said it also will not accept the military’s offer. The KNU has been fighting on and off for greater autonomy since Myanmar, then called Burma, won independence from Britain in 1948. 'What we see is that their inviting offers are the ideas from more than 70 years ago. We won’t accept and discuss it, and looking back at the statements we have repeatedly expressed, I would like to say that there is no need to think about this,' Padoh Saw Kalae Say told the AP. The military’s brief 'Offer to resolve political issues in political means,' dated Thursday and published Friday in the Global New Light of Myanmar and other state-run newspapers, was its most direct offer of peace talks since it seized power from the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi in February 2021. It said its opponents are invited 'to contact the State to resolve the political issues through party politics or electoral processes in order to be able to join hands with the people to emphasize durable peace and development by discarding the armed terrorist way.' The offer came five days before the military government launches a national census to compile voter lists for a general election expected next year. An election is seen as a way for the military to legitimize its rule, though it would be difficult to organize while the country is at war, and critics see no way for the polls to be free and fair. The ruling military originally announced that elections would be held in August 2023, but has repeatedly pushed back the date. The military's offer, which defended its 2021 takeover and blamed the country’s subsequent turmoil on its opponents, came after the army over the past year has suffered unprecedented battlefield defeats from powerful ethnic militias, especially in the northeast along the border with China and in the western state of Rakhine. The army is currently on the defensive against ethnic militias in much of the country that are seeking autonomy, as well as hundreds of armed guerrilla groups collectively called People’s Defense Forces, formed to fight to restore democracy after the army takeover. The opposition’s political road map earlier this year offering talks was signed by the National Unity Government and three major ethnic armed organizations — the Chin National Front, the Karenni National Progressive Party and the Karen National Union, all of which are engaged in active combat against the military government. That statement’s objectives include terminating the military’s involvement in politics, placing all armed forces under the command of an elected civilian government, promulgating a new constitution embodying federalism and democratic values, establishing a new federal democratic union and instituting a system of transitional justice. It calls for a dialogue with the military’s leadership, but only after it shows its unconditional acceptance of the plan for the termination of military rule and a peaceful transition of power. It is not clear whether the military's new offer was meant to include all opposition groups, several of which it has officially classified as terrorists and therefore illegal. While addressing thousands of military personnel at a military parade on Armed Forces Day in March 2022, Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, the head of the ruling military council, said he would not negotiate with 'terrorist groups and their supporters for killing innocent people' and threatening peace and security. He said the military — known as the Tatmadaw — 'will annihilate them to (the) end.'	https://apnews.com/article/myanmar-military-political-talks-proposal-opposition-e42372700fbc4bc7b7cdf2917a10e81b	2024-09-27T02:55:15-07:00	
49 saplings from famous UK tree that was illegally chopped down will be shared to mark anniversary	LONDON (AP) — It's been a year since a sycamore tree that stood high and proud near the Roman landmark of Hadrian’s Wall in the north of England was inexplicably chopped down, triggering a wave of shock and disbelief across the U.K., even among those who had never seen it up close. Known and loved by millions, the 150-year-old tree was made famous around the world when it featured in Kevin Costner’s 1991 film 'Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves.' The Sycamore Gap tree, as it was known because of its regal canopy framed between two hills, was a popular subject for landscape photographers and a great resting spot for walkers. Now it is going to get a new lease of life — dozens of them. The National Trust, a conservation charity that seeks to protect and open up historic places and green spaces to the general public, launched an initiative on Friday in which 49 saplings from the tree will be given to communities around the U.K. Other saplings will be sent to the U.K.'s 15 national parks and the local primary school. The initiative, which also involves the local Northumberland National Park Authority and Historic England, the public organization that looks after England’s historic environment, is called 'Trees of Hope' and aims to 'create a new chapter in the life of this legendary tree.' Each of the 49 saplings — one to represent each foot of the tree's height when it was felled — is expected to be 6 feet (1.8 meters) tall on delivery. People from around the U.K. are invited to apply for a tree to plant in publicly accessible spaces which have emotional connections with people and communities. Entries must be made by Oct. 25, with winners announced on Nov. 18. 'The last 12 months have been a real rollercoaster of emotions, from the hopelessness and grief we felt when we discovered that the tree had been illegally felled, to experiencing the stories shared with us about just what the tree meant to so many,' said Andrew Poad, general manager for the National Trust’s Hadrian’s Wall properties. Also on Friday, the Northumberland National Park Authority is marking the anniversary of the felling with the opening of the first phase of an exhibition, 'Sycamore Gap: One Year On,' including the largest remaining section of the tree. Two men — Daniel Graham and Adam Carruthers — have been charged with two counts over the felling of the tree. One count is for allegedly cutting down the tree and the second is for damage to the adjacent wall built by Emperor Hadrian in A.D. 122 to protect the northwest frontier of the Roman Empire. Prosecutors have calculated that the cost of the felling was around 620,000 pounds ($825,000). Both have been released on bail ahead of their trial scheduled for early December.	https://apnews.com/article/sycamore-gap-tree-hadrians-wall-britain-vandalism-f01a506ce053bb746156e2492911d446	2024-09-27T02:20:34-07:00	
Japan's soon-to-be prime minister faces big challenge as he tries to move past ruling party scandals	TOKYO (AP) — The person chosen Friday to lead Japan's governing party, and become prime minister next week, is a veteran politician with deep policy experience, a taste for curry and anime — and big challenges ahead of him as he tries to unite a fractious party and hold off an opposition eager to capitalize on recent corruption scandals. Shigeru Ishiba has long been popular with voters but has often struggled to win over his conservative fellow Liberal Democratic Party lawmakers. A vocal critic of the hawkish politics of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, he was long seen as a troublesome outsider by some party members. That makes Friday's victory a huge comeback for Ishiba. It could also signal a break from years of Abe's influence over the party, even after the former prime minister's assassination. Some analysts believe that Ishiba was chosen as much for his image as a centrist who can counter challenges by the more liberal main opposition party as for his policy views. The 67-year-old former banker was running in the party leadership race for a fifth time and had said this was going to be his 'final battle.' Ishiba was first elected to parliament in 1986, after being influenced by the late Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka, who was popular with the public. He has served as defense minister, agriculture minister and in other key Cabinet posts, and as the LDP secretary general under Abe. His party will now look for him to use his experience, stability and expertise to beat back the main opposition Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan, which recently chose as its new leader former Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda, a veteran known for his inspiring speeches. University of Tokyo politics professor Yu Uchiyama said political parties tend to make centrist shifts to win elections, and Ishiba could do well in an upcoming parliamentary face-off with the opposition leader. Considered a defense policy expert, Ishiba has proposed an Asian version of the NATO military alliance and a more equal and mutual Japan-U.S. security alliance, including having Japanese Self Defense Force bases in the United States. Ishiba is a supporter of Taiwan’ s democracy. He calls for the establishment of a disaster management agency in one of the world’s most disaster-prone countries. Ishiba has vowed to push for more diversity and gender equality. He supports a revision to a 19th century civil code that requires married couples to choose one of their surnames. That has caused most women to adopt their husband’s surname. Moves to change the code have stalled for decades because of LDP opposition. At a recent speech in Tokyo, Ishiba said Japanese women are among the shortest sleepers in the world because of their heavy responsibilities both at work and home. He said most husbands, including himself, hardly help with childrearing and homemaking. Ishiba also supports legalizing same-sex marriage. Ishiba is known as a policy 'otaku,' or nerd, especially in security and defense issues. He likes anime, building model warships and listening to 1970s and '80s Japanese pop songs. He says his favorite food is curried rice.	https://apnews.com/article/japan-ishiba-governing-party-leader-prime-minister-f99834b652921f707471e0be845a6d94	2024-09-27T00:36:32-07:00	
Bangladesh's Shakib is retiring from test cricket but he's not sure in which match	KANPUR, India (AP) — Bangladesh cricket great Shakib Al Hasan wants his last test match to be in his Dhaka hometown next month. He's not sure it will be, though, because he's worried about his safety. Shakib, who has played for Bangladesh for 19 years, told the selectors and the national cricket board (BCB) this week of his pending test retirement, and his immediate retirement from Twenty20s. He wants to continue in one-day internationals until the Champions Trophy in February in Pakistan. The hitch is him getting a security clearance from his government if he returns home. He's in India, playing the ongoing second test against the host in Kanpur. Shakib was a Member of Parliament under the Awami League-led government until the party was ousted from power in August in the face of nationwide protests. Following the government's fall, many Awami League politicians went into hiding, were arrested, and banned from leaving the country. Shakib, who reportedly hasn't been in Bangladesh since before the protests, was accused in a murder case related to the protests by the Adabor police station. The BCB has allowed him to continue playing for the national team until proven guilty. South Africa plans to play two tests in Bangladesh next month, subject to a security clearance, and Shakib wants the first match in Dhaka to be his 72nd and last test. But his desire for a security guarantee from the BCB can't be fulfilled, board president Faruque Ahmed said this week. 'Shakib's security is not in the board's hand,' Faruque told ESPN. 'The board can't provide an individual with personal security. He has to take a decision on that. His security has to come from the highest level of the government.' Shakib said if he can't get security guarantees for his safety, and receive permission to leave the country, then this week's test against India in Kanpur would be his last. 'I am a citizen of Bangladesh, so I shouldn't have any problem going back to Bangladesh. My concern is my safety and security in Bangladesh,' he said. 'My close friends and family members are concerned. I hope things are getting better. There should be a solution to it. 'I am available for the South Africa series but since there's a lot happening back home, everything doesn't depend on me. I have discussed my plans (with the BCB). If there’s a chance, and if I could play, my last test will be in Mirpur (Dhaka). The board is trying to ensure that I can play and feel safe, but at the same time, I should be able to leave the country without a hitch. 'It has been tough for me, while I am focused on the game. There is a case against me. I will be glad to see evidence of it, if it was done properly. Everyone has rights — people know where I was and what I was doing at the time. False allegations are not really giving our country a great outlook. It is not very appropriate.' The 37-year-old Shakib has been a tremendous all-rounder for Bangladesh across 71 tests, 247 ODIs and 129 T20s. He was ranked the world’s best allrounder for long periods. 'It is the right time to move on and create a place for new players,' he said. 'I have played my last T20 in the World Cup (this year). I won’t be playing in the upcoming series against India and the West Indies. 'If I do well in the franchise leagues in the next months, BCB can call me up if they feel I can contribute to the T20 side (for the 2026 World Cup in India and Sri Lanka). Basically, I can see the end of my career in these two formats. I am happy and don’t have any regrets in life. I have enjoyed my cricket career and it is the right time for me as well as Bangladesh cricket.' ___ AP cricket: https://apnews.com/hub/cricket	https://apnews.com/article/shakib-bangladesh-cricket-retire-8b730b6bc7bc098f7105a214b4c953c8	2024-09-27T00:23:07-07:00	
Belgian PM blasts Pope Francis for Catholic Church's sex abuse cover-up legacy in blistering welcome	BRUSSELS (AP) — Belgium’s prime minister blasted Pope Francis for the Catholic Church’s horrific legacy of clerical sex abuse and cover-ups, demanding 'concrete steps' to come clean with the past and put victims’ interests ahead those of the institution in a blistering welcome at the start of Francis’ visit on Friday. The speech by Prime Minister Alexander De Croo was one of the most pointed ever directed at the pope during a foreign trip, where the genteel dictates of diplomatic protocol usually keeps outrage out of the public speeches. But even King Philippe had strong words for Francis, demanding the church work 'incessantly' to atone for the crimes and help victims heal. Their tone underscored just how raw the abuse scandal still is in Belgium, where two decades of revelations of abuse and systematic cover-ups have devastated the hierarchy’s credibility and contributed to an overall decline in Catholicism and the influence of the once-powerful Catholic Church. Francis applauded at the end of De Croo’s speech, and was expected to meet with victims in private later Friday. 'Today, words alone do not suffice. We also need concrete steps,' De Croo said. 'Victims need to be heard. They need to be at the center. They have a right to truth. Misdeeds need to be recognized,' he said in front of an audience of royals, church officials, diplomats and politicians at Laeken Castle, the residence of Belgium’s royal family. 'When something goes wrong we cannot accept cover-ups,' he said. 'To be able to look into the future, the church needs to come clean on its past.' Revelations of Belgium’s horrific abuse scandal have dribbled out in bits over a quarter century, punctuated by a bombshell in 2010, when the country’s longest-serving bishop, Bruges Bishop Roger Vangheluwe, was allowed to resign without punishment after admitting he had sexually abused his nephew for 13 years. Francis only defrocked Vangheluwe earlier this year, in a move clearly designed to remove a lingering source of outrage among Belgians before his visit. Outrage about church sex abuse was reignited last year, when a four-episode Flemish documentary showed Belgian victims telling their stories on camera. 'Godvergeten' (Godforsaken) aired on public broadcaster VRT in the weeks surrounding a royal visit to the Vatican during which Francis was invited to Belgium. For the first time, Flemish viewers at home saw victims explain the scope of the scandal in their community, the depravity of the crimes, and the systematic cover-up by the Catholic hierarchy. Amid the public outrage that ensued, both a Flanders parliamentary committee and Belgium’s federal parliament opened official inquests and heard months of testimony from victims, experts and the Catholic hierarchy. Their testimonies cast new attention on a scandal that had already been blamed for a steep decline in the Catholic Church over a generation in Belgium, where church authorities have stopped publishing weekly Mass attendance figures as the monthly rate sits in the single digits. The pope also referred to abuse in his remarks, insisting that the church was 'addressing firmly and decisively' the problem by implementing prevention programs, listening to victims and accompanying them to heal. But after the astonishing dressing down by the prime minister and king, Francis went off-script to express the shame of the church for the scandal and voice his commitment to ending it. 'The church must be ashamed and ask forgiveness and try to resovlve this problem, and put all the possibilities in place so that this doesn’t happen again,' Francis said. 'For even one (victim), we must ask forgiveness.' Victims, however, have demanded the church do far more, including implementing robust reparations programs to compensate them for their trauma and pay for the lifelong therapy many need. Some penned a letter demanding such a reparations program, which they planned to deliver to Francis in their private meeting. ___ Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

Israel-Hamas war latest: With nearly 700 killed in a week, Lebanon fears Gaza-level violence	Nearly 700 people have been killed in Lebanon this week, according to Lebanon’s health ministry. Israel has dramatically escalated strikes, saying it is targeting Hezbollah’s military capacities and senior Hezbollah commanders. Top Israeli officials have threatened to repeat the destruction of Gaza in Lebanon if the Hezbollah fire continues, raising fears that Israel’s actions in Gaza since Oct. 7 would be repeated in Lebanon. The International Organization for Migration estimated Thursday that more than 200,000 people have been displaced in Lebanon since Hezbollah began firing rockets into northern Israel in support of Hamas after it stormed into Israel, sparking the Israel-Hamas war. Lebanon says a total of 1,540 people have been killed within its borders in that time. The United States, France and other allies jointly called for a 21-day cease-fire. Lebanon's foreign minister said the country welcomed the cease-fire efforts, and decried Israel’s 'systematic destruction of Lebanese border villages.' Israeli military vehicles were seen transporting tanks and armored vehicles toward the country’s northern border with Lebanon, and commanders have issued a call-up of reservists. Netanyahu says Israel is striking Hezbollah 'with full force' and won’t stop until its goals are achieved. ___ Here’s the latest: Houthi rebels claim missile attack targeting Israel DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Yemen’s Houthi rebels have claimed a missile attack that targeted Israel early Friday morning. Brig. Gen. Yahya Saree, a Houthi military spokesman, claimed the attack in a pre-recorded statement released by the Houthis. He claimed the rebels launched both a missile and drone. The missile targeted Tel Aviv while the drone targeted another city, though Israel did not acknowledge the drone. No injuries were reported. Israel’s military said earlier Friday it used an Arrow interceptor missile to down the Houthi missile, which saw some shrapnel fall. It’s the second attack by the Houthis to target Tel Aviv in recent weeks. Friday’s launch comes amid Israel’s intensified airstrike campaign targeting Lebanon’s Hezbollah militia. Both Hezbollah and the Houthis are backed by Iran. UN: More than 30,000 people crossed from Lebanon into Syria in 3 days GENEVA — The U.N. refugee agency says 'well over 30,000' people have crossed from Lebanon into neighboring Syria over the last 72 hours in the wake of fighting between the militant group Hezbollah and Israeli forces in Lebanon. Gonzalo Vargas Llosa, the representative for refugee agency UNHCR in Syria, said roughly half of the people who have fled were children and adolescents. He said about 80% were Syrians returning to their home country and the rest were Lebanese. 'Now these, of course, are people who are fleeing bombs and who are crossing into a country that has been suffering from its own crisis and violence for 13 years now,' he told reporters in Geneva by video from the Lebanon-Syria border. Syria is facing 'economic collapse,' he said. 'I think that this just illustrates the kind of extremely difficult choices both Syrians and Lebanese are having to make,' he said. Israeli strike kills a family of 9 in a Lebanese border town, authorities say BEIRUT — An Israeli airstrike on a border village has killed nine members of the same family, Lebanon’s state-run National News Agency said Friday. NNA said nine people were killed in the early Friday airstrike on the village of Chebaa that destroyed their three-story building. Chebaa is in an area where the borders of Syria, Israel and Lebanon meet, and was struck several times in recent months. On Friday, Israeli warplanes struck towns and villages in southern Lebanon and the eastern Bekaa Valley, according to NNA. Israeli military reports more strikes from Lebanon JERUSALEM — Incoming fire from Lebanon into Israel continued Friday, with one man suffering wounds from shrapnel. The Israeli military said four drones came across the border Friday, all of which were intercepted. Earlier Friday, the Israeli military said another 10 projectiles came into Israel from Lebanon, with some intercepted and others falling into open fields. It said it later targeted launchers in Lebanon behind the missile attacks. Hezbollah claimed it had targeted the Israeli city of Tiberias with missiles. The Israeli military said its warplanes had struck launchers in Haddatha, Lebanon, that it said fired the rockets at Tiberius in northern Israel. Israeli strike in Syria kills 5 soldiers DAMASCUS — An overnight Israeli airstrike on a military site in the area of Kfar Yabous in Syria near the border with Lebanon killed five Syrian army soldiers and injured another, Syrian state news agency SANA reported Friday, citing an unidentified military official. Israel's military did not immediately acknowledge the strike. Israel regularly targets military sites in Syria and facilities linked to Iran and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah but rarely acknowledges them. Those strikes have become more frequent as Hezbollah has exchanged fire with Israeli forces for the past 11 months against the backdrop of Israel’s war against Hamas — a Hezbollah ally — in Gaza. Tens of thousands of Lebanese and Syrians have fled across the border from Lebanon into Syria since the beginning of the week under intense Israeli bombardment that Israel says is targeting Hezbollah militants and weapons. The week's strikes have killed an estimated 700 people, including at least 150 women and children. Trade unions file claim at United Nations for Palestinian workers GENEVA — A group of international trade unions on Friday filed a complaint against Israel at the United Nations labor organization in a bid to win compensation for 200,000 Palestinians who have gone unpaid or seen their benefits withheld after the Oct. 7 attacks. The nine unions say the workers from both Gaza and the West Bank had been employed in Israel before the deadly attacks by armed militants, but were barred from entering to go to their jobs afterward. As a result, the workers and their families have faced millions of dollars’ worth of lost income, financial insecurity and no access to remedies through the courts, they said. 'These workers have experienced widespread wage theft due to the suspension of work permits and the unilateral termination of their contracts,' said a joint statement from the unions, whose members are active in industries as diverse as construction, education, journalism, agriculture, hospitality and transportation. The filing at the International Labor Organization in Geneva, of which Israel is a member country, is based on language in its constitution that seeks to ensure that countries uphold international commitments they have already made. Such economic woes that many Palestinians have faced come on top of the bloodshed, displacement and other troubles faced by Gaza and the West Bank as Israel continues its campaign against armed Palestinian militants. The Philippines is preparing to evacuate thousands of its citizens from Lebanon MANILA, Philippines — The Philippine government is bracing to evacuate thousands of Filipino workers in Lebanon in case the deadly conflict between Israel and the Hezbollah militant group further escalates, Philippine officials said Friday. More than 11,000 Filipinos live and work in Lebanon, often as house cleaners. Philippine officials have not yet ordered a mandatory evacuation of its citizens because it was not yet clear whether a full-scale war would erupt, including an Israeli ground attack. Many Filipinos were adamant not to leave their jobs in Lebanon and return to uncertainties at home, but they have been told to be ready to evacuate any time, Foreign Undersecretary Eduardo De Vega told a news briefing in Manila. They say 'it’s better for them to die in war than to die of hunger,' De Vega said. But he added without elaborating that the Philippine government prepared a contingency plan for a massive evacuation if widespread ground fighting erupts across Lebanon. Philippine Ambassador to Lebanon Raymond Balatbat told reporters in Manila via video on Friday that many Filipinos there 'will only decide to leave when the situation is so bad, when the war is at their doorsteps.'	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hezbollah-hamas-latest-mideast-27-september-2024-4dc3676b10be0fe7b41ab6d9cd897014	2024-09-26T22:28:12-07:00

As the Ukraine war enters a critical period, the EU moves ahead without the US	BRUSSELS (AP) — As the war in Ukraine enters a critical period, the European Union has decided that it must take responsibility for what it sees as an existential threat to security in its own neighborhood and is preparing to tackle some of the financial burden, perhaps even without the United States. EU envoys have been working in Brussels this week on a proposal to provide Ukraine with a hefty loan package worth up to 35 billion euros ($39 billion). It was announced by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen during a trip to Kyiv last Friday. 'Crucially, this loan will flow straight into your national budget,' she told President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. 'It will provide you with significant and much-needed fiscal space. You will decide how best to use the funds, giving you maximum flexibility to meet your needs.' Zelenskyy wants to buy weapons and bomb shelters and rebuild Ukraine's shattered energy network as winter draws near. In international matters, particularly involving major conflicts, the EU rarely moves ahead without the U.S., but it hopes this decision will encourage others to come forward. Russian troops and an election close in Almost 1,000 days since their full-scale invasion, Russian forces are making advances in the east. Ukraine’s army has a shaky hold on part of the Kursk region in Russia, which has provided a temporary morale boost, but as casualties mount it remains outmanned and outgunned. On the political front, Zelenskyy hopes to secure support for a 'victory plan' that might force Russian President Vladimir Putin to the negotiating table. He’s trying to persuade U.S. President Joe Biden and other allies to help strengthen Ukraine’s hand in any future talks. But a U.S. election looms, and polls suggest that Donald Trump might return to the White House in January. Trump has been critical of U.S. aid to Ukraine. On Wednesday, he said Zelenskyy should have made concessions to Putin before the invasion began in February 2022. Most of the 27-nation EU fears that a Putin victory would lead to deep uncertainty. Russia’s armed forces are depleted and currently incapable of another war, but the prospect of a future land grab in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania or Poland remains. Reworking a G7 loan plan The EU loans are part of a plan by the Group of Seven major industrialized nations to take advantage of interest earned on about $250 billion worth of frozen Russian assets, most of them held in Europe. These windfall profits are estimated at around 4.5 billion to 5.5 billion euros ($5 billion to $6 billion) a year. The profits underpin the G7 plan. The EU would stump up $20 billion, the U.S. $20 billion, and Canada, Japan and the U.K. $10 billion together, for a combined total of $50 billion. The scheme expires at the end of the year, before the next U.S. president takes office. Now, amid differences over how long the Russian asset freeze should be guaranteed, the EU has decided to go it alone. Its offer of up to $39 billion in loans accounts for almost the entirety of the U.S. share as well. The U.S. wants to ensure that the assets are locked away for at least three years to guarantee the income. But EU member Hungary insists this should only happen in 6-month increments. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán styles himself as a peacemaker and is too close to Putin for many of his partners' comfort. The other 26 EU countries feel they must move now because time is running out. An evolving alliance with the United States The U.S. election is just weeks away. The Europeans are wary of Trump’s unpredictability and are testing scenarios to help protect themselves from the kind of battering, like tariff hikes, their economies received during his past presidency. But they also see the Democrats as more inward looking these days. Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act left European leaders fuming over rules that favored American products. China and war in the Middle East are the foreign policy priorities of Democrat or Republican candidates alike, and for now the U.S. is in the grip of election campaign fever. The EU hopes that Vice President Kamala Harris, if she is elected president, would enter the loan program as previously planned and reduce the EU's financial burden. But that remains an open question for now, and EU members say Ukraine’s position is too precarious to hesitate. Political delays in the U.S. Congress last year over a $60 billion support package starved Ukrainian troops of weapons and ammunition for months, resulting in 'real consequences on the battlefield,' in the words of NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg. Pressing ahead on pressing needs Helping Ukraine in military terms is a challenge for the Europeans. They could not do it alone, and cannot match the U.S. transport, logistics and equipment superiority, despite progress in ramping up their defense industries to supply arms and ammunition. But the world’s biggest trading bloc does wield economic might. It has already given Ukraine about $132 billion since the full-scale invasion started. Within weeks it appears ready to provide tens of billions more, even though going it alone is not in the EU's DNA. 'I do not know what the Americans, the United States with the new presidency, will do or not,' EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said on Tuesday. But, he said, 'as long as the Ukrainians want to resist, we have to support them. Otherwise, we will make a historical mistake.' The Biden administration did announce Wednesday that the U.S. will send Ukraine a major military aid package, including cluster bombs and an array of rockets, artillery and armored vehicles. A U.S. official also said billions of dollars more in assistance would arrive over the coming months. Meanwhile, deliberations on the EU's share of the G7 loan package will be high on the agenda of a summit of the bloc's leaders in Brussels on Oct. 17-18. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine	https://apnews.com/article/eu-ukraine-us-russia-loans-aid-d9ed4389497b4f88647d488fdd7531e2	2024-09-26T21:20:48-07:00	
Helene makes landfall in northwestern Florida as a Category 4 hurricane	CRAWFORDVILLE, Fla. (AP) — Hurricane Helene made landfall in northwestern Florida as a Category 4 storm as forecasters warned that the enormous system could create a 'nightmare' storm surge and bring dangerous winds and rain across much of the southeastern U.S. There were at least three storm-related deaths. The National Hurricane Center in Miami said Helene roared ashore around 11:10 p.m. Thursday near the mouth of the Aucilla River in the Big Bend area of Florida’s Gulf Coast. It had maximum sustained winds estimated at 140 mph (225 kph). That location was only about 20 miles (32 kilometers) northwest of where Hurricane Idalia came ashore last year at nearly the same ferocity and caused widespread damage. Helene prompted hurricane and flash flood warnings extending far beyond the coast up into northern Georgia and western North Carolina. More than 1.2 million homes and businesses were without power in Florida, more than 190,000 in Georgia and more than 30,000 in the Carolinas, according to the tracking site poweroutage.us. The governors of those states and Alabama and Virginia all declared emergencies. One person was killed in Florida when a sign fell on their car and two people were reported killed in a possible tornado in south Georgia as the storm approached. 'When Floridians wake up tomorrow morning, we’re going to be waking up to a state where very likely there’s been additional loss of life and certainly there’s going to be loss of property,' Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said at a news conference Thursday night. Helene was moving rapidly inland after making landfall, with the center of the storm set to race from southern to northern Georgia through early Friday morning. The risk of tornadoes also would continue overnight and into the morning across north and central Florida, Georgia, South Carolina and southern North Carolina, forecasters said. Later Friday, there would be the risk of tornadoes in Virginia. 'Helene continues to produce catastrophic winds that are now pushing into southern Georgia,' the hurricane center said in an update at 1 a.m. Friday. 'Persons should not leave their shelters and remain in place through the passage of these life-threatening conditions.' Even before landfall, the storm's wrath was felt widely, with sustained tropical storm-force winds and hurricane-force gusts along Florida's west coast. Water lapped over a road in Siesta Key near Sarasota and covered some intersections in St. Pete Beach. Lumber and other debris from a fire in Cedar Key a week ago crashed ashore in the rising water. Beyond Florida, up to 10 inches (25 centimeters) of rain had fallen in the North Carolina mountains, with up to 14 inches (36 centimeters) more possible before the deluge ends, setting the stage for flooding that forecasters warned could be worse than anything seen in the past century. Heavy rains began falling and winds were picking up earlier Thursday in Valdosta, Georgia, near the Florida state line. The weather service said more than a dozen Georgia counties could see hurricane-force winds exceeding 110 mph (177 kph). In south Georgia, two people were killed when a possible tornado struck a mobile home on Thursday night, Wheeler County Sheriff Randy Rigdon told WMAZ-TV. Wheeler County is about 70 miles (113 kilometers) southeast of Macon. The storm made landfall in the sparsely-populated Big Bend area, home to fishing villages and vacation hideaways where Florida’s Panhandle and peninsula meet. 'Please write your name, birthday, and important information on your arm or leg in a PERMANENT MARKER so that you can be identified and family notified,' the sheriff's office in mostly rural Taylor County warned those who chose not to evacuate in a Facebook post, the dire advice similar to what other officials have dolled out during past hurricanes. Still, Philip Tooke, a commercial fisherman who took over the business his father founded near the region’s Apalachee Bay, planned to ride out this storm like he did during Hurricane Michael and the others — on his boat. 'If I lose that, I don’t have anything,' Tooke said. Michael, a Category 5 storm, all but destroyed one town, fractured thousands of homes and businesses and caused some $25 billion in damage when it struck the Florida Panhandle in 2018. Many, though, were heeding the mandatory evacuation orders that stretched from the Panhandle south along the Gulf Coast in low-lying areas around Tallahassee, Gainesville, Cedar Key, Lake City, Tampa and Sarasota. Among them were Cindy Waymon and her husband, who went to a shelter in Tallahassee after securing their home and packing medications, snacks and drinks. They wanted to stay safe given the magnitude of the storm, she said. 'This is the first time we’ve actually come to a shelter, because of the complexities of the storm and the uncertainties,' she said. Federal authorities staged search-and-rescue teams as the weather service forecast storm surges of up to 20 feet (6 meters) and warned they could be particularly 'catastrophic and unsurvivable' in Apalachee Bay. 'Please, please, please take any evacuation orders seriously!' the office said, describing the surge scenario as 'a nightmare.' This stretch of Florida known as the Forgotten Coast has been largely spared by the widespread condo development and commercialization that dominates so many of Florida’s beach communities. The region is loved for its natural wonders — the vast stretches of salt marshes, tidal pools and barrier islands. 'You live down here, you run the risk of losing everything to a bad storm,' said Anthony Godwin, who lives about a half-mile (800 meters) from the water in the coastal town of Panacea, as he stopped for gas before heading west toward his sister’s house in Pensacola. School districts and multiple universities canceled classes. Airports in Tampa, Tallahassee and Clearwater were closed Thursday, while cancellations were widespread elsewhere in Florida and beyond. While Helene will likely weaken as it moves inland, damaging winds and heavy rain were expected to extend to the southern Appalachian Mountains, where landslides were possible, forecasters said. Tennessee was among the states expected to get drenched. Helene had swamped parts of Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula on Wednesday, flooding streets and toppling trees as it passed offshore and brushed the resort city of Cancun. In western Cuba, Helene knocked out power to more than 200,000 homes and businesses as it brushed past the island. Areas 100 miles (160 kilometers) north of the Georgia-Florida line expected hurricane conditions. The state opened its parks to evacuees and their pets, including horses. Overnight curfews were imposed in many cities and counties in south Georgia. 'This is one of the biggest storms we’ve ever had,' said Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp. For Atlanta, Helene could be the worst strike on a major Southern inland city in 35 years, said University of Georgia meteorology professor Marshall Shepherd. Helene is the eighth named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, which began June 1. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has predicted an above-average Atlantic hurricane season this year because of record-warm ocean temperatures. ___ Hollingsworth reported from Kansas City, Missouri.

Asian markets follow Wall Street higher on upbeat news from China, US	HONG KONG (AP) — Stocks in Asia advanced on Friday, led by gains in Hong Kong and other Chinese markets fueled by China's moves to rev up its economy. Japan’s Nikkei 225 index was up more than 1% as the ruling Liberal Democratic Party conducted a leadership election that will determine who is Japan’s next prime minister. The change in leadership is not expected to lead to any major policy shifts, given the similarities between the leading contenders. China’s central bank cut its reserve requirement for banks as of Friday as part of measures announced this week to help the property industry and support financial markets. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong advanced 3.7% to 20,659.03 and the Shanghai Composite index jumped 2.1% to 3,065.29. Meanwhile, the Shanghai Stock Exchange encountered glitches that hindered order processing and caused delays after the market opened on Friday. This led to a 6.4% increase in the Shenzhen index, as local media reported that investors flocked to that smaller market during the delay. Trading returned to normal by noon, and the Shanghai Stock Exchange later said in a statement that it was still investigating the causes. In the latest sign of the malaise hindering growth in the world's second-largest economy, the government reported that industrial profits fell nearly 18% year-on-year in August. Shares of Hong Kong’s property giant New World Development surged 21.5% on Friday trading after Adrian Cheng, the third-generation scion at the helm of the conglomerate, had been replaced. The firm reported an annual loss of over $2.4 billion in a profit warning last month, its first loss in nearly 20 years. In Japan, the Nikkei 225 index edged 1.4% higher to 39,451.25 after Tokyo’s consumer inflation, considered a leading indicator of nationwide trends, cooled to 2.2% year-on-year in September, in line with the market consensus. Elsewhere in Asia, Australia’s S&amp;P/ASX 200 added nearly 0.1% to 8,208.70. South Korea’s Kospi shed 0.2% to 2,666.01. On Thursday, the S&amp;P 500 added 0.4% to 5,745.37, setting an all-time high for the third time this week and the 42nd time this year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.6% to 42,175.11, while the Nasdaq composite rose 0.6% to 18,190.29. Micron Technology led the way with a jump of 14.7% after the maker of computer memory and storage products delivered stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. It benefited from sales related to artificial-intelligence technology, where a boom has helped drive some stocks to astounding heights. Jabil climbed 11.7% after the electronics manufacturer likewise reported stronger profit and revenue than expected. It also announced a plan to plow cash to its shareholders by buying back up to $1 billion of its stock. The biggest drop in the S&amp;P 500 hit Super Micro Computer, which gave back some of its huge gains after more than tripling last year amid the AI frenzy. Its stock tumbled 12.2% following a report from The Wall Street Journal saying the U.S. Department of Justice is probing the seller of servers and storage systems. The company declined to comment. A round of reports on Thursday suggested the world’s largest economy may be doing better than expected. Fewer U.S. workers applied for unemployment benefits last week in the latest signal that layoffs remain relatively low across the economy. A separate report said the overall U.S. economy grew at a 3% annual rate during the spring, as previously estimated. That’s a solid rate. The hope on Wall Street is for a form of financial nirvana where the U.S. economy’s growth holds steady, keeping corporate profits humming while the Federal Reserve continues to lower interest rates. The Fed last week made a drastic turn in how it sets interest rates. It’s now cutting them to make things easier for the U.S. economy after keeping rates high for years in hopes of extinguishing high inflation. Lower rates not only make it less expensive to borrow money to buy a house, a car or things on credit cards, they can also boost prices for all kinds of investments. In other dealings early Friday, benchmark U.S. crude oil lost 15 cents to $67.52 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, gave up 19 cents at $70.90 per barrel. The U.S. dollar rose to 145.24 Japanese yen from 144.80 yen. The euro was trading at $1.1170, down from $1.1176. ___ AP Business Writer Stan Choe contributed.	https://apnews.com/article/stock-markets-rates-china-japan-4df6b51767d77295182961585e8ca163	2024-09-26T20:14:01-07:00	
Dozens of children drown while bathing during 3-day Hindu festival in eastern India	PATNA, India (AP) — Dozens of children drowned while bathing in rivers and ponds in rituals that were part of a three-day Hindu festival in eastern India's Bihar state, officials said. Heavy monsoon rains recently had raised the levels of waterways across the state. At least 46 people, including 37 children, drowned in separate incidents across the state’s 15 districts, a statement from Bihar’s disaster management department said. Authorities have recovered 43 bodies so far, and the three missing people are presumed to be dead. During the annual festival, mothers fast for 24 hours for the well-being of their children. The women are sometimes accompanied by their children when they visit rivers and ponds for cleansing rituals. The festival concluded Thursday. The state government has announced a compensation of 400,000 rupees ($4,784) for the families of each of the dead. Deadly accidents like drownings and stampedes during religious festivals are common in India. In July, at least 121 people were killed after severe overcrowding and a lack of exits contributed to a stampede at a religious festival in northern India.	https://apnews.com/article/india-drowning-hindu-festival-688500d6d4f73276bb62a4beba8e10bd	2024-09-26T19:36:55-07:00	
Lebanon fears Gaza-like carnage as Israel ramps up airstrikes across the country	When she first heard about the evacuation warnings Israel was sending to residents of Lebanon, Aline Naser’s thoughts immediately turned to Gaza. For the past year, the 26-year-old Beirut resident has been following with horror the reports about besieged Palestinians in the Gaza Strip ordered to move from one place to the other, fleeing to 'humanitarian zones' only to be bombed and ordered to leave again. The Israeli calls for Lebanese citizens to evacuate ahead of a widening air campaign, delivered via mobile phone alerts, calls and leaflets this week, seemed chillingly familiar. 'It’s definitely something on the back of my mind, and we don’t really know where exactly is safe,' she said. Almost a year after the start of its war in Gaza, Israel has turned its focus on Lebanon, significantly ratcheting up its campaign against its archenemy Hezbollah. Among many in Lebanon, there is fear that Israel’s military operations in Lebanon would follow the same Gaza playbook: Evacuation orders, mass displacement and overwhelming airstrikes. Israel says its strikes target Hezbollah weapons sites and militants. There are key differences between Gaza and Lebanon and how Israel has so far conducted its operations, which it says aim to push back Hezbollah from the border so that tens of thousands of Israelis displaced by Hezbollah's rocket attacks can return to their homes. Although it has said it is preparing for a possible ground operation, Israel has so far not sent troops into Lebanon. Still, there are fears that Israel’s actions in Gaza, including the use of overwhelming and what rights groups and the United Nations have described as disproportionate force, would be repeated in Lebanon. Top Israeli officials have threatened to repeat the destruction of Gaza in Lebanon if the Hezbollah fire continues. On Monday, Israel struck 1,600 targets across Lebanon, killing 492 people and wounding 1,645, and causing a massive wave of displacement as thousands fled from south Lebanon north. It was a staggering one-day toll that shocked a nation used to war. It was by far the deadliest barrage since the monthlong 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war, when an estimated 1,000 people in Lebanon were killed. Throughout the day, the Israeli military sent warnings to residents to immediately evacuate in anticipation of the strikes and to stay away from places where Hezbollah stores weapons — something most would have no way of knowing. 'Please get out of harm’s way now,' Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a recorded message. 'Once our operation is finished, you can come back safely to your homes.' Israel’s evacuation orders have been a central part of its military campaign in Gaza for the past year. In the first week after launching war, Israel ordered 1.1 million civilians in the Gaza Strip to relocate from the north to the south, sowing confusion and fear in the overcrowded enclave. Since then, the Israeli military has issued dozens of evacuation orders calling on Palestinians to evacuate to Israeli-designated 'humanitarian zones.' Israeli officials say they are targeting Hamas militants who have embedded themselves among the population. Israel’s campaign in Gaza has killed more than 41,000 Palestinians, according to health officials in Gaza. The Health Ministry, part of the territory’s Hamas government, does not differentiate between civilians and combatants, but says that just over half the dead have been women and children.' With Gaza's borders sealed, residents of the crammed territory are trapped with nowhere to go, whereas in Lebanon, those fleeing Israeli strikes have been able to move to safer areas. Thousands have fled to neighboring Syria, while others have left through the country’s airport. A second front for Israel Hezbollah started firing rockets on Israel in support of Gaza on Oct. 8, a day after Hamas militants launched an unprecedented attack on Israel, killing some 1,200 people and abducting another 250. Since then, the two sides have been engaged in cross border strikes that have gradually escalated and displaced tens of thousands of civilians on both sides of the border. Many Lebanese have been following the growing hostilities with a mixture of nonchalance and dread, hoping they would remain contained. Lebanon has been in the throes of an economic meltdown since 2019 and can ill afford another devastating war with Israel. Hostilities escalated dramatically last week when thousands of explosives hidden in pagers and walkie-talkies used by Hezbollah detonated, killing dozens of people and leaving thousands, including many civilians, with severe injuries to the eyes, face and limbs. Israel is widely believed to be behind the attack. Israel has also killed several top Hezbollah commanders in Beirut. Meanwhile, intensifying Hezbollah barrages have wounded several people in Israel. As the region appeared to be teetering toward another all-out war, Jana Bsat, 25, who works for a media analysis company in Beirut, said she now has a bag packed, ready for immediate evacuation. She feels it’s only a matter of time. 'It feels surreal, to be honest. We heard about what was happening in Gaza and now we’re experiencing it for ourselves,' she said. 'I am in disgust of all this fear-mongering and psychological torture,' she said, adding: 'But then you remember, it’s all part of a warfare strategy and it’s not going to stop anytime soon.' Lebanon is not Gaza While Israel’s actions in Lebanon may have echoes of Gaza, the conflicts are different. In Gaza, Israel’s goal is the complete destruction of Hamas, whereas Israel’s stated goal in Lebanon is to push Hezbollah away from its border. Whereas Hamas rules Gaza, Hezbollah is a powerful militia with enormous influence inside Lebanon, and has representatives in the country's parliament and government. In 2006, Israel flattened entire Beirut neighborhoods and bombed Lebanon's only international airport as well as key infrastructure, including bridges and power stations. By contrast, its current campaign seems to be, for the large part, targeting Hezbollah, although many civilians have also been killed. Unlike Gaza, Lebanon is also a mixed tapestry of political and religious groups, including Christian and Sunni-majority areas where there is significant opposition to the Iran-backed Shiite Hezbollah. Ali Safa, a 30-year-old interior designer who fled to Beirut from south Lebanon with his family this week, said he isn’t worried about the Gaza scenario being repeated in Lebanon. 'Gaza is an open prison, it is besieged. Lebanon is much larger, it is not encircled. And it has Hezbollah, which is a much bigger force, much better-equipped than Hamas,' he said. U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres, speaking at the United Nations Wednesday, said the world 'cannot afford Lebanon to become another Gaza.' Frayed nerves Whether the current hostilities will expand into an all-out war or whether Israel will launch a ground invasion remains to be seen. Israel’s army chief said Wednesday that preparations were underway for a possible ground operation. Many in Lebanon say they are haunted by the nonstop churn of horrifying images from Gaza over the past year, fearing the same scenario in Lebanon. For several months, low-flying Israeli fighter jets have launched sonic booms over Lebanon, rattling windows and terrifying residents. More recently, the buzzing sound of Israeli military drones in Lebanese skies have added to the anxiety. Some have gotten used to it. At a funeral for a Hezbollah commander recently where a few hundred people gathered, hardly anyone flinched when low-flying Israeli planes caused a thundering boom that shook the ground. Bsat said at some point she, too, got used to hearing sonic booms that made the windows in her house shake. 'The drones I also got used to and now, unfortunately, the bombing,' she said via Whatsapp. 'I’ve come to terms with reality, but my hands still can’t stop shaking as I’m writing this,' she said. 'I’m still dreading what is going to happen here.'	https://apnews.com/article/lebanon-israel-gaza-hezbollah-hamas-war-fears-ca37a9b6314d327f8719a4f513e81233	2024-09-26T19:29:38-07:00	
Mexico's populist president held court each morning for 6 years. Now he's retiring from public life	MEXICO CITY (AP) — Every day at 7 a.m., President Andrés Manuel López Obrador strolls onto a stage in Mexico's National Palace, clad in a smart suit and tie, and peers out at a room of bleary-eyed reporters and social media personalities. 'Buenos días, look alive!' the 70-year-old leader calls out in a gravelly voice. And the show begins. Throughout his nearly six-year term in office, López Obrador’s morning media briefings, known as 'las mañaneras,' have provided him with a powerful tool: a direct line to his political base, broadcast live on government and local news channels, and streaming online. Without pausing to take bathroom breaks or even a sip of water, the president stands at the podium talking for sometimes more than three hours, often in long, roundabout musings or rambling diatribes, all in simple language that anyone tuning in can understand. Before he leaves office Monday, the daily briefings, beloved by many supporters and criticized by opponents as full of falsehoods and personal attacks, are emblematic of the particular brand of folksy populism that López Obrador wielded to become one of the most powerful political forces Mexico has seen in decades. It's a model that his successor and protege, President-elect Claudia Sheinbaum, will be hard-pressed to emulate. 'The national conversation revolves around him,' said Daniela Lemus, a National Autonomous University of Mexico professor who researches political communication and has written about the briefings. 'He is the protagonist of the mañaneras … and what he says becomes the main topic of conversation by the media, day and night.' When López Obrador won the presidency in a landslide in 2018, he pitched himself as a fighter for poor, working-class and rural Mexicans long neglected by the political elite. He started holding the briefings right after taking office that December, and has continued to do so every workday almost without fail for the duration of his time in office. They're popular with his base: One older adult couple in Mexico City, for example, tune in religiously on a small TV wedged between bags of seeds and nuts at their stall in a food market. Elsewhere, a magazine vendor records the broadcast to watch at night after work. Still another fan of AMLO, as the president is popularly known, streams it on social media while he looks for work. 'The mañaneras have opened our eyes. They show us all what Mr. López Obrador has achieved,' said Jesús Hernández Alarcón, a 79-year-old roasted corn vendor. 'We have understood a lot because the media is full of lies, many have tricked us. Now that we have the mañaneras, everything has changed for me.' López Obrador often uses the space to provide updates on key projects and take questions from a cluster of journalists and government-friendly social media influencers, some of whom have gained a platform from their participation in the briefings — such as Carlos Pozos Soto, an eccentric, bow-tied, effusively pro-AMLO figure better known as Lord Molecule. As time has gone on, the briefings have morphed into something resembling a morning show, with López Obrador inviting mariachi bands to serenade viewers on Mother’s Day, lecturing at length on Mexican history and hosting recurring segments such as 'Who's who in the lies of the week,' in which government officials attack critical media. 'This is a way to educate, to raise awareness so that (traditional news organizations) cannot manipulate' information, López Obrador said one morning in August. 'People are more informed, and that comes with a lot of advantages. … There is no topic that is off limits, there is no censorship.' López Obrador’s willingness to publicly joust with journalists has had all the more impact because his predecessor, Enrique Peña Nieto, almost never took a question during his own six-year term. But while the president calls the briefings a bastion of transparency in a nation long plagued by corruption, critics say he has used them to badmouth opponents and journalists, spread false information and firmly control the political narrative. Often, rather than answering a question directly, he instead uses it as a launching pad to talk about one of his preferred topics. He consistently sidesteps questions about Mexico's continuing cartel-fueled violence, for example, or pivots to rail against his predecessors for starting the drug war. López Obrador has attacked judges, criticized opponents during election campaigns and regularly targeted both domestic and foreign journalists. In February, after a New York Times reporter sought comment for an article investigating ties between his administration and drug cartels, the president disclosed her cellphone number during a morning briefing. And last month, when an independent Mexican journalist said she had been harassed by a mob of his supporters and forced to flee an event she was covering, López Obrador responded with a mix of scorn and disinterest. 'I am at risk because of this, now anyone can attack me in the street,' Reyna Ramírez told the president. 'You have polarized society. Don’t you have anything to say about that?' 'Have you gone on long enough?' the president said. Advocates for press freedom have expressed concern over his hostility toward critical media in a place that is more dangerous for journalists than any other country not currently at war. At least 138 journalists have been killed in Mexico in the past 20 years, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, and many more have gone missing or been threatened, attacked, tortured or forced to flee their homes. The president's discourse created 'a narrative of us versus them, of journalists being the enemies of this political project, the opponents of the people … diminishing the urgency of protecting press freedom,' said Jan-Albert Hootsen, the CPJ's Mexico representative. Meanwhile a 2021 report by the political consulting agency SPIN found that López Obrador made more than 56,000 false or misleading statements in his mañaneras in a period covering 2 1/2 years. Among them is his assertion that cartels ' respect citizens ' and only fight among themselves. 'Just because the president is walking up to a stage and is talking about something, doesn’t mean he's being open,' Hootsen said. 'If he’s lying all the time, and there are no consequences, then we’re not talking about transparency.' In the age of social media, videos and soundbites from the mañaneras often go viral online, further boosting the president’s audience. 'It’s not what happens in the morning press conference itself, but what happens after,' said Kevin Zapata, a social and public policy professor at the University de Nottingham who has studied the briefings. 'A 30-second clip can be more powerful than the two hours on the TV.' For people who may not have much time to investigate López Obrador's claims and deeply distrust Mexican media, it's often the government's narrative that ends up dominating. When asked about false information and attacks on journalists, his supporters often repeat the president's lines of attack, for example saying such criticism comes from a corrupt opposition and the president is defending Mexican sovereignty. López Obrador's popularity spurred his Morena party to major electoral gains in the June elections. Morena will have an even greater majority in Congress as Sheinbaum takes up the presidency, and lawmakers recently passed a constitutional amendment that observers and critics say is likely to result in courts being stacked with judges friendly to the party. Sheinbaum has said she will continue the morning broadcasts. But most Mexicans agree that she lacks the natural charisma that has allowed López Obrador to wield the mañaneras so effectively. 'It’s something that worked for AMLO because he’s a very unique figure and very charismatic. ... But now democracy is becoming a popularity show in Mexico,' Zapata said. 'Many people will try to emulate it, that’s for sure. But not everyone will be able to.' ___ Follow AP's Latin America coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america	https://apnews.com/article/mexico-lopez-obrador-mananeras-daily-briefings-81245ec04ad9843f3bfa64cfad2ce66b	2024-09-26T19:26:10-07:00	
Trump and Zelenskyy meet in New York amid rising questions about US support for Ukraine	NEW YORK (AP) — Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy met face-to-face with Donald Trump on Friday with public tensions rising between the two over Ukraine's defense against Russia's invasion and in the midst of the U.S. presidential election. 'We both want to see this end, and we both want to see a fair deal made,' Trump told Fox News while standing alongside Zelenskyy after meeting for 40 minutes. 'The president wants it to end, and he wants it to end as quickly as possible. He wants a fair transaction to take place.' Zelenskyy said the war shouldn't have started and added that there needs to be pressure on Russian President Vladimir Putin and peace for the families of those killed. 'We need to do everything to pressure him to stop this war. He is in our territory. That's most important to understand. He is in our territory.' The meeting came at a critical time in the Russia-Ukraine war as Election Day nears in the U.S. Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris, his Democratic opponent, have taken sharply different approaches to Ukraine. Zelenskyy has been eager to keep good relations with the United States, his country's largest provider of arms and money for the war. But the future of that support would be in doubt if Trump were to win the election. Trump, who has touted his good relationship with Putin and called the Russian leader 'pretty smart' for invading Ukraine, has for months criticized U.S. support for Ukraine and derided Zelenskyy as a 'salesman' for persuading Washington to provide weapons and funding to his military as it tries to fend off Moscow. On Friday, Trump brought up his first impeachment, which Democrats in Congress pursued after he asked Zelenskyy for a 'favor' — that he investigate Joe Biden, now the president, and Biden’s son Hunter, who served on the board of a Ukrainian gas company. At the time Trump asked for the 'favor,' he was withholding $400 million in military aid to Ukraine as it fought Russian-backed separatists on its eastern boundary. He was later acquitted of the impeachment charges by a Republican-led Senate. 'He could have grandstanded and played cute,' Trump said. 'And he didn't do that. He said, ‘President Trump did absolutely nothing wrong.’ He said it loud and clear.' Zelenskyy told reporters in October 2019, as Congress was launching its impeachment inquiry, that there was 'no blackmail' from Trump. He also told reporters, 'I don’t want to interfere in any way in the elections,' trying to publicly and privately distance himself then from U.S. domestic politics. But The Associated Press reported afterward that, despite Zelenskyy’s denials, U.S. officials were aware he was feeling pressure from the Trump administration to investigate Biden even before his phone call with Trump regarding the 'favor.' Friday's meeting almost wasn't scheduled despite Zelenskyy’s office saying something had been planned during the Ukrainian leader’s visit to the U.N. General Assembly, during which he is making his endgame pitch to allies. In an interview with The New Yorker that was published earlier this week, Zelenskyy implied Trump does not understand and oversimplifies the conflict. The Ukrainian leader said Trump's running mate, Sen. JD Vance of Ohio, was 'too radical' and has essentially advocated for Ukraine to 'make a sacrifice' by 'giving up its territories.' Trump ripped Zelenskyy and Ukraine on two separate occasions this week. Speaking Wednesday in North Carolina, he referred to Ukraine as 'demolished' and its people as 'dead.' 'Any deal — the worst deal — would’ve been better than what we have now,' Trump said. 'If they made a bad deal, it would’ve been much better. They would’ve given up a little bit and everybody would be living and every building would be built and every tower would be aging for another 2,000 years.' Meanwhile, Harris on Thursday stood alongside Zelenskyy and said Trump's push for Ukraine to quickly cut a deal to end the war was 'not proposals for peace,' but 'proposals for surrender.' Trump on Thursday said he was not advocating for a surrender. As he was preparing to sit down for the Friday meeting, Trump was asked by a reporter if Ukraine could win the war and he replied, 'Sure. They could.' He said of Zelenskyy: 'We have a very good relationship. And I also have a very good relationship, as you know, with President Putin. And if we win, I think we’re going to get it resolved very quickly.' Zelenskyy cut into Trump's remarks with, 'I hope we have more good relations between us.' Before moving on to another question, Trump interjected to say 'but, you know, it takes two to tango.' ___ Gomez Licon reported from Fort Lauderdale, Florida, and Mascaro from Washington.	https://apnews.com/article/trump-zelenskyy-trump-tower-meeting-7c163eb5068c5003b219b6d524436517	2024-09-26T19:05:15-07:00	
Titan implosion hearing paints a picture of reckless greed and explorer passion	Witnesses testified that the company that operated an experimental deep-water submersible that imploded, killing five people, put profits over safety and ignored warning signs before the disaster. Several company officials, meanwhile, spoke of the explorer spirit and taking calculated risks to push humankind’s boundaries. Those different viewpoints emerged as the Coast Guard panel on Friday wraps up two weeks of testimony on the Titan disaster last year. The panel is tasked with determining why the carbon-fiber submersible was lost 12,500 feet (3,810 meters) deep on the ocean floor near the wreck of the Titanic. Testimony painted contrasting images of greed and hubris as OceanGate sought out well-heeled clients for its submersible made from carbon fiber — a material that was untested at such depths — versus modern-day explorers who carefully considered risks as they sought to open the deepest depths of the world’s oceans to more people. Guillermo Sohnlein, who helped found OceanGate with Stockton Rush, described the lofty goal 'to give humanity greater access to the ocean, specifically the deep ocean.' Using carbon fiber for the pressure hull was hardly a novel idea, he said, and noted Rush himself was the first human to test the design. But former operations director David Lochridge said the company was committed only to profit making. 'The whole idea behind the company was to make money,' he testified. 'There was very little in the way of science.' Witnesses could not even agree on what to call the wealthy clients who paid $250,000 for the experience. Some said they were simply passengers, even though OceanGate called them 'mission specialists' who were given tasks. Killed in the implosion were Rush and four others including Paul-Henri Nargeolet, who was director of underwater research for RMS Titanic, which holds the legal rights to salvage the wreck of the ship. Nargeolet’s family is suing for more than $50 million, accusing the sub’s operator of gross negligence. The carbon-fiber pressure hull of Titan was the subject of much of the discussion. An expert witness, Roy Thomas, senior principal engineer at the American Bureau of Shipping, testified that carbon-fiber may be strong and light, but that it’s tricky to manufacture. Carbon fiber also is 'susceptible to fatigue failure' under repeated pressurization and salt water can weaken the material in multiple ways, he said. Coast Guard officials noted at the start of the hearing, held in South Carolina, that the submersible had not been independently reviewed, as is standard practice. Witnesses testified they had heard loud cracking sounds in past descents. And scientific director Steven Ross said that, on a dive just a few days before the Titan imploded, the vessel became unstable because of a ballast problem, causing passengers to tumble and crash into a bulkhead. During its final dive on June 18, 2023, the crew lost contact after an exchange of texts as it descended. One of the last messages from Titan’s crew to the Polar Prince support ship before the submersible imploded stated, 'all good here.' The crew of Polar Prince, meanwhile, grew increasingly concerned. Ships, planes and other equipment assembled for a rescue operation about 435 miles (700 kilometers) south of St. John’s, Newfoundland. Wreckage of the Titan was subsequently found on the ocean floor about 330 yards (300 meters) off the bow of the Titanic, Coast Guard officials said.	https://apnews.com/article/titan-submersible-disaster-coast-guard-hearing-f991bd49eb1f49b303477bfcab8923f1	2024-09-26T19:02:20-07:00
