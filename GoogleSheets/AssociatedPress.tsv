The Vatican is set to rule on reported apparitions of the Virgin Mary at a Bosnian shrine	VATICAN CITY (AP) — The Vatican is providing its long-awaited assessment on one of the more contested aspects of Roman Catholicism in recent years: the reported 'apparitions' of the Virgin Mary in an otherwise unremarkable village in southern Bosnia. Following nearly 15 years of study, the head of the Vatican’s doctrine office, Cardinal Víctor Manuel Fernández, is headlining a news conference Thursday on what the Vatican called 'the spiritual experience of Medjugorje.' In 1981, six children and teenagers reported seeing visions of the Madonna on a hill in the village of Medjugorje, located in the wine-making region of southern Bosnia. Some of those original 'seers' have claimed the visions have occurred regularly since then, even daily, and that Mary sends them messages. As a result, Medjugorje has become a major European pilgrimage destination for Christian believers, attracting millions of people over the years. Last year alone, 1.7 million Eucharistic wafers were distributed during Masses there, according to statistics published on the shrine’s website, a rough estimate of the numbers of Catholics who visited. However, unlike at the more well-known and established Catholic sanctuaries in Fatima, Portugal or Lourdes, France, the alleged apparitions at Medjugorje have never been declared authentic by the Vatican. And over the years, local bishops and Vatican officials have cast doubt on the reliability and motivations of the 'seers,' because of concerns that economic interests may have been driving their reports of continued visions. Religious tourism has become an important part of the local economy, with an entire industry catering to pilgrims – hotels, private accommodations, family-run farm businesses, even sports complexes and camping sites -- and popping up around Medjugorje. Their growth has contributed to the surrounding municipality's financial well-being after the Bosnian war in the 1990s devastated the economy. All of which has led to intense speculation about what, exactly, the Vatican will say Thursday, with journalists parsing the significance of the fact that the Vatican didn’t refer to 'apparitions' or 'visions' in its announcement of the briefing, but merely 'the spiritual experience of Medjugorje.' In 2010, Pope Benedict XVI appointed an international commission of theologians and bishops to formally investigate the reported apparitions, tapping his vicar of Rome, Cardinal Camillo Ruini, to head it. Pope Francis received Ruini’s report in 2013 or early 2014. In a sneak-preview, Francis in 2017 said the key of the Vatican investigation was to distinguish between the original reported visions in 1981, and the current claims of continuous apparitions, on which Francis cast doubt. 'I prefer Our Lady to be a mother, our mother, and not a telegraph operator who sends out a message every day at a certain time,' he said at the time. 'This is not the mother of Jesus and these alleged apparitions have no great value.' But in an airborne press conference returning home from Fatima, Francis added that it was undeniable that people go to Medjugorje and are converted from sin. 'This isn’t a magic wand. You can’t deny this spiritual and pastoral fact,' he said. Francis went on to appoint two personal envoys to oversee the shrine and the needs of the faithful there, and in 2019 explicitly allowed official church pilgrimages, while making clear that such permission didn’t amount to a decision about the authenticity of the reported visions. Whatever is announced Thursday, it is unlikely to be a point-blank declaration of authenticity about the Medjugorje phenomena. That is because Fernández earlier this year announced the Vatican was no longer in the business of declaring alleged visions, weeping statues and stigmata as authentic or not. He released a new criteria for examining such reports and said the Vatican would not make definitive declarations unless the reported event is clearly a hoax. The aim is to prevent the faithful from being harmed by people trying to make money off of their beliefs, he said. The new criteria envisages six main outcomes, with the most favorable being that the church issues a noncommittal doctrinal green light, a so-called 'nihil obstat.' Such a declaration means there is nothing about the event that is contrary to the faith, and therefore Catholics can express devotion to it. Whatever the outcome, it will surely impact Medjugorje, which lies in the municipality of Citluk, one of the smallest in Bosnia with some 18,000 residents but economically well-off. The municipality has declared that tourism is key for its development, largely thanks to Medjugorje, and hosts various festivals and gatherings each year organized by Christian humanitarian organizations drawn to the place. Municipal workers say 2024 could be a record year, because Christian pilgrims are tending to stay away from Israel because of the war, and are opting for Medjugorje instead. 'Medjugorje means a lot, all economic sectors lean on Medjugorje,' said Ante Kozina, the tourism association chief. 'It is a growth generator for the entire municipality.' ___ Gec contributed from Belgrade, Serbia.	https://apnews.com/article/vatican-medjugorje-shrine-pope-7141cafa786438ebd14f0980c06371d3	2024-09-18T20:37:25-07:00	
Relentless fighting is devastating Sudan and escalating in Darfur's capital, UN says	UNITED NATIONS (AP) — Relentless violence has devastated Sudan and large-scale fighting has escalated in and around the only capital in Sudan’s western Darfur region not held by paramilitary forces, the United Nations top humanitarian official said Wednesday. Acting humanitarian chief Joyce Msuya told the U.N. Security Council that famine has already struck Zamzam camp, about 15 kilometers (10 miles) from North Darfur’s embattled capital of El Fasher. She said a large-scale humanitarian operation is 'a matter of life and death.' Sudan plunged into conflict in mid-April 2023, when long-simmering tensions between its military and paramilitary leaders broke out in the capital Khartoum and spread to other regions including Darfur. The U.N. says over 14,000 people have been killed and 33,000 injured. Msuya urged the council to demand that the warring government and paramilitary Rapid Support Force refrain from targeting civilians, hospitals, schools and other civilian infrastructure, and allow unimpeded delivery of humanitarian aid through all border crossings and across conflict lines. She also called on the U.N.’s 193 member nations to pressure the parties 'to agree to a humanitarian pause to save lives, give civilians respite and allow us to deliver assistance.' Two decades ago, Darfur became synonymous with genocide and war crimes, particularly by the notorious Janjaweed Arab militias, against populations that identify as Central or East African. Up to 300,000 people were killed and 2.7 million were driven from their homes. That legacy appears to have returned, with the International Criminal Court’s prosecutor, Karim Khan, saying in January there are grounds to believe both sides may be committing war crimes, crimes against humanity, or genocide in Darfur. Msuya said 'the world should not abide in El Fasher the atrocities we witnessed in West Darfur.' In June, the Security Council adopted a resolution calling for 'an immediate halt to the fighting and for de-escalation in and around El Fasher.' Regrettably, Msuya said, both sides ignored the call, and fighting escalated in the past week with 'constant and heavy' shelling and bombing. 'Civilians, especially women and children, have been hit (and) civilian sites and infrastructure — including hospitals and internally displaced persons’ camps — have been hit,' she said. 'Of the three main hospitals in El Fasher, only one is functioning, although only partially following an attack that caused extensive damage in August.' In August, international experts confirmed there is famine in Zamzam camp, which houses around 500,000 displaced people. Msuya said close to 1.7 million people in North Darfur face 'acute food insecurity,' adding that 13 other localities in Sudan have been identified as at risk of famine. In February, Doctors Without Borders reported that a child was dying every two hours in Zamzam camp, she said. The latest screening by the medical aid organization and the Ministry of Health between Sept. 1 and 5 indicates the situation is getting worse. 'About 34% of the children are malnourished, including 10% who are severely malnourished,' Msuya said. Aid deliveries have been impeded by fighting and flooding, but Msuya said that as floodwaters subside in the coming weeks, the U.N. will be able to start moving food and other assistance to El Fasher and other areas at risk of famine. The acting undersecretary-general for humanitarian affairs stressed that to address 'the atrocious humanitarian situation,' there are two keys: a de-escalation in fighting and a willingness by both sides to facilitate access to those in need. 'Be in no doubt: Without safe and predictable access and a steady supply of food and humanitarian supplies, we will see a dramatic spike in mortality — including children — in Zamzam and in other areas around El Fasher,' she said. 'The same goes for the situation across Sudan,' Msuya said, especially the capital Khartoum and neighboring Sennar and Jazeera states in southeast Sudan, which continue to be devastated 'by relentless violence.'	https://apnews.com/article/un-sudan-famine-violence-el-fasher-darfur-8cc6ee91caca3e8b61d04f01791ba80c	2024-09-18T19:47:26-07:00	
Sri Lanka's presidential election a test for current leader, 2 years after its economy hit bottom	COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) — Two years ago, food cart worker Fathima Shiyama had to wait in line, sometimes for days, to get cooking gas, fuel and other essentials. It was a test of patience for her and millions of other Sri Lankans as their country languished in economic and political chaos. Since then, under President Ranil Wickremesinghe, the South Asian island nation's economy has begun a fragile recovery. As the country gears up for a crucial presidential vote, key economic indicators have improved and there are no shortages of food and fuel. Inflation is almost under control after peaking at 70%. Sri Lankans who usually vote along religious and ethnic lines will be keeping the state of the economy in mind when they vote Saturday on a new president. Many are still struggling, borrowing money or leaving the country to cope with rising living costs and limited opportunities. Shiyama says she isn’t still earning enough to cover her monthly expenses and pay for her ailing daughter’s medical tests. In desperation, she has turned to borrowing from loan sharks at an exorbitant 20% interest rate. 'We are trying our best to survive despite many difficulties,' said the 48-year-old mother of five, as she was selling 'string hopper' noodles and coconut 'pittu,' popular traditional dinner items, from a cart on the outskirts of Colombo. As Sri Lanka sank into economic collapse in 2022, a popular uprising led its then president Gotabaya Rajapaksa to flee the country. This weekend's election pits his successor, Wickremesinghe, against opposition leader Sajith Premadasa and Anura Dissanayake, leader of a Marxist-led coalition that has been gaining popularity. Poll results are due Sunday. All the candidates have promised to lead Sri Lanka into a prosperous future by developing new industries, improving agriculture, broadening the tax base to increase revenue and creating tens of thousands of new jobs. Under Wickremesinghe, Sri Lanka has been negotiating with the international creditors to restructure the country's staggering debt and get the economy back on track. The International Monetary Fund approved a four-year bailout program last year, but many Sri Lankans are unhappy over the government’s efforts to increase revenue by raising electricity rates and imposing heavy taxes on professionals and businesses, to meet IMF conditions for its assistance. Overall conditions have improved after the long dry spell during and after the pandemic. Vital tourism earnings have risen and the Sri Lankan rupee has recovered. But rising prices due to the government's austerity measures are squeezing many households. 'We are in a very critical time' said Murtaza Jafferjee, an economic analyst and chairman of Advocata Institute, a Colombo-based independent policy think tank. 'The economy is looking up,' he said, but has not fully recovered. The government should aim for at least 4% growth this year, instead of its target of 3%. Politicians need to focus on policies that don't just benefit the country's elite, Jafferjee said. 'It is high time that we run this country for the benefit of the 22 million people,' he said. Sri Lanka’s economic crisis began well before the upheavals of 2022. Staggering economic mismanagement by successive governments was compounded by poor policy choices and then the pandemic. Rajapaksa pushed through big tax cuts in 2019. Then, he banned imports of chemical fertilizer to preserve Sri Lanka’s scarce foreign reserves, hurting crop yields in a a country largely dependent on agriculture. With the war in Ukraine, food and fuel prices surged and fuel, cooking gas, medicine and food ran short. Sri Lankans lined up for government rice handouts and charity meals. Today, inflation has dropped below 5% and there's no need to line up to buy essentials. But key parts of the economy remain in crisis. Jagath Dissanayake said conditions remain dire for his construction firm in Gampaha, a town located about 30 kilometers (19 miles) north of Colombo after prices of building materials tripled. Most of Dissanayake projects are suspended and he had to lay off two-thirds of his employees. 'People have no money to do new construction as they give priority to buying essentials. We hardly get any new work,' Dissanayake said. His income is down almost 75%, he said, so there is no more dining out and Dissanayake rides a motorbike instead of driving a car, to save money on fuel. 'Of course, there are no queues for petrol anymore, but we don't have enough money to buy it.' he said. Sri Lanka’s construction industry has shed about 400,000 jobs in the last four years, according to some estimates. Once a booming industry that contributed nearly 12% to the country’s growth figures, its share has dropped to 7% this year. Many Sri Lankans have sought jobs abroad. Viraj Maduranga, formerly a teacher in a government school, went to Dubai in 2021 to find work when he became unable to repay loans he had taken to build his house and buy a vehicle. 'Either I had to sell off the house and the car, or find an alternative income. So, I decided to leave. It was not an easy decision for me and my wife, but we have to make sacrifices to build our lives,' said Maduranga, who now works as a teacher in Dubai and won’t be able to vote in the election. Not everyone is impressed with the promises made by the candidates in this election. 'We have seen it in the past, politicians saying various things, but when they come into power they have simply ignored what they have said during campaigns,' said W.A. Wijewardena, an economic analyst and former deputy governor of Sri Lanka's central bank. Jafferjee, the economic analyst, said the election is 'extremely crucial' for Sri Lanka’s economic recovery. The next president should use his executive powers to 'enact pro-consumer policies' and be more open to trade. 'This (crisis) is not insurmountable, but you need to make unpopular choices. What you need basically is a president who looks to grow the pie,' said Jafferjee. In the meantime, Sri Lankans like Maduranga are impatiently waiting for change. He longs to rejoin his wife and 8-year-old son in Sri Lanka, but still needs to repay his loans. 'This is not the best time to go back,' Maduranga said. 'I want to live in Sri Lanka as a free man without being indebted to anyone.' ___ Saaliq reported from New Delhi.	https://apnews.com/article/lanka-election-economy-wickremesinghe-imf-e2df0bbc35ea715494f6d617af0741ee	2024-09-18T19:29:52-07:00	
Adoption fraud separated generations of South Korean children from their families, AP finds	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea’s government, Western countries and adoption agencies worked in tandem to supply some 200,000 Korean children to parents overseas, despite years of evidence they were being procured through questionable or downright unscrupulous means, an investigation led by The Associated Press has found. Those children grew up and searched for their roots — and some realized they are not who they were told. Their stories have sparked a reckoning that is rocking the international adoption industry. The investigation, in collaboration with Frontline (PBS), was based on interviews with more than 80 adoptees in the U.S., Australia and six European countries, along with parents, agency employees, humanitarian workers and government officials. It also drew on more than 100 information requests and thousands of pages of documents — including many never publicly seen before and some the AP got declassified. In dozens of cases AP examined, it found: Children were kidnapped off the streets. Parents claim they were told their newborns were dead or very sick, only to have them shipped away. Documents were fabricated, leading adoptees to anguished later reunions with supposed parents — only to discover they were not related at all. Government officials declined to answer questions about its past, saying it will let a fact-finding commission finish its work. But in a written statement, the Health Ministry acknowledged that skyrocketing adoptions in the 1970s-80s were possibly driven by an intent to reduce welfare spending. The adoption agencies declined to comment on specific cases, but have long defended their practices as a way to search for foreign families for vulnerable children. Here are further findings: Desperate to reduce spending, South Korea targeted its weakest citizens Korea’s adoption program grew out of the wreckage of the 1950-53 Korean War, when Americans took in the unwanted biracial children of Korean women and Western soldiers. It expanded to include the children of unwed mothers and poor families. Korea relied on private adoption agencies as its social safety net, bringing millions of dollars into the economy. Korean officials fit their laws to match American ones to make children adoptable in the West, where access to birth control and abortion had caused the domestic supply of adoptable babies to plummet. The government endorsed 'proxy adoptions' for families to adopt children quickly without ever visiting Korea. Korea also rewrote its laws to remove minimal safeguards or judicial oversight. Concerns were raised early. In a 1966 internal memo obtained by AP, International Social Service, a Geneva-based organization, wrote that it suspected the Korean government assessed agencies not by child welfare standards, but by the money they brought in. Korean officials were aware that lost children were documented as abandoned; the origins of alleged orphans weren’t verified; and some were 'disguised' by agencies as being born from unwed mothers to make them adoptable, according to records seen by AP. In the early 1980s, the government itself likened the agencies’ child-hunting practices to 'trafficking.' Workers warned that adoption agencies were aggressively hunting for children Former adoption workers told AP that agencies paid to have every corner of the country scoured for children. One worker, employed at an agency from 1979 to 1984, said the agencies had no process to verify the backgrounds of children and invested 'zero effort' in confirming the child was orphaned. Private counseling records in a 1988 document prepared by the country’s largest adoption agency, Holt Children’s Services, show that some parents who relinquished their children soon pleaded for them back, with no success. The document, obtained by AP, describes how agency’s workers told parents that their children would thrive in good Western families and may return home someday rich or 'with Ph.Ds.' Humanitarian workers openly worried about what they were seeing. Francis Carlin, who then ran Korea’s Catholic Relief Services, said there weren’t enough legitimate orphans to feed Western demand, which led to 'a lot of the compromises, a lot of the hanky panky' involving larger agencies. 'These, I would call them brokers, were going out and trying to get more and more children,' Carlin said. 'They would put the legitimate parent on a guilt trip and say, what are you doing? You can’t afford to take care of this child…. You’re so selfish.' Children were stolen from parents, bought from hospitals and falsely described as abandoned By the 1980s, agencies were procuring most of their children directly from hospitals and maternity homes, which often received illegal payments for babies, according to records seen by AP. Though the stated intention of adoption was to spare children from orphanages, they gathered more than 4,600 children from hospitals in 1988, 60% of their supply. A government audit in 1989 shows that Holt Children’s Services, the biggest agency, made nearly 100 illegal payments to hospitals during six months in 1988, worth about $16,000 now. Eastern Social Welfare Society gave even more, worth about $65,340, to hospitals over that period. Despite the agencies' common practice of labeling children as 'abandoned,' records from 1980 to 1987 show that more than 90% of the Korean children sent to the West almost certainly had known relatives, said Philsik Shin, a scholar at Korea’s Anyang University. It was 'almost customary' to document children as abandoned, said Helen Noh, who matched hundreds of children with U.S. parents at Holt from 1981 to 1982. As complaints mount, South Korea is under pressure Robyn Joy Park, who was adopted by parents in Minnesota in 1982, traveled to South Korea in 2007 to meet a woman her agency, Eastern, said was her biological mother. She developed a deep bond with the woman over several years, but was devastated after a DNA test in 2012 showed they weren’t related. The AP spoke to 10 others who found their identity was switched with someone else. When children processed for adoption died, became too sick to travel or were found by their biological families, agencies often replaced them with other children, according to former adoption workers. At a meeting with an adoptee in 2021 where AP was present, a longtime worker said Western partner agencies were willing to take 'any child of the same sex and similar age, because it would take too much time to start over again.' Park is among more than 360 adoptees who have asked South Korea’s Truth and Reconciliation Commission to investigate the circumstances surrounding their adoptions. Nobody knows how many Korean adoptions were questionable or even fraudulent, in part because of the privacy and sensitivities involved along with the vagueness and unreliability of the documents. Advocates say many adoptions have happy endings.	https://apnews.com/article/south-korea-international-adoption-fraud-investigation-takeaways-25fb71223bf86bfd0709863e5063faba	2024-09-18T19:27:48-07:00	
Rampant adoption fraud separated generations of South Korean children from their families, AP finds	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — As the plane descended into Seoul, Robert Calabretta swaddled himself in a blanket, his knees tucked into his chest like a baby in the womb. A single tear ran down his cheek. The 34-year-old felt like a newborn — he was about to meet his parents for the first time since he was 3 days old. Most of his life, he thought they’d abandoned him for adoption to the United States. When he finally found them, he learned the truth: The origin story on his adoption paperwork was a lie. Instead, he said, his parents were told in 1986 that their infant was very sick and they thought he had died. 'I am so sorry,' his birth father had written when they found each other, his words interrupted by fits of weeping. 'I miss you. How did you endure this cruel world?' Calabretta is among a growing and vocal community of victims of an adoption system they accuse of searching out children for would-be parents, rather than finding parents for vulnerable children — sometimes with devastating consequences only surfacing today. South Korea’s government, Western countries and adoption agencies worked in tandem to supply some 200,000 Korean children to parents overseas, despite years of evidence they were being procured through questionable or downright unscrupulous means, an investigation led by The Associated Press found. Those children grew up and searched for their roots — and some realized they are not who they were told. Their stories have sparked a reckoning that is rocking the international adoption industry, which was built in South Korea and spread around the world. European countries have launched investigations and halted international adoption. The South Korean government has accepted a fact-finding commission under pressure from adoptees, and hundreds have submitted their cases for review. The AP investigation, done in collaboration with Frontline (PBS), was based on interviews with more than 80 adoptees in the U.S., Australia and six European countries, along with parents, agency employees, humanitarian workers and government officials. It also drew on more than 100 information requests and thousands of pages of documents — including many never publicly seen before and some the AP got declassified — from courts, archives, government files and adoption papers. In dozens of cases AP examined with Frontline, it found: Children were kidnapped off the streets and sent abroad. Parents claim they were told their newborns were dead or too sick to survive, only to have them shipped away. Documents were fabricated to give children identities that belonged to somebody else, leading adoptees to anguished reunions with supposed parents — to later discover they were not related at all. The agencies and governments each played a part in keeping the baby pipeline pumping. Adoption agencies created a competitive market for children and paid hospitals to supply them, documents show. The South Korean government not only knew of fraudulent practices but designed laws to speed up the exportation of children it deemed undesirable. Western governments turned a blind eye, sometimes even pressuring South Korea for children, while promoting the narrative that they were saving orphans with no other options. Calabretta doesn’t believe he was saved; he believes he was stolen. And many in his network of adult adoptees believe they were, too. Advocates say the vast majority of adoptions are honest and end well. But it is impossible to know how many adoptions are fraudulent because unreliable documents prevent adoptees from finding their birth families and learning the truth. Government data obtained by AP shows less than a fifth of 15,000 adoptees like Calabretta, who have asked South Korea for help with family searches since 2012, have managed to reunite with relatives. In 2019, a Korean government agency told Calabretta they had found his father. He pictured himself as a rock on a beach, with two waves crashing over it. The first was joy — he had been loved. The other was fury that something profound had been taken from him. 'You’re constantly in flux between two worlds,' he said, 'the one you could have and should have been in, and the one where you are.' 'A baby factory' Adoptions from South Korea peaked in the 1980s, fueled by the government, just as Calabretta’s parents arrived at the hospital with a blanket in which to carry their firstborn son home. The adoption industry had grown out of the wreckage of the Korean War in the 1950s, when Americans took in the unwanted biracial children born of Korean women and Western soldiers. As it clawed its way out of post-war poverty, South Korea continued to rely on private adoption agencies as its social safety net, bringing millions of dollars into the economy and saving even more by never building its own child welfare program. Meanwhile, in the West, the number of adoptable babies plummeted because of access to birth control and abortion. The desires of two cultures collided: couples in wealthy nations desperately wanted babies, and South Korea desperately wanted to rid itself of mouths to feed. As the supply of biracial babies dwindled, South Korea turned to those it saw as unwelcome citizens: fully-Korean children of poor families and unwed mothers. Korean officials fit their laws to match American ones to make children adoptable for what some deride as 'baby diplomacy' to satisfy Western demand. The government endorsed 'proxy adoptions,' for families to adopt children quickly without ever visiting Korea, meeting them by the planeloads at American airports. In an internal memo from 1966 obtained by AP, International Social Service, a Geneva-based organization, wrote that it suspected the Korean government assessed agencies not by child welfare standards, but by the money they brought in. 'There is quite a bit of rivalry and competition among the different agencies, and it is not beyond agencies to bribe or pressure mothers for the release of these children, and not beyond agencies to try to compete with each other for the same child,' officials noted in the document, now at the agency’s archives at the University of Minnesota Libraries. In 1976, Patricia Nye, east Asia director for ISS, concluded in a memo that the South Korean government was 'entirely irresponsible.' What was happening, she wrote, was 'close to being scandalous, the mass exportation of children, Korea has been called a baby factory.' Nye, who has died, said publicly on a BBC program called 'A Traffic in Babies,' that Korean adoptions had 'gone out of control.' 'We are not talking about little pets or pieces of wood,' Nye said into the camera. 'It’s almost like a trade in children … Asian children flowing from Asia to Europe and North America.' The Korean government tried to downplay the concerns. Documents reveal an official insisted the show — which described the country’s adoption program as 'baby wholesaling' — actually depicted it as 'organized and well-managed.' In December 1976, the government facilitated a new law that widened the legal definition of adoptable children, removed judicial oversight and granted vast powers to the heads of private agencies. The government empowered four agencies to handle most adoptions: Holt Children’s Services, which had pioneered sending Korean children to the U.S., and three others, Eastern Social Welfare Society, Korea Welfare Services and Korea Social Service. A 1983 Health Ministry audit cited all four agencies and accused Holt of providing larger-than-allowed payments to impoverished birth mothers. The ministry’s response was to issue a 'warning.' Records show that officials were aware of a laundry list of dubious practices in the industry: lost children were documented as abandoned; the origins of alleged orphans weren’t verified; some were 'disguised' by agencies as being born from unwed mothers to make them adoptable, according to Health Ministry records seen by AP. In the early 1980s, the government itself likened the agencies’ child-hunting practices to 'trafficking.' At a meeting in 1982, documents show, the ministry admitted to child 'intake' problems and cautioned agencies to improve their practices to avoid the appearance of 'trafficking, profiteering.' Yet the government still called for 'as many adoptions as possible.' Calabretta was taken from the Red Cross Hospital in Daegu in 1986. His father, Lee Sung-soo, said an administrator told him his son had serious lung and heart problems. The family didn’t have a lot of money. The only option, the administrator said, was a high-risk and very expensive surgery that could leave the baby dead or severely disabled. She advised Lee to relinquish his son to Holt, which would pay for the surgery and find a home for a disabled child if he survived. Lee said he signed the paper, believing it was the only way to save his son, and wept. The AP could not verify Lee’s account — the hospital closed and its records were destroyed. Information obtained through a records request show that 470 children born in that hospital were adopted during the 80s and 90s. 'It felt like the sky was falling,' Lee said. 'I felt like my heart was being ripped apart.' By then, agencies were procuring most of their children directly from hospitals and maternity homes, which often received illegal payments for babies, records show. Though the stated intention of adoption was to spare children from orphanages, they gathered more than 4,600 children from hospitals in 1988, 60% of their supply. 'In paying rewards for childbirth delivery costs to hospitals, maternity homes, local administrative offices and others when acquiring children for adoption,' the Health Ministry wrote in 1988, 'the social welfare institutions (agencies) have lost their morality and have descended to become trafficking institutions.' A government audit the following year shows that Holt made nearly 100 illegal payments to hospitals during six months in 1988, worth about $16,000 now. Eastern Social Welfare Society gave even more, now worth about $64,000, to hospitals over that period. The South Korean government declined to answer questions about its responsibility for the past, saying it will let the fact-finding commission finish its work. In a statement, the Health Ministry acknowledged that skyrocketing adoptions in the 1970s-80s were possibly driven by an intent to reduce welfare spending to balance cuts in foreign aid. Lee Moo-ja, a retired local official in Boryeong city, recalled a sense of helplessness during the 1980s. Abandoned children were supposed to be reported to city officials, who would assign them to an orphanage, she said. But instead, agencies were directly scooping them up, and the pleading letters she sent to hospitals went nowhere. The national government wasn’t interested in enforcement, she said, leaving local officials like her powerless to stop it. Calabretta’s parents felt powerless too; they got onto an elevator with other couples holding their newborn children. All they had was the empty blanket. ___ 'Is this really all for children?' With the government on their side, agencies raced against time for children. Employees were told to process them as quickly as they could, said two former adoption workers who spoke anonymously because Korean law forbids them from publicizing confidential information. 'All I heard was work faster, faster,' said one, employed at an agency from 1979 to 1984. 'Do it faster and faster.' Even now, the woman clenches her hands and clutches a pillow as she said she convinced herself they were saving orphans. She couldn’t help but quietly wonder: 'Is this really all for children?' Agencies had intake workers scour every region of the country for children, she said. They invested 'zero effort' in confirming a child was truly orphaned. She questioned whether dubious practices were baked into the system, from beginning to end. A colleague once brought in a girl allegedly abandoned in Daegu, about 145 miles away from Seoul. She refused to process the girl for adoption because she thought it was too soon to conclude she was abandoned. Not long after, the Daegu worker sent the same girl again, with the same photo — but a new name and background story that claimed she’d been abandoned earlier. The former worker said she never learned whether the girl was adopted. Some lost children ended up overseas. Laurie Bender was approached by a strange woman while playing in the front yard in South Korea in 1975. She remembers the woman saying that Bender’s family didn’t want her anymore because her mother had another baby. She went with the woman, and felt so sad she thought she might die. Bender says she was 4, but Korea calculates birthdays differently and her records say she was 6. Every day, her mother, Han Tae-soon, went to police stations, government offices, adoption agencies. Every night, she slept with a picture of her missing daughter. That picture was displayed everywhere — in subway stations, on lamp posts, on bags of snacks that advertised missing children, the Korean version of American milk cartons. But Bender was on the other side of the globe — sent by Holt to an American family who believed she was an orphan. The U.S. took in the highest number of orphans by far, and to be eligible for a visa, they had to have lost one or both parents to death, disappearance or abandonment. The agencies seized on the word abandonment, applying it to most of the children they acquired. Records from 1980 to 1987 show that more than 90% of the Korean children sent to the West almost certainly had known relatives, said Philsik Shin, a scholar at Korea’s Anyang University. The number of children sent for adoption was often more than 10 times higher than the police count for abandoned children, he found — close to 9,000 in 1985. Listing children as abandoned made adoptions easier because agencies didn’t have to verify child origins or obtain parental relinquishment. It was 'almost customary' to document children as abandoned, said Helen Noh, who matched hundreds of children with U.S. parents at Holt Children’s Services from 1981 to 1982. Now a scholar at Seoul’s Soongsil University, Noh said Holt workers understood the agency was charging adopters about $3,000 per child. 'My salary was 240,000 won, which is like less than $200 a month,' Noh said. 'If you send one child … that amount could pay at least one worker for the whole year.' Documents obtained by AP show that agencies were likely charging even more, around $4,000 to $6,000. But they pocketed some of that money through improper means, such as charging for travel expenses for adoption workers but arranging for commercial passengers to carry babies instead. Workers tried to meet specific requests from adoptive families. Some asked for siblings, Noh said, so she and her colleagues would compete over the small number of twins in their networks. Another former worker, employed at two agencies from the 1970s to early 1990s, said anybody facing challenges in raising their children would be strongly encouraged to give them away. 'Many of the children we gathered would have stayed with their biological parents with a little help,' the former worker said. 'But what we heard (from management) was always the same – if we don’t take that child, another adoption agency will.' Private counseling records in a 1988 Holt document obtained by AP show that some parents who relinquished their children soon pleaded for them back. The agency’s workers told them that their children would thrive under good Western parents and may return home someday rich or 'with Ph.Ds.' In one case, a mother returned and asked to see her son. The boy was still in Seoul, but a Holt worker told the mother he’d been flown to the U.S. 'After being told the lie,' the worker wrote, 'the birth mother began to regain her peace of mind as expected.' Susan Soonkeum Cox, who long worked for Holt International, the Oregon-based U.S. arm of the Holt adoption network, denied widespread problems. She said the goal was always to find good homes for children who would have otherwise grown up in orphanages. 'Has there been some activity that shouldn’t have happened? Probably. We’re human and everybody is different. There’s good social workers, there’s bad social workers, there’s good employees, bad employees,' she said. 'But…the accusation of systemic, deliberate wrongdoing, that I reject.' The Seoul-based Holt Children’s Services, which split from the American agency in the 1970s, and the three other Korean agencies declined to comment on specific cases. Holt Korea has in recent years denied accusations of wrongdoing and attributed adoptee complaints to misunderstandings and Korea’s social welfare issues. Kim Jin Sook, president of Eastern, has said the agency carried out government policies to find homes for 'discarded children.' But some other agencies on the ground started closing their programs because of ethical concerns. In the 1970s, Francis Carlin ran South Korea’s Catholic Relief Services, which facilitated about 30 adoptions a month, compared to hundreds by the larger agencies. The demand from the West was intense, and there weren’t enough legitimate orphans to feed it, he said, leading to 'a lot of the compromises, a lot of the hanky panky.' The larger agencies toured orphanages, grabbing up healthy babies and leaving older and disabled children, he said. 'These, I would call them brokers, were going out and trying to get more and more children,' Carlin said when reached by AP. 'They would put the legitimate parent on a guilt trip and say, what are you doing? You can’t afford to take care of this child…. Why don’t you just step back and let them have a better life? You’re so selfish.' One Korean social worker expressed disgust in words so crushing they stuck with Carlin all these years: 'It’s sickening, just sickening.' Catholic Relief Services ceased its adoption program in 1974. Carlin remembers standing up at a meeting of humanitarian organizations: 'We are beginning to slide into the abyss,' he said. Four decades later, Laurie Bender took a DNA test because her own daughter was curious about their heritage. In 2019, she got a call: 'Your mother has been looking for you.' Bender dropped the phone. 'It’s like a hole in your heart has been healed, you finally feel like a complete person,' Bender said. 'It’s like you’ve been living a fake life and everything you know is not true.' Bender and her daughter flew to South Korea just weeks later. Her mother, Han Tae-soon, wore her best outfit and lipstick for the first time in a long time. She recognized her daughter immediately in the airport and ran to her, screaming, moaning, running her fingers through her hair. Han, who is in her 70s, has notebooks feverishly annotated with English translations, written during countless hours trying to learn her daughter’s language. Amid the photos of her children on her living room wall is a black-and-white one of Bender as a little girl, stuck in time. Han plans to sue the South Korean government and Holt for robbing them of ever having a real relationship. 'I feel like I am dying. I really am dying,' she said. 'There’s so little time for me.' She jabbed her finger at paperwork that sent her daughter away. 'Isn’t this a government seal?' she demanded. 'Why did you make this up and sell away other people’s children?' ___ This story is part of an ongoing investigation led by The Associated Press in collaboration with FRONTLINE (PBS). The investigation includes an interactive and the upcoming documentary South Korea’s Adoption Reckoning, premiering Sept. 20 on PBS &amp; online. —- Switched identities This system turned children into people with no history, no parents, no ties. Many adoptees will never know the basic facts of their lives — their birthdays, their birth parents, if they were wanted or truly abandoned — because their documents are false. Robyn Joy Park, adopted to the United States, cherished her documents so much that she tattooed her adoption number — 82C-1320 — on her back. It was her only tether to her motherland. Those documents said she was a girl named Park Joo Young, born in Busan in August 1982, and her unmarried mother couldn’t afford to keep her. In 2007, Park traveled to Korea to meet the woman that her adoption agency, Eastern, listed as her mother. Their bond deepened slowly over years. They visited relatives, held hands, shared hotel rooms — the mother spoonfed her rice. The woman’s son changed his name to Park Joon Young, to share the 'Young' syllable in line with Korean naming traditions for siblings. Five years passed. Park asked the woman to take a DNA test in the hope of finding her father. They were not related. She was not Park Joo Young — she was another, unknown, girl. 'I really was so hurt and stunned and devastated and incredibly angry,' Park said. 'I could only imagine what it was like for her.' She lost touch with the woman, although she remains in contact with the man she considered her brother. Her agency offered her nothing but an apology, and declined to comment when reached by AP. Her story is not uncommon. When children processed for adoption died, became too sick to travel or were found by their biological families, agencies often replaced them with other children instead of redoing the process from scratch, according to former adoption workers. At a meeting with an adoptee in 2021 where AP was present, a longtime worker said Western partner agencies were willing to take 'any child of the same sex and similar age, because it would take too much time to start over again.' The AP has spoken to 10 others who found that their identity was switched with someone else. One of them, Mia Sang Jørnø, raised in Denmark, developed a close relationship with the family of the man listed as her father by her agency, Korea Social Service. She attended his funeral in 2000, even joining relatives as they received guests through the traditional three-day mourning procession. He had given her the name of her mother, and she worked up the courage to contact her. They took a DNA test. They weren’t related. The agency told her that her paperwork was mistaken, and she wasn’t even the girl named on her documents, Park Sang Ok. She was Kim Eun-hye. She had mourned a father who wasn’t hers. 'I always have this kind of restlessness, she said, 'of just not knowing that part of me, my identity.' KSS did not respond to questions. In letters seen by AP and Frontline, the agency has admitted to adoptees that the stories on their paperwork were invented to get the adoptions through. 'I would like to apologize for the wrong information in your adoption paper,' a KSS worker wrote to a Danish adoptee in 2016. 'It was made up just for adoption procedure.' The worker could not be reached by AP. In 2022, the agency emailed another adoptee that their 'real background is different' than listed, apologizing that the discrepancy might 'confuse' them. Neither Park nor Jørnø ever found their real parents. They both think often of the girls whose identities they were given, and wonder: What happened to her? ___ 'We were supposed to be a happy family' The Korean government cracked down on the adoption industry when the 1988 Olympics brought attention to the baby trade as a national shame. The Health Ministry instructed agencies to 'improve' their practices and stop 'touring' hospitals and orphanages to gather children, according to a document obtained by AP. They were told they could be punished if they continued to 'competitively engage in unlawful practices.' Adoptions plummeted, from around 8,000 a year in the mid-1980s to around 2,000 a year in the 1990s. But tens of thousands of children were already overseas, including Calabretta. Hospital officials told Calabretta’s mother to assume he had died. She went to a temple three times to offer a Buddhist ceremony to bless the soul of the dead. The documents that went with him to the U.S. in 1986 described him as a 'normal healthy baby, adoptable,' born to an unwed mother, and made no mention of a surgery. Calabretta returned to South Korea in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. His father, Lee Sung-soo, could not wait out the two-week quarantine and showed up outside the apartment the next day. Calabretta threw open the window. 'Dad!' he shouted. 'My son!' Lee shouted back. 'We were supposed to be a happy family, not separated. He was my precious firstborn son,' Lee said. 'For over 30 years, he lived in a foreign land against his will. That makes my heart break.' Calabretta visits South Korea often, and they talk on the phone every few days. He has the same odd divot in his ear as his mother, the same laugh as his father, the same taste in shoes and jackets and music, the same allergies. All those years, Calabretta’s mother kept the blanket she’d carried empty out of the hospital, a symbol of the absence where her son should be. He asked her to rename him, to reclaim him, as her son and a son of Korea. In Korea, there is a sentiment that something isn’t truly yours until you name it, and once you do, you must take care of it. So he prefers his new name now: Hanil Lee. ___ AP reporter Lori Hinnant and researcher Rhonda Shafner and Frontline's Lora Moftah and Emily Sternlicht contributed to this report. ___ COMING TOMORROW: The role of the West Robert Calabretta blames not just South Korea but also the United States for taking him away from his parents and adopting him out to an American family. 'What higher trophy is it of domination than taking one’s children and carting them off?' he asked. 'The audacity of that. And it’s all tied in a bow of, ‘you must feel so lucky that you’re adopted.’' Western governments turned a blind eye to rampant fraud and pressured the South Korean government to keep the kids coming, an Associated Press investigation has found.	https://apnews.com/article/south-korea-international-adoption-fraud-investigation-e4e7d4b8823212e3b260517c5128cd66	2024-09-18T19:20:20-07:00	
A gold mining town in Congo has become an mpox hot spot as a new strain spreads	KAMITUGA, Congo (AP) — Slumped on the ground over a mound of dirt, Divine Wisoba pulled weeds from her daughter’s grave. The 1-month-old died from mpox in eastern Congo in August, but Wisoba, 21, was too traumatized to attend the funeral. In her first visit to the cemetery, she wept into her shirt for the child she lost and worried about the rest of her family. 'When she was born, it was as if God had answered our prayers — we wanted a girl,' Wisoba said of little Maombi Katengey. 'But our biggest joy was transformed into devastation.' Her daughter is one of more than 6,000 people officials suspect have contracted the disease in South Kivu province, the epicenter of the world’s latest mpox outbreak, in what the World Health Organization has labeled a global health emergency. A new strain of the virus is spreading, largely through skin-to-skin contact, including but not limited to sex. A lack of funds, vaccines and information is making it difficult to stem the spread, according to alarmed disease experts. Mpox — which causes mostly mild symptoms like fever and body aches, but can trigger serious cases with prominent blisters on the face, hands, chest and genitals — had been spreading mostly undetected for years in Africa, until a 2022 outbreak reached more than 70 countries. Globally, gay and bisexual men made up the vast majority of cases in that outbreak. But officials note mpox has long disproportionately affected children in Africa, and they say cases are now rising sharply among kids, pregnant women and other vulnerable groups, with many types of close contact responsible for the spread. Health officials have zeroed in on Kamituga, a remote yet bustling gold mining town of some 300,000 people that attracts miners, sex workers and traders who are constantly on the move. Cases from other parts of eastern Congo can be traced back here, officials say, with the first originating in the nightclub scene. Since this outbreak began, one year ago, nearly 1,000 people in Kamituga have been infected. Eight have died, half of them children. Challenges on the ground Last month, the World Health Organization said mpox outbreaks might be stopped in the next six months, with governments' leadership and cooperation. But in Kamituga, people say they face a starkly different reality. There's a daily average of five new cases at the general hospital, which is regularly near capacity. Overall in South Kivu, weekly new suspected cases have skyrocketed from about 12 in January to 600 in August, according to province health officials. Even that’s likely an underestimate, they say, because of a lack of access to rural areas, the inability of many residents to seek care, and Kamituga’s transient nature. Locals say they simply don’t have enough information about mpox. Before her daughter got sick, Wisoba said, she was infected herself but didn’t know it. Painful lesions emerged around her genitals, making walking difficult. She thought she had a common sexually transmitted infection and sought medicine at a pharmacy. Days later, she went to the hospital with her newborn and was diagnosed with mpox. She recovered, but her daughter developed lesions on her foot. Nearly a week later, Maombi died at the same hospital that treated her mother. Wisoba said she didn't know about mpox until she got it. She wants the government to invest more in teaching people protective measures. Local officials can't reach areas more than a few miles outside Kamituga to track suspected cases or inform residents. They broadcast radio messages but say that doesn't reach far enough. Kasindi Mwenyelwata goes door to door describing how to detect mpox — looking for fevers, aches or lesions. But the 42-year-old community leader said a lack of money means he doesn't have the right materials, such as posters showing images of patients, which he finds more powerful than words. ALIMA, one of the few aid groups working on mpox in Kamituga, lacks funds to set up programs or clinics that would reach some 150,000 people, with its budget set to run out at year's end, according to program coordinator Dr. Dally Muamba. If support keeps waning and mpox spreads, he said, 'there will be an impact on the economy, people will stop coming to the area as the epidemic takes its toll. ... And as the disease grows, will resources follow?' The vaccine vacuum Health experts agree: What’s needed most are vaccines — even if they go only to adults, under emergency approval in Congo. None has arrived in Kamituga, though it’s a priority city in South Kivu, officials said. It’s unclear when or how they will. The main road into town is unpaved — barely passable by car during the ongoing rainy season. Once they make it here, it’s unclear whether supply will meet demand for those who are at greatest risk and first in line: health staff, sex workers, miners and motorcycle taxi drivers. Congo’s government has budgeted more than $190 million for its initial mpox response, which includes the purchase of 3 million vaccine doses, according to a draft national mpox plan, widely circulating among health experts and aid groups this month and seen by The Associated Press. But so far, just 250,000 doses have arrived in Congo and the government’s given only $10 million, according to the finance ministry. Most people with mild cases recover in less than two weeks. But lesions can get infected, and children or immunocompromised people are more prone to severe cases. Doctors can ensure lesions are clean and give pain medication or antibiotics for secondary infections such as sepsis. But those who recover can get the virus again. A new variant, a lack of understanding Experts say a lack of resources and knowledge about the new strain makes it difficult to advise people on protecting themselves. An internal report circulated among aid groups and agencies and seen by AP labeled confidence in the available information about mpox in eastern Congo and neighboring countries low. While the variant is known to be more easily transmissible through sex, it’s unclear how long the virus remains in the system. Doctors tell recovered patients to abstain from sex for three months, but acknowledge the number’s largely arbitrary. 'Studies haven’t clarified if you’re still contagious or not ... if you can or can’t have sex with your wife,' said Dr. Steven Bilembo, of Kamituga’s general hospital. Doctors say they're seeing cases they simply don’t understand, such as pregnant women losing babies. Of 32 pregnant women infected since January, nearly half lost the baby through miscarriage or stillbirth, hospital statistics show. Alice Neema was among them. From the hospital's isolation ward, she told AP she'd noticed lesions around her genitals and a fever — but didn’t have enough money to travel the 30 miles (50 kilometers) on motorbike for help in time. She miscarried after her diagnosis. As information trickles in, locals say fear spreads alongside the new strain. Diego Nyago said he'd brought his 2-year-old son, Emile, to the hospital for circumcision when he developed a fever and lepasions. It was mpox — and today, Nyago is grateful he was already at the hospital. 'I didn’t believe that children could catch this disease,' he said as doctors gently poured water over the boy to bring his temperature down. 'Some children die quickly, because their families aren’t informed. 'Those who die are the ones who stay at home.' ___ AP reporters Jean-Yves Kamale in Kinshasa, Congo, and Maria Cheng in London contributed. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.

Harris hopes to turn Ukraine war into winning issue in battle with Trump for Polish American votes	HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — Democrats are stepping up their outreach to Polish Americans in this year's presidential election as Kamala Harris and Donald Trump vie for support from a community that could play a decisive role in razor-thin battleground state contests. Harris hopes to capitalize on Polish Americans' historic animosity toward Russia and on Trump's hesitancy to back Ukraine during last week's debate. The Democratic vice president's team organized a national call with Polish American supporters on Wednesday to encourage local networks to hold their own events and spread the campaign's message. Although Polish Americans are not a particularly large demographic, many of them live in the so-called 'blue wall' states that are critical to victory for either candidate. There are an estimated 784,000 in Michigan, 758,000 in Pennsylvania and 481,000 in Wisconsin, three places that Harris is visiting this week. 'We’re talking about an election where a swing of a few thousand voters in any of those states could make all the difference,' said Tom Malinowski, a Polish-born former Democratic congressman from New Jersey. Filip Jotevski, the newly hired point person for networking with diaspora and ethnic communities, said on Wednesday's Harris organizing call that if Trump returns to power 'he'll sell out Ukraine' after spending years 'cozying up to Vladimir Putin.' Trump, for his part, is slated to visit a Polish American shrine in Pennsylvania on Sunday for the unveiling of a monument to the anti-communist Solidarity movement. The Republican candidate will be there at the same time as Polish President Andrzej Duda. The Polish American community was pushed into the spotlight during the Sept. 10 debate in Philadelphia, when Trump twice refused to say whether he wanted Ukraine to win the war against Russia. 'Negotiate a deal,' Trump said. 'Because we have to stop all of these human lives from being destroyed.' Harris fired back that if Trump had been president when the invasion took place, 'Putin would be sitting in Kyiv with his eyes on the rest of Europe.' 'Why don’t you tell the 800,000 Polish Americans right here in Pennsylvania how quickly you would give up,' she said. Some were surprised yet pleased to hear their community mentioned on the debate stage. 'She knew what she was talking about,' said Tony Pol, a 67-year-old retired fire chief in Erie, Pennsylvania, who spent a quarter century helping run a Polish American fraternal organization. 'I think that’s the concern of everybody — if Ukraine goes down, then Poland goes next, and that’s very concerning.' Gosia Dodi, originally from Poland and now an American citizen living in western Michigan, said she 'absolutely agrees' with Harris that Russia could target Poland if Ukraine loses. The 61-year-old described Trump's affection for Putin as 'dangerous for Poland.' 'I want the war over, but not the way he’s saying,' she said. 'He thinks he can fix everything within one day or something, which is ridiculous.' After Poland was devastated in World War II, the country spent decades as a satellite state of the Soviet Union. A revolution ended communist rule in 1989, paving the way for the country's modern multiparty democracy. Poland became a NATO member in 1999. Timothy L. Kuzma, a Pittsburgh resident who leads the Polish Falcons of America, a fraternal organization with 19th-century roots in Chicago’s large Polish immigrant community, said his community's voters want to see a candidate that's committed to strong transatlantic bonds. 'If either candidate doesn’t give those kinds of assurances, that’s problematic,' he said. 'The candidates, both parties, have to pledge their support to Poland, to Ukraine, to NATO and to the overall security of Eastern Europe — and that’s all of Eastern Europe — and Europe as well.' Trump has previously suggested withdrawing the United States from NATO, which would devastate the alliance, and he’s demanded that allies increase their defense spending to reduce the burden on Washington. If they didn't, Trump warned, the U.S. would not uphold its treaty obligations and 'would encourage them' — meaning Russia — 'to do whatever the hell they want.' Pete Alibali, 53, immigrated from Soviet-controlled Poland when he was 16, because his mother, a chemist, wanted to advance her career without becoming a communist party member. A lifelong Democrat who now lives in Madison, Wisconsin, Alibali views Putin as a 'predator and a continuation of the Soviets.' Beyond his concern for his native Poland, he worries that tiny Baltic nations could also be threatened if Ukraine is defeated. Alibali acknowledged that many Polish Americans are conservative, growing up reading Polish newspapers, working in Polish-owned businesses, listening to Polish radio and attending their neighborhood Catholic church. He described his uncle, who lives in Chicago, as a 'very rabid Trump supporter.' 'Trump divided my family,' Alibali said. Polish American voters have swung back and forth between Democrats and Republicans in presidential elections over the years. They supported Trump in 2016 but backed President Joe Biden in 2020. Malinowski said Trump's visit to the shrine 'shows that he’s nervous that he might be losing ground among a group of voters that he may have taken for granted.' He also downplayed any suggestion of friendship between Trump and Duda, a right-wing politician who once suggested renaming a military base in his country as Fort Trump. 'I know the Poles are nervous,' he said. 'The advice they’re getting is, cultivate Trump just in case. They’re doing it with fingers crossed.' Tom Kolano, a 55-year-old Republican in suburban Pittsburgh whose ancestors were Polish immigrants, said he's encouraged by Trump's relationship with Duda. 'I’m not worried that President Trump will abandon Ukraine,' Kolano said. 'Here’s one big reason — I think Poland will have a lot to say about that.' He pointed out that Duda and his political rival, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, used a visit to Washington in March to press a divided Congress to break its impasse over replenishing funds for Ukraine at a critical moment in the war. John Laka, 66, of Appleton, Wisconsin, believes that Trump will be stronger overall on foreign policy than Harris. 'I just don’t have a lot of confidence in her as a leader or president,' he said. 'She’s just really lacking.' Laka's parents immigrated to the United States from Poland, and he's not sure how much the country is really imperiled by Russia. 'The threat of Putin going further is always going to be there unless there’s that idea of deterrence and right now we’re not deterring going anywhere,' he said. ___ Megerian reported from Washington.

Colombia suspends peace talks with ELN rebel group after a deadly attack on the military	BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) — Colombia on Wednesday suspended peace talks with the National Liberation Army, or ELN, after blaming the rebel group for an attack that killed two soldiers and injured more than 20. 'Today the dialogue process is suspended,' said the government’s peace delegation in a statement. 'Its viability is severely damaged, and its continuity can only be recovered with an unequivocal manifestation of the ELN’s will for peace.' This is the deepest crisis of the peace negotiations with the ELN since November 2022 and after President Gustavo Petro took power as the first leftist president launching talks with that and other armed groups under a policy known as total peace. The National Liberation Army, or ELN, ended a cease-fire with the Colombian government in August, but was still involved in peace talks aimed at ending more than five decades of conflict. The army said Tuesday that the group fired homemade rockets from a cargo truck that had been parked near a base in Puerto Jordan, a small town in Arauca province. The rebel group has not claimed responsibility for the attack. The ELN was founded in the 1960s by union leaders and university students inspired by the Cuban Revolution. The group has an estimated 6,000 fighters in Colombia and Venezuela and finances itself through drug trafficking and illegal gold mines. Recently the ELN has been spreading into rural areas abandoned by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, the large rebel group that made a peace deal with Colombia’s government in 2016. The attack on Tuesday left two soldiers killed and 26 wounded, according to the latest report from Defense Minister Iván Velásquez. Most of the wounded were airlifted to a military hospital in Bogotá, Colombia's capital, where Petro visited them on Wednesday. According to the hospital’s medical report, 13 remain hospitalized in 'stable condition,' most with soft tissue injuries, while five are in the intensive care unit. Authorities announced on Wednesday a reward of up to $23,700 for information leading to the capture of those responsible for the attack. They also confirmed a reward of up to $948,000 for the main leaders of the ELN. Petro compared the attack in Arauca to another carried out by the ELN in 2019 against a police school in Bogotá that killed 22 people died and dozens injured. That assault led also to the suspension of the peace talks of the rebel group with the government of Iván Duque, president from 2018 to 2022. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america	https://apnews.com/article/colombia-eln-rebels-ceasefire-petro-387caf06b740869e2087eb3b90934393	2024-09-18T18:59:41-07:00	
Stock market today: Asian markets forge higher after Fed's first rate cut in over 4 years	Asian markets forged higher on Thursday after the Federal Reserve kicked off its efforts to prevent a recession in the U.S. with a bigger-than-usual cut to interest rates. In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 index jumped 2.5% to 37,284.43. Hong Kong's Hang Seng gained 1% to 17,840.93. The Shanghai Composite index climbed 0.8% to 2,738.19, while Taiwan's Taiex was up 1%. South Korea's index was an outlier, losing 0.3% to 2,566.65. The Bank of Japan and the Bank of England are also holding monetary policy meetings this week. Neither central bank is expected to move on rates, though the language of what the officials say could be an indicator of later moves and still influence markets. Because the Fed's half-percentage point rate cut was so well telegraphed and because markets had already climbed so much in anticipation, Wall Street’s reactions to the 180-degree turn on its policy rate were relatively muted. 'Markets barely reacted to the Fed’s 50 (basis point) rate cut, on balance, and our base case is that further cuts won’t move the needle too much either,' Thomas Mathews of Capital Economics said in a commentary. It was the first cut to the federal funds rate in over four years, ending a stretch where the Fed kept rates at a two-decade high to slow the U.S. economy enough to stifle the worst inflation in generations. On Wednesday, the S&amp;P 500 slipped 0.3%, closing at 5,618.26. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 0.2% to 41,503.10. The Nasdaq composite lost 0.3% to 17,573.30. The momentous move by the Fed helps financial markets in two big ways. It eases the brakes off the economy, which has been slowing under the weight of higher rates, and it gives a boost to prices for all kinds of investments. Besides stocks, gold and bond prices had already rallied in recent months on expectations that rate cuts were coming. Now that inflation has eased significantly from its peak two summers ago and appears to be heading toward 2%, the Fed says it it can turn more of its attention toward protecting the slowing job market and overall economy. 'The time to support the labor market is when it’s strong and not when you begin to see the layoffs,' Fed Chair Jerome Powell said. 'That’s the situation we’re in.'

Kim calls for bolstering nuclear and conventional weapons after testing 2 types of missiles	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korea said Thursday that leader Kim Jong Un supervised successful tests of two types of missiles — one designed to carry a 'super-large conventional warhead' and the other likely for a nuclear warhead, as he ordered officials to bolster up his country’s military capabilities to repel United States-led threats. The tests appear to be the same as the multiple missile launches that neighboring countries said North Korea performed Wednesday, extending its run of weapons displays as confrontations with the U.S. and South Korea escalate. The official Korean Central News Agency said that Kim oversaw the launch of the country’s newly built Hwasongpho-11-Da-4.5 ballistic missile tipped with a dummy '4.5-ton super-large conventional warhead.' It said the test-firing was meant to verify an ability to accurately hit a 320 kilometer (200 mile) -range target, suggesting it’s a weapon aimed at striking sites in South Korea. KCNA said Kim also guided the launch of an improved 'strategic' cruise missile, a word implying the weapon was developed to carry a nuclear warhead. After the tests, Kim stressed the need to continue to 'bolster up the nuclear force' and acquire 'overwhelming offensive capability in the field of conventional weapons, too,' according to KCNA. It cited the Kim as saying that North Korea can thwart its enemies' intentions to invade only when it has strong military power. KCNA released photos of a missile hitting a ground target. South Korea's military said later Thursday it assessed that both ballistic and cruise missiles fired by North Korea the previous day landed in the North's mountainous northeastern region. North Korea typically test-launches missiles off its east coast, and it's highly unusual for the country to fire missiles at land targets likely because of concerns about potential damages on the ground if the weapons land in unintended areas. Jung Chang Wook, head of the Korea Defense Study Forum think tank in Seoul, said North Korea likely aims to show it's confident about the the accuracy of its new ballistic missile with a high-powered warhead meant to attack ground targets. But Jung said North Korea hasn't acquired weapons that can penetrate deep into the earth and destroy underground structures. The Hwasongpho-11-Da-4.5 ballistic missile's first known test occurred in early July. North Korea said the July test was successful as well, but South Korea's military disputed the claim saying one of the two missiles fired by North Korea travelled abnormally during the initial stage of its flight before falling at an uninhabited area near Pyongyang, the capital. North Korea hasn't released photos on the July launches. North Korea has been pushing to introduce a variety of sophisticated weapons systems designed to attack both South Korea and the mainland U.S. to deal with what it calls its rivals’ intensifying security threats. Many foreign experts say North Korea would ultimately want to use its enlarged arsenal as leverage to win greater concessions in future dealings with the U.S. Worries about North Korea deepened last week as it disclosed photos of a secretive facility built to enrich uranium for nuclear bombs. Since late May, North Korea has also floated thousands of trash-carrying balloons toward South Korea, prompting the South to resume anti-North loudspeaker broadcasts at border areas. ___ Follow AP’s Asia-Pacific coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/asia-pacific	https://apnews.com/article/north-korea-kim-missiles-39ac9c4a37ebc7c827651e4256add05b	2024-09-18T14:45:17-07:00

Families of Americans detained in China share their pain and urge US to get them home	WASHINGTON (AP) — The families of four Americans detained in China said Wednesday that their loved ones are suffering both physically and mentally, urging the U.S. government to take action to bring them home. Appearing before the Congressional-Executive Commission of China, the families of Kai Li, Mark Swidan, Dawn Michelle Hunt and Nelson Wells Jr. — all of whom have been detained in China for at least eight years — cast a spotlight on the longstanding issue that has gained new attention with the release this week of American pastor David Lin, who was behind bars for almost 20 years. More Americans are detained in China than in any other foreign country, according to the commission created by Congress to monitor human rights in the communist country. The panel has vowed to bring to light the harrowing stories of the other Americans detained in China and keep pressure on the Biden administration to act. 'This is American human rights being violated with impunity,' said Rep. Chris Smith, a New Jersey Republican who chairs the commission. At the hearing, Harrison Li said his father had suffered a stroke and lost a tooth and that he was largely locked in a cell for three years when China imposed draconian restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic. Kai Li is serving 10 years in a Shanghai jail on what rights groups say are trumped-up charges of spying and stealing state secrets. 'Everyday I wake up I shudder at the thought of him crammed in that tiny cell with anywhere from seven to 11 other people, no climate control, unable to sleep in the summer due to the heat, experiencing the mental and physical anguish,' Harrison Li said. He told the panel that it is time for his father to come home: 'So I ask President Biden, how much longer does he need to suffer?' Nelson Wells Sr. said his son, jailed in China since 2014 over what the family believes to have been unwitting drug possession, is suffering from 'debilitating chronic pain, seizures, malnutrition, internal issues, dental pain, severe depression and thoughts of self-harm.' He expressed frustration at the lack of progress to bring his son home. 'Please help our family by creating a pathway for outright release or prisoner transfer to a home prison,' Wells Sr. said. Tim Hunt, brother of Dawn Hunt, choked up when he asked the commission to help her. She's serving life in prison in the southern province of Guangdong after being arrested in 2014 and charged with drug smuggling, which she denies, the family said. Tim Hunt said his sister was tricked into believing she had won a contest that brought her to Hong Kong. He says she was taken to mainland China, where she was given designer purses before a flight to Australia without knowing illicit drugs were sewn into the linings. Dawn Hunt has developed ailments but has refused surgeries out of distrust, her brother said, adding that 'our citizens are being mistreated, abused — and it’s coordinated.' While Americans should be held liable for breaking the law in a foreign country, Beijing's legal practice and human rights records make judicial justice a far reach, said Sen. Jeff Merkley, an Oregon Democrat and the commission's co-chair. 'We know that even one American detained as a political prisoner in China is one too many,' Merkley said. Rep. Zach Nunn, an Iowa Republican, accused China of engaging in hostage diplomacy by 'warehousing American citizens for a time that they want to gain leverage against the United States.' The Chinese Embassy in Washington said China is ruled by law. 'The judicial authorities will handle the criminal suspects strictly in accordance with the law, treat them equally regardless of their nationality, and protect their legitimate rights and interests,' the embassy said in a statement. The U.S. State Department advises Americans to reconsider travel to China, citing 'the risk of wrongful detentions' as a reason for its second-highest travel alert. The hearing also showed a video by Katherine Swidan, mother of Mark Swidan, who said her son was suffering. He has been jailed in China for 12 years on a drug charge and, along with Li, is considered wrongfully detained by the State Department. In a statement, Katherine Swidan urged the U.S. government to act: 'I am pleading for my son’s life, his freedom and the chance to bring him home.' ___ AP writer Elsie Chen contributed from Washington.	https://apnews.com/article/china-detained-americans-congress-294b10f51d76c89af8c49f76b967ae00	2024-09-18T12:35:22-07:00	
Veteran CIA officer who drugged and sexually assaulted dozens of women gets 30 years in prison	WASHINGTON (AP) — A longtime CIA officer who drugged, photographed and sexually assaulted more than two dozen women in postings around the world was sentenced to 30 years in federal prison Wednesday after an emotional hearing in which victims described being deceived by a man who appeared kind, educated and part of an agency 'that is supposed to protect the world from evil.' Brian Jeffrey Raymond, with a graying beard and orange prison jumpsuit, sat dejectedly as he heard his punishment for one of the most egregious misconduct cases in the CIA’s history. It was chronicled in his own library of more than 500 images that showed him in some cases straddling and groping his nude, unconscious victims. 'It's safe to say he's a sexual predator,' U.S. Senior Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly said in imposing the full sentence prosecutors had requested. 'You are going to have a period of time to think about this.' Prosecutors say the 48-year-old Raymond’s assaults date to 2006 and tracked his career in Mexico, Peru and other countries, all following a similar pattern: He would lure women he met on Tinder and other dating apps to his government-leased apartment and drug them while serving wine and snacks. Once they were unconscious, he spent hours posing their naked bodies before photographing and assaulting them. He opened their eyelids at times and stuck his fingers in their mouths. One by one, about a dozen of Raymond’s victims who were identified only by numbers in court recounted how the longtime spy upended their lives. Some said they only learned what happened after the FBI showed them the photos of being assaulted while unconscious. 'My body looks like a corpse on his bed,' one victim said of the photos. 'Now I have these nightmares of seeing myself dead.' One described suffering a nervous breakdown. Another spoke of a recurring trance that caused her to run red lights while driving. Many told how their confidence and trust in others had been shattered forever. 'I hope he is haunted by the consequences of his actions for the rest of his life,' said one of the women, who like others stared Raymond down as they walked away from the podium. Reading from a statement, Raymond told the judge that he has spent countless hours contemplating his 'downward spiral.' 'It betrayed everything I stand for and I know no apology will ever be enough,' he said. 'There are no words to describe how sorry I am. That’s not who I am and yet it’s who I became.' Raymond’s sentencing comes amid a reckoning on sexual misconduct at the CIA. The Associated Press reported last week that another veteran CIA officer faces state charges in Virginia for allegedly reaching up a co-worker’s skirt and forcibly kissing her during a drunken party in the office. Still another former CIA employee — an officer trainee — is scheduled to face a jury trial next month on charges he assaulted a woman with a scarf in a stairwell at the agency’s Langley, Virginia, headquarters. That case emboldened some two dozen women to come forward to authorities and Congress with accounts of their own of sexual assaults, unwanted touching and what they contend are the CIA’s efforts to silence them. And yet the full extent of sexual misconduct at the CIA remains a classified secret in the name of national security, including a recent 648-page internal watchdog report that found systemic shortcomings in the agency’s handling of such complaints. 'The classified nature of the activities allowed the agency to hide a lot of things,' said Liza Mundy, author of 'Sisterhood: The Secret History of Women at the CIA.' The male-dominated agency, she said, has long been a refuge for egregious sexual misconduct. 'For decades, men at the top had free rein.' CIA has publicly condemned Raymond’s crimes and implemented sweeping reforms intended to keep women safe, streamline claims and more quickly discipline offenders. But a veil of secrecy still surrounds the Raymond case nearly four years after his arrest. Even after Raymond pleaded guilty late last year, prosecutors have tiptoed around the exact nature of his work and declined to disclose a complete list of the countries where he assaulted women. Still, they offered an unbridled account of Raymond’s conduct, describing him as a 'serial offender' whose assaults increased over time and become 'almost frenetic' during his final CIA posting in Mexico City, where he was discovered in 2020 after a naked woman screamed for help from his apartment balcony. U.S. officials scoured Raymond’s electronic devices and began identifying the victims he had listed by name and physical characteristics, all of whom described experiencing some form of memory loss during their time with him. One victim said Raymond seemed like a 'perfect gentleman' when they met in Mexico in 2020, recalling only that they kissed. Unbeknownst to the woman, after she blacked out, he took 35 videos and close-up photos of her breasts and genitals. 'The defendant’s manipulation often resulted in women blaming themselves for losing consciousness, feeling ashamed, and apologizing to the defendant,' prosecutors wrote in a court filing. 'He was more than willing to gaslight the women, often suggesting that the women drank too much and that, despite their instincts to the contrary, nothing had happened.' Raymond, a San Diego native and former White House intern who is fluent in Spanish and Mandarin, ultimately pleaded guilty to four of 25 federal counts including sexual abuse, coercion and transportation of obscene material. As part of his sentence, the judge ordered him to pay $10,000 to each of his 28 victims. Raymond’s attorneys had sought leniency, contending his 'quasi-military' work at the CIA in the years following 9/11 became a breeding ground for the emotional callousness and 'objectification of other people' that enabled his years of preying upon women. 'While he was working tirelessly at his government job, he ignored his own need for help, and over time he began to isolate himself, detach himself from human feelings and become emotionally numb,' defense attorney Howard Katzoff wrote in a court filing. 'He was an invaluable government worker, but it took its toll on him and sent him down a dark path.' ___ Goodman reported from Miami.

Lawyers question whether a drugged French woman was truly unconscious during alleged rapes	AVIGNON, France (AP) — Lawyers for some of the men accused of raping an unconscious French woman who had been drugged by her husband questioned her Wednesday about her habits, personal life and sex life, and even questioned whether she was truly unconscious during the encounters. Gisèle Pelicot's testimony came a day after her ex-husband, Dominique Pelicot, told the court that for nearly 10 years, he drugged her and invited dozens of men to rape her as she lay defenseless. She fiercely rejected any suggestion that she was anything but an unwitting victim. 'Since I’ve arrived in this courtroom, I’ve felt humiliated. I am treated like an alcoholic, an accomplice. ... I have heard it all,' she said at the start of the day's proceedings, breaking at times with the remarkable calm and stoicism she has shown throughout the often harrowing trial that has gripped France. Gisèle Pelicot, who was married to her husband for 50 years and shares three children with him, has become a hero to many rape victims and a symbol of the fight against sexual violence in France for waiving her anonymity in the case, letting the trial be public and appearing openly in front of the media. Her ex-husband and the 50 other men on trial, who range in age from 26 to 74, face up to 20 years in prison if convicted. Many of the defendants deny having raped Gisèle Pelicot. Some claim they were tricked by Dominique Pelicot, others say they believed she was consenting, and others argue that her husband’s consent was sufficient. Gisèle Pelicot and her lawyers say the preponderance of evidence -- thousands of videos and photos shot by her ex-husband of men having sex with her while she appeared to be unconscious -- should be enough to prove she was a victim and was entirely unaware of what Dominique Pelicot was subjecting her to from at least 2011 until 2020. But on Wednesday, defense lawyers focused their questions on the notion of consent and whether she was aware of what was happening at any point during some of the 90 sexual encounters that prosecutors believe were rapes. 'Don’t you have tendencies that you are not comfortable with?' one lawyer asked Gisèle Pelicot. 'I’m not even going to answer this question, which I find insulting,' she responded, her voice breaking. 'I understand why victims of rape don’t press charges. We really spill everything out into the open to humiliate the victim.' Another lawyer asked whether she was indeed unconscious during one of the encounters captured on video. 'I didn't give my consent to Mr. Pelicot or these men behind me for one second,' she said, referring to her ex-husband's co-defendants. 'In the state I was in, I could not respond to anybody. I was in a state of coma — the videos will attest to it.' The line of questioning upset her. 'Since when can a man decide for his wife?' she said, stressing that only one of her ex-husband's 50 co- defendants had refused his invitation to rape her. That man met Dominique Pelicot online and invited him to rape his own wife, who was also drugged, authorities contend. 'What are these men? Are they degenerates?' she said angrily. 'They have committed rapes. That's all I have to say.' Another questioned the time and date stamps on the videos, and whether she thought the sexual acts lasted as long as the stamps suggested. 'Rape is not a question of time,' she said. 'To talk of minutes, seconds. ... It does not matter how long they spent. It’s so degrading, humiliating what I am hearing in this room,' she said. At one point, Dominique Pelicot, who already said during the trial that all of the accusations against him are true, came out in support of his ex-wife, saying, 'Stop suspecting her all the time ... I did many things without her knowing.' On Tuesday, he testified that all of his co-defendants knew exactly what they were doing when he had them over, saying, 'They knew everything. They can’t say otherwise.'	https://apnews.com/article/pelicot-france-rape-trial-5033d9a6d00630f00592018eccc9236c	2024-09-18T11:28:47-07:00	
A war with Hezbollah may be looming. Is Israel prepared?	JERUSALEM (AP) — With Israel's defense minister announcing a 'new phase' of the war and an apparent Israeli attack setting off explosions in electronic devices in Lebanon, the specter of all-out combat between Israel and Hezbollah seems closer than ever before. Hopes for a diplomatic solution to the conflict appear to be fading quickly as Israel signals a desire to change the status quo in the country's north, where it has exchanged cross-border fire with Hezbollah since the Lebanese militant group began attacking on Oct. 8, a day after the war's opening salvo by Hamas. In recent days, Israel has moved a powerful fighting force up to the northern border, officials have escalated their rhetoric, and the country’s security Cabinet has designated the return of tens of thousands of displaced residents to their homes in northern Israel an official war goal. Here's a look at how Israel is preparing for a war with Lebanon: Troops drawn from Gaza to the northern border While the daily fighting between Israel and Hezbollah has escalated on several occasions, the bitter enemies have been careful to avoid an all-out war. That appears to be changing — especially after pagers, walkie-talkies, solar equipment and other devices exploded in Lebanon on Tuesday and Wednesday, killing at least 20 and wounding thousands in a sophisticated attack Hezbollah blamed on Israel. 'You don’t do something like that, hit thousands of people, and think war is not coming,' said retired Israeli Brig. Gen. Amir Avivi, who leads Israel Defense and Security Forum, a group of hawkish former military commanders. 'Why didn't we do it for 11 months? Because we were not willing to go to war yet. What’s happening now? Israel is ready for war.' As fighting in Gaza has slowed, Israel has fortified forces along the border with Lebanon, including the arrival this week of a powerful army division that took part in some of the heaviest fighting in Gaza. The 98th Division is believed to include thousands of troops, including paratrooper infantry units and artillery and elite commando forces specially trained for operations behind enemy lines. Their deployment was confirmed by an official with knowledge of the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss troop movements. The division played a key role in Gaza, spearheading the army's operations in the southern city of Khan Younis, a Hamas stronghold. The offensive inflicted heavy losses on Hamas fighters and tunnels, but also wreaked massive damage, sent thousands of Palestinians fleeing and resulted in scores of civilian deaths. Israel says Hamas endangers civilians by hiding in residential areas. The military also said it staged a series of drills this week along the border. 'The mission is clear,' said Maj. Gen. Ori Gordin, who heads Israel's Northern Command. 'We are determined to change the security reality as soon as possible.' A 'new phase’ of war The military movements have been accompanied by heightened rhetoric from Israel's leaders, who say their patience is running thin. Defense Minister Yoav Gallant on Wednesday night declared the start of a ' new phase' of the war as Israel turns its focus toward Hezbollah. 'The center of gravity is shifting to the north by diverting resources and forces,' he said. He spoke a day after Israel's Cabinet made the return of displaced residents to their homes in northern Israel a formal goal of the war. The move was largely symbolic — Israeli leaders have long pledged to bring those residents home. But elevating the significance of the aim signaled a tougher stance. After meeting Wednesday with top security officials, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared: 'We will return the residents of the north securely to their homes.' Netanyahu delivered a similarly tough message with a top U.S. envoy sent to the region this week to soothe tensions. An official with knowledge of the encounter told The Associated Press that the envoy, Amos Hochstein, told Netanyahu that intensifying the conflict with Hezbollah would not help return evacuated Israelis back home. Netanyahu, according to a statement from his office, told Hochstein that residents cannot return without 'a fundamental change in the security situation in the north.' The statement said that while Netanyahu 'appreciates and respects' U.S. support, Israel will 'do what is necessary to safeguard its security.' Is war inevitable? Israeli media reported Wednesday that the government has not yet decided whether to launch a major offensive in Lebanon. Much, it seems, will depend on Hezbollah's response. The group's leader, Hassan Nasrallah, is expected to deliver a major speech on Thursday. But public sentiment in Israel seems to be supportive of tougher action against Hezbollah. A poll in late August by the Israeli Democracy Institute, a Jerusalem think tank, found that 67% of Jewish respondents thought Israel should intensify its response to Hezbollah. That includes 46% of Jewish respondents who believed Israel should launch a deep offensive striking Lebanese infrastructure, and 21% who seek an intensified response that avoids striking Hezbollah infrastructure. 'There’s a lot of pressure from the society to go to war and win,' said Avivi, the retired general. 'Unless Hezbollah tomorrow morning says, ’OK, we got the message. We’re pulling out of south Lebanon,' war is imminent.' Such a war would almost certainly prove devastating to both sides. Already, more than 500 people have been killed in Lebanon by Israeli strikes since Oct. 8, most of them fighters with Hezbollah and other armed groups but also more than 100 civilians. In northern Israel, at least 23 soldiers and 26 civilians have been killed by strikes from Lebanon. Israel inflicted heavy damage on Lebanon during a monthlong war against Hezbollah in 2006 that ended in a stalemate. Israeli leaders have threatened even tougher action this time around, vowing to repeat the scenes of destruction from Gaza in Lebanon. But Hezbollah also has built up its capabilities since 2006. Hezbollah has an estimated 150,000 rockets and missiles, some believed to have guidance systems that could threaten sensitive targets in Israel. It has also developed an increasingly sophisticated fleet of drones. Capable of striking all parts of Israel, Hezbollah could bring life in Israel to a standstill and send hundreds of thousands of Israelis fleeing. ___ Associated Press Writer Natalie Melzer in Jerusalem contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-lebanon-hezbollah-pagers-hamas-gaza-war-df4c835ee3d1471e79d1a7fe951226bf	2024-09-18T11:15:01-07:00	
Haiti creates a provisional electoral council to prepare for the first elections since 2016	SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) — Haiti’s government on Wednesday created a provisional electoral council long sought by the international community to prepare the troubled Caribbean country for its first general elections since 2016. Smith Augustin, a member of the country's transitional presidential council, confirmed to The Associated Press that the electoral council was created, albeit with only seven of what by law is supposed to be a nine-member panel. He said the two other members would likely be announced in upcoming days. The electoral council, which represents groups including farmers, journalists, human rights activists and the Vodou community, is tasked with organizing the elections and helping create the legal framework to hold them. Haiti has not had a president since July 2021, and it last held elections in 2016. The previous electoral council had been dissolved in September 2021 by former Prime Minister Ariel Henry, who accused it of being 'partisan.' His move delayed elections planned for November 2021 and prompted critics to accuse Henry of holding on to power, accusations he rejected. Henry was himself a transitional leader. He was sworn in as prime minister roughly two weeks after former President Jovenel Moïse was assassinated at his private home in July 2021. Henry repeatedly pledged to hold elections but blamed worsening gang violence for his failure to do so. Earlier this year, gangs that control 80% of the capital of Port-au-Prince launched coordinated attacks on critical government infrastructure, a move that eventually led to Henry’s resignation. A transitional presidential council was then created and tasked with holding presidential elections by February 2026. The assassination of Moïse had left a major political vacuum. In addition, the terms of 10 remaining senators expired in January 2023, stripping Haiti of its last democratically elected institution. The country had failed to hold legislative elections since October 2019, with Moïse ruling by decree before he was killed. The newly formed provisional electoral council faces numerous obstacles, including persistent gang violence blamed for the killing of more than 3,200 people from January to May. To help quell gang violence, nearly 400 Kenyan police arrived in Haiti earlier this year as part of a U.N.-backed mission that also expects to see the pledged deployment of soldiers and police from the Bahamas, Chad, Benin and Bangladesh. Turf wars among gangs have left more than half a million people homeless in recent years, with thousands of Haitians forced to flee their homes, abandoning essential documents including ID’s needed to vote. Government officials have been visiting makeshift shelters to provide new IDs, but many Haitians remain without one. 'How are people going to vote?' said Daniel Janvier, 40, who now lives at a shelter after gangs raided his home and forced him to leave everything behind. 'Most of the people that I know in this area don't have an ID.' Janvier, who is unemployed after losing his job at a factory making pants, said he had his doubts that the government would actually organize elections. 'I think all of this is a joke,' he said. 'Thousands and thousands of people are spread out. They won’t know where to go and vote if they manage to have elections.' ___ Associated Press reporter Evens Sanon in Port-au-Prince, Haiti contributed.	https://apnews.com/article/haiti-electoral-council-4b9135738c454eb1a71ca0a556540203	2024-09-18T10:58:38-07:00	
US wants more clarity from Ukraine on possible use of long-range weapons	WASHINGTON (AP) — The Biden administration still is not convinced that it should give Ukraine the authority to launch long-range missiles deeper into Russia, and U.S. officials say they are seeking more detailed information about how Kyiv would use the weapons and how they fit into the broader strategy for the war. U.S. officials said they have asked Ukraine to spell out more clearly its combat objectives, as President Joe Biden prepares to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy next week. Administration officials are concerned that loosening restrictions on the use of the weapons would have limited impact and come with great risk. Russian President Vladimir Putin last week warned that Russia would be 'at war' with the United States and its NATO allies if they allow Ukraine to use the long-range weapons. U.S. defense officials have repeatedly argued that the long-range missiles are limited in number and that Ukraine already is using its own long-range drones to hit targets farther into Russia. That capability was evidenced by a Ukrainian drone strike overnight that hit a large military depot, causing a huge blaze, in a town 500 kilometers (300 miles) from the border. Ukrainian leaders, however, say they need permission to strike weapons depots, airfields and military bases far from the border to motivate Russia to seek peace. The U.S. allows Ukraine to use American-provided weapons in more limited, cross-border strikes to counter attacks by Russian forces. The U.S. is coming under mounting pressure from NATO allies who believe Ukraine should be the one to decide how and where it uses the weapons and how it fights its own war. A senior U.S. official said the subject came up during meetings of NATO defense chiefs in Europe over the weekend — attended by Gen. CQ Brown, chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff — and that most advocated in favor of the change. The U.S. officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. Ukraine is pressing to use U.S.-supplied Army Tactical Missile Systems, or ATACMS, and British-supplied Storm Shadow missiles to hit deeper into Russia. Biden discussed the issue during a meeting last week with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer. U.S. officials familiar with discussions said they believed Starmer was seeking Biden’s approval to allow Ukraine to use the Storm Shadow missiles for expanded strikes in Russia. Biden’s approval may be needed because Storm Shadow components are made in the U.S. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to share the status of private conversations. Starmer said talks would continue when global leaders convene for the U.N. General Assembly gathering next week. Biden's meeting with Zelenskyy is expected to happen late next week after the U.S. president returns from the U.N. A senior U.S. official said the U.S. wants to help Ukraine shape its combat objectives for the war and the use of long-range weapons. On Saturday, the head of NATO’s military committee said Ukraine has the solid legal and military right to strike deep inside Russia to gain combat advantage. Speaking in Prague at the close of the meeting of the alliance's military chiefs, Adm. Rob Bauer of the Netherlands said, 'Every nation that is attacked has the right to defend itself. And that right doesn’t stop at the border of your own nation.' Lt. Gen. Karel Řehka, chief of the General Staff of the Czech Armed Forces, made it clear his nation places no such weapons restrictions on Kyiv. 'We believe that the Ukrainians should decide themselves how to use it,' Řehka said. U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, however, has consistently pushed back on the idea that long-range strikes would be a game-changer. 'I don’t believe one capability is going to be decisive, and I stand by that comment,' Austin said, noting that Ukraine has other means to strike long-range targets.	https://apnews.com/article/ukraine-russia-war-long-range-missiles-6bd6af3d74ebbf6225330e476173575f	2024-09-18T09:00:32-07:00	
A Hungarian company is linked to the pagers that exploded in Lebanon and Syria	BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) — In a duplex in a quiet neighborhood of the Hungarian capital is the headquarters of a company that is linked to the manufacture of the pagers that exploded in Lebanon and Syria as part of an apparent Israeli operation against the Hezbollah militant group. BAC Consulting shares the ground floor of the modest building in Budapest with other enterprises. On Wednesday morning, Associated Press journalists saw the names of multiple companies, including BAC, posted on pieces of printer paper and taped in a window. In a corporate registry, the company listed 118 official functions, including sugar and oil production, retail jewelry sales and natural gas extraction. BAC reportedly supplied the thousands of devices that killed at least 12 people, including two children, and wounded about 2,800 on Tuesday in a coordinated attack that Hezbollah and the Lebanese government blamed on Israel. More attacks were reported Wednesday, when walkie-talkies and solar equipment exploded in multiple parts of Lebanon. The second wave of attacks killed at least 14 people and wounded more than 450, the Health Ministry said. The Taiwanese company whose brand appears on the pagers, Gold Apollo, said Wednesday that it had authorized the use of its name on the devices. BAC was authorized 'to use our brand trademark for product sales in designated regions, but the design and manufacturing of the products are solely the responsibility of BAC,' Gold Apollo said in a statement. A Hungarian government spokesman said the pagers were never in Hungary and that BAC Consultants merely acted as an intermediary. 'Authorities have confirmed that the company in question is a trading intermediary, with no manufacturing or operational site in Hungary. It has one manager registered at its declared address, and the referenced devices have never been in Hungary,' Zoltán Kovács posted Wednesday on X. He did not say where the pagers were manufactured. Hungarian national security services were cooperating with international partners, and the matter posed no national security risk to Hungary, he added. BAC Consulting, which was registered as a limited liability company in May 2022, brought in $725,000 in revenue in 2022 and $593,000 in 2023, according to the company registry. Its CEO is Cristiana Bársony-Arcidiacono, who describes herself on LinkedIn as a strategic adviser and business developer with a doctorate. BAC could be an acronym, in the Eastern name order that is used in Hungary, for Bársony-Arcidiacono Cristiana. The AP attempted to reach Bársony-Arcidiacono by email and social media sites but received no response. It was not clear what connection, if any, she or BAC had to the attack. She describes herself as a physicist and a consultant for projects to solve environmental and political issues. She co-authored a paper in 2022 for a UNESCO conference on underground water management. Among other positions, Bársony-Arcidiacono's LinkedIn page said she serves on the board of directors of the Earth Child Institute, a sustainability group. But the group does not list Bársony-Arcidiacono among its board members on its website. She also writes that she is a strategic adviser for major international organizations such as the International Atomic Energy Agency and the CARE humanitarian agency, as well as for venture capital firms. The IAEA confirmed that a person by Bársony-Arcidiacono’s name was an intern with the agency for nine months in 2008 and 2009. The other relationships could not be immediately confirmed. In an article featuring her on an online expert site, Bársony-Arcidiacono said: 'A good understanding of local issues and a network of collaborators in various areas are important to succeed.' The BAC Consulting website, which became unavailable Wednesday, describes the company's fields of expertise as 'environment, development and international affairs.' Phone calls to the number listed for BAC went unanswered. A woman who emerged Wednesday from the Budapest building housing the company's headquarters said the location is used as a service that provides addresses to companies. She would not give her name. Social media accounts indicate Bársony-Arcidiacono studied at the London School of Economics and Political Science and the School of Oriental and African Studies. She has also posted published scientific papers on water ionization, climate change and other topics in the natural sciences. An Instagram account features many of her 'photos and sketches from around the world.' 'Sicily, Budapest, Paris, Africa, etc.,' it reads. ___ Associated Press Writer Sarah El Deeb in Beirut contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/hungarian-company-behind-lebanon-pager-explosions-9ebcca9cc9e5a7d7bc9bc74ddcf23fb3	2024-09-18T08:12:45-07:00	
Justice Department disrupts vast Chinese hacking operation that infected consumer devices	WASHINGTON (AP) — The FBI has disrupted a group of hackers working at the direction of the Chinese government who targeted universities, government agencies and other organizations, Director Chris Wray said Wednesday. The hacking campaign known as Flax Typhoon installed malicious software on more than 200,000 consumer devices, including cameras, video recorders and home and office routers, to create a massive botnet — a network of infected computers. The botnet was used to facilitate cyber crimes, such as the theft of sensitive information from victims' networks. 'Flax Typhoon’s actions caused real harm to its victims, who had to devote precious time to clean up the mess when they discovered the malware,' Wray said at the Aspen Cyber Summit. Speaking at the same conference, Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco said the average citizen should care because the case involves 'criminal activity, disruptive activity going on in potentially their devices. And, and it is part of a broader ecosystem that malicious cyber actors are using.' The FBI and Justice Department, which obtained a warrant to seize the botnet's infrastructure, did not identify any of the targets by name but said they included universities, government agencies, telecommunications providers, media organizations and nongovernmental organizations. Half of the hijacked devices were located in the U.S., Wray said. 'This was another successful disruption, but make no mistake — it’s just one round in a much longer fight,' Wray said. 'The Chinese government is going to continue to target your organizations and our critical infrastructure, either by their own hand or concealed through their proxies, and we’ll continue to work with our partners to identify their malicious activity, disrupt their hacking campaigns, and bring them to light.' Flax Typhoon was described in a Microsoft report in August 2023 that said the group had stepped up its targeting of Taiwanese organizations as well as government agencies in other countries. The disruption was revealed nine months after Wray disclosed to Congress a separate takedown of a Chinese state-sponsored hacking group known as Volt Typhoon, in which U.S.-based small office and home routers owned by private citizens and companies were hijacked by hackers to cover their tracks as they sowed the malware. Their ultimate targets included water treatment plants, the electrical grid and transportation systems across the U.S.	https://apnews.com/article/fbi-justice-department-chinese-hacking-84e16185ae16367443a5e083adb74c8c	2024-09-18T06:54:57-07:00	
Suspension of security clearance for Iran envoy did not follow protocol, watchdog says	WASHINGTON (AP) — The State Department’s internal watchdog concluded Wednesday that officials did not follow proper protocol when handling the security clearance suspension of the U.S. special envoy for Iran following allegations last year that he may have mishandled classified information. The department’s inspector general report, obtained by The Associated Press, stated that in several instances officials 'deviated' from the standard process, allowing envoy Rob Malley to access classified meetings and information that would have otherwise been restricted. 'OIG also found that the lack of standard policies for political appointees and the lack of supervision of Special Envoy Malley led to significant confusion as to what work Mr. Malley was authorized to do following the suspension,' the report said. Malley, who led the Biden administration's effort to revive the faltering Iran nuclear deal and resolve issues related to detained Americans in Iran, was placed on unpaid leave in June 2023 following allegations that he may have mishandled classified information. Malley’s whereabouts first raised questions when he skipped a classified congressional briefing on Iran in May 2023. At the time, State Department officials told lawmakers that Malley was on 'extended personal leave' and suggested that his absence might be related to a family health issue. For the past year, congressional Republicans have been demanding that the State Department produce more information on the suspension and related allegations. The watchdog report is expected to be released soon to Congress, where GOP lawmakers have been demanding accountability from the State Department.	https://apnews.com/article/rob-malley-iran-special-envoy-security-clearance-4b7cf51477b8e8ca320181f911e50847	2024-09-18T05:40:30-07:00	
Lessons from Red Sea and Ukraine's Black Sea fight help prep Navy for possible conflict with China	WASHINGTON (AP) — The Navy is taking lessons from its combat in the Red Sea over the past year and what Ukraine has done to hold off the Russians in the Black Sea to help U.S. military leaders prepare the service for a potential future conflict with China. From drones and unmanned surface vessels to the more advanced operation of ship-board guns, the Navy is expanding its combat skills and broadening training. It is also working to overcome recruiting struggles so it can have the sailors it needs to fight the next war. Adm. Lisa Franchetti, chief of naval operations, is laying out a series of goals, including several that will be highly challenging to meet, in a new navigation plan she described in an interview with The Associated Press. The objective is to be ready to face what the Pentagon calls its key national security challenge — China. 'I’m very focused on 2027. It’s the year that that President Xi (Jinping) told his forces to be ready to invade Taiwan,' Franchetti said. 'We need to be more ready.' The new plan, set to be released Wednesday, includes what she considers seven priority goals, ranging from removing delays in ship depot maintenance to improving Navy infrastructure, recruiting and the use of drones and autonomous systems. One significant challenge is to have 80% of the force be ready enough at any given time to deploy for combat if needed — something she acknowledged is a 'stretch goal.' The key, she said, is to get to a level of combat readiness where 'if the nation calls us, we can push the ‘go’ button and we can surge our forces to be able to meet the call.' The announcement of the goals comes as U.S. leaders are treading a fine line, pledging a commitment to the defense of Taiwan while also working to keep communication open with Beijing to deter greater conflict. Taiwan, a self-governing island democracy that split from communist China in 1949, has rejected Beijing’s demands that it accept unification. China says it will do so by force if necessary. The United States is obligated under domestic law to help defend Taiwan and give it weapons and technology to deter invasion. An important element in any Asia-Pacific conflict will be the need to control the seas. Franchetti said the U.S. can learn from how the Ukrainians have used drones, airstrikes and long-range unmanned vessels to limit Russian ship activity in the western Black Sea and keep access open to critical ports. 'If you look at the Ukrainian success in really keeping the Russian Black Sea fleet pushed all the way over into the east, that’s all about sea denial and that’s very important,' Franchetti said. She added that Ukraine has been innovating on the battlefield by using existing systems, such as drones, in different ways. The Navy's monthslong battle with the Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen has provided other lessons. 'I think probably no one is learning more than the Navy, because really, this is the first time we’ve been in a weapons engagement zone for this sustained period,' she said. She said sailors are watching their attacks and analyzing the data as ships respond. Earlier this year, the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower aircraft carrier was stationed in the Red Sea to respond to help Israel and to defend commercial and military ships from Houthi attacks. The carrier returned home after an eight-month-plus deployment that the Navy said was the most intense running sea battle since World War II. F/A-18 fighter jets routinely launched off the carrier's deck to take out Houthi weapons, and Navy destroyers persistently fired rounds of missiles and used on-board guns to shoot down incoming strikes and drones. On board the USS Mason destroyer, which was stationed with the Eisenhower, Franchetti in August met and promoted one of the destroyer's fire control sailors who worked on its large, fully automatic artillery gun. Unlike missiles, many of the drones launched by the Houthis were more complicated and challenging to target and shoot down, and he was able to adjust the gun to better defeat them. 'He could see how it was performing against the Houthi threat,' Franchetti said, 'and he came up with a different way to use the gun to make it more effective in these engagements.' She did not identify the sailor and declined to provide details on the exact changes he recommended. But it resulted in new formal military tactics and procedures that were distributed to all other ships. Another key effort will be to improve Navy development of unmanned and autonomous systems and weapons and integrate them into training and combat. As the military brings on new technologies, including unmanned surface vessels, the Navy needs to ensure it has trained sailors who can use and repair them. The new navigation plan notes that the Navy is now working on concepts and requirements for larger robotic systems and the artificial intelligence applications they could use to understand and control the battlespace. Navy leaders also understand the financial restraints they will likely face from Congress — limits that rivals such as China do not have. China outpaces the U.S. in the number of ships and is expected to do so into the future. Navy officials said that while they would like a bigger naval force, they need to offset that by working more effectively with the Army, Air Force, Space Force and Marines, which is something the U.S. has historically done very well. A challenge will be eliminating the maintenance overruns that often prevent ships from being able to deploy on time. Getting ships in and out of depots on time, Franchetti said, is critical to having a combat-ready Navy. 'These are the things that we know that we need to be able to do to have the force that’s going to be more ready every single day,' she said.	https://apnews.com/article/navy-china-lessons-ukraine-houthis-327713f10c4556467c14c0989f2a4e97	2024-09-18T05:24:42-07:00	
Blinken expresses frustration at attacks he says threaten to 'derail' Israel-Hamas cease-fire talks	CAIRO (AP) — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken expressed frustration Wednesday at surprise escalations that he said threaten to derail efforts to broker a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. He said the U.S. is still assessing the previous day's deadly pager explosions, linked to Israel, in Lebanon. Blinken spoke in Egypt, where he traveled for talks on the Gaza cease-fire negotiations and U.S.-Egyptian relations. The United States and international partners, including Egypt, are working to broker a cease-fire in the nearly year-old war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, and to tamp down tensions as Israeli leaders threaten to step up military action against Hezbollah in Lebanon. 'Time and again' when the U.S. and other international mediators believe themselves to be making progress in a cease-fire deal for Israel's and Hamas's war in Gaza, 'we've seen an event that makes the process more difficult, might derail it,' Blinken said, speaking in answer to a question about the previous day's explosions in Lebanon. Explosive attacks using personal pagers used by members of the Hezbollah militant group in Lebanon killed at least 12 people Tuesday, including a child. Israel has not publicly spoken on whether it was responsible. Blinken spoke of Hamas' killing earlier this month of six of the several dozen hostages that Hamas-led militants have held in Gaza since capturing them Oct. 7, in the attack in Israel that launched the war. At the time news came of the six hostages' killing, negotiators had been making progress on the timing and other details of a swap that would have freed hostages in exchange for a freeing of Palestinian prisoners in Israeli detention, Blinken said. Blinken on Wednesday repeated administration statements that the U.S. was still gathering information on the circumstances of the pager attacks, and declined more specific comment on them. Blinken spoke to reporters after talks with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi and Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty. He also said the most dire need in the talks for a cease-fire and hostage release in Gaza was for both sides to show they actually wanted a deal. 'The most important thing in this moment is to see a demonstration of political will,' Blinken said. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been accused of slow-rolling the talks because a deal could mean the collapse of his hardline coalition government, some members of which oppose any deal with Palestinians. Blinken was speaking on his 10th trip to the Middle East since the war in Gaza began. The trip was billed in part as a chance to consult with Egypt on refining terms of a final proposal to present to Israel and Hamas.	https://apnews.com/article/gaza-blinken-middle-east-pagers-israel-4d4234bfdac2e49d3bc7c70cfb82a585	2024-09-18T04:45:18-07:00	
Americans can now renew passports online and bypass cumbersome paper applications	WASHINGTON (AP) — Americans can now renew their passports online, bypassing a cumbersome mail-in paper application process that often caused delays. The State Department announced Wednesday that its online passport renewal system is now fully operational. 'By offering this online alternative to the traditional paper application process, the Department is embracing digital transformation to offer the most efficient and convenient passport renewal experience possible,' Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement. After staffing shortages caused mainly by the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in lengthy passport processing delays, the department ramped up hiring and introduced other technological improvements that have reduced wait times by about one-third over last year. It says most applications are now completed in far less than the advertised six weeks to eight weeks and the online renewal system is expected to further reduce that. The system will allow renewal applicants to skip the current process, which requires them to print out and send paper applications and a check by mail, and submit their documents and payment through a secure website, www.Travel.State.Gov/renewonline.	https://apnews.com/article/passport-renewals-online-mail-paper-applications-87df311259fdbd01bc9fb50cab4137e9	2024-09-18T04:15:48-07:00	
Rising rivers threaten southern Poland as flooding recedes elsewhere in Central Europe	WARSAW, Poland (AP) — Soldiers and volunteers in southwestern Poland laid sandbags Wednesday near swollen rivers around the city of Wroclaw to protect homes and businesses after days of flooding across Central Europe. Poland joins Austria, the Czech Republic and Romania in being hard hit by floods following record rains in the region starting last Thursday. Authorities have reported 23 deaths, with seven each in Poland and Romania, five in Austria and four in the Czech Republic. The floods in Central Europe combined with deadly wildfires in Portugal are joint proof of a 'climate breakdown' that will become the norm unless drastic action is taken, the European Union’s head office said Wednesday. The fourth death in the Czech Republic was reported Wednesday, when police said they found the body of a 70-year-old woman who was swept away by waters on Sunday in the town of Kobyla nad Vidnavkou near the town of Jesenik, located in the badly hit northeast. The weather has improved, with warm and sunny conditions in the Czech Republic, Poland and elsewhere. Water levels were falling in some places, allowing authorities and residents to clean up debris. Firefighters in Poland were pumping water out of flooded streets and basements. And in Romania, about 1,000 firefighters were working across the country to clean up severely affected areas, the General Inspectorate for Emergency Situations said Wednesday in a Facebook post. But some areas are still under threat, particularly in southwestern Poland. Prime Minister Donald Tusk held crisis meetings in Wroclaw with local officials and rescue services, urging protective measures and saying his government will help those affected. Floodwaters were expected to crest late Wednesday, and high water levels were expected to continue for many hours, even days. Soldiers and residents in Marcinkowice, near Wroclaw, laid sandbags near a bridge over the Olawa River, whose waters flow into the Oder, the major river that rises in the Oder Mountains in the Czech Republic and runs north through Poland to Germany. The community leader of the town of Olawa, Artur Piotrowski, described the situation as difficult. He told the Polish state news agency PAP that two villages in a low-lying area have been flooded since Monday and residents have refused to evacuate. Thousands of Polish soldiers were in action. Some evacuated people and animals — including dogs and horses — from flood-affected areas and distributed food and drinking water. The army also posted on X on Wednesday that it set up a field hospital in the town of Nysa after patients in a hospital there had to be evacuated earlier this week. Soldiers also were building a temporary bridge in the town of Glucholazy to replace one that was washed away by the flooding. Residents in another flood-damaged town, Stronie Slaskie, have appealed to Tusk to send someone to direct the cleaning and recovery action, saying it was chaotic and inefficient. Experts have been preparing for flood threats due to the cresting Oder River in Opole, a city of some 130,000 residents, which seems to have avoided any major flooding, and in Wroclaw, home to about 640,000 residents, which suffered disastrous flooding in 1997.	https://apnews.com/article/central-europe-floods-poland-wroclaw-oder-czech-c7b9901872be8706baca1d662098bde9	2024-09-18T03:31:14-07:00	
The Latest: Trump to campaign in New York and Harris will speak at Hispanic leadership conference	Donald Trump is taking his message Wednesday to a somewhat unlikely place: suburban New York. The Republican presidential nominee and former president is heading to Uniondale, on Long Island, an area that could be key to his party maintaining control of the House. His party is trying to protect 18 Republicans in Democratic-heavy congressional districts Joe Biden carried in 2020. Meanwhile, Vice President Kamala Harris is expected to speak at the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute’s 47th Annual Leadership Conference in Washington and has trips planned later in the week to Michigan and Wisconsin. Follow the AP’s Election 2024 coverage at: https://apnews.com/hub/election-2024. Here’s the latest: Officials say online reports of explosives found in a car near a Trump rally are false Nassau County officials say social media reports that explosives were found in a car near former President Donald Trump’s New York rally on Long Island just days after the second apparent assassination attempt on him are false. Christopher Boyle, spokesperson for Nassau County Executive Bruce Blakeman, and Lt. Scott Skrynecki, spokesperson for the Nassau County Police Department, both said Wednesday morning that the reports are unfounded. 'No. Ridiculous. Zero validity,' Boyle said. 'False,' Skrynecki said in a text. The officials said they would be releasing an official statement later. In a post on X, Musk says ‘Trump must win’ the presidential election Elon Musk, the owner of the social media platform X, posted overnight that 'Trump must win' to save the country. 'Unless Trump is elected, America will fall to tyranny,' he wrote to his nearly 200 million followers. He was replying to a post that argued the former president is the only candidate fighting an impending American dictatorship. The post falls into a recent pattern for Musk, who endorsed Trump in July. He frequently jumps into the political fray with inflammatory commentary during tense moments. He also has repeatedly shared misinformation about elections to his massive audience on X. Musk’s critics and several election officials have condemned his actions as irresponsible, but the 53-year-old billionaire and many conservatives vehemently disagree. They sharply criticize Democrats for suggesting that speech should be moderated or criminalized and blame the assassination attempts against Trump on the left’s rhetoric. White House hosts first meeting with Trump, Harris transition teams Representatives for former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris ′ transition teams met for the first time at the White House, the Biden administration announced Wednesday, as the outgoing administration plans to smooth the handoff to whomever wins in November. Chief of Staff Jeffrey Zients hosted a meeting Tuesday of the White House Transition Coordinating Committee — the government’s senior-most transition planning group — and for the first time this year included Harris and Trump aides. The meeting and invitation to both parties’ representatives are required under the Presidential Transition Act, which mandates that the designated candidate representatives serve in an advisory capacity. Now a Roe advocate, woman raped by stepfather as a child tells her story in Harris campaign ad A 22-year-old woman who became an abortion rights advocate after she was raped by her stepfather as a child tells her story in a new campaign ad for Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris. Hadley Duvall says in voiceover that she’s never slept a full night in her life — her stepfather first started abusing her when she was five years old, and impregnated her when she was 12. As she speaks, images of Duvall as a child flash on the screen. The soundtrack of the ad is a song by Billie Eilish, who endorsed the vice president Tuesday. 'I just remember thinking I have to get out of my skin. I can’t be me right now. Like, this can’t be it,' Duvall says. 'I didn’t know what to do. I was a child. I didn’t know what it meant to be pregnant, at all. But I had options.' The ad is part of a continued push by the Harris campaign to highlight the growing consequences of the fall of Roe, including that some states have abortion restrictions with no exceptions for rape or incest. Women in some states are suffering increasingly perilous medical care and the first reported instance of a woman dying from delayed reproductive care surfaced this week. New Jersey voters are set to pick a successor to late congressman in special election Voters in northern New Jersey are set to settle a special U.S. House election to fill the seat that opened when Rep.

Democratic Newark City Council President LaMonica McIver and Republican Carmen Bucco are competing for the seat in the heavily Democratic and majority-Black 10th Congressional District. Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy set the special election under state law after Payne died in April. He had served on the House for more than two decades. Wednesday’s election determines who serves out the remainder of Payne’s term, which ends Jan. 3, 2025. The regular election process held in parallel will determine who fills the seat after that.

European Union court largely upholds Qualcomm antitrust penalty in 2019 case but trims fine	LONDON (AP) — Qualcomm lost its legal fight on Wednesday to get a European Union antitrust penalty thrown out after a top court largely rebuffed the technology company's arguments in the case involving cellphone chipsets. The European Union's General Court said it was rejecting most of Qualcomm's appeal against the 242 million euro ($269 million) fine that the bloc's regulators issued in 2019, when they accused the company of 'predatory pricing' to drive a competitor out of the market. The European Commission, the 27-nation bloc's executive branch and top antitrust enforcer, said five years ago that Qualcomm abused its market dominance in 3G baseband chipsets, selling them below the cost of production to force startup Icera out of the market a decade prior. The court said in a press release that after examining Qualcomm's arguments, it was 'rejecting them all in their entirety,' except for the company's plea that the commission didn't follow guidelines in calculating the fine. Therefore the court trimmed the fine to 238.7 million euros. Qualcomm said it 'respectfully disagrees with the judgment and the Commission’s decision and believes that we have always remained in compliance with European competition law.' In a separate case the European Commission fined Qualcomm $1.23 billion after concluding it bribed Apple to stifle competition, but the General Court overturned that decision in 2022 after the company appealed.	https://apnews.com/article/european-union-qualcomm-antitrust-court-01dfc49c8de0cb792ea2eb7e4327cd10	2024-09-18T03:13:01-07:00	
Hungary refuses to pay fines for breaking EU asylum rules. Brussels is taking the money anyway.	BRUSSELS (AP) — The European Union on Wednesday began the process of clawing back hundreds of millions of euros in funds meant to go Hungary after its ant-migrant government refused to pay a huge fine for breaking the bloc’s asylum rules. In June, the EU’s top court ordered Hungary to pay 200 million euros ($223 million) for persistently depriving migrants of their right to apply for asylum. The court imposed an additional fine of 1 million euros for every day it failed to comply. The European Court of Justice described Hungary’s actions as 'an unprecedented and extremely serious infringement of EU law.' Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán slammed its ruling as 'outrageous and unacceptable.' The EU’s executive branch, the European Commission, said that given Hungary’s failure to pay or provide information about its intentions, Brussels is 'moving to what we call the off-setting procedure' by taking the money from common funds that would otherwise go to Budapest. 'So, what we are going to do now is to deduct the 200 million euro from upcoming payments from the EU budget towards Hungary,' commission spokesman Balazs Ujvari said. He said it would take time to identify which parts of Hungary’s funding could be deducted. Ujvari said the commission has also sent a first payment request on the daily fines amounting to 93 million euros ($103 million) so far. 'Counting from receipt, the Hungarian authorities will have 45 days to make that payment,' he said. Hungary’s staunchly nationalist government has taken a hard line on people entering the country since well over 1 million people arrived in Europe in 2015, most of them fleeing conflict in Syria. The case against it concerned changes Hungary made to its asylum system in the wake of that crisis, when some 400,000 people passed through Hungary on their way to Western Europe. The government in Budapest ordered fences with razor wire to be erected on its southern borders with Serbia and Croatia and a pair of transit zones for holding asylum seekers to be set up on its border with Serbia. Those transit zones have since closed. In 2020, the ECJ found that Hungary had restricted access to international protection, unlawfully detained asylum applicants, and failed to observe their right to stay while their applications were processed. The transit zones were closed in 2020, shortly after that ruling. But the commission, which is responsible for monitoring the 27 EU member states’ compliance with their shared laws, took the view that Budapest had still not complied and requested that the ECJ impose a fine. After the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak in 2020, the government also pushed through a law forcing asylum seekers to travel to Belgrade or Kyiv to apply for a travel permit at its embassies there before entering Hungary. Only once back could they file their applications. People have the right to apply for asylum or other forms of international protection if they fear for their safety in their home countries or face the prospect of persecution based on their race, religion, ethnic background, gender or other discrimination.	https://apnews.com/article/eu-migration-hungary-fines-funds-asylum-bef928922abffa280bb1bb245fd5f448	2024-09-18T02:43:15-07:00	
Ukrainian drones strike a major military depot in a Russian town northwest of Moscow	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukrainian drones struck a large military depot in a town deep inside Russia overnight, causing a huge fire and forcing some residents to evacuate, a Ukrainian official and Russian news reports said Wednesday. At least 13 people were injured, Russia's Health Ministry added. Meanwhile, a senior U.S. diplomat said Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has a workable plan to end the war, now in its third year, although its details have not been publicly disclosed. Ukraine claimed the strike destroyed military warehouses in Toropets, a town in Russia’s Tver region about 380 kilometers (240 miles) northwest of Moscow and about 500 kilometers (300 miles) from the border with Ukraine. The attack was carried out by Ukraine’s Security Service, along with Ukraine’s Intelligence and Special Operations Forces, a Kyiv security official told The Associated Press, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the operation. According to the official, the depot housed Iskander and Tochka-U missiles, as well as glide bombs and artillery shells. He said the facility caught fire in the strike and was burning across an area 6 kilometers (4 miles) wide. Among the destroyed ammunition were North Korean KN-23 short-range ballistic missiles, another official, in Ukraine’s Intelligence Office, told AP. He also was not authorized to comment publicly and didn’t provide evidence to support his claim. Russia and North Korea signed a landmark pact in June that envisioned mutual military assistance between Moscow and Pyongyang. More than 100 domestically produced exploding drones were deployed in the attack on the depot, the Ukrainian intelligence official added. Russian state news agency RIA Novosti quoted regional authorities as saying air defense systems were working to repel a 'massive drone attack' on Toropets, which has a population of about 11,000. The agency also reported a fire and the evacuations, and the Health Ministry said 13 people were hospitalized in the region after the attack. Tver regional Gov. Igor Rudenya later said all evacuees could return home. Successful Ukrainian strikes deep inside Russia have become more common as Kyiv developed its drone technology. Zelenskyy also is seeking approval from Western nations for Ukraine to use the sophisticated weapons they are providing to hit targets inside Russia. Some Western leaders have balked at that, fearing they could be dragged into the conflict. Part of Kyiv’s strategy is targeting of military equipment, ammunition and infrastructure deep inside Russia, as well as making civilians feel some of the consequences of the war that is being fought largely inside Ukraine. The swift push by Ukrainian forces into Russia’s Kursk border region last month fits into that plan, which apparently seeks to compel Russian President Vladimir Putin to back down. Putin, however, has shown no signs of that and has been trying to grind down Ukraine's resolve through attritional warfare and also sap the West’s support for Kyiv by drawing out the conflict. That has come at a price, however, as the U.K. Defense Ministry estimates the war has probably killed or wounded more than 600,000 Russian troops. On Tuesday, Putin ordered the country’s military to increase its number of troops by 180,000 to a total of 1.5 million by Dec. 1. Zelenskyy announced his war plan in his nightly address on Monday, saying it’s 90% ready and will be presented to allies over the next week. He said Ukraine's plan for victory includes not only battlefield goals but also diplomatic and economic wins. The plan has been kept under wraps but the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, said at a news conference Tuesday that Washington officials have seen it. 'We think it lays out a strategy and a plan that can work,' she said, adding that the United States will bring it up with other world leaders at the U.N. General Assembly in New York next week. She did not comment on what the plan contained. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-toropets-drones-attack-e3d05b2637d316b437e4789a35c7f59e	2024-09-18T00:49:59-07:00	
Google wins legal bid to overturn 1.5 billion euro antitrust fine in EU digital ad case	LONDON (AP) — Google won a court challenge on Wednesday against a 1.49 billion euro European Union antitrust fine imposed five years ago that targeted its online advertising business. The European Union's General Court said it was throwing out the 2019 penalty imposed by the European Commission, which is the 27-nation bloc's top antitrust enforcer. 'The General Court annuls the Commission’s decision in its entirety,' it said in a press release. The commission's ruling applied to a narrow portion of Google’s ad business: ads that the U.S. tech giant sold next to Google search results on third-party websites. Regulators had found that Google inserted exclusivity clauses in its contracts that barred these websites from running similarly placed ads sold by Google’s rivals. The commission, the bloc's top antitrust enforcer, said when it issued the penalty that Google's behavior resulted in advertisers and website owners having less choice and likely facing higher prices that would be passed on to consumers.	https://apnews.com/article/google-european-union-digital-antitrust-7810906b9fda391f9fa393750d67e76a	2024-09-17T23:03:09-07:00	
Pagers that exploded in Lebanon and Syria were made by a company in Budapest, Gold Apollo says	TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) — Taiwanese company Gold Apollo said Wednesday that it authorized its brand on the pagers that exploded in Lebanon and Syria but that another company based in Budapest manufactured them. Pagers used by the militant group Hezbollah exploded near-simultaneously Tuesday in Lebanon and Syria, killing at least nine people, including an 8-year-old girl, and wounding nearly 3,000. Hezbollah and the Lebanese government blamed Israel for what appeared to be a sophisticated remote attack. The AR-924 pagers were manufactured by BAC Consulting KFT, based in Hungary’s capital, according to a statement released Wednesday by Gold Apollo. 'According to the cooperation agreement, we authorize BAC to use our brand trademark for product sales in designated regions, but the design and manufacturing of the products are solely the responsibility of BAC,' the statement read. Gold Apollo chair Hsu Ching-kuang told journalists Wednesday that his company has had a licensing agreement with BAC for the past three years, but did not provide evidence of the contract. At about 3:30 p.m. Tuesday, as people shopped for groceries, sat in cafes or drove cars and motorcycles, the pagers in their hands or pockets started heating up and then exploding — leaving blood-splattered scenes and panicking bystanders. It appeared that many of those hit were members of Hezbollah, but it was not immediately clear if non-Hezbollah members also carried any of the exploding pagers. The blasts were mainly in areas where the group has a strong presence, particularly a southern Beirut suburb and in the Beqaa region of eastern Lebanon, as well as in Damascus, according to Lebanese security officials and a Hezbollah official. The Hezbollah official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to the media. Hezbollah, which has pointed the blame at Israel, said in a statement Wednesday morning that it would continue its normal strikes against Israel 'as in all the past days' as part of what it describes as a support front for its ally, Hamas, and Palestinians in Gaza. 'This path is continuous and separate from the difficult reckoning that the criminal enemy must await for its massacre on Tuesday that it committed against our people, our families and our fighters in Lebanon,' it said. 'This is another reckoning that will come, God willing.' Hezbollah began firing rockets over the border into Israel on Oct. 8, the day after a deadly Hamas-led attack in southern Israel triggered a massive Israeli counteroffensive and the ongoing war in Gaza. Since then, Hezbollah and Israeli forces have exchanged strikes near-daily, killing hundreds in Lebanon and dozens in Israel and displacing tens of thousands on each side of the border. At hospitals in Beirut on Wednesday, the chaos of the night before had largely subsided, but relatives of the wounded continued to wait. Lebanon’s Health Minister Firas Abiad told journalists during a tour on hospitals Wednesday morning that many of the wounded suffered 'severe injuries to the eyes' and others had limbs amputated. Journalists were not allowed to enter hospital rooms or film patients. The health minister said that the wounded had been distributed among all the area hospitals to avoid any single facility being overloaded and added that Turkey, Iraq, Iran, Syria and Egypt offered to help in treating the patients. Earlier Wednesday, an Iraqi military plane landed in Beirut carrying medical equipment, airport officials said. Abiad said the plane was carrying 15 tons of medicine and medical equipment. Experts believe explosive material was put into the pagers prior to their delivery and use in a sophisticated supply chain infiltration. The AR-924 pager, advertised as being 'rugged,' contains a rechargeable lithium battery, according to specifications once advertised on Gold Apollo’s website before it was apparently taken down Tuesday after the sabotage attack. It could receive texts of up to 100 characters. It also claimed to have up to 85 days of battery life. That would be crucial in Lebanon, where electricity outages have been common after years of economic collapse. Pagers also run on a different wireless network than mobile phones, making them more resilient in emergencies — one of the reasons why many hospitals worldwide still rely on them. Taiwan's Ministry of Economic Affairs said from the beginning of 2022 until August 2024, Gold Apollo has exported 260,000 sets of pagers, including more than 40,000 sets between January and August of this year. The ministry said the pagers were exported mainly to European and American countries and that it had no records of direct exports of Gold Apollo pagers to Lebanon. For Hezbollah, the militants also looked at the pagers as a means to sidestep what’s believed to be intensive Israeli electronic surveillance on mobile phone networks in Lebanon. 'The phone that we have in our hands — I do not have a phone in my hand — is a listening device,' warned Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah in a February speech. He later added: 'I tell you that the phone in your hands, in your wife’s hands, and in your children’s hands is the agent. It is a deadly agent, not a simple one. It is a deadly agent that provides specific and accurate information. Therefore, this requires great seriousness when confronting it.' ___ Associated Press journalists Bassem Mroue and Abby Sewell in Beirut and Jon Gambrell in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/lebanon-israel-exploding-pagers-hezbollah-syria-ce6af3c2e6de0a0dddfae48634278288	2024-09-17T21:12:52-07:00	
Sri Lanka's plantation workers live on the margins. But politicians still want their votes	SPRING VALLEY, Sri Lanka (AP) — Whoever Sri Lanka's next president is, Muthuthevarkittan Manohari isn't expecting much to change in her daily struggle to feed the four children and elderly mother with whom she lives in a dilapidated room in a tea plantation. Both leading candidates in Saturday's presidential election are promising to give land to the country's hundreds of thousands of plantation workers, but Manohari says she's heard it all before. Sri Lanka's plantation workers are a long-marginalized group who frequently live in dire poverty, but they can swing elections by voting as a bloc. Mahohari and her family are descended from Indian indentured laborers who were brought in by the British during colonial rule to work on plantations that grew first coffee, and later tea and rubber. Those crops are still Sri Lanka's leading foreign exchange earners. For 200 years, the community has lived on the margins of Sri Lankan society. Soon after the country became independent in 1948, the new government stripped them of citizenship and voting rights. Around 400,000 people were deported to India under an agreement with Delhi, separating many families. The community fought for its rights, winning in stages until achieving full recognition as citizens in 2003. There are around 1.5 million descendants of plantation workers living in Sri Lanka today, including about 3.5% of the electorate, and some 470,000 people still live on plantations. The plantation community has the highest levels of poverty, malnutrition, anaemia among women and alcoholism in the country, and some of the lowest levels of education. They're an important voting bloc, turned out by unions that double as political parties that ally with the country's major parties. Despite speaking the Tamil language, they’re treated as a distinct group from the island’s indigenous Tamils, who live mostly in the north and east. Still, they suffered during the 26-year civil war between government forces and Tamil Tiger separatists. Plantation workers and their descendants faced mob violence, arrests and imprisonment because of their ethnicity. Most plantation workers live in crowded dwellings called 'line houses,' owned by plantation companies. Tomoya Obokata, a U.N. special rapporteur on contemporary forms of slavery, said after a visit in 2022 that five to ten people often share a single 10-by-12-foot (3.05-by-3.6 meter) room, often without windows, a proper kitchen, running water or electricity. Several families frequently share a single basic latrine. There are no proper medical facilities in the plantations, and the sick are attended to by so-called estate medical assistants who do not have medical degrees. 'These substandard living conditions, combined with the harsh working conditions, represent clear indicators of forced labour and may also amount to serfdom in some instances,' Obokata wrote in a report to the U.N. high commissioner for human rights. The government has made some efforts to improve conditions for the planation workers, but years of fiscal crisis and the resistance of powerful plantation companies have blunted progress. Access to education has improved, and a small group of entrepreneurs, professionals and academics descended from planation workers has emerged. This year, the government negotiated a raise in the minimum daily wage for a plantation worker to 1,350 rupees ($4.50) per day, plus an additional dollar if a worker picks more than 22 kilos in a day. Workers say this target is almost impossible to achieve, in part because tea bushes are often neglected and grow sparsely. The government has built better houses for some families and the Indian government is helping to build more, said Periyasamy Muthulingam, executive director of Sri Lanka's Institute of Social Development, which works on plantation worker rights. But many promises have gone unfulfilled. 'All political parties have promised to build better houses during elections but they don’t implement it when they are in power,' Muthulingam said. Muthulingam says more than 90% of the planation community is landless because they have been left out of the government's land distribution programs. In this election, sitting President Ranil Wickremesinghe standing as an independent candidate has promised to give the line houses and the land they stand on to the people who live in them, and help develop them into villages. The main opposition candidate, Sajith Premadasa, has promised to break up the plantations and distribute the land to the workers as small holdings. Both proposals will face resistance from the plantation companies. Manohari says she's not holding out hope. She's more concerned with what's going to happen to her 16-year-old son after he was forced to drop out of school due to lack of funds. 'The union leaders come every time promising us houses and land and I would like to have them,' she said. 'But they never happen as promised.' ___ Francis reported from Colombo, Sri Lanka. ___ Find more of AP's Asia-Pacific coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/asia-pacific	https://apnews.com/article/sri-lanka-presidential-election-plantation-workers-b798368f9927a7955a68cab18699a436	2024-09-17T20:06:44-07:00	
Japan's trade deficit grows while both imports, exports fall short of forecasts	TOKYO (AP) — Japan posted a trade deficit for a second straight month in August, the Finance Ministry said Wednesday, despite signs of sluggish consumer spending that weighed on imports. Japan’s trade deficit totaled 695 billion yen, or $4.9 billion, down 26% from a year earlier, the ministry said. Exports totaled 8.4 trillion yen ($59 billion), up 5.6% from the same month the previous year. Shipments to Asia rose while exports to the U.S. fell. Imports totaled 9.1 trillion yen ($64 billion), up 2.3% from a year earlier. By region, imports from European nations, in categories such as pharmaceuticals, showed the strongest growth. Both numbers fell short of forecasts for 10% growth in exports and and even higher increases for imports. The Japanese yen has gained in value against the U.S. dollar in recent weeks, helping to boost the country's purchasing power. The dollar had traded at levels over 150 yen earlier this year but in recent days has dipped to about 140 yen. ___ Yuri Kageyama is on X: https://x.com/yurikageyama	https://apnews.com/article/japan-trade-exports-imports-yen-449cb9ccd939f40bf42fa0627657606b	2024-09-17T19:54:15-07:00	
UN General Assembly widely supports a Palestinian resolution demanding Israel end its occupation	UNITED NATIONS (AP) — The U.N. General Assembly strongly supported a nonbinding Palestinian resolution Wednesday demanding that Israel end its 'unlawful presence' in Gaza and the occupied West Bank within a year. The vote in the 193-member world body was 124-14, with 43 abstentions. Among those in opposition was the United States, Israel’s closest ally. The resolution was adopted as Israel’s war against Hamas in Gaza approaches its first anniversary and as violence in the West Bank reaches new highs. Troubled efforts to broker a cease-fire deal in Gaza are pressing ahead, with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken meeting fellow mediators Wednesday in Egypt, even as attacks elsewhere in the region raise fears of escalating conflict in the Middle East. Riyad Mansour, the Palestinian U.N. ambassador, called the vote a turning point 'in our struggle for freedom and justice.' 'It sends a clear message that Israel’s occupation must end as soon as possible and that the Palestinian people’s right to self-determination must be realized,' he said. Israel’s U.N. Ambassador, Danny Danon, slammed the vote as 'a shameful decision that backs the Palestinian Authority’s diplomatic terrorism.' 'Instead of marking the anniversary of the Oct. 7 massacre by condemning Hamas and calling for the release of all 101 of the remaining hostages, the General Assembly continues to dance to the music of the Palestinian Authority, which backs the Hamas murderers,' Danon said. The U.S. mission to the U.N. called the resolution 'one-sided,' pointing to its failure to recognize that Hamas, 'a terrorist organization,' still exerts power in Gaza and to state that Israel has a right to defend itself from acts of terrorism. 'This resolution will not bring about tangible progress for Palestinians,' the U.S. said. 'In fact, it could both complicate efforts to end the conflict in Gaza and impede reinvigorating steps toward a two-state solution, while ignoring Israel’s very real security concerns.' While the resolution is not legally binding, the extent of its support reflects world opinion. There are no vetoes in the General Assembly, unlike in the 15-member Security Council. The resolution also demands the withdrawal of all Israeli forces and the evacuation of settlers from the occupied Palestinian territories 'without delay.' And it urges countries to impose sanctions on those responsible for maintaining Israel’s presence in the territories and halt arms exports to Israel if they’re suspected of being used there. In addition, the resolution calls for Israel to pay reparations to Palestinians for the damage caused by its occupation and urges countries to take steps to prevent trade or investments that maintain Israel’s presence in the territories. It comes in response to a ruling by the top United Nations court in July that said Israel’s presence in the Palestinian territories is unlawful and must end. The court’s opinion also is not legally binding. In the sweeping condemnation of Israel’s rule over the lands it captured during the 1967 war, the International Court of Justice said Israel had no right to sovereignty over the territories and was violating international laws against acquiring the lands by force. The General Assembly’s consideration of the resolution began Tuesday with Mansour stressing that any country that thinks the Palestinian people 'will accept a life of servitude' — or that claims peace is possible without a just solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict — is 'not being realistic.' The solution remains an independent Palestinian state based on the 1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital, living side by side in peace and security with Israel, he said. Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International also urged Israel to heed the call to end its occupation. The resolution asks U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to submit a report to the General Assembly within three months on putting the resolution in place, 'including any actions taken by Israel, other states and international organizations, including the United Nations.' 'We fully abide by the decisions of the International Court of Justice,' Guterres told reporters. 'I will implement any decision of the General Assembly in that regard.' Mansour said most likely Israel won’t pay attention to the resolution and that the Palestinians will then follow up with a stronger one. ___ Follow AP’s war coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war	https://apnews.com/article/un-israel-palestinians-assembly-vote-gaza-a0136b26cad52070e79628639edbec2c	2024-09-17T19:21:07-07:00	
Seen abroad as a leader on Indigenous rights, New Zealand enters a divisive new era	WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — On the eve of New Zealand’s Māori language celebration week, the country’s right-wing political leaders ordered public agencies to stop affirmative action policies for Māori people, who are disadvantaged on almost every metric. The lawmakers then posted on social media about their enthusiasm for the Indigenous tongue. 'In New Zealand we’re lucky to have this language and I’m glad to celebrate it,' Prime Minister Christopher Luxon of the center-right National party wrote on Facebook Monday. Māori was not solely 'the preserve of people who think a certain way,' said David Seymour, the leader of populist party ACT — whose detractors accuse him of anti-Māori policies — in a video introducing his followers to economic terms in the language. Their remarks reflected the exploding popularity of Māori culture and language – which has reversed course from the brink of extinction decades ago to become part of everyday life in New Zealand. There are waiting lists for classes and a chain store's clothing line for Māori language week sold out in minutes. But they also belied a fraught debate about race roiling New Zealand, fueled by the polarized politics confronting many Western democracies and a backlash against the previous left-wing government. Last year, that sentiment brought to power fringe parties claiming that special treatment for Māori language and people — promised in the country's founding document and intended to address deep inequities — has created social division and unequal rights. As a government comprising those groups and Luxon's ramps up initiatives stripping recognition of Māori from policy and law, analysts say they imperil New Zealand’s standing on Indigenous matters. 'We’ve been world leaders and now that is being clawed back,' said Ella Henry, a Māori entrepreneurship professor at Auckland University of Technology. 'I don’t know that this government quite understands the negative impact that is not only going to have on us politically but economically, because Māori culture is a tourism destination.' The relationship between Māori and the government — a coalition between Luxon’s and Seymour’s parties and a third, populist New Zealand First — promises to be 'not just the most, but the only regressive one' in nearly two decades, said Ben Thomas, a political consultant who worked for a previous National government before Luxon led the party. Their words echo others across the political spectrum who spoke to The Associated Press. They describe the way in which New Zealand has grown more racially fraught since the government took office last November, while at the same time public support for Māori culture has surged — a paradox rooted in the way the political system functions. Without enough seats in Parliament to rule after an election that tipped Jacinda Ardern’s Labour party from office, Luxon formed a government with two minor parties whose leaders — both Māori — capitalized on dissatisfaction about policies that favor Māori. The two groups combined received less than 15% of the national vote, but extracted a series of concessions from Luxon amounting to 'an onslaught of racist policy,' said Janell Dymus-Turei, an expert in Māori health policy currently based at the Centers for American Indian and Alaska Native Health in Colorado. Central to the groups' resentment is how the Treaty of Waitangi, New Zealand’s founding document, has become integrated in law. It was signed in 1840, between Māori tribes and the British Crown which colonized New Zealand, but breaches of the rights promised to Māori and contested interpretations of the treaty since gave way to an Indigenous protest movement in the 1970s. The activism prompted a Māori renaissance – immersion language pre-schools, billions of dollars in settlements between the government and tribes, and inclusion in law of the Treaty’s principles, which promise Māori a say in decision-making and protection of their interests. Much of the legal recognition is due to be revised. This week’s order to public servants to stop targeting policy initiatives by race -- unless it was proven as the only contributing factor to a problem -- was insidious because it did not require a parliamentary vote, Dymus-Turei said. 'The government are not just using legislative measures, they’re using their directive powers within their ministries' to repeal Māori rights, she added. Māori die on average seven years younger than non-Māori for women and eight years younger for men. They record higher rates of health issues — including cancers and respiratory and heart problems — that policies such as earlier screening and free doctors’ visits have sought to address. Speaking to reporters Friday, Seymour denied the directive was anti-Māori. Policy should be 'based on equal rights for each and every citizen, no matter what your background,' he said, adding that health issues where Māori disproportionately suffered could be explained by poverty or lack of housing, which affect other New Zealanders too — although Māori are disadvantaged in both. Seymour has also secured a pledge that parliament will consider his proposed law drastically redefining the Treaty of Waitangi’s principles. Luxon has promised the bill will not succeed, but it will be open for public submissions. Detractors warn this threatens months of racially charged debate about a matter that many New Zealanders consider long settled. 'The wording is so vague that if something like that were to ever go through, you would see decades of court cases and probably greater rights for Māori,' said Thomas. 'But none of that matters because the bill is a cipher for people to project all of their feelings and frustrations about the place of Māori in society.' A greater threat to Māori rights, Thomas said, was a concession won by New Zealand First, led by Winston Peters, to review and either repeal or replace all mentions of the Treaty of Waitangi in New Zealand law, with a few exceptions. 'This is not the prime ministership that Luxon expected or planned for or wanted,' said Thomas, adding that ACT and New Zealand First had gained power unprecedented for minor parties. Luxon on Tuesday promoted his government’s record on Māori matters in Parliament, citing plans to improve literacy and numeracy and to move children out of emergency housing. 'When I actually think about what we’re doing to rebuild this economy, giving tax relief for Māori families to support them in a cost of living crisis, we’re a government focused on outcomes and we're improving them for Māori and non-Māori,' he said. Luxon took Māori language lessons ahead of an election campaign in which he pledged to change the names of public agencies — some have adopted Māori titles in recent years — back to English. The turmoil has arisen as a fresh Māori political movement has come of age. Māori lawmakers — including Seymour and Peters — hold 33 of Parliament’s 123 seats, six of them representing a Māori political party. But Thomas said the previous left-wing government didn't do a good job of explaining its 'completely defensible' policies advancing Māori rights, with the coronavirus pandemic and cost of living crisis amplifying the backlash. Māori — who are nearly 20% of New Zealand’s population and disproportionately young — were more ready to oppose challenges to their rights than generations before, said Henry. 'The last 55, 60 years of Māori protest transformed the country that I was born into 70 years ago,' she said. 'We’ve been galvanized into action, which I think is really positive.'	https://apnews.com/article/maori-zealand-treaty-waitangi-principles-luxon-seymour-5390951314bc5c5e690ad192043b6913	2024-09-17T18:18:10-07:00	
Voting for local government opens in Indian-controlled Kashmir for first time after losing autonomy	SRINAGAR, India (AP) — The three-phased election for choosing a local government in Indian-controlled Kashmir opened early Wednesday in the first such vote since Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government stripped the disputed region of its special status five years ago. Authorities deployed thousands of additional police and paramilitary soldiers in the region’s seven southern districts where over 2.3 million residents are eligible to cast their votes and chose 24 lawmakers out of 219 candidates in the first phase of the polling. Wearing riot gears and carrying assault rifles, troops set up checkpoints and patrolled the constituencies in the districts as locals lined up to cast their votes in villages and towns. The second and third phases are scheduled for Sept. 25 and Oct. 1 in a process that is staggered to allow troops to move around to stop potential violence. Votes will be counted on Oct. 8, with results expected that day. For the first time, authorities limited access of foreign media to polling stations and denied press credentials to most journalists working with international media, including to The Associated Press, without citing any reason. Press passes issued by election authorities are mandatory for journalists to travel and film, photograph or interview voters in a polling constituency. India and Pakistan each administer part of Kashmir, but both claim the territory in its entirety. Militants in the Indian-controlled portion of Kashmir have been fighting New Delhi’s rule since 1989. Most Muslim Kashmiris support the rebels’ goal of uniting the territory, either under Pakistani rule or as an independent country. India insists the Kashmir militancy is Pakistan-sponsored terrorism. Pakistan denies the charge, and most Kashmiris consider it a legitimate freedom struggle. Tens of thousands of civilians, rebels and government forces have been killed in the conflict. The vote is the first in a decade, and the first since Modi’s Hindu nationalist government in 2019 scrapped the Muslim-majority region’s semi-autonomy, downgraded the former state to a federally governed territory and stripped its separate constitution and inherited protections on land and jobs. It was also divided into two federal territories, Ladakh and Jammu-Kashmir, ruled directly by New Delhi, allowing it to appoint administrators to run the territories along unelected bureaucrats and security personnel. Many people said they knew their votes won’t solve the dispute over Kashmir, but provided a rare window to express their frustration with direct Indian control. Aamir Ahmed, a first-time voter in Pulwama town, said it was important to elect a local representative 'who does not condone wrongdoing.' 'We have witnessed a lot of suffering in the last 10 years,' Ahmed said. Another voter, 80-year-old farmer Ali Mohammad Alai, said he had been 'reduced to penury by the Modi government' after authorities took away his land given to him decades ago for cultivation by the local administration. 'All I want is to get that land back,' he said. 'Our own government can do that.' People in the Kashmir Valley had layered rights to use of land since reforms in the 1950s that mainly gave Muslim farmers possession of land they tilled for the minority Hindu rulers and its elite. Some of those rights were rescinded after 2019 changes. Voter turnout was slow early Wednesday but long lines of voters stretched around some polling booths as the day progressed. In Kishtwar town, multiple voters said they hoped the polling would culminate in a government that cared about economic development and addressed their main issues. 'Be it BJP or some other party or a coalition, we urgently want development and better life. Politics can wait,' said Chander Jeet Sharma, 49. The multistage election will allow Kashmir to have its own truncated government and a local legislature, called an assembly, instead of remaining under New Delhi’s direct rule. A chief minister will head a council of ministers in the government. However, there will be a limited transition of power from New Delhi to the local assembly as Kashmir will continue to be a 'Union Territory' — directly controlled by the federal government — with India’s Parliament remaining its main legislator. The elected government will have partial control over areas like education, culture and taxation but not over the police. Kashmir’s statehood must be restored for the new government to have powers similar to other states of India. Multiple local parties have campaigned on promises to fight for reversal of 2019 changes and address other key issues like rising unemployment and inflation in the region where locals have struggled amid curtailed civil liberties particularly after the revocation of the special status. India's ruling BJP, however, has vowed to block any move aimed at undoing those changes but promised to help in the region’s economic development. The region’s last assembly election was held in 2014, after which Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party for the first time ruled in a coalition with the local Peoples Democratic Party. But the government collapsed in 2018, after BJP withdrew from the coalition. Polls in the past have been marked with violence, boycotts and vote-rigging, even though India called them a victory over separatism. ___ Follow AP's Asia-Pacific coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/asia-pacific	https://apnews.com/article/kashmir-election-india-pakistan-conflict-197e0720c55fad094535e2a5d6907b59	2024-09-17T17:07:46-07:00	
Stock market today: Asia shares rise moderately ahead of closely watched Federal Reserve meeting	TOKYO (AP) — Asian shares were trading mixed Wednesday as markets focused on prospects for the U.S. Federal Reserve’s first cut to interest rates in more than four years. The Bank of Japan and the Bank of England are also holding monetary policy meetings later this week. But neither central bank is expected to move on rates, although the language of what the officials say could be an indicator of later moves and still influence markets. Japan’s Nikkei 225 gained 0.2% in afternoon trading to 36,269.04. Australia’s S&amp;P/ASX 200 inched down nearly 0.1% to 8,134.40. South Korea’s Kospi added 0.1% to 8,134.40. Trading was closed in Hong Kong for a national holiday. The Shanghai Composite index edged 0.1% lower to 2,701.15. The Fed’s announcement is scheduled for Wednesday, with the overwhelming expectation on Wall Street for a cut to the federal funds rate. The rate has been in a range of 5.25% to 5.50% for over a year. Lower rates would help boost the slowing economy, as it has become increasingly more expensive to borrow money for everything from houses to cars to corporate debt. The Fed has been keeping its main interest rate at a two-decade high in hopes of grinding down on the economy enough to stifle high inflation. In Japan, the nation's trade deficit totaled 695 billion yen, or $4.9 billion, down 26% from a year earlier, according to the Finance Ministry, recording a deficit for the second month straight. Exports totaled 8.4 trillion yen ($59 billion), up 5.6% from the same month the previous year. Shipments to Asia rose while exports to the U.S. fell. Imports totaled 9.1 trillion yen ($64 billion), up 2.3% from a year earlier. By region, imports from European nations, in categories such as pharmaceuticals, showed the strongest growth. Both numbers fell short of forecasts for 10% growth in exports and and even higher increases for imports. The Japanese yen has gained in value against the U.S. dollar in recent weeks, helping to boost the country’s purchasing power. The dollar had traded at levels over 150 yen earlier this year but in recent days has dipped. The U.S. dollar slipped to 141.33 Japanese yen from 142.34 yen. The euro cost $1.1123, up from $1.1117. On Tuesday, the S&amp;P 500 edged up less than 0.1% to 5,634.58. It remains 0.6% below its all-time closing high set in July, and it briefly rose above that mark during the morning. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped less than 0.1% to 41,606.18 from its own record set the day before, while the Nasdaq composite edged up by 35.93, or 0.2%, to 17,628.06. Intel helped drive the market with a gain of 2.7% following a series of announcements, including an expansion of its partnership with Amazon Web Services to produce custom chips. Intel also detailed plans to build its foundry business. But some reports released Tuesday on the U.S. economy were better than expected, including one on U.S. consumer spending. That’s likely a sign the American economy will not nose-dive into a recession. A separate report said U.S. industrial production returned to growth in August and was stronger than economists expected. In the bond market, the 10-year Treasury yield rose to 3.64% from 3.62% late Monday. The two-year yield, which more closely tracks expectations for the Fed’s actions, rose to 3.59% from 3.56%. In energy dealings, benchmark U.S. crude declined 47 cents to $70.72 a barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, fell 51 cents to $73.19 a barrel.	https://apnews.com/article/stock-markets-fed-rates-recession-7e41dab05ea85531991cd69a7d2524bb	2024-09-17T17:01:11-07:00	
March for Bolivia's ex-President Morales turns violent, as political crisis escalates	CARACOLLO, Bolivia (AP) — Thousands of anti-government demonstrators marching in support of Bolivia’s former President Evo Morales clashed on Tuesday with counterprotesters blocking their way, a stark sign of an escalating power struggle in the volatile Andean nation. In his most brazen show of force yet against current President Luis Arce, Morales sent word to his followers to mobilize what he called a 'March to Save Bolivia,' a 190-kilometer (118 mile)-trek from the small village of Caracollo to the capital, La Paz, denouncing the government of his protege-turned-bitter rival. Morales, a former coca grower, has retained significant support among poor and Indigenous Bolivians despite his resignation in 2019 amid mass protests over his disrupted re-election. The march in solidarity with him began peacefully Tuesday morning, but turned violent hours later when hundreds of counterprotesters, armed with tear gas bombs, stones and firecrackers, spread across the highway waiting to confront the nearly 10,000 marchers. Some of them set a giant effigy of Morales on fire. The Morales supporters, raising multi-colored Indigenous flags and chanting against Bolivia's economic crisis, surged toward them, using slingshots to pelt their adversaries with rocks as police in pickup trucks and on motorbikes looked on. Morales' followers soon forced the counterprotesters to retreat, their shouts — 'Evo, Bolivia wants you back!' — drowning out the pro-Arce activists who chanted, 'Evo, you traitor, your time has passed.' A top official in Arce's government, Eduardo Del Castillo, told reporters that 13 people were injured in the scuffles, including three police officers. Associated Press reporters saw some pro-Morales marchers chasing the counterdemonstrators into the rolling Andean highlands on either side of the highway, beating them with sticks, pushing them to the ground and kicking them. Arce and his ministers accused Morales of trying to orchestrate a coup. Using exaggerated, apocalyptic rhetoric, Del Castillo denounced Morales’ protest as a 'death march' and said that the former president seeks 'to destroy democracy in Bolivia and end the lives of Bolivians.' He denied that police used force against peaceful protesters, insisting that officers were attacked first. Morales, for his part, claimed that the government sent plainclothes police officers to stir up trouble and vandalize protesters' vehicles, saying that Arce's government 'has lost respect for human rights and laws in the country.' The mood was largely defiant late Tuesday at a protest encampment in Panduro, in the mining state of Oruro, where the road weary marchers spent the night. 'The government is the one that sent police officers to try to stop us, but we were united and defeated them,' said Yamile Cruz, leader of Frutcas, a group of Indigenous farmers on the edge of the world’s largest salt flat. 'This march will not retreat despite the government's intentions.' Tuesday's mayhem deepened the rift at the top of Bolivia’s governing party, threatening to take the political feud between Morales and Arce into a dramatic new phase. Morales, Bolivia's first Indigenous President who oversaw the country's commodities boom from 2006 to 2019, seeks to run against Arce, his former economy minister, in next year's presidential election. Protesters at the march Tuesday demanded that Morales be allowed on the 2025 electoral ballot despite a ruling by Bolivia’s constitutional court last year that Arce insists disqualifies him. Morales has dismissed the court resolution as politically motivated. 'They not only want to disqualify me, they want to restrict political rights,' Morales told reporters at the march. 'Above all, we want the president and his government to heed our demands.' Cracks in the governing Movement Toward Socialism, or MAS, first opened in 2019, when Morales ran for an unconstitutional third term. He won a contested vote plagued by allegations of fraud, setting off mass protests that caused 36 deaths and prompted Morales to resign and flee the country. He returned and launched his political comeback after Arce, his choice candidate at the time, won the 2020 election. The political rivalry has divided Congress and exacerbated an economic crisis stemming from the depletion of Bolivia’s foreign-exchange reserves. Protesters on Tuesday decried Arce's failure to halt the spiral and recalled Morales' tenure as one of economic growth and social uplift. 'We are suffering from hunger,' said Felix Torres, a peasant protester from the highlands. 'This is not how you govern.' ___ Associated Press writer Isabel DeBre in Buenos Aires, Argentina, contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/bolivia-evo-morales-arce-struggle-protest-violence-police-14888ebce41ed3479801dd054cc285c9	2024-09-17T15:42:46-07:00	
Colombia's president says attack on army base 'practically ends' peace talks with ELN rebels	BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) — An attack on a military base in eastern Colombia killed two soldiers and injured at least 21, Colombia's military said on Tuesday, as tensions escalate between Colombia's government and one of the nation's largest remaining rebel groups. Colombia's military blamed the National Liberation Army for the attack, with President Gustavo Petro hinting late on Tuesday that the attack will lead to a suspension, or a cancellation of peace talks with the rebel group. 'This is an attack that practically closes a peace process, with blood,' Petro said during a ceremony, in which he named a new judge to one of Colombia's highest courts. The National Liberation Army, or ELN, ended a cease-fire with the Colombian government in August, but is still involved in peace talks aimed at ending more than five decades of conflict. The army said Tuesday that the group fired homemade rockets from a cargo truck that had been parked near a base in Puerto Jordan, a small town in Colombia's Arauca province. The ELN was founded in the early 1960s by union leaders and university students inspired by the Cuban Revolution. The group has an estimated 6,000 fighters in Colombia and Venezuela and finances itself through drug trafficking and illegal gold mines. Recently the ELN has been spreading into rural areas abandoned by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, the large rebel group that made a peace deal with Colombia's government in 2016. After being elected two years ago, President Gustavo Petro quickly launched peace talks with the ELN and several smaller armed groups under a policy known as total peace. But talks with ELN floundered as the group continued to conduct kidnappings and tax civilians in areas under its control. The ELN has also expressed its frustration with a recent effort by Colombia's government to start separate peace negotiations with one of its splinter groups in southwest Colombia. A cease-fire between the government and ELN expired at the end of August and was not renewed. Since then, the group has stepped up its attacks on military targets and oil pipelines in Colombia's Arauca province. In a message published on X, Colombia's defense ministry said it would act with 'firmness and resolve to restore security and stability' in Arauca province. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america	https://apnews.com/article/eln-colombia-army-attacks-petro-99207930a4969a47809ddff8ec7fe8b5	2024-09-17T14:55:42-07:00	
At least 30 killed as factions of the Sinaloa Cartel clash in northern Mexico	MEXICO CITY (AP) — At least 30 people have been killed in the past two weeks in Mexico's northern state of Sinaloa as two factions of the powerful Sinaloa cartel continue to clash, authorities said Tuesday. Defense Secretary Luis Cresencio Sandoval said that two military personnel were among those killed in the fighting that started Sept. 9, despite the presence of more than 2,000 security personnel. The surge in violence had been expected after Joaquín Guzmán López, a son of former Sinaloa cartel leader Joaquín 'El Chapo' Guzmán, landed near El Paso, Texas on July 25 in a small plane with Ismael 'El Mayo' Zambada. Zambada was the cartel’s elder figure and reclusive leader. After his arrest, he said in a letter circulated by his lawyer that he had been abducted by the younger Guzmán and taken to the U.S. against his will. Now there appears to be a struggle for power between the remaining sons of El Chapo, known locally as 'the Chapitos,' and those loyal to Zambada. The clashes in the state’s capital Culiacan are the latest example of the violence that continues to plague Mexico, where cartels employ increasingly sophisticated forms of warfare, including roadside bombs or IEDs, trenches, home-made armored vehicles and bomb-dropping drones. Since the beginning of last week, Culiacan has been semi-paralyzed. Schools are empty, businesses are closed and there is almost no transportation due to people’s fear of being caught in the middle of a shootout. Sandoval said that 2,200 members of the armed forces and the National Guard were sent to Sinaloa to reinforce security and they haven't ruled out further military presence. On Monday, the regional army commander, Jesús Leana Ojeda, said the possibility of the situation calming down does not depend on them. 'It depends on the antagonistic groups to stop confronting each other,' he said at a news briefing. 'We, on the contrary, are here to prevent them from having confrontations and the loss of human lives,' he added. Although they have received reinforcements and military helicopters, Sinaloa's Gov. Rubén Rocha suspended schools last week and festivities around Mexican Independence Day over the weekend. Schools resumed classes Tuesday. Outgoing President Andrés Manuel López Obrador said Tuesday that the Armed Forces are protecting the population and ensuring that there are no clashes between criminal groups. Throughout his presidency, López Obrador has favored a 'hugs not bullets' strategy that seeks to avoid confrontation with cartels often causing tensions with the United States. He claims members are forced into criminality by a lack of opportunities, and his strategy offers job training programs for youths so they won’t become cartel gunmen. President-elect Claudia Sheinbaum has said she will maintain her predecessor’s security policy. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america	https://apnews.com/article/mexico-culiacan-violence-sinaloa-cartel-el-mayo-chapo-e980e88d2d6883b2fa5e8180a113a08b	2024-09-17T14:19:07-07:00	
US sends soldiers to Alaska amid Russian military activity increase in the area	ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) — The U.S. military has moved more than 100 soldiers along with mobile rocket launchers to a desolate island in the Aleutian chain of western Alaska amid a recent increase in Russian military planes and vessels approaching American territory. Eight Russian military planes and four navy vessels, including two submarines, have come close to Alaska in the past week as Russia and China conducted joint military drills. None of the planes breached U.S. airspace and a Pentagon spokesperson said Tuesday there was no cause for alarm. 'It’s not the first time that we’ve seen the Russians and the Chinese flying, you know, in the vicinity, and that’s something that we obviously closely monitor, and it’s also something that we’re prepared to respond to,' Pentagon spokesperson Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said at a news conference Tuesday. As part of a 'force projection operation' the Army on Sept. 12 sent the soldiers to Shemya Island, some 1,200 miles (1,930 kilometers) southwest of Anchorage, where the U.S. Air Force maintains an air station that dates to World War II. The soldiers brought two High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, or HIMARS, with them. U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, also said the U.S. military deployed a guided missile destroyer and a Coast Guard vessel to the western region of Alaska as Russia and China began the 'Ocean-24' military exercises in the Pacific and Arctic oceans Sept. 10. The North American Aerospace Defense Command said it detected and tracked Russian military planes operating off Alaska over a four-day span. There were two planes each on Sept. 11, Sept. 13, Sept. 14 and Sept. 15. Sullivan called for a larger military presence in the Aleutians while advocating the U.S. respond with strength to Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping. 'In the past two years, we’ve seen joint Russian-Chinese air and naval exercises off our shores and a Chinese spy balloon floating over our communities,' Sullivan said in a statement Tuesday. 'These escalating incidents demonstrate the critical role the Arctic plays in great power competition between the U.S., Russia, and China.' Sullivan said the U.S. Navy should reopen its shuttered base at Adak, located in the Aleutians. Naval Air Facility Adak was closed in 1997. ___ Associated Press writers Tara Copp and Lolita Baldor contributed from Washington, D.C.	https://apnews.com/article/alaska-russia-china-military-planes-aleutians-e47f7cf0e6f0618e2b6387505f393c34	2024-09-17T14:19:00-07:00	
South Korea and Japan say North Korea test-fired ballistic missiles in latest military display	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korea on Wednesday test-fired multiple ballistic missiles toward its eastern seas, the South Korean and Japanese militaries said, adding to its military demonstrations as tensions with Washington and neighbors escalate. The launches come days after North Korea offered a rare view into a secretive facility built to enrich uranium for nuclear bombs in a significant show of defiance against the United States and as leader Kim Jong Un called for a rapid expansion of his nuclear weapons program. South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said it detected North Korea firing multiple short-range ballistic missiles from a region north of its capital, Pyongyang, and said the weapons flew eastward. The joint chiefs said it was closely communicating with the United States and Japan over the launches but didn’t immediately provide more details. Japan’s defense ministry said it detected at least two launches but didn’t immediately say what types of missiles they were and how far they flew. Japan’s coast guard said the missiles were believed to have already fallen into waters between the Korean Peninsula and Japan and urged vessels to watch out for falling objects. Japan’s NHK television said the missiles were believed to have landed outside of Japan’s exclusive economic zone. The launches followed a previous round of ballistic tests last week as Kim vowed to have his nuclear force fully ready for battle with its rivals. The North said the launches on Sept. 12 involved its 'super-large' 600mm multiple rocket launchers, which it describes as capable of delivering tactical nuclear warheads. Experts say North Korea’s large-sized artillery rockets blur the boundary between artillery systems and ballistic missiles because they can create their own thrust and are guided during delivery. Since 2022, North Korea has ramped up its weapons testing activities to expand and modernize its arsenal of nuclear missiles targeting the U.S. and South Korea. Analysts say North Korea could conduct a nuclear test explosion or long-range missile test ahead of the U.S. presidential election in November with the intent of influencing the outcome and increasing its leverage in future dealings with the new U.S. administration. — Yamaguchi reported from Tokyo.	https://apnews.com/article/north-korea-ballistic-missile-tensions-af75c31d24dc53b0ae0db7260458563b	2024-09-17T13:48:07-07:00	
Venezuela's government says fourth US citizen was detained in alleged plot to kill President Maduro	CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) — Venezuela’s government Tuesday announced the arrest of a fourth U.S. citizen in connection with an alleged plot to kill President Nicolás Maduro in which authorities claim the CIA, Spain’s intelligence agency, organized crime groups, sex workers and members of the opposition are involved. Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello revealed the arrest and details of the plot during a speech before the National Assembly, whose members applauded the detention. Cabello did not identify the most recently detained American. The alleged plan joins dozens of other anti-Maduro plans that his government earlier this year claimed to have foiled. 'Those who try to mess with Venezuela, we will screw them, regardless of their name,' Cabello said. He spoke hours after an independent panel of experts backed by the United Nations’ Human Rights Council issued a scathing report against Maduro’s government, accusing it of deploying the 'harshest and most violent mechanisms of its repressive apparatus' in the wake of the disputed July presidential election. Cabello told lawmakers that the objective of the latest alleged plot 'is political.' He claimed the U.S. citizen detained Tuesday in the capital, Caracas, had taken photos of electrical and oil-industry infrastructure and military units. 'It is not the first time he has come to Venezuela,' Cabello said, without identifying the man. He insisted, without providing evidence, that the CIA designed, promoted and financed the plot and Spain's National Intelligence Center was aware of it. Cabello on Saturday announced the arrests of three Americans, two Spaniards and a Czech citizen in connection with the alleged plan. He identified one of the U.S. citizens as Wilbert Joseph Castañeda Gomez, whom he claimed is a Navy SEAL who had served in Afghanistan, Iraq and Colombia. 'Any claims of U.S. involvement in a plot to overthrow Maduro are categorically false. The United States continues to support a democratic solution to the political crisis in Venezuela,' the Department of State said in a statement after the initial arrests were announced. Cabello on Tuesday also linked to the alleged plot sex workers who were supposedly in contact with the foreigners, and members of the main opposition coalition. Tensions between Venezuela’s government and the U.S. have increased since the presidential election, whose result sparked protests across the South American country that resulted in the arrests of more than 2,000 people, including minors, and the deaths of two dozen. Venezuela’s National Electoral Council, which is stacked with Maduro loyalists, said Maduro won a third six-year term, but it did not provide a detailed breakdown of the results. Members of the opposition, however, surprised the government by collecting tally sheets from 80% of the nation’s electronic voting machines and publishing them online. The tally sheets, they said, indicate that former diplomat Edmundo González won the election with twice as many votes as Maduro.	https://apnews.com/article/venezuela-maduro-cabello-us-citizens-detentions-37ac41480d06d26ee7bfc135701f1e4e	2024-09-17T13:31:36-07:00	
AP PHOTOS: Hallmarks of climate change seen in floods, fires and drought around the globe	The hallmarks of climate change — extreme heat and drought; larger, more intense wildfires and supercharged hurricanes, typhoons and rainstorms that lead to catastrophic flooding — are being seen and felt around the globe. Drought in Brazil. Wildfires in Portugal, Peru and the Western U.S. Severe flooding swamping Central Europe, Southeast Asia and Western Africa. Multiple wildfires Firefighters across northern Portugal are working to contain some 100 wildfires caused by hot, dry conditions, stretching crews thin. Fires have forced residents to flee their homes and are blamed for the deaths of at least six people, including four firefighters. In Peru, wildfires have left at least 15 people dead since July and 22 of the nation's 24 regions have active outbreaks. Peru’s National Forest and Wildlife Service, SERFOR, says the effects of climate change are intensifying conditions that help spread fire. In Brazil, flames were burning through Brasilia National Park. And in California, more than 8,000 firefighters were battling three major fires, all ignited during a triple-digit heatwave at the start of the month. Smoke filled Los Angeles skies while fire threatened tens of thousands of homes and other structures. Hot and dry Brazil is enduring its worst drought since nationwide measurements began over seven decades ago, with almost 60% of the country, stretching from the north to the southeast, under stress. It's affecting neighboring Paraguay, too. Drought in Brazil’s Pantanal region led on Monday to the lowest water levels on the Paraguay River in more than a century, disrupting commerce on the major waterway and creating hazards for local transport. Officials say water levels on the river dipped 89 centimeters (35 inches) below a benchmark at the port of Asunción, the capital, the lowest point in 120 years. Hot, dry conditions also are behind wildfires in Portugal. And in Africa, severe drought prompted Zimbabwe and Namibia this month to announce plans to slaughter hundreds of wild elephants and other animals to stave off hunger in needy communities. Too much water Typhoon Yagi is blamed for more than 500 deaths in Southeast Asia, almost half of them in Myanmar, where the combination of that storm and seasonal monsoon rains triggered floods and landslides. The typhoon swept into Myanmar after hitting the Philippines, Vietnam, northern Thailand and Laos, killing hundreds and leaving scores of people missing. Thousands of miles away, Central Europe is struggling to cope with heavy rains and widespread flooding that's killed six people in Romania and one each in Austria and Poland. In the Czech Republic, four people were swept away by waters and missing, police said. Authorities say flooding could hit Croatia, Hungary and Slovakia in the coming days. Parts of southeastern North Carolina were under water after an unnamed tropical storm dumped more than 20 inches of rain. Highways in Brunswick County were still flooded Tuesday, a day after about 18 inches of rain fell in 12 hours in Carolina Beach. The same area has seen four other major floods in the past 25 years. And West Africa has experienced some of the heaviest flooding in decades this year, affecting over 2.3 million people, a threefold increase from 2023, according to the United Nations. Unusually high rains caused a major dam in Nigeria to collapse, killing 30 and displacing over 1 million. Authorities also say 281 inmates escaped after floods brought down a prison’s walls in the country’s northeast. ___ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Israel has a long history of pulling off complex attacks like the exploding pagers	JERUSALEM (AP) — Hezbollah and the Lebanese government were quick to blame Israel for the nearly simultaneous detonation of hundreds of pagers used by the militant group's members in an attack Tuesday that killed at least nine people and wounded nearly 3,000 others, according to officials. Many of those hit were members of militant group Hezbollah, but it wasn't immediately clear if others also carried the pagers. Among those killed were the son of a prominent Hezbollah politician and an 8-year-old girl, according to Lebanon's health minister. The attack came amid rising tensions between Israel and Iran-backed Hezbollah, which have exchanged fire across the Israel-Lebanon border since the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas that sparked the war in Gaza. Iran’s ambassador to Lebanon was among those injured by the pager explosions. Israel rarely takes responsibility for such attacks, and its military declined to comment Tuesday. However, the country has a long history of carrying out sophisticated remote operations, ranging from intricate cyberattacks to remote-controlled machine guns targeting leaders in drive-by shootings, suicide drone attacks, and the detonation of explosions in secretive underground Iranian nuclear facilities. Here is a look at previous operations that have been attributed to Israel: July 2024 Two major militant leaders in Beirut and Tehran were killed in deadly strikes within hours of each other. Hamas said Israel was behind the assassination of its supreme leader, Ismail Haniyeh, in Iran’s capital. Although Israel didn't acknowledge playing a role in that attack, it did claim responsibility for a deadly strike hours earlier on Fouad Shukur, a top Hezbollah commander in Beirut. July 2024 Israel targeted Hamas’ shadowy military commander, Mohammed Deif, in a massive strike in the crowded southern Gaza Strip. The strike killed at least 90 people, including children, according to local health officials. The Israeli military said in August that Deif was killed in the attack, though Hamas previously claimed he survived. April 2024 Two Iranian generals were killed in what Iran said was an Israeli strike on the Iranian consulate in Syria. The deaths led Iran to launch an unprecedented attack on Israel that involved about 300 missiles and drones, most of which were intercepted. January 2024 An Israeli drone strike in Beirut killed Saleh Arouri, a top Hamas official in exile, as Israeli troops fight the militant group in Gaza. December 2023 Seyed Razi Mousavi, a longtime adviser of the Iranian paramilitary Revolutionary Guard in Syria, was killed in a drone attack outside of Damascus. Iran blamed Israel. 2021 An underground nuclear facility in central Iran was hit with explosions and a devastating cyberattack that caused rolling blackouts. Iran accused Israel of carrying out the attack as well as several others against Iranian nuclear facilities using explosive drones in the ensuing years. 2020 In one of the most prominent assassinations targeting Iran's nuclear program, a top Iranian military nuclear scientist, Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, was killed by a remote-controlled machine gun while traveling in a car outside Tehran. Iran blamed Israel. 2019 An Israeli airstrike hit the home of Bahaa Abu el-Atta, a senior Islamic Jihad commander in the Gaza Strip, killing him and his wife. 2012 Ahmad Jabari, head of Hamas’ armed wing, was killed when an airstrike targets his car. His death sparked an eight-day war between Hamas and Israel. 2010 The Stuxnet computer virus, discovered in 2010, disrupted and destroyed Iranian nuclear centrifuges. It was widely believed to be a joint U.S.-Israeli creation. 2010 Mahmoud al-Mabhouh, a top Hamas operative, was killed in a Dubai hotel room in an operation attributed to the Mossad spy agency but never acknowledged by Israel. Many of the 26 supposed assassins were caught on camera disguised as tourists. 2008 Imad Mughniyeh, Hezbollah’s military chief, was killed when a bomb planted in his car exploded in Damascus. Mughniyeh was accused of engineering suicide bombings during Lebanon’s civil war and of planning the 1985 hijacking of a TWA airliner in which a U.S. Navy diver was killed. Hezbollah blamed his killing on Israel. His son Jihad Mughniyeh was killed in an Israeli strike in 2015. 2004 Hamas' spiritual leader, Ahmed Yassin, was killed in an Israeli helicopter strike while being pushed in his wheelchair. Yassin, who was paralyzed in a childhood accident, was among the founders of Hamas in 1987. His successor, Abdel Aziz Rantisi, was killed in an Israeli airstrike less than a month later. 2002 Hamas’s second-highest military leader, Salah Shehadeh, was killed by a one-ton bomb dropped on an apartment building in Gaza City. 1997 Mossad agents tried to kill the head of Hamas at the time, Khaled Mashaal, in Amman, Jordan. Two agents entered Jordan using fake Canadian passports and poison Mashaal by placing a device near his ear. They were captured shortly afterward and Jordan’s king threatened to void a still-fresh peace accord if Mashaal died. Israel ultimately dispatched an antidote, and the Israeli agents were returned home. Mashaal remains a senior figure in Hamas. 1996 Yahya Ayyash, nicknamed the 'engineer' for his mastery in building bombs for Hamas, was killed by answering a rigged phone in Gaza. His assassination triggered a series of deadly bus bombings in Israel. 1995 Islamic Jihad founder Fathi Shikaki was shot in the head in Malta in an assassination widely believed to have been carried out by Israel. 1988 Palestine Liberation Organization military chief Khalil al-Wazir was killed in Tunisia. Better known as Abu Jihad, he had been PLO chief Yasser Arafat’s deputy. In 2012, military censors allowed an Israeli paper to reveal details of the Israeli raid for the first time. 1973 Israeli commandos shot a number of PLO leaders in their apartments in Beirut, in a nighttime raid led by Ehud Barak, who later became Israel’s top army commander and prime minister. The operation was part of a string of Israeli assassinations of Palestinian leaders that were carried out in retaliation for the killings of 11 Israeli coaches and athletes at the 1972 Munich Olympics.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-lebanon-hezbollah-pagers-hamas-826a71b87e395f0195f877e4e9d238f1	2024-09-17T12:13:38-07:00	
Milan Fashion Week opens with light, ethereal yet grounded looks from Fendi, Ferretti and Marni	MILAN (AP) — Just as the northern hemisphere starts the wardrobe transition from summer to fall, runway shows in the world’s fashion capitals seek to stir the imagination, and desire, for the next warm weather season. Milan designers have been ambiguous about seasons in recent fashion weeks, with summer collections not corresponding to the soaring temperatures. That was not the case during the first day of Milan Fashion Week previews on Tuesday, featuring diaphanous, dreamy summery dresses, alongside crisp cotton. Here are highlights from the first day of Milan Fashion Week of runway previews of mostly womenswear for Spring-Summer 2025: Fendi centenary Fendi honored its upcoming centenary with a Spring-Summer 2025 collection that paid elegant homage to the founding era, from art deco detailing to a flapper silhouette, light on the fringe. In snippets of conversation that punctuated the show's soundtrack, Silvia Venturini Fendi emphasized the matriarchal lineage that has made her the third generation to play a key Fendi role. 'My mother was the energy of the house,' Venturini Fendi recalled. The collection by Fendi womenswear artistic director Kim Jones sought to spotlight '100 years of very chic Roman women,' combining ready-to-wear with artisanal detailing of couture. Diaphanous dresses with art-deco embroidery were grounded with boots. Slip dresses were turned upside down as skirts, worn with a sheer top embellished with crystals. Knitwear defined the silhouette, under sheers or hugging the body over diaphanous trousers. Bags by Venturini Fendi, artistic director of accessories, were soft and huggable, often carried in triplicate. Ferretti's artisanal summer Alberta Ferretti showed her summery creations in the courtyard of a former cloister, now a science museum, with an elegant dome rising in the background, the juxtaposition emphasizing the artisanal heritage in her collection. Instead of embellishments, Ferretti focused on technique. Laser cut cotton created an almost lace effect. Individual cotton leaves were stitched together as dresses or accents on bodices. Pleating elevated dresses, while boxer shorts gave a casual flair. The day looks were in earthy tones of sand, ecru and black. For evening, chiffon dresses flowed in bright shades. 'They are real summer clothes, because the world in the summer is very warm. I know a show is supposed to be a show but reality is important,’’ Ferretti said backstage. Marni's essential beauty Marni maintained its zany heritage under creative director Francesco Risso, with a wardrobe of whimsically tailored everyday looks for him and for her. The female silhouette was swathed in form-fitting dresses and skirts, often with deep back slits, sometimes with a mermaid flair. Feathers, boas and crystal embellishments were pretty, and sometimes off-beat accents. For him, broad shouldered jackets contrasted with skinny trousers. An off-skew bow on a chiffony blouson was kept aloft through some sartorial trickery. Mixing art with fashion, models emerged in threes, and wandered through the showroom full of wooden chairs on conversational groups to a percussive piano trio. A sense of Marni whimsy permeated the collection, partly but not only through a series of hats with a yesteryear military flair made light with feathery accents. Risso appeared to confirm his Napoleonic intentions, taking a bow with his hand thrust inside his jacket. 'We like things that are bold,' Risso said after the show.	https://apnews.com/article/milan-fashion-week-spring-summer-51e6112c90d2d7a124e6a4590f232fcc	2024-09-17T11:26:22-07:00	
Hundreds of pagers exploded in Lebanon and Syria in a deadly attack. Here's what we know.	NEW YORK (AP) — In what appears to be a sophisticated, remote attack, pagers used by hundreds of members of Hezbollah exploded almost simultaneously in Lebanon and Syria Tuesday, killing at least nine people — including an 8-year-old girl — and wounding thousands more. The Iran-backed militant group blamed Israel for the deadly explosions, which targeted an extraordinary breadth of people and showed signs of being a long-planned operation. How the attack was executed is largely uncertain and investigators have not immediately said how the pagers were detonated. The Israeli military has declined to comment. Here's what we know so far. Why were pagers used in the attack? Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah previously warned the group’s members not to carry cellphones, saying they could be used by Israel to track the group's movements. As a result, the organization uses pagers to communicate. A Hezbollah official told The Associated Press the exploded devices were from a new brand the group had not used before. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to the press, did not identify the brand name or supplier. Nicholas Reese, adjunct instructor at the Center for Global Affairs in New York University’s School of Professional Studies, explains smart phones carry a higher risk for intercepted communications in contrast to the more simple technology of pagers. This type of attack will also force Hezbollah to change their communication strategies, said Reese, who previously worked as an intelligence officer, adding that survivors of Tuesday's explosions are likely to throw away 'not just their pagers, but their phones, and leaving their tablets or any other electronic devices.' How could sabotage cause these pagers to explode? With little disclosed from investigators so far, multiple theories have emerged Tuesday around how the attack might have been carried out. Several experts who spoke with The Associated Press suggest that the explosions were most likely the result of supply-chain interference. Very small explosive devices may have been built into the pagers prior to their delivery to Hezbollah, and then all remotely triggered simultaneously, possibly with a radio signal. By the time of the attack, 'the battery was probably half-explosive and half-actual battery,' said Carlos Perez, director of security intelligence at TrustedSec. A former British Army bomb disposal officer explained that an explosive device has five main components: A container, a battery, a triggering device, a detonator and an explosive charge. 'A pager has three of those already,' explained the ex-officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he now works as a consultant with clients on the Middle East. 'You would only need to add the detonator and the charge.' After security camera footage appeared on social media Tuesday purporting to show one of the pagers explode on a man’s hip in a Lebanese market, two munitions experts also said that the blast appeared to be the result of a tiny explosive device. 'Looking at the video, the size of the detonation is similar to that caused by an electric detonator alone or one that incorporates an extremely small, high-explosive charge,' said Sean Moorhouse, a former British Army officer and explosive ordinance disposal expert. This signals involvement of a state actor, Moorhouse said. He adds that Israel’s foreign intelligence agency, the Mossad, is the most obvious suspect to have the resources to carry out such an attack. N.R. Jenzen-Jones, an expert in military arms who is director of the Australian-based Armament Research Services, agreed that the scale and sophistication of the attack 'almost certainly points to a state actor,' and that Israel had been accused of carrying out such operations in the past. Last year, AP reported that Iran accused Israel of trying to sabotage its ballistic missile program through faulty foreign parts that could explode, damaging or destroying the weapons before they could be used. How long was this operation? It would take a long time to plan an attack of this scale. The exact specifics are still unknown, but experts who spoke with the AP shared estimates ranging anywhere between several months to two years. The sophistication of the attack suggests that whoever is behind it has been collecting intelligence for a long time, Reese explained. An attack of this caliber requires building the relationships needed to gain physical access to the pagers before they were sold; developing the technology that would be embedded in the devices; and developing sources who can confirm that the targets were carrying the pagers. And it's likely the compromised pagers seemed normal to their users for some time before the attack. Elijah J. Magnier, a Brussels-based veteran and a senior political risk analyst with over 37 years experience in the region, said he has had conversations with members of Hezbollah and survivors of Tuesday's pager attack. He said the pagers were procured more than six months ago. 'The pagers functioned perfectly for six months,' Magnier said. What triggered the explosion, he said, appeared to be an error message sent to all the devices. Based on his conversations with Hezbollah members, Magnier also said that many pagers didn’t go off, allowing the group to inspect them. They came to the conclusion that between 3 to 5 grams of a highly explosive material were concealed or embedded in the circuitry, he said. What else could have happened? Another possibility is that malware could have been inserted into the operating system of the pagers — somehow causing the device batteries to all overload at a specific time, causing them to burst into flame. According to a Hezbollah official and Lebanese security officials, the pagers first heated up and then exploded in the pockets, or the hands, of those carrying them Tuesday afternoon. These pagers run on lithium ion batteries, the Hezboolah official said, claiming the devices exploded as the result of being targeted from an Israeli 'security operation,' without elaborating further. When overheated, lithium ion batteries can smoke, melt and even catch on fire. Rechargeable lithium batteries are used in consumer products ranging from cellphones and laptops to electric cars. Lithium battery fires can burn up to 590 C (1,100 F). Still, Moorhouse and others noted that images and video footage seen Tuesday more strongly resembled the detonation of small explosive charge, not an overheating battery. 'A lithium ion battery fire is one thing, but I’ve never seen one explode like that. It looks like a small explosive charge,' said Alex Plitsas, a non-resident fellow at the Atlantic Council who leads their initiative studying the future of global terrorism threats and counter-terrorism efforts. Among those pointing to the likelihood of a supply chain attack is Jenzen-Jones, who adds that 'such a large-scale operation also raises questions of targeting' — stressing the number of causalities and enormous impact reported so far. 'How can the party initiating the explosive be sure that a target’s child, for example, is not playing with the pager at the time it functions?' he said.	https://apnews.com/article/lebanon-israel-hezbollah-pager-explosion-e9493409a0648b846fdcadffdb02d71e	2024-09-17T10:11:49-07:00	
Vatican opens new investigation into leaks surrounding its 'trial of the century' probe	ROME (AP) — The Vatican prosecutor has opened a new investigation into the alleged leak of information about its 'trial of the century' probe into a London property investment, the Holy See said Tuesday. The leak emerged during the course of a broader, separate Italian investigation into the actions of a financial police official who is accused of abusively accessing a police database and providing information from it to journalists. According to Italian media reports, the names of four of the key suspects in the Vatican’s trial were among hundreds of names accessed from the Italian police database. Their data was accessed in July of 2019, right around the time Vatican prosecutors opened their investigation into the London property. At the time, only a handful of people in the Vatican knew about the investigation, including the pope, the prosecutors’ office and the Vatican gendarmes, many of whom have ties to Italian law enforcement since they worked there before joining the Vatican. The Vatican’s chief prosecutor, Alessandro Diddi and the head of the city-state’s gendarmes, Gianluca Gauzzi, met Tuesday in Perugia with the Italian chief prosecutor, Raffaele Cantone, who is heading up the broader Italian probe into the database case, according to a Vatican communique. According to the statement, the reason for the meeting was to agree on launching a collaborative effort in the two, parallel investigations. The Vatican probe, it said, would be into the 'alleged abusive accesses made during the course of investigations in the well-known inquiry concerning the purchase of the London building.' Diddi prosecuted 10 people in connection with the London investment and other financial crimes, and in December the Vatican tribunal convicted nine of them, including the once-powerful Cardinal Angelo Becciu. The data of four of the other defendants convicted for various charges -- Cecilia Marogna, Raffaele Mincione, Gianluigi Torzi and Fabrizio Tirabassi -- were accessed from the Italian police database, according to La Stampa newspaper and other media reports. They were among hundreds of names that were accessed, including those of top Italian politicians, business, sporting and entertainment figures. According to the reports, the police official who accessed the information as well as three reporters from the Domani newspaper are under investigation as part of the Perugia probe. The newspaper's 2022 investigative reports on the Italian defense minister triggered the Perugia probe.	https://apnews.com/article/vatican-trial-london-3026e2d717be05c8ec4dcb6db1bb6098	2024-09-17T08:16:21-07:00	
Cyprus approves electricity cable to link its power grid with Greece's	NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) — Cyprus has given the green light for construction of a 1.9 billion euro ($2.1 billion) undersea electricity cable linking its grid with Greece's, aiming to sharply reduce electricity bills and end its energy isolation, the country's energy minister said Tuesday. Minister George Papanastasiou said the significance of the project is underscored by the European Union’s decision to fund it with the sum of 657 million euros ($735 million). He said the Cypriot government will contribute 25 million euro ($27.8 million) annually over the five-year period of the 1,000 MW cable’s construction so that Cypriot taxpayers won’t see any hike to their electricity bills. The total 125 million euro sum will be raised from revenues generated from the EU's emission trading system. Papanastasiou said the cable, expected to be completed by the end of 2029, is part of a series of projects including the planned introduction of natural gas to the island nation's energy mix, that aims to 'further accelerate the country's medium-term economic development and the welfare of its citizens.' Officials said Cypriot consumers stand to gain a drop in their electricity bills of as much as 40% once the cable is completed. The cable's operating costs will be split down the middle by both Cypriot and Greek consumers. Officials also said that the project will carry a guaranteed return on investment of 8.3%, considered attractive for potential investors. The U.S. and the United Arab Emirates have expressed interest in investing in the project, officials said. It's envisioned that the cable will eventually continue from Cyprus to connect with Israel's electricity grid.	https://apnews.com/article/cyprus-greece-electricity-cable-grid-undersea-92e201ae94205cd0d3308aeb2f34db97	2024-09-17T07:57:48-07:00	
Overseas threats hit the Ohio city where Trump and Vance lies slandered Haitians over dogs and cats	SPRINGFIELD, Ohio (AP) — Ohio stationed state police at Springfield schools Tuesday in response to a rash of bomb threats — the vast majority that officials said came from overseas —- after former President Donald Trump and his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance falsely said legal Haitian immigrants in the small city were eating dogs and cats. Schools, government buildings and elected officials' homes in Springfield were among the targets of more than 30 hoax threats made last week that forced evacuations and closures. Two more schools had to be evacuated on Monday. Republican Gov. Mike DeWine said that a foreign actor was largely responsible, but he declined to name the country. 'The vast majority of the bomb threats came from foreign countries. Not 100%, but it’s the vast majority,' Dan Tierney, DeWine's spokesperson, said Tuesday. Tierney said a criminal investigation by multiple law enforcement agencies yielded information on the origin of the bomb threats. He was not more specific on how investigators determined they came from a foreign country, nor would he reveal the name of the country, saying that could encourage additional threats. 'These are largely foreign actors, not folks in the community or another part of the United States,' he said. 'We think it’s useful in part because it shows that it’s, you know, false, that it’s safe to send your kids to school. And we’re providing extra patrol support to make sure people feel safe at school.' DeWine announced Monday that he was dispatching dozens of members of the Ohio State Highway Patrol to help keep schools open. Two highway patrol officers have been assigned to each of the Springfield City School District's 18 schools, said Jenna Leinasars, a district spokesperson. 'The troopers will conduct sweeps of the buildings for threats prior to school and sweep again, after school has ended. In between these sweeps, the troopers will be stationed at the building for the entire day,' she said. State police were visible at a middle school Tuesday morning, with students dropped off as normal. Thousands of Haitian immigrants have settled in recent years in the predominantly white, blue-collar city of about 60,000, about 45 miles (70 kilometers) from the state capital of Columbus, where they have found work in factories and warehouses that had been struggling to fill job openings. The sudden influx has strained schools, health care facilities and city services and driven up the cost of housing. ___ Rubinkam reported from northeastern Pennsylvania.	https://apnews.com/article/trump-vance-haitian-immigrants-ohio-threats-8035cbe409b471e61fe2e5457870d7b4	2024-09-17T07:53:57-07:00	
6 die in a landslide caused by heavy rains in Mexico	MEXICO CITY (AP) — A landslide caused by heavy rains has killed six people near Mexico City, authorities said. The landslide on Monday night in Naucalpan, a community northwest of Mexico City, also affected a house and school, the State of Mexico government said in a statement. The victims were four men and two women. Another three people were injured and transported to a state hospital. State Gov. Delfina Gómez ordered the deployment of rescue teams and security task forces to support affected families. The deaths in Naucalpan occurred a few days after another landslide killed nine people on Saturday in Jilotzingo, west of Mexico City in the State of Mexico. A 3-month-old baby was among the victims. Two children, ages 10 and 12, and a 34-year-old woman were rescued. Several homes were affected and authorities had to evacuate more than 100 people for fear of further landslides. The landslides and heavy rains have been pounding the State of Mexico since the start of the rainy season in late July. In cities like Chalco that have also experienced heavy torrential rains, the combination of unchecked growth and failing infrastructure have caused sewage-infused waters to invade streets, homes and businesses.	https://apnews.com/article/mexico-state-landslide-deaths-climate-rainy-season-f6b8b874e48f5fbf03ec0e586e76fae4	2024-09-17T06:36:19-07:00

US court upholds British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell's sex trafficking conviction	NEW YORK (AP) — A U.S. court on Tuesday upheld disgraced British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell's conviction on sex trafficking charges for helping the late financier Jeffrey Epstein abuse underage girls. Maxwell's lawyers had argued that her convictions violated an agreement Epstein reached with federal prosecutors 15 years ago in which he agreed to plead guilty to sex crimes and his co-conspirators were granted immunity. The lawyers also said some of the charges were brought after the statute of limitations had expired, and alleged judicial errors during her trial and sentencing. But a three-judge panel of the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York rejected all of those arguments. 'Identifying no errors in the District Court’s conduct of this complex case, we affirm the District Court’s … judgment of conviction,' Judge Jose Cabranes wrote in the ruling. Maxwell, 62, was found guilty in December 2021 of luring young girls to Epstein so he could molest them, between 1994 and 2004. She was sentenced to 20 years in prison in June 2022. Epstein sexually abused children hundreds of times over more than a decade, exploiting vulnerable girls as young as 14. Prosecutors said Maxwell, his longtime companion, helped him and made the abuse possible. He killed himself in 2019 while awaiting trial. The case has drawn widespread attention because of Epstein and Maxwell’s links to royals, presidents and billionaires. Maxwell herself is the daughter of the late British media tycoon Robert Maxwell, who once owned the New York Daily News. While their celebrity connections didn’t play a prominent role in Maxwell’s trial, mentions of friends such as Bill Clinton and Donald Trump showed how the pair exploited their connections to impress their prey. The trial revolved around allegations from only a handful of Epstein’s accusers. Four testified that they were abused in the 1990s and early 2000s at Epstein’s mansions in Florida, New York, New Mexico and the Virgin Islands. In 2007, Epstein reached a deal with federal prosecutors in Florida in which he agreed to plead guilty to two sex crimes and serve 18 months in prison. As part of the arrangement, known as an NPA, prosecutors agreed not to prosecute any of Epstein’s co-conspirators. The appeals court ruled that this agreement applied only to the U.S. Attorney’s Office in the Southern District of Florida and didn’t apply to prosecutors in New York. 'There is nothing in the NPA that affirmatively shows that the NPA was intended to bind multiple districts,' Carbanes wrote. 'Instead, where the NPA is not silent, the agreement’s scope is expressly limited to the Southern District of Florida.' The court also rejected suggestions that some of the charges were filed too late, saying that Congress in 2003 passed legislation stating that no statute of limitations would apply to crimes involving the sexual or physical abuse of minors 'during the life of the child.' 'The statutory text makes clear that Congress intended to extend the time to bring charges of sexual abuse for pre-enactment conduct as the prior statute of limitations was inadequate,' Carbanes wrote. Maxwell is serving her sentence at a low-security federal prison in Tallahassee, Florida.	https://apnews.com/article/ghislaine-maxwell-sex-trafficking-conviction-2e090610b579c8313bea7c31174ae0c4	2024-09-17T05:50:37-07:00	
Hezbollah hit by a wave of exploding pagers in Lebanon and Syria. At least 9 dead, hundreds injured	BEIRUT (AP) — Pagers used by hundreds of members of the militant group Hezbollah exploded near simultaneously in Lebanon and Syria on Tuesday, killing at least nine people – including an 8-year-old girl -- and wounding several thousand, officials said. They blamed Israel in what appeared to be a sophisticated, remote attack. Among those wounded was Iran’s ambassador to Lebanon. The mysterious incident came amid rising tensions between Israel and Iran-backed Hezbollah, which have exchanged fire across the Israel-Lebanon border since the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas that sparked the war in Gaza. The pagers that exploded had been newly acquired by Hezbollah after the group’s leader ordered members to stop using cell phones, warning they could be tracked by Israeli intelligence. A Hezbollah official told The Associated Press the pagers were a new brand the group had not used before. At about 3:30 p.m. local time on Tuesday, pagers started heating up and then exploding in the pockets and hands of those carrying them -- particularly in a southern Beirut suburb and the Beqaa region of eastern Lebanon where Hezbollah has a strong presence, and in Damascus, where several Hezbollah members were wounded, Lebanese security officials and a Hezbollah official said. The Hezbollah official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to the press. The AP reached out to the Israeli military, which declined to comment. The explosions came hours after Israel’s internal security agency said it had foiled an attempt by Hezbollah to kill a former senior Israeli security official using a planted explosive device that could be remotely detonated. Experts said the pager explosions showed signs of being a long-planned operation – though the means were not immediately known. Investigators had no immediate word on how the pagers were detonated or if explosives had somehow been sneaked into each pager. Whatever the means, it targeted an extraordinary breadth of people with hundreds of small explosions — all at once, wherever the pager carrier happened to be — that left some maimed. One video circulating online showed a man picking through produce at a grocery store when the bag he’s carrying at his hip explodes, sending him sprawling to the ground and bystanders running. AP photographers at area hospitals said the emergency rooms were overloaded with patients. Some had missing hands or chunks blown out of their legs near the pocket area. Lebanon’s health minister, Firas Abiad, said at least nine people were killed, including an 8-year-old girl, and 2,750 wounded — 200 of them critically — by the explosions. Most had injuries in the face, hand, or around the abdomen. Hezbollah said in a statement that two of its members were among those killed. The Hezbollah official who spoke anonymously identified one of the dead as Mahdi Ammar, the son of one of the group’s members in the Lebanese parliament. 'We hold the Israeli enemy fully responsible for this criminal aggression that also targeted civilians,' Hezbollah said, adding that Israel will 'for sure get its just punishment.' Iranian state-run IRNA news agency said that the country’s ambassador, Mojtaba Amani, was superficially wounded by an exploding pager and was being treated at a hospital. Previously, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah had warned the group’s members not to carry cellphones, saying that they could be used by Israel to track their movements and to carry out targeted strikes. The images seen Tuesday showed signs of detonation, said Alex Plitsas, a weapons expert at the Atlantic Council. 'A lithium ion battery fire is one thing, but I’ve never seen one explode like that. It looks like a small explosive charge,' Plitsas said. That raises the possibility Israel was aware of a shipment of pagers heading to Hezbollah and managed to modify the pagers before delivery, he said. Another possibility is an electronic pulse 'that was sent from afar and burnt the devices and caused their explosion,' said Yehoshua Kalisky, a scientist and senior researcher at the Institute for National Security Studies, a Tel Aviv think tank. 'It is not some random action; it was deliberate and known.' Israel has a long history of carrying out deadly operations behind enemy lines. In January, Saleh Arouri, a senior Hamas official, was killed in an airstrike on a Beirut apartment building blamed on Israel. In July, Israel assassinated Hezbollah’s top commander in another airstrike. Hours later, Ismail Haniyeh, Hamas’ supreme leader, died in a mysterious explosion in Iran, also blamed on Israel. Israel has killed Hamas militants in the past with booby-trapped cellphones and it’s widely believed to have been behind the Stuxnet computer virus attack on Iran’s nuclear program in 2010. Tuesday’s explosions came at a time of heightened tensions between Lebanon and Israel. Hezbollah and Israeli forces have been clashing near-daily for more than 11 months against the backdrop of war in Gaza between Israel and Hamas, a Hezbollah ally that is also backed by Iran. The clashes have killed hundreds in Lebanon and dozens in Israel and displaced tens of thousands on both sides of the border. On Tuesday, Israel said that halting Hezbollah’s attacks in the north to allow residents to return to their homes is now an official war goal. ___ This story has been updated to correct the name of the Hezbollah lawmaker’s son killed by a pager blast. ___ AP writers Abby Sewell, Hussein Malla, Hassan Ammar, Fadi Tawil and Sarah El Deeb in Beirut, Jon Gambrell in Dubai, Amir Vahdat in Tehran, and Josef Federman, in Jerusalem, contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/lebanon-hezbollah-israel-exploding-pagers-8893a09816410959b6fe94aec124461b	2024-09-17T04:55:58-07:00	
Bangladesh opposition party rallies to demand a new election	DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) — Thousands of activists and leaders of the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party rallied Tuesday in the nation’s capital to demand a democratic transition through an election as an interim government has yet to outline a timeframe for new voting. The supporters gathered in front of BNP headquarters in Dhaka, where they chanted slogans demanding a new election. The interim government headed by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus has rolled out a number of plans to reform various sectors of the country, from the Election Commission to financial institutions. But major political parties — including the BNP, which is headed by former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia — want the new election sometime soon. Yunus took the helm after former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina fled the country during a mass uprising last month, ending a 15-year stint in power. The protests began in July and morphed into an anti-government movement. Hasina has been living in India since. The country's powerful military is playing a crucial role in running the administration, which faces a number of challenges including worker unrest in its garment industry sector, unstable law and order, and an uncertain economy. In his recent speeches, Yunus hasn't outlined when a new national election would be held and said they would stay in power as long as the people want them to stay. A team of newspaper editors recently said that Yunus should complete crucial reforms first and stay in power for at least two years. The BNP initially demanded an election in three months, but later said it wants to allow the interim government time for reforms. The country’s main Islamist Jamaat-e-Islami party, which was once officially an alliance partner under Zia’s party, also wants to give the Yunus-led government more time before an election. Tarique Rahman, heir apparent to Zia and the BNP’s acting chairman, spoke online from London where he has been living in exile since 2008. He said Tuesday that his party supported the interim government’s plans for reforms, but such changes would only be sustained if the people have their say in the process. He didn't specify when a new election should be held, but said any reforms must be endorsed in the next parliament. 'Only a free and fair election can ensure the political empowerment of the people,' he said. He said that reforms by the Yunus-led government should focus on installing an elected parliament and a new government that would empower the people politically. 'To ensure such an election, reforms must be made in the Election Commission, public administration and security agencies, enabling them to perform effectively,' Rahman said. In another development, a court in Dhaka on Tuesday allowed interrogators to question two senior journalists facing murder charges while they are held in custody. Shyamal Dutta, editor of Bengali-language Bhorer Kagoj and former general secretary of the National Press Club in Dhaka, and Mozammel Babu, managing director and editor-in-chief of private station Ekattor TV, were arrested on Monday as they reportedly attempted to flee to India. Both of them face murder charges related to student-led protests. Both of them were known as being close to Hasina. More than 150 journalists have faced charges such as murder and crimes against humanity since Hasina's fall from power, drawing criticism from groups like Paris-based Reporters Without Borders, or RSF, and the Human Rights Watch. After two other journalists were arrested last month and more cases were filed against others, the RSF demanded a halt to such cases. 'The purge of journalists who are considered to be affiliated with the former government has reached a new level. Media professionals are bearing the brunt of the need for vengeance that permeates this terrible legal cabal, which is hurting the image of the political transition underway in Bangladesh,' said Antoine Bernard, RSF’s director of Advocacy and Assistance. 'The interim authorities, headed by Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus, must do everything in their power to end this vicious process,' Bernard said. Meenakshi Ganguly, deputy director of the agency’s Asia division, told The Associated Press last month that it was 'extremely concerning that the justice system is replicating its abusive and partisan behavior since the fall of the Awami League government (of Hasina), with arbitrary arrests and failure in due process, merely reversing those targeted.' Also on Tuesday, the government granted magistrate powers to commissioned officials of the military to operate outside metropolitan areas across the country for the next two months. A notification by the Ministry of Public Administration said the empowered military officials would be able to apply their power in dealing with organized crime.	https://apnews.com/article/bangladesh-yunus-hasina-khaleda-zia-election-3525d4c39c748a974f67b62efadb23b9	2024-09-17T04:31:00-07:00	
Georgian parliament approves anti-LGBTQ legislation, echoing measures in Russia	TBILISI, Georgia (AP) — Georgia’s parliament on Tuesday approved sweeping legislation that curtails LGBTQ+ rights, a measure that echoes laws adopted in neighboring Russia. The bill, introduced by the ruling party Georgian Dream earlier this year, includes bans on same-sex marriages, adoptions by same-sex couples and public endorsement and depictions of LGBTQ+ relations and people in the media. It also bans gender-affirming care and changing gender designations in official documents. The Orthodox Church wields great influence in Georgia, and demonstrations against the LGBTQ+ community are common. Last year, hundreds of opponents of gay rights stormed an LGBTQ+ festival in the Georgian capital, forcing the event’s cancellation. This year, tens of thousands marched in Tbilisi to promote 'traditional family values.' 'Traditional family values' are also at the cornerstone of the Kremlin's narrative in Russia, where authorities in the last decade banned public endorsement of 'nontraditional sexual relations' as well as laws against gender-affirming care, among other measures. Its Supreme Court effectively outlawed LGBTQ+ activism by labeling what the authorities called the LGBTQ+ 'movement' operating in Russia as an extremist organization and banning it. The new initiative was announced by Georgian Dream after the country in June adopted the 'foreign influence' law that critics also denounced as borrowed from Moscow’s playbook. The measure requires media and nongovernmental organizations to register as 'pursuing the interests of a foreign power' if they receive more than 20% of their funding from abroad. That measure ignited weeks of protests and was widely criticized as threatening democratic freedoms and jeopardizing Georgia’s chances of joining the European Union. The South Caucasus nation of 3.7 million formally applied to join in 2022, after Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, but the bloc halted its accession in response to the 'foreign influence' law and froze some of its financial support. The United States imposed sanctions on dozens of Georgian officials in response to the law. The anti-LGBTQ+ bill was approved on its third and final reading, with 84 of 150 lawmakers voting for it. It now must be signed by President Salome Zourabichvili. Zourabichvili, who has been at odds with the ruling party. She can veto the bill, the same way she vetoed the foreign influence law, but the parliament, dominated by Georgian Dream, can override her and adopt the legislation regardless. Georgia's constitution states that 'marriage is based on the legal equality and free will of the spouses' but does not explicitly ban same-sex marriage, and the country’s civil code clarifies that marriage is a 'voluntary union between a man and a woman.' The new legislation by the ruling party, which does not have the votes to change the constitution, contains a more explicit ban and is seen as a populist step to win the support of marginal groups. Georgia will hold a parliamentary election on Oct. 26, with the ruling party seeking to retain its dominance. Georgian Dream was set up up by Bidzina Ivanishvili, a shadowy billionaire who made his fortune in Russia and served briefly as Georgia’s prime minister in 2012. It promised to restore civil rights and 'reset' relations with Moscow, which fought a brief war with Georgia in 2008 over the breakaway province of South Ossetia. Russia then recognized the independence of South Ossetia and another breakaway Georgian province, Abkhazia, and established military bases there. Many Georgians backed Ukraine as Kyiv battled Russia's invasion in 2022. But the Georgian government abstained from joining sanctions against Moscow, barred dozens of Kremlin critics from entering the country, and accused the West of trying to drag Tbilisi into open conflict with Russia. The opposition has accused the ruling party of steering the country into Russia's orbit at the detriment of its European aspirations. —- Litvinova reported from Tallinn, Estonia.	https://apnews.com/article/georgia-lgbtq-rights-samesex-marriage-57ede62918ec995f21473f23f5676f80	2024-09-17T03:47:36-07:00	
Instagram makes teen accounts private as pressure mounts on the app to protect children	Instagram is making teen accounts private by default as it tries to make the platform safer for children amid a growing backlash against how social media affects young people's lives. Beginning Tuesday in the U.S., U.K., Canada and Australia, anyone under under 18 who signs up for Instagram will be placed into restrictive teen accounts and those with existing accounts will be migrated over the next 60 days. Teens in the European Union will see their accounts adjusted later this year. Parent company Meta acknowledges that teenagers may lie about their age and says it will require them to verify their ages in more instances, like if they try to create a new account with an adult birthday. The Menlo Park, California company also said it is building technology that proactively finds teen accounts that pretend to be grownups and automatically places them into the restricted teen accounts. The teen accounts will be private by default. Private messages are restricted so teens can only receive them from people they follow or are already connected to. 'Sensitive content,' such as videos of people fighting or those promoting cosmetic procedures, will be limited, Meta said. Teens will also get notifications if they are on Instagram for more than 60 minutes and a 'sleep mode' will be enabled that turns off notifications and sends auto-replies to direct messages from 10 p.m. until 7 a.m. While these settings will be turned on for all teens, 16 and 17-year-olds will be able to turn them off. Kids under 16 will need their parents' permission to do so. 'The three concerns we’re hearing from parents are that their teens are seeing content that they don’t want to see or that they’re getting contacted by people they don’t want to be contacted by or that they’re spending too much time on the app,' said Naomi Gleit, head of product at Meta. 'So teen accounts is really focused on addressing those three concerns.' The announcement comes as the company faces lawsuits from dozens of U.S. states that accuse it of harming young people and contributing to the youth mental health crisis by knowingly and deliberately designing features on Instagram and Facebook that addict children to its platforms. While Meta didn't give specifics on how the changes might affect its business, the company said the changes may mean that teens will use Instagram less in the short term. Emarketer analyst Jasmine Enberg said the revenue impact of the changes 'will likely be minimal.' 'Even as Meta continues to prioritize teen safety, it’s unlikely that it’s going to make sweeping changes that would cause a major financial hit,' she said, adding that the teen accounts are unlikely to significantly affect how engaged teens are with Instagram 'not in the least because there are still plenty of ways to circumvent the rules, and could even make them more motivated to work around the age limits.' New York Attorney General Letitia James said Meta’s announcement was 'an important first step, but much more needs to be done to ensure our kids are protected from the harms of social media.' James' office is working with other New York officials on how to implement a new state law intended to curb children’s access to what critics call addictive social media feeds. Others were more critical. Nicole Gil, the co-founder and executive director of the nonprofit Accountable Tech, called Instagram's announcement the 'latest attempt to avoid actual independent oversight and regulation and instead continue to self-regulate, jeopardizing the health, safety, and privacy of young people.' 'Today’s PR exercise falls short of the safety by design and accountability that young people and their parents deserve and only meaningful policy action can guarantee,' she said. 'Meta’s business model is built on addicting its users and mining their data for profit; no amount of parental and teen controls Meta is proposing will change that.' Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), the co-author of the Kids Online Safety Act that recently passed the Senate, questioned the timing of the announcement 'on the eve of a House markup' of the bill. 'Just like clockwork, the Kids Online Safety Act moves forward and industry comes out with a new set of self-enforcing guidelines,' she said. In the past, Meta's efforts at addressing teen safety and mental health on its platforms have also been met with criticism that the changes don't go far enough. For instance, while kids will get a notification when they've spent 60 minutes on the app, they will be able to bypass it and continue scrolling. That's unless the child's parents turn on 'parental supervision' mode, where parents can limit teens' time on Instagram to a specific amount of time, such as 15 minutes. With the latest changes, Meta is giving parents more options to oversee their kids' accounts. Those under 16 will need a parent or guardian's permission to change their settings to less restrictive ones. They can do this by setting up 'parental supervision' on their accounts and connecting them to a parent or guardian. Nick Clegg, Meta’s president of global affairs, said last week that parents don't use the parental controls the company has introduced in recent years. Meta's Gleit said she thinks the teen accounts will incentivize parents to start using them. 'Parents will be able to see, via the family center, who is messaging their teen and hopefully have a conversation with their teen,' she said. 'If there is bullying or harassment happening, parents will have visibility into who their teen’s following, who’s following their teen, who their teen has messaged in the past seven days and hopefully have some of these conversations and help them navigate these really difficult situations online.' U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy said last year that tech companies put too much responsibility on parents when it comes to keeping children safe on social media. 'We’re asking parents to manage a technology that’s rapidly evolving that fundamentally changes how their kids think about themselves, how they build friendships, how they experience the world — and technology, by the way, that prior generations never had to manage,' Murthy said in May 2023. —— Associated Press writer Anthony Izaguirre in New York contributed to this report	https://apnews.com/article/instagram-meta-teen-accounts-kids-425a05cc37f81b6ff2b7439d3884c54a	2024-09-17T03:16:24-07:00	
China says it tailed a US spy plane through the sensitive Taiwan Strait	TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) — Chinese warplanes tailed a U.S. military aircraft through the sensitive Taiwan Strait on Tuesday, China’s military said. The U.S. aircraft was a P-8A Poseidon patrol and reconnaissance plane, capable of conducting long-range anti-submarine warfare, according to a statement by the People’s Liberation Army’s Eastern Theater Command. Chinese military forces 'organized warplanes to tail and monitor the U.S. aircraft’s flight and handled it in accordance with the law,' said Li Xi, a senior colonel and spokesperson for the command. 'Theater command troops will remain on constant high alert and resolutely safeguard national sovereignty and security as well as regional peace and stability,' he added. The U.S. Navy didn’t immediately comment on the incident. China claims the self-ruled island of Taiwan as its own territory and bristles at other countries’ patrolling the body of water separating it from the island. On Friday, Germany sailed two warships through the Taiwan Strait in its first transit of the disputed waters in more than two decades, drawing criticism from Beijing. In 2001, a U.S. surveillance plane and a Chinese navy fighter collided mid-air near the Chinese island province of Hainan, resulting in the Chinese pilot’s death. The U.S. said its plane was in international airspace and the accident was the result of reckless flying by the Chinese side.	https://apnews.com/article/china-us-spy-plane-taiwan-strait-32161435e1d2e21fb21ae6d07f1106cb	2024-09-17T01:44:25-07:00	
Doctors Without Borders closes operations in Russia	GENEVA (AP) — Doctors Without Borders said Tuesday it has closed its operations in Russia after 32 years, citing a Justice Ministry letter that said the medical aid group had been removed from a register of foreign nongovernmental organizations. The aid group, also known by its French language name Médecins Sans Frontières and acronym MSF, said it will retain its branch office in Moscow, but operations – run by its Dutch affiliate – have stopped. It was MSF Netherlands whose registration was withdrawn, a group spokesman said in an email. MSF has been in Russia since 1992, and has operated programs that provided aid for homeless people and migrants, tuberculosis treatment, and general health care including for infectious diseases like HIV. The aid group said it had provided assistance to more than 52,000 people who either crossed into Russia from Ukraine or internally displaced people in Russia since Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. MSF said it recently had been planning to respond to the humanitarian and medical needs of the internally displaced people in the Kursk region in Russia, where Ukrainian forces have recently made inroads. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Thursday that Russian forces had launched a counteroffensive in the Kursk region to dislodge Ukraine’s troops who stormed across the border more than five weeks ago. It was the first time since World War II that Russian territory was under foreign occupation. Norman Sitali, the operations manager for MSF programs in Russia, said the aid group was 'very sad' to end the programs, 'as many people in need of medical and humanitarian assistance will now be left without the support we could have provided to them.' 'MSF would like to still work in Russia again if and when possible,' Sitali added.	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-msf-4a3fdbc069d0b9300c8d9ef658bdde9d	2024-09-17T01:01:35-07:00	
Budapest and Poland's Wroclaw reinforce their river banks ahead of more flooding in central Europe	WARSAW, Poland (AP) — Soldiers dropped sandbags from military helicopters to reinforce river embankments and evacuated residents as the worst flooding in years spread Tuesday to a broad swath of Central Europe, taking lives and destroying homes. Heavy flooding has affected a large part of the region in recent days, including the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Austria. There have been at least 16 deaths reported in the flooding, which follow heavy rainfall across the region. Other places are now bracing for the flood waves to hit them, including two central European gems: Budapest, the Hungarian capital on the Danube River, and Wroclaw, a city in southwestern Poland on the Oder River, its old town filled with architectural gems. Hungary's government of Prime Minister Viktor Orbán deployed soldiers to reinforce barriers along the Danube, and thousands of volunteers assisted in filling sandbags in dozens of riverside settlements. In Budapest, authorities closed the city’s lower quays, which are expected to be breached by rising waters later in the day. The lower half of the city’s iconic Margaret Island was also closed. In Wroclaw, firefighters and soldiers spent the night using sandbags to reinforce river embankments. The city zoo, located along the Oder, appealed for volunteers to fill sandbags on Tuesday morning. 'We and our animals will be extremely grateful for your help,' the zoo said in its appeal. The city said it expected the flood wave to peak there around Friday, though some had predicted that would happen sooner. Poland's Prime Minister Donald Tusk met with a crisis team early Tuesday and said there are contradictory forecasts from meteorologists. Tusk's government has declared a state of natural disaster across the affected region of southern Poland. To the south of Wroclaw, residents spent the night fighting to save Nysa, a town of 44,000 people, after the Nysa Klodzka River broke its banks the day before. The town mayor Kordian Kolbiarz said 2,000 'women, men, children, the elderly' came out to try to save their town from the rising waters, forming a human chain that passed sandbags to the river bank. 'We simply … did everything we could,' Kolbiarz wrote on Facebook. 'This chain of people fighting for our Nysa was incredible. Thank you. We fought for Nysa. Our home. Our families. Our future.' In the Czech Republic, waters have been receding in the two hardest-hit, northeast regions. The government approved the deployment of 2,000 troops to help with clean-up efforts. The damage is expected to reach billions of euros. The Czech government also scrambled to help local authorities organize regional elections on Friday and Saturday as several schools and other buildings serving as polling stations have been badly damaged. However, a planned evacuation of some 1,000 in the town of Veseli nad Luznici could be postponed as the waters had not reached critical levels so far. ___ Associated Press writers Justin Spike in Budapest, Hungary, and Karel Janicek in Prague contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/poland-central-europe-floods-hungary-czech-b9cf9aea4d91d89a5807284dd449f6d0	2024-09-17T00:21:06-07:00	
Casualties in Myanmar push Southeast Asia's death toll from Typhoon Yagi past 500	BANGKOK (AP) — Floods and landslides in Myanmar triggered by last week’s Typhoon Yagi and seasonal monsoon rains have claimed at least 226 lives, with 77 people missing, state-run media reported Tuesday. The new figures push the total number of dead in Southeast Asia from the storm past 500. The accounting of casualties has been slow, in part due to communication difficulties with the affected areas. Myanmar is wracked by a civil war that began in 2021 after the army seized power from the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi. Independent analysts believe the ruling military controls much less than half of the country’s territory. Typhoon Yagi earlier hit Vietnam, northern Thailand and Laos, killing almost 300 people in Vietnam, 42 in Thailand and four in Laos, according to the ASEAN Coordinating Center for Humanitarian Assistance. It said 21 people were killed in the Philippines, with another 26 missing. The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, said on Monday that an estimated 631,000 people may have been affected by flooding across Myanmar. There were already 3.4 million displaced people in Myanmar at the beginning of September, according to the U.N. refugee agency, mostly because of war and unrest in recent years. Heavy rains from the typhoon and the seasonal monsoon brought widespread flash floods to Myanmar, especially the central regions of Mandalay, Magway, Bago and the Ayeyarwaddy Delta; the eastern states Shan, Kayah, Kayin and Mon; and the country’s capital, Naypyitaw. Some flooded areas have started to see water levels recede but others in the Shan and Kayah states remain critical. More than 160,000 houses have been damaged and 438 temporary relief camps have been opened for more than 160,000 flood victims, Myanma Alinn reported. The military government announced that nearly 240,000 people have been displaced. Myanma Alinn said 117 government offices and buildings, 1,040 schools, 386 religious buildings, roads, bridges, power towers, and telecom towers were damaged by the floods in 56 townships. It also said nearly 130,000 animals were killed and more than 259,000 hectares (640,000 acres) of agricultural land were damaged by the floods. The U.N.’s humanitarian affairs agency said food, drinking water, medicine, clothes, dignity kits, and shelters are urgent needs for the flood victims but alleviation efforts are hampered by blocked roads, damaged bridges and ongoing armed clashes. Vice Senior Gen. Soe Win, the second-ranking member of Myanmar’s ruling military council, said the country had received relief aid from other countries, and some humanitarian assistance from the Association of Southeast Asia, will arrive soon. Soe Win, speaking at a meeting of the National Disaster Management Committee on Monday, said that the extent of flooding in the capital was unprecedented, and cleaning and rehabilitation activities in the flooded areas began Thursday as the water level declined. Myanmar experiences extreme weather during the monsoon virtually every year. In 2008, Cyclone Nargis killed more than 138,000 people around the Irrawaddy River delta. The then-military government was harshly discredited when it delayed acceptance of outside aid.	https://apnews.com/article/flood-landslide-disaster-naypyitaw-251c12ebeec148daefe3bcc2f6235f34	2024-09-17T00:06:11-07:00	
EU chief unveils her new team with women in top roles in right-leaning Commission	BRUSSELS (AP) — European Union chief Ursula von der Leyen put women in many of the top roles on her new team for her next five-year tenure at the head of the bloc on Tuesday, despite the reluctance of many EU member states to give in to her demand for gender parity. Von der Leyen put six women among the eight top positions in her team. Her position as EU chief and Kaja Kallas as foreign policy chief were already agreed on by government leaders. Von der Leyen on Tuesday added Spanish Socialist Teresa Ribero to lead the green transition, along with Ribero also becoming the anti-trust czar. Three other women were also named as Commission vice presidents. The appointments of the Commission team — which veers to the right after the June elections saw a surge of far right parties — still have to be confirmed. The appointment as executive vice president of Raffaele Fitto of Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's hard right Brothers of Italy party is bound to cause controversy during the parliamentary confirmation hearing in the coming weeks. Also on Tuesday, von der Leyen gave French Foreign Minister Stephane Sejourne the industrial portfolio, after French heavyweight Thierry Breton resigned and openly criticized the EU chief for allegedly 'questionable governance' on Monday, It left France with a strong voice in the Commission, and many saw Breton's shock resignation more as a removal by von der Leyen of one of her most open internal critics after exerting pressure on French authorities. Compounding such problems was the defiance of many of the 27 member states as von der Leyen struggled to get anywhere close to gender parity on her Commission team — they staunchly refused to give her a choice between a male and a female candidate. She said that originally, EU nations only proposed 22% female candidates before she started to push for more. 'So I worked with the member states and we were able to improve the balance to 40% women and 60% men. And it shows that — as much as we have achieved — there is still so much more work to do,' von der Leyen said. If she could not get full gender parity in numbers, von der Leyen made sure they were more than well represented in the top jobs. After days of secret talks with individual European governments about their picks, von der Leyen huddled with the leaders of the political groups at the European Parliament in Strasbourg, France, to discuss the makeup of her college before making the final announcement. Now attention will center on the hearings in the European Parliament, where each candidate can be rejected to force a member state to put another candidate forward. All eyes are expected to be on Fitto. Greens lawmaker Rasmus Andresen said the appointment of Fitto, a representative of a far-right party, to the post of executive vice president of the Commission is 'completely incomprehensible.' 'Can an anti-European manage EU funds,' Andresen asked. However, von der Leyen said the Commission team had to reflect Italy's weight as a founding member and major economy. 'The importance of Italy is reflected in the portfolio and the executive vice president. And I think the balance is also very well kept,' von der Leyen said. Even if the Commission's makeup has hardly become the talk of bar rooms or barber shops across the vast EU of 450 million people, it has enthralled the upper echelons of politics and bureaucracy, as they sought to boost one candidate or undermine another. The Commission proposes legislation for the EU’s 27 member countries and ensures that the rules governing the world’s biggest trading bloc are respected. It’s made up of a College of Commissioners with a range of portfolios similar to those of government ministers, including agriculture, economic, competition, security and migration policy. The Commission is to start work on Nov. 1, but speculation is rife that it might not get down to business before January.	https://apnews.com/article/eu-commission-gender-von-der-leyen-0044d71f85f8e55cee8d36418fbb2ebb	2024-09-16T23:32:15-07:00	
Israel says halting Hezbollah attacks is now a war goal as officials warn of a wider operation	JERUSALEM (AP) — Israel said Tuesday that halting Hezbollah's attacks in the country's north to allow residents to return to their homes is now an official war goal, as it considers a wider military operation in Lebanon that could ignite an all-out conflict. Israeli officials have repeatedly threatened to take heavier military action to halt the near-daily attacks, which began shortly after the outbreak of the nearly yearlong Israel-Hamas war in Gaza. Israel has regularly launched airstrikes on Lebanon in response and has targeted and killed senior Hezbollah commanders. As recently as last month it appeared a full-blown war was imminent. Tuesday's statement by Israel's security Cabinet signaled a tougher stance at a time when Israeli leaders have stepped up their warnings. But it also appeared to be largely symbolic and may not herald an immediate change in policy. The tit-for-tat strikes have displaced tens of thousands of people on both sides of the Israeli-Lebanon border. Hezbollah has said it would halt the attacks if there is a cease-fire in Gaza, but those talks have repeatedly bogged down. The United States has pressed for restraint even as it has rushed military aid to Israel, warning its close ally that a wider war would not achieve its goals. Israeli media have meanwhile reported that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is considering firing Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and replacing him with Gideon Saar, the leader of a small right-wing party who is seen as more hawkish. That would be the biggest leadership shakeup in Israel since Hamas' Oct. 7 attack triggered the war in Gaza and set off wider regional tensions. The announcement on Lebanon came after Israel's security Cabinet met late into the night. It said the Cabinet has 'updated the objectives of the war' to include safely returning the residents of the north to their homes. 'Israel will continue to act to implement this objective,' it said. U.S. envoy Amos Hochstein, who has made several visits to Lebanon and Israel to try to ease tensions, met with Netanyahu on Monday. Hochstein told Netanyahu that intensifying the conflict with Hezbollah would not help return Israelis evacuated from the border area to their homes, according to a U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the private talks. According to the official, Hochstein argued that Netanyahu risked sparking a broad and protracted regional conflict if he moved forward with a full-scale war in Lebanon and said the Biden administration remained committed to finding a diplomatic solution in conjunction with a Gaza cease-fire or on its own. Netanyahu told Hochstein that residents cannot return without 'a fundamental change in the security situation in the north,' according to a statement from the prime minister's office. It said that while Netanyahu 'appreciates and respects' U.S. support, Israel will 'do what is necessary to safeguard its security.' Defense Minister Gallant has meanwhile said the focus of the conflict is shifting from Gaza to Israel's north. He told U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin this week that time is running out for an agreement with Hezbollah, saying 'the trajectory is clear.' Hezbollah has said that while it does not want a wider war it is prepared for one. Raed Berro, a member of Hezbollah’s bloc in the Lebanese parliament, said Monday that the militant group 'is ready for confrontation and has a lot in its pocket to deter the enemy and protect Lebanon in case Netanyahu thinks of expanding the war.' Lebanese Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri, a close political ally of Hezbollah, largely dismissed the warnings, telling a local newspaper that the Lebanese have grown used to the 'increasing Israeli threats … even if their tone has become louder recently.' The war in Gaza began when Hamas launched a surprise attack into southern Israel, killing some 1,200 people and taking another 250 hostage. Militants are still holding around 100 captives, a third of whom are believed to be dead, after releasing most of the rest during a cease-fire last year. Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed over 41,000 Palestinians in the territory since Oct. 7, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. The ministry does not differentiate between fighters and civilians in its count but says a little over half of those killed were women and children. Iran supports Hamas, Hezbollah and other militant groups across the region, which have carried out strikes on Israeli and U.S. targets in solidarity with the Palestinians. A missile launched by Yemen's Iran-backed Houthi rebels on Sunday set off air raid sirens in central Israel without causing casualties. Israel has hinted at a military response. Israel and Iran traded fire directly for the first time in April, and Iran has threatened to avenge the killing of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in an explosion in Tehran in July. The targeted killing was widely blamed on Israel, which has not said whether it was involved. The U.S., Qatar and Egypt have spent most of this year trying to broker an agreement in which Hamas would release the hostages in exchange for a lasting cease-fire, a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and the release of Palestinians imprisoned by Israel. President Joe Biden endorsed the framework of the agreement in May and the U.N. Security Council backed it days later. But since then, both Israel and Hamas have accused each other of making new and unacceptable demands, and the talks appear to be at an impasse. ___ Associated Press writers Aamer Madhani in Washington, and Abby Sewell and Kareem Chehayeb in Beirut contributed to this report. ___ Follow AP’s war coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war	https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-lebanon-39f6bdbacb2d4d0743f78a85bd138708	2024-09-16T23:31:10-07:00	
A military training camp in Mali's capital has been attacked, the army says	BAMAKO, Mali (AP) — A military training camp in Mali’s capital was attacked by extremists early Tuesday, said the army. Gunmen attempted to infiltrate the Faladie gendarme school and a sweep operation is underway, said a statement from the military. The army said the situation was under control and asked people to avoid the area. Early Tuesday morning an Associated Press reporter heard two explosions and saw smoke rise in the distance. The training school is located on the outskirts of the city. Mali, along with its neighbors Burkina Faso and Niger, has for over a decade battled an insurgency fought by armed groups, including some allied with al-Qaida and the Islamic State group. Following military coups in all three nations in recent years, the ruling juntas have expelled French forces and turned to Russian mercenary units for security assistance instead. Since taking power, Col. Assimi Goita has struggled to stave off growing attacks by the jihadis. Attacks in central and northern Mali are increasing. In July, approximately 50 Russian mercenaries in a convoy were killed in an al-Qaida ambush. The mercenaries had been fighting mostly Tuareg rebels alongside Mali’s army when their convoy was forced to retreat into jihadi territory and ambushed south of the commune of Tinzaouaten. Attacks in the capital are rare. In 2022, gunmen struck a Malian army checkpoint about 60 kilometers (37 miles) outside the city, killing at least six people and wounding several others.	https://apnews.com/article/mali-explosions-training-camp-attack-472f06bd7d2d9d2913252e9787f276f9	2024-09-16T23:30:40-07:00	
A French man admits in court to drugging his wife so that he and dozens of men could rape her	AVIGNON, France (AP) — A 71-year-old French man admitted in court Tuesday that for nearly a decade, he repeatedly drugged his unwitting wife and invited dozens of men to rape her while she lay unconscious in their bed. His wife of 50 years, who has divorced him since his arrest, also got to speak, telling the court that she feels completely betrayed. In a trial that has gripped France and raised awareness about sexual violence in the home and beyond, Dominique Pélicot told the court that he also raped his wife, Gisèle Pélicot, and that the 50 men standing trial alongside him understood exactly what they were doing. 'Today I maintain that, along with the other men here, I am a rapist,″ Dominique Pélicot testified. 'They knew everything. They can’t say otherwise.' Pélicot’s testimony marked the most important moment yet in a trial that has shocked the world. Although he previously confessed to investigators, his court testimony will be crucial for the panel of judges to decide on the fate of his co-defendants, who range in age from 26 to 74. Many of them deny having raped Gisèle Pélicot, saying her then-husband had manipulated them or that they believed she was consenting. Many following the case also hope his testimony might help explain why Dominique Pélicot would subject the mother of his three children to such unconscionable abuse. Gisèle Pélicot has become a hero to many rape victims and a symbol of the fight against sexual violence in France for agreeing to waive her anonymity in the case, letting the trial be public and appearing openly in front of the media. She shows up every day, passing through the courthouse security line behind men accused of raping her. As she left court during a break Tuesday, supporters brought her flowers. After days of delay due to what his lawyers said was a kidney stone and urinary tract infection, Dominique Pélicot, seated in a wheelchair, testified that the charges against him are true. With his ex-wife looking on from the packed gallery and his voice trembling and barely audible at times, he started a long day of testimony trying to explain childhood traumas that he said scarred and molded him into the person he became. 'One is not born a pervert, one becomes a pervert,' Pélicot told the judges after recounting, sometimes in tears, being raped by a male hospital nurse at age 9 and being forced to take part in a gang rape at age 14. Pélicot also said that for years, his father sexually abused a young girl his family had taken in, and that his brother later said their father had invited other men to do the same. He regretted that his parents didn't let him continue his studies after he turned 14. He said that around that time, he tried to persuade his mother to leave the house with him, but 'she never wanted to.' 'I don’t really want to talk about this, I am just ashamed of my father. In the end, I didn’t do any better,'' said Pélicot, who faces 20 years in prison if convicted. After he spoke about his difficult upbringing, Gisèle Pélicot was given the opportunity to address the court. 'It is hard for me to hear this. For 50 years, I lived with a man. I couldn’t imagine even one second that he could have committed acts of rape,″ she said. 'I trusted this man entirely.″ The two looked at each other, him from behind the dock’s glass window and her from the witness stand. 'I am guilty,' he told her. 'I regret everything I did. I ask you for forgiveness, even if it is unpardonable.' Asked if she wanted to respond, Gisèle Pélicot turned and left the stand. When asked about his feelings toward his ex-wife, Dominique Pélicot said she didn't deserve what he did. 'From my youth, I remember only shocks and traumas, forgotten partly thanks to her,' he said in tears. At that moment, Gisèle Pélicot put on her sunglasses. Later, Dominique Pélicot said, 'I was crazy about her. She replaced everything. I ruined everything.' A supermarket security guard caught Pélicot in 2020 secretly shooting video up women’s skirts, according to court documents. During a search of his house and electronic devices, police found thousands of photos and videos of men engaging in sexual acts with Gisèle Pélicot while she appeared to be unconscious in bed. With the recordings, police were able to track down most of the 72 suspects they were seeking, but not all. In addition to the photos and videos of Gisèle Pélicot, investigators found photos of the Pelicots' daughter, Caroline Darian, and two daughters-in-law that were surreptitiously taken while they were in their underwear, getting undressed or taking showers, according to authorities. While her mother has stayed remarkably calm throughout the trial, Darian walked out of the courtroom Tuesday as her father was being asked about photos of her that were found on his laptop. ″Excuse me, I’m going to vomit,″ she said angrily before rushing out. She has written a book about what happened to her family, called ″And I Stopped Calling you Daddy.″ After retiring, the Pélicots moved from the Paris region to a house in Mazan, a small town in the Provence region. When police officers called Gisèle Pélicot in for questioning in late 2020, she initially told them her husband was 'a great guy,″ according to legal documents. They then showed her some photos. She left and later divorced her husband. Since Dominique Pélicot’s arrest, other cases have surfaced. He was fined after being caught shooting video of a women’s crotch in 2010 and required to see a psychologist. Gisèle Pélicot has said she never knew about this incident. Under French law, the proceedings inside the courtroom cannot be filmed or photographed. Dominique Pélicot has been brought into the court through a special entrance that's inaccessible for the media, because he and some other defendants are being held in custody during the trial and can't be filmed. Defendants who are not in custody have been arriving at the courthouse wearing surgical masks or hoods to avoid having their faces filmed or photographed. Among those hoping to secure a seat to watch the Tuesday's proceedings was Bernadette Tessonière, a 69-year-old retiree who lives a half-hour drive from Avignon, where the trial is taking place. 'How is it possible that in 50 years of communal life, one can live next to someone who hides his life so well? This is scary,' she said.	https://apnews.com/article/france-rape-trial-drugged-pelicot-943400b83a8b111bcd42a0fb23a1cfda	2024-09-16T23:09:28-07:00	
Stock market today: World shares are mostly higher as Wall Street gears up for an interest rate cut	Shares mostly advanced in Europe and Asia on Tuesday as world markets awaited an expected interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve. Oil prices were mixed and U.S. futures edged higher. Apart from the Federal Reserve’s most anticipated meeting in years, which wraps up on Wednesday, traders also were awaiting U.S. retail sales data that will provide a glimpse into the state of the economy. Germany's DAX rose 0.% to 18,704.36 and the CAC 40 in Paris climbed 0.5% to 7,485.77. In London, the FTSE 100 surged 0.7% to 8,338.42. The futures for the S&amp;P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average edged 0.2% higher. In Asian trading, Tokyo’s Nikkei index fell 1% to 36,203.22 and the Hang Seng in Hong Kong advanced 1.4% to 17,660.02. Markets in mainland China and South Korea were closed. Australia's S&amp;P/ASX 200 gained 0.2% to 8,140.90. Markets have been eagerly awaiting the decision by the Fed, which is expected to cut its key rate for the first time in more than four years after keeping rates high to tamp down inflation. The main question is how much relief for the economy the Fed will deliver. 'The warning is that markets steeped in rich policy expectations are ripe for volatility,' Mizuho Bank said in a commentary. 'Accordingly, it may be best to be braced for (policy) curveballs that could potentially force market re-pricing.' On Monday, the Dow rose 0.6% to surpass its prior all-time high set a few weeks ago. It closed at 41,622.08. The S&amp;P 500 index, which is much more comprehensive and widely followed on Wall Street, ticked up by 0.1%, ending at 5,633.09. The Nasdaq composite slipped 0.5% to 17,592.13 as big technology stocks and other market superstars gave back a bit of their big gains from recent years. Most stocks rose, and Oracle’s 5.1% gain helped lead the market. The software company continued a strong run that began last week with a better-than-expected profit report. Traders are shifting bets toward a larger-than-usual rate cut by the Fed of half a percentage point, according to data from CME Group. The difference between a half-point cut and a quarter may sound academic, but it can have far-ranging effects. Lower rates relieve pressure on the economy, but they can also fuel inflation. Inflation has eased substantially from its peak two summers ago, and the Fed has said it can now focus on supporting the slowing job market and economy. Some critics say it may be moving too late, increasing the risk of a possible recession. In other dealings, the dollar fell to 140.56 Japanese yen from 140.61 yen. The yen has strengthened against teh dollar with expectations that the Bank of Japan will persist in raising rates after keeping them near zero for years, although it is expected to stand pat at its policy meeting this week. 'The Bank of Japan’s upcoming policy meeting is expected to reaffirm its commitment to gradual rate hikes, which could further bolster the yen soon,' Luca Santos, currency analyst at ACY Securities, said in a commentary. The euro rose to $1.1140 from $1.1135. U.S. benchmark crude oil rose 10 cents to $70.20 a barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, shed 2 cents to $72.73 a barrel.	https://apnews.com/article/stock-market-rates-fed-inflation-a6a27e45f16418e0b024babb3c849161	2024-09-16T21:53:00-07:00	
A key employee says the Titan sub tragedy could have been prevented	A key employee who labeled a doomed experimental submersible unsafe prior to its last, fatal voyage testified Tuesday that the tragedy could have been prevented if a federal safety agency had investigated his complaint. David Lochridge, OceanGate’s former operations director, said he felt let down by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's decision not to follow through on the complaint. 'I believe that if OSHA had attempted to investigate the seriousness of the concerns I raised on multiple occasions, this tragedy may have been prevented,' he said while speaking before a commission trying to determine what caused the Titan to implode en route to the wreckage of the Titanic last year, killing all five on board. 'As a seafarer, I feel deeply disappointed by the system that is meant to protect not only seafarers but the general public as well.' Lochridge said during testimony that eight months after he filed an OSHA complaint, a caseworker told him the agency had not begun investigating it yet and there were 11 cases ahead of his. By then, OceanGate was suing Lochridge and he had filed a countersuit. About 10 months after he filed the complaint, he decided to walk away. The case was closed and both lawsuits were dropped. 'I gave them nothing, they gave me nothing,' he said of OceanGate. OSHA officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday. Earlier in the day, Lochridge said he frequently clashed with the company’s co-founder and felt the company was committed only to making money. Lochridge was one of the most anticipated witnesses to appear before a commission. His testimony echoed that of other former employees Monday, one of whom described OceanGate head Stockton Rush as volatile and difficult to work with. 'The whole idea behind the company was to make money,' Lochridge said. 'There was very little in the way of science.' Rush was among the five people who died in the implosion. OceanGate owned the Titan and brought it on several dives to the Titanic going back to 2021. Lochridge's testimony began a day after other witnesses painted a picture of a troubled company that was impatient to get its unconventionally designed craft into the water. The accident set off a worldwide debate about the future of private undersea exploration. Lochridge joined the company in the mid-2010s as a veteran engineer and submersible pilot and said he quickly came to feel he was being used to lend the company scientific credibility. He said he felt the company was selling him as part of the project 'for people to come up and pay money,' and that did not sit well with him. 'I was, I felt, a show pony,' he said. 'I was made by the company to stand up there and do talks. It was difficult. I had to go up and do presentations. All of it.' Lochridge referenced a 2018 report in which he raised safety issues about OceanGate operations. He said with all of the safety issues he saw 'there was no way I was signing off on this.' Asked whether he had confidence in the way the Titan was being built, he said: 'No confidence whatsoever.' Employee turnover was very high at the time, said Lochridge, and leadership dismissed his concerns because they were more focused on 'bad engineering decisions' and a desire to get to the Titanic as quickly as possible and start making money. He eventually was fired after raising the safety concerns, he said. 'I didn’t want to lose my job. I wanted to do the Titanic. But to dive it safely. It was on my bucket list, too,' he said. OceanGate, based in Washington state, suspended its operations after the implosion. OceanGate's former engineering director, Tony Nissen, kicked off Monday's testimony, telling investigators he felt pressured to get the vessel ready to dive and refused to pilot it for a journey several years before Titan's last trip. Nissen worked on a prototype hull that predated the Titanic expeditions. '‘I’m not getting in it,’' Nissen said he told Rush. OceanGate's former finance and human resources director, Bonnie Carl, testified Monday that Lochridge had characterized the Titan as 'unsafe.' Coast Guard officials noted at the start of the hearing that the submersible had not been independently reviewed, as is standard practice. That and Titan's unusual design subjected it to scrutiny in the undersea exploration community. During the submersible's final dive on June 18, 2023, the crew lost contact after an exchange of texts about the Titan's depth and weight as it descended. The support ship Polar Prince then sent repeated messages asking if the Titan could still see the ship on its onboard display. One of the last messages from Titan’s crew to Polar Prince before the submersible imploded stated, 'all good here,' according to a visual re-creation presented earlier in the hearing. When the submersible was reported overdue, rescuers rushed ships, planes and other equipment to an area about 435 miles (700 kilometers) south of St. John’s, Newfoundland. Wreckage of the Titan was subsequently found on the ocean floor about 330 yards (300 meters) off the bow of the Titanic, Coast Guard officials said. Scheduled to appear later in the hearing are OceanGate co-founder Guillermo Sohnlein and former scientific director, Steven Ross, according to a list compiled by the Coast Guard. Numerous guard officials, scientists, and government and industry officials are also expected to testify. The U.S. Coast Guard subpoenaed witnesses who were not government employees, said Coast Guard spokesperson Melissa Leake. Among those not on the hearing witness list is Rush’s widow, Wendy Rush, the company’s communications director. Lochridge said Wendy Rush had an active role in the company when he was there. Asked about Wendy Rush's absence, Leake said the Coast Guard does not comment on the reasons for not calling specific individuals to a particular hearing during ongoing investigations. She said it’s common for a Marine Board of Investigation to 'hold multiple hearing sessions or conduct additional witness depositions for complex cases.' OceanGate has no full-time employees at this time but will be represented by an attorney during the hearing, the company said in a statement. The company said it has been fully cooperating with the Coast Guard and NTSB investigations since they began. The ongoing Marine Board of Investigation is the highest level of marine casualty investigation conducted by the Coast Guard. When the hearing concludes, recommendations will be submitted to the Coast Guard’s commandant. The National Transportation Safety Board is also conducting an investigation.	https://apnews.com/article/titan-submersible-implosion-hearing-3e698a31c32d753b2d34e28900f65bdc	2024-09-16T20:02:12-07:00	
US Coast Guard says Russian naval vessels crossed into buffer zone off Alaska	JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) — The U.S. Coast Guard said Monday that it tracked a group of Russian naval vessels as they crossed into U.S. waters off Alaska in an apparent effort to avoid sea ice, a move that is permitted under international rules and customs. Crew of a U.S. Coast Guard cutter witnessed the Russian military vessels cross the maritime boundary and venture 30 miles (48 kilometers) inside an area extending beyond U.S. territorial waters known as the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone. The Russian vessels consisted of two submarines, a frigate and tug boat, the Coast Guard said in a news release. The encounter took place nearly 60 miles (100 kilometers) northwest of Point Hope. Rear Adm. Megan Dean said the Coast Guard is actively patrolling maritime borders on the Bering Sea, Bering Strait and Chukchi Sea to 'protect U.S. sovereign interests, U.S. fish stocks and promote maritime norms.'	https://apnews.com/article/coast-guard-russia-navy-alaska-b210372dc66b56603a9ede5472430c2f	2024-09-16T19:15:13-07:00	
Many in Indian-controlled Kashmir plan to vote this time to deny Modi total control	SRINAGAR, India (AP) — For decades, boycotting elections in Indian-controlled Kashmir was a sign of protest against Indian rule. That may change on Wednesday, when many residents of the Muslim-majority region say they’re willing to use their vote in a local election to deny Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s party the power to form an administration in the disputed region. The vote is the first in a decade, and the first since Modi’s Hindu nationalist government in 2019 scrapped the region’s special status and downgraded the former state to a federally governed territory. The move — which largely resonated in India and among Modi supporters — was mostly opposed in Kashmir as an assault on its identity and autonomy. 'Boycotts will not work in this election,' said Abdul Rashid, a resident in southern Kashmir’s Shangus village. 'There is a desperate need to end the onslaught of changes coming from there (India).' India wants to keep Kashmir under direct rule The election will allow Kashmir to have its own truncated government and a local assembly, instead of remaining under New Delhi’s direct rule. The region’s last assembly election was held in 2014, after which Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party for the first time ruled in a coalition with the local Peoples Democratic Party. But the government collapsed in 2018, after BJP withdrew from the coalition. Polls in the past have been marked with violence, boycotts and vote-rigging, even though India called them a victory over separatism. This time, New Delhi says the polls are ushering in democracy after more than three decades of strife. However, many locals see the vote as an opportunity not only to elect their own representatives but also to register their protest against the 2019 changes. Polling will be held in three phases. The second and third phases are scheduled for Sept. 25 and Oct. 1. Votes will be counted on Oct. 8, with results expected that day. Kashmir is divided between nuclear-armed rivals India and Pakistan. Since 1947, the neighbors have fought two wars over its control, after British rule of the subcontinent ended with the creation of the two countries. Both claim the Himalayan territory in its entirety. In 2019, the Indian-controlled part of the region was divided into two territories, Ladakh and Jammu-Kashmir, ruled directly by New Delhi. The region has been on edge since it lost its flag, criminal code, constitution and inherited protections on land and jobs. Limited power for local assembly Multiple pro-India Kashmiri parties, many of whose leaders were among thousands jailed in 2019, are contesting the election, promising to reverse those changes. Some lower-rung separatist leaders, who in the past dismissed polls as illegitimate exercises under military occupation, are also running for office as independent candidates. India’s main opposition Congress party, which favors restoration of the region’s statehood, has formed an alliance with the National Conference, the region’s largest party. Modi’s BJP has a strong political base in Hindu-dominated areas of Jammu that largely favor the 2019 changes but is weak in the Kashmir Valley, the heartland of anti-India rebellion. 'Our main concern is governance through local representatives. It will be good for us if the BJP forms the government here as it’s already in power at the center,' said Chuni Lal, a shopkeeper in Jammu city. The vote will see a limited transition of power from New Delhi to the local assembly, with a chief minister at the top heading a council of ministers. But Kashmir will continue to be a 'Union Territory' — a region directly controlled by the federal government — with India’s Parliament remaining its main legislator. The elected government will have partial control over areas like education, culture and taxation but not over the police. Kashmir’s statehood must be restored for the new government to have powers similar to other states in India. However, it will not have the special powers it enjoyed before the 2019 changes. Last year, India’s Supreme Court endorsed the government’s 2019 changes but ordered New Delhi to conduct local polls by the end of September and restore Kashmir’s statehood. Modi’s government has promised to restore statehood after the polls but has not specified a timeline. Concerns about rigged vote Elections in Indian-held Kashmir are a sensitive issue. Many believe they have been rigged multiple times in favor of local politicians who subsequently became India’s regional enforcers, used to incrementally dilute laws that offered Kashmir a special status and legitimize New Delhi’s militaristic policies. In the mid-1980s, the region’s dissident political groups emerged as a formidable force against Kashmir’s pro-India political elite but lost the 1987 election widely believed to have been rigged. A public backlash followed, with some young activists taking up arms and demanding a united Kashmir, either under Pakistani rule or independent of both. India insists the insurgency is Pakistan-sponsored terrorism, a charge Islamabad denies. Tens of thousands of people have been killed in the fighting, which most Kashmiri Muslims consider a legitimate freedom struggle. Noor Ahmed Baba, a political scientist, said the outcome of the polls 'is not going to change the dynamics of the Kashmir dispute' since it will end with a largely powerless legislature, but will be crucial for optics. 'If local parties win, it is going to put some pressure on the central government and perhaps delegitimize from a democratic perspective what has been done to Kashmir. But a BJP win can allow the party to consolidate and validate 2019 changes in the local legislature,' Baba said. India’s ruling BJP is not officially aligned with any local party, but many politicians believe it is tacitly supporting some parties and independent candidates who privately agree with it. The National Conference party says Modi’s BJP is trying to manipulate the election through independents. 'Their (BJP’s) concerted effort is to divide the vote in Kashmir,' said Tanvir Sadiq, a candidate from the National Conference. The BJP’s national secretary, meanwhile, says his party’s former ally, the Peoples Democratic Party, and the National Conference are being supported by former militants. Ram Madhav said at a recent rally that they want to return the region to its 'trouble-filled days.' For residents whose civil liberties have been curbed, the election is also a chance to choose representatives they hope will address their main issues. Many say that while the election won’t solve the dispute over Kashmir, it will give them a rare window to express their frustration with Indian control. 'We need some relief and end of bureaucratic rule here,' said Rafiq Ahmed, a taxi driver in the region’s main city of Srinagar.	https://apnews.com/article/kashmir-election-india-pakistan-conflict-4493b9cd496de1aadf1cddcb6194043d	2024-09-16T19:08:11-07:00	
At least 15 dead since July and thousands of hectares scorched as wildfires sweep Peru	LIMA, Peru (AP) — Wildfires in Peru have left at least 15 dead since July and more than 3,000 hectares (7,400 acres) of cultivated land and natural areas scorched, authorities said Monday. Prime Minister Gustavo Adrianzén told reporters that the fires were started by human activity and that 22 of the 24 regions that make up the country have active outbreaks. He added that clouds, smoke and winds were hampering the operations of the aircraft available to fight the fires. A Civil Defense report seen by The Associated Press indicates that since July at least 15 people have died and another 98 have been injured due to the fires. Of the fatalities, 10 died in the last two weeks and more than 1,800 people have been affected. The livestock sector was reported to have lost 334 animals. Peru's National Forest and Wildlife Service, SERFOR, indicated that the effects of climate change intensify the conditions that facilitate the spread of fire. 'Extremely strong winds and prolonged droughts dry out vegetation, turning it into highly flammable fuel,' said Romina Liza, a specialist in monitoring and management of forest Fires at SERFOR. 'This allows the fires to spread rapidly.' Some of the most complicated fires are in the Amazon region, which borders Ecuador, the head of civil defense, Juan Urcariegui, told a local television station. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america	https://apnews.com/article/peru-wildfires-amazon-dead-c96e54eac09cfd25b5baaa2863660901	2024-09-16T17:42:09-07:00	
US airs frustration with Israel's military about strikes in Gaza	UNITED NATIONS (AP) — The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations on Monday accused Israel’s military of striking schools, humanitarian workers and civilians in Gaza in a sign of growing American frustration with its close ally as the war approaches its first anniversary.Israel has repeatedly said it targets Hamas militants, who often hide with civilians and use them as human shields, in retaliation for the Oct. 7 attacks in southern Israel that killed about 1,200 people and launched the war in Gaza.U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield was unusually outspoken against the Israeli military at a U.N. Security Council meeting, saying many of the strikes in recent weeks that injured or killed U.N. personnel and humanitarian workers 'were preventable.'Many council members cited last week’s Israeli strike on a former school turned civilian shelter run by the U.N. agency helping Palestinian refugees, known as UNRWA, in which six UNRWA staffers were among at least 18 people killed, including women and children.Hub peek embed (Israel-Hamaswar) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) Israel said it targeted a Hamas command-and-control center in the compound, and Israel’s U.N. ambassador, Danny Danon, asserted Monday that Hamas militants were killed in the strike. He named four, claiming to the council that they worked for UNRWA during the day and Hamas at night. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has called for an independent investigation.Thomas-Greenfield told council members that the U.S. will keep raising the need for Israel to facilitate humanitarian operations in the Palestinian territory and protect humanitarian workers and facilities like the UNRWA shelter.She also reiterated U.S. 'outrage' at the death of Turkish American activist Aysenur Eygi, who was shot and killed during a protest in the West Bank last week. Israeli Defense Forces said it likely killed Eygi by mistake, and the government has begun a criminal investigation.'The IDF is a professional military and knows well how to ensure that incidents such as these do not happen,' the U.S. envoy said.Thomas-Greenfield said the United States expects Israeli military leaders to implement 'fundamental changes' in their operations — including to their rules of engagement and procedures to ensure that military operations do not conflict with humanitarian activities and do not target schools and other civilian facilities.'We have also been unequivocal in communicating to Israel that there is no basis — absolutely none — for its forces to be opening fire on clearly marked U.N. vehicles as recently occurred on numerous occasions,' Thomas-Greenfield said.At the same time, she said Hamas is also hiding in — and in some cases, taking over or using — civilian sites, which poses 'an ongoing threat.'She said it underscores the urgency of reaching a cease-fire and hostage release deal in Gaza. While the United States works with fellow mediators Egypt and Qatar to try to get both sides 'to agree that enough is enough,' she said, 'this is ultimately a question of political will' and difficult compromises.Secretary of State Antony Blinken heads to Egypt this week for talks partly about refining a proposal to present to Israel and Hamas.The United States urges 'all council members with influence over Hamas to join others in pressing its leaders to stop stalling, make these compromises, and accept the deal without delay,' Thomas-Greenfield.She spoke after the top U.N. humanitarian official in Gaza said the territory is 'hell on Earth' for its more than 2 million people, calling the lack of effective protection for civilians 'unconscionable.'Sigrid Kaag, the U.N. senior humanitarian and reconstruction coordinator for Gaza, told council members and reporters that the war has turned the territory 'into the abyss.' Over 41,000 Palestinians have been killed during Israel’s offensive, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which doesn’t distinguish between civilians and combatants.Humanitarian operations are being impeded by lawlessness, Israeli evacuation orders, fighting and difficult conditions for aid workers that include Israeli denials of access, delays, a lack of safety and security, and 'poor logistical infrastructure,' Kaag said.Danon insisted that Israel's humanitarian efforts 'are unparalleled' for a country forced to go to war and urged the Security Council and the U.N. 'to speak to the facts.'Over 1 million tons of aid have been delivered via more than 50,000 trucks and nearly 1 million land crossings, he said, adding that hardly a fraction have been stopped.When asked about Danon’s statement, Kaag pointed to recent strikes on humanitarian convoys and schools and health facilities where Israel had received prior notification.'It’s not about trucks. It’s about what people need,' she said. 'We’re way, way off what people need, not only daily, but also what we would all consider a dignified human life.'___Find more AP coverage of the war at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war	https://apnews.com/article/us-un-israel-hamas-war-gaza-c28906d65480c177b641a8e6676e80fe	2024-09-16T16:52:48-07:00	
Bolivia's iconic ex-President Morales calls for anti-government march as political fight escalates	LA PAZ, Bolivia (AP) — Bolivia's hugely popular and controversial former leftist president, Evo Morales, on Monday called on supporters to take to the streets in protest against his bitter political rival, current President Luis Arce, who hours earlier accused Morales on national TV of trying to overthrow him. Morales’ appeal to Bolivia’s farmers, miners and peasants followed President Arce's unprecedented televised speech late Sunday lambasting his former mentor. Accusing Morales of trying to sabotage his administration and undermine democracy, Arce escalated a high-stakes power struggle that has pushed Bolivia to the brink. 'Enough, Evo!' Arce exclaimed on state TV. 'Until now, I have tolerated your attacks and slander in silence. But putting the lives of people at risk is something I cannot tolerate.'Arce, who has faced a series of mounting crises with his ruling party riven by disagreements, alleged that Morales’ attempts to mobilize support and run against Arce in next year's presidential election was 'putting democracy at risk.' Hub peek embed (apf-latinamerica) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) 'You are threatening the entire country,' Arce said, claiming that Morales sought to return to power by 'means fair or foul.' His dramatic speech in the Andean nation of 12 million dredged up the chaos and bloodshed of 2019, when Morales ran for an unconstitutional third term and won. After accusations of fraud sparked mass protests, Morales resigned under pressure from the army, in what his supporters call a coup. At least 36 people were killed in the ensuing crackdown by security forces.Morales, who served as Bolivia’s first Indigenous president, has vowed to unleash unrest if he is stopped from running in the August 2025 elections. Ever since the constitutional court last year barred the charismatic leader from the race, coca cultivators, Indigenous tribes and workers — whom Morales represented during his presidency from 2006 to 2019 — have come to his defense with street protests, marches and road blockades. Speaking to reporters, Morales encouraged the international community to follow his so-called 'March to Save Bolivia' on Tuesday from the southeast village of Caracollo to Bolivia's administrative capital of La Paz. He described the march — 85 kilometers (53 miles) by foot along a highway — as a natural expression of protest against the failure of Arce’s government to fix the worsening economic crisis.Firing back at Arce on Monday, Morales insisted that he had no selfish ulterior motives. 'The march is the response of a people fed up with their unthinking government, which has maintained absolute silence in the face of the crisis, corruption and the destruction of stability,' Morales wrote on social media platform X. 'President Arce is not only desperate, but also confused.' Over the past year, the Arce-Morales rift has polarized Bolivia, tainting the country's politics and creating a sense of turmoil that soldiers sought to seize upon in June in an alleged coup attempt. Anti-government protesters on Monday flocked to the main road leading to Bolivia’s tourist hotspot of Lake Titicaca, convening and calling on Arce to resign under the watchful gaze of riot police. Some demonstrators piled dirt at the entrances of other roads in the La Paz area, impeding traffic. 'It’s an incompetent government that we have, and it won’t solve the economic crisis,' said Pablo Merma, a peasant leader of the so-called Red Ponchos, radical Indigenous activists from the high plains who rallied Monday against the president. 'We are not afraid of you, Arce.'Another protest leader, Ponciano Santos, warned Arce that the social movement would hold him responsible for whatever happened on Tuesday.'If you tear gas us, if you interfere with our march, the government will fall,' Santos told reporters.Although Arce was Morales’ former economy minister and his candidate in Bolivia’s 2020 elections, the erstwhile allies began vying for power after Morales’ return from exile and political comeback the same year. Bolivia’s political stagnation and economic quagmire — with fuel scarce and the central bank dangerously short on foreign currency reserves — has caused some Bolivians once outraged over Morales’ strongman tendencies to grow nostalgic for the ex-leader’s transformation of the economy and remarkable reduction of poverty.___Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america	https://apnews.com/article/bolivia-protest-morales-arce-economy-president-election-b489c2a58235d6f9e0551b104fb6469e	2024-09-16T12:39:20-07:00	
Brazilian firefighters battle national park wildfire that is enveloping Brasilia in smoke	RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) — Firefighters on Monday battled flames spreading through a national park in Brazil that is enveloping Brasilia in smoke. It's the latest wildfire in the country, which is experiencing an historic drought.More than 90 firefighters were trying to extinguish blazes that have already burned through 700 hectares (1,700 acres) of the conservation area of Brasilia National Park. Two aircraft from the Federal District’s military firefighting unit and another two from the nearby Chapada dos Veadeiros national park are being mobilized, according to a statement from ICMBio, the government agency that manages the park.The head of the agency, Mauro Pires, told newspaper Folha de S.Paulo that the fire was human-caused and appears to have started near the edge of a farm.Smoke from the fire smothered the capital, Brasilia, on Monday, and columns of black smoke were visible from several points in the city.Hub peek embed (Wildfires) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) Brazil has been enveloped in smoke in recent weeks, as fires rage in the Amazon rainforest, the Cerrado savanna and the Pantanal wetlands. Those uncontrolled, human-made wildfires have ravaged protected areas and spread smoke over a vast expanse, causing air quality to plummet.The country is also enduring its worst drought since nationwide measurements began more than seven decades ago, with 59% of the country affected — an area roughly half the size of the U.S. Major Amazon basin rivers are registering historic lows.A task force of the Federal District’s public security agency is working with the Federal Police to investigate possible criminal actions in the fire in the Brasilia National Park, the agency said in a statement, adding that around 1,500 agents from the district's government are working to combat fires in the region.President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva said on Instagram that the Federal Police have opened 52 investigations 'against those responsible for the crimes against our country,' adding that he would be meeting with Environment Minister Marina Silva to 'discuss further actions to deal with this climate emergency.' On Sunday, he did a flyover of the park that's spread across three of the Federal District's administrative regions, including Brasilia, and one municipality in Goias state.Supreme Court Justice Flávio Dino issued a ruling on Sunday authorizing the federal government to direct extra funds toward combating forest fires and hiring firefighters.Scientists say that climate change — primarily caused by the burning of fossil fuels such as oil, gas and coal — makes extreme weather more likely, favoring conditions for events such as wildfires and floods.	https://apnews.com/article/brazil-wildfires-brasilia-a2a0d88beef5193730cc08f9d639cec5	2024-09-16T11:00:00-07:00	
Former high-ranking Canadian military officer found not guilty in decades-old sexual assault case	OTTAWA, Ontario (AP) — A former high-ranking member of the Canadian military was found not guilty by a judge Monday of sexual assault and committing an indecent act in a 33-year-old case involving a younger, lower-ranking servicemember.Former Vice Adm. Haydn Edmundson was head of the military’s personnel in 2021 when he was accused of assaulting another member of the navy during a 1991 deployment.The complainant, Stephanie Viau, testified during the trial that began in February that she was 19 years old and had the navy’s lowest rank at the time of the alleged assault, while Edmundson was an older officer.Edmundson pleaded not guilty and testified that he never had sexual contact with Viau.In reading his decision in the Ontario Court of Justice, Justice Matthew Webber said prosecutors did not prove their case beyond a reasonable doubt.

US military completes withdrawal from junta-ruled Niger	DAKAR, Senegal (AP) — The withdrawal of U.S. troops from Niger is complete, an American official said Monday.A small number of military personnel assigned to guard the U.S. Embassy remain, Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh told reporters.Earlier this year, Niger’s ruling junta ended an agreement that allowed U.S. troops to operate in the West African country. A few months later, officials from both countries said in a joint statement that U.S. troops would complete their withdrawal by the middle of September.The U.S. handed over its last military bases in Niger to local authorities last month, but about two dozen American soldiers had remained in Niger, largely for administrative duties related to the withdrawal, Singh said.Niger’s ouster of American troops following a coup last year has broad ramifications for Washington because it's forcing troops to abandon critical bases that were used for counterterrorism missions in the Sahel. groups linked to al-Qaida and the Islamic State group operate in the vast region south of the Sahara desert.

Writers Percival Everett, Rachel Kushner are among 6 Booker Prize finalists	LONDON (AP) — American writers Percival Everett and Rachel Kushner are among six finalists shortlisted for the prestigious Booker Prize for fiction this year, organizers said Monday. Five of the six authors are women — the largest number in the prize's 55-year history. Everett, a 2022 Booker finalist for 'The Trees,' is again nominated for 'James,' which reimagines Mark Twain’s 'Huckleberry Finn' from the point of view of its main Black character, the enslaved man Jim.Kushner, another former Booker finalist with her bestseller 'The Mars Room,' is a contender again with spy story 'Creation Lake.'The other finalists vying for the 50,000 pound ($64,000) award are Britain's Samantha Harvey, for 'Orbital'; Canada's Anne Michaels for 'Held'; Australia's Charlotte Wood for 'Stone Yard Devotional'; and Yael van der Wouden — the first Dutch author to be shortlisted for the Booker — for her debut, 'The Safekeep.'Organizers said the stories transport readers from World War I battlefields to America's Deep South in the 19th century to the International Space Station. 'Here is storytelling in which people confront the world in all its instability and complexity. The fault lines of our times are here,' said author Edmund de Waal, who chairs this year's five-member judging panel. 'They are books that made us want to keep on reading, to ring up friends and tell them about them.'The winner will be announced on Nov. 12 at a ceremony in London.Founded in 1969, the Booker Prize celebrates the best fiction and is open to novels from any country published in the U.K. and Ireland.	https://apnews.com/article/booker-prize-fiction-finalists-2024-5586838bf6bc3c90e914e747e50c275b	2024-09-16T09:31:19-07:00	
DEA shutting down two offices in China even as agency struggles to stem flow of fentanyl chemicals	The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration is shutting down two of its hard-won offices in China, The Associated Press has learned, a move that comes even as the agency struggles to disrupt the flow of precursor chemicals from the country that have fueled a fentanyl epidemic blamed for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Americans.'These closings reflect the need to harness DEA’s limited and strained resources to target where we can make the biggest impact in saving American lives,' DEA Administrator Anne Milgram told agents in an email last week that also included plans to close a dozen other offices worldwide to trim DEA’s current footprint of 93 offices in 69 countries.Though rumored for months, it was unclear exactly why DEA is shutting down its offices in Shanghai and Guangzhou, leaving only those in the capital Beijing and the autonomously-governed city of Hong Kong, and how that could affect its efforts on fentanyl. DEA said only that the move followed a data-driven process intended to maximize the agency's impact. 'Americans have a right to know why this decision was made and where DEA intends to reallocate taxpayers’ hard-earned dollars,' said Iowa Republican Chuck Grassley, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee. DEA veterans say it marked yet another setback in the often-halting cooperation between the two geopolitical rivals. Even though China has added dozens of fentanyl-producing chemicals to its list of controlled substances and warned companies against shipping them, the country remains the world’s largest source of precursors in a fentanyl crisis blamed for nearly 100,000 U.S. deaths a year.'We need to work with the Chinese and get them to help stop the flow of precursor chemicals,' said Mike Vigil, a former head of DEA’s foreign operations, 'and it’s hard to develop those relationships with less representation in the country.'It took years of U.S. requests before China even agreed to allow the DEA to open offices outside of the capital of Beijing in 2017. Hopes were high for its two-agent office in Guangzhou, a major center for trade and organized crime, and a similar outpost in Shanghai, the country’s financial hub.But a U.S. official familiar with the closures who spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive diplomatic matter said China’s cooperation was largely in name only, and that the agents assigned to the field offices faced difficulties obtaining visas and numerous restrictions as U.S.-China relations soured.China suspended anti-narcotics cooperation in 2022 in retaliation for then-Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan, a self-ruled island which Beijing claims. Those efforts appeared to improve more recently, however, following President Joe Biden’s meeting last year in San Francisco with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping.The DEA's Milgram traveled to China in January with Todd Robinson, the top anti-narcotics official at the State Department. A few months later, authorities in Beijing arrested a Chinese national who fled the U.S. after being named in a criminal indictment out of Los Angeles federal court for fentanyl trafficking.Milgram has increasingly emphasized how such cooperation could help disrupt China’s trade in precursors and its role as a magnet for the laundering of illegal drug proceeds worldwide.'This work has been constructive so far, but I believe it’s too early to know whether we’ll see the results that we want to see,' Milgram told a congressional panel earlier this year. 'If we could stop the flow of precursors from China, we could have a significant impact.'China would not comment on what it said was a DEA internal matter. However, Liu Pengyu, a spokesperson for China's Embassy in Washington, praised recent cooperation between the two countries on fentanyl, citing the recent visit to DEA headquarters by a delegation led by the director general of the Chinese Narcotics Control Bureau. 'China hopes that, the U.S. side can work with China in the same direction and continue the pragmatic counter-narcotics cooperation based on mutual respect, managing differences and mutual benefits.'Collectively, the 14 offices DEA has slated to close account for more than 100 agents and employees, and include some, including in Russia, Cyprus and Indonesia, that are home to flourishing criminal underworlds with connections to Latin American cartels who smuggle the bulk of cocaine, methamphetamine and fentanyl sold in the U.S.Other offices slated to close are: Bahamas, Egypt, Georgia, Haiti, Kazakhstan, Mozambique, Myanmar, Nicaragua and Senegal. Milgram also announced plans to open offices in Albania and Jordan.The actions come 18 months after an outside review of the DEA’s global footprint that followed an AP investigation into a foreign corruption scandal involving José Irizarry, a disgraced former DEA agent in Colombia who confessed to skimming millions of dollars from drug money laundering operations to fund a worldwide joyride of partying and prostitutes.That review noted the now-50-year-old agency had never conducted such an assessment to reflect changing threats, and recommended a 'rightsizing' of resources to fight fentanyl.Four of the offices slated to close – the Bahamas, Haiti, Myanmar and Nicaragua – are in countries that, along with China, were designated by the White House as major drug producing or transit zones. Andre Kellum, who retired in 2021 as regional director for Africa, was especially critical of the closure of the office in Senegal, where an elite unit of local police trained and vetted by the DEA was behind scores of major busts. Close ties with authorities in Mozambique, where the DEA opened an office in 2017, was key to nabbing Brazil’s biggest drug trafficker.'This is shortsighted,' he said. 'Those relationships are critical and aren’t easily rebuilt.'William Warren, the DEA’s former regional director in the Middle East, noted that the agency can also act as a vital extra set of American eyes in countries that are hotbeds for weapons smuggling, human trafficking and terrorist groups.'The DEA is a force multiplier for national security,' he said 'It’s not just about seizing drugs. The leads, information and intelligence the DEA passes on to other federal agencies keeps Americans safe from all kinds of threats.'___Mustian reported from New York.___Contact AP’s global investigative team at Investigative@ap.org.	https://apnews.com/article/dea-drugs-china-fentanyl-diplomacy-4405d6169a47c723c6932a3294c4ac35	2024-09-16T08:07:28-07:00	
US imposes sanctions on a spyware firm behind a tool used to spy on dissidents and journalists	WASHINGTON (AP) — The United States announced new sanctions Monday against a commercial spyware company headed by a former Israeli military officer whose program allowed easy access to almost any information stored on a smartphone.U.S. officials and private researchers say Intellexa Consortium's products have been used for mass surveillance campaigns around the world, allowing unscrupulous users to track and obtain sensitive information from dissidents, journalists, political candidates and opposition figures. The penalties target five people and one organization connected to Intellexa, a Greece-based network of companies with subsidiaries in North Macedonia, Hungary, Ireland and the British Virgin Islands. The company developed and sold a suite of spyware tools known as Predator that allowed entry into a target's device without requiring them to click on a link or attachment.The program would then grant access to the camera and microphone as well as any data or files stored on the compromised phone.Hub peek embed (apf-politics) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) 'The United States will not tolerate the reckless propagation of disruptive technologies that threatens our national security and undermines the privacy and civil liberties of our citizens,' said Bradley T. Smith, acting undersecretary of the Treasury for terrorism and financial intelligence.Several subsidiaries of Intellexa and two employees, including its founder, were sanctioned earlier this year by the Biden administration. Last year, the Commerce Department blacklisted Intellexa and one of its subsidiaries, denying them access to U.S. technology.The five people subject to the new penalties each held senior positions at Intellexa or one of its subsidiaries, U.S. officials say. The Aliada Group, another subsidiary based in the British Virgin Islands, also was sanctioned over allegations of enabling financial transactions for Intellexa that totaled tens of millions of dollars, officials said.Messages left with Intellexa and its executives were not immediately returned Monday.Intellexa was created in 2019 by former Israeli military officer Tal Dilian. Dilian and Sara Hamou, a corporate offshoring specialist who has provided managerial services to Intellexa, were penalized earlier this year in what Biden administration officials said was the first time sanctions were issued over the misuse of spyware.Individuals and organizations under sanctions are prohibited from engaging in business or financial transactions within the U.S. or with U.S. entities.Amnesty International’s Security Lab published a report last year that found Predator had been used to target but not necessarily infect devices connected to the president of the European Parliament, Roberta Metsola, and the president of Taiwan, Tsai Ing-Wen, as well as Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, and Sen. John Hoeven, R-N.D.Europe also has faced a number of spyware incidents. Predator spyware was reportedly used in Greece, a revelation that helped precipitate the resignation in 2022 of two top government officials, including the national intelligence director.	https://apnews.com/article/spyware-sanctions-intellexa-israel-biden-treasury-3951466b68fd592f4db4e164525de824	2024-09-16T07:51:21-07:00

Authoritarian Belarus president pardons 37 political prisoners out of more than 1,300	TALLINN, Estonia (AP) — Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko on Monday pardoned 37 people serving prison sentences for 'extremist' crimes, his office said. It is the fourth time since July that the authoritarian leader has pardoned dozens of political prisoners in what some observers see as an attempt to soften his image. Lukashenko's office didn't identify any of the prisoners pardoned Monday, but said they include six women. It described them as guilty of 'crimes of an extremist character,' a reference to people who took part in protests. Lukashenko’s press service said all had repented and asked to be released.There are over 1,300 political prisoners in Belarus, according to the Viasna human rights center. They include the group’s founder and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Ales Bialiatski and Polish newspaper journalist Andrzej Poczobut, whose release Poland is seeking. At least six political prisoners have died behind bars, Viasna said.Hub peek embed (apf-politics) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) In 2020, Belarus was rocked by its largest-ever protests following an election that gave Lukashenko a sixth term in office but was condemned by the opposition and the West as fraudulent. According to Viasna, 65,000 people have been arrested since the protests began and hundreds of thousands have fled Belarus.Before Monday’s releases, Lukashenko since July had pardoned 78 other people convicted of participating in mass protests, including journalists and activists with serious illnesses. They included the leader of the Belarusian Popular Front, Ryhor Kastusiou, who suffers from severe cancer.Viasna representative Pavel Sapelka said Lukashenko's pardoning of some convicts doesn't mean a relaxation of his crackdown on dissent.'Freeing some political prisoners doesn't mark the start of a thaw in Belarus, as harsh repression continues and the authorities have rounded up four times as many activists — about 400 people in three months,' Sapelka said.Some observers linked the pardons to a presidential election next year in which Lukashenko is set to extend his 30-year rule.'Lukashenko is trying to humanize his image ahead of the presidential election to start bargaining with the West about the recognition of vote results and a partial rollback of Western sanctions,' analyst Valery Karbalevich said.	https://apnews.com/article/belarus-president-lukashenko-pardons-political-prisoners-8921b983238219084b49b8f5890d3ee6	2024-09-16T05:54:39-07:00	
A Sao Paulo mayoral candidate is treated in hospital after a rival attacks him with a chair	RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) — A candidate in Sao Paulo ’s mayoral race was treated and released Monday from a hospital after one of his five rivals in a televised debate slammed him with a metal chair following references to allegations of sexual misconduct.Pablo Marçal, a personal development influencer turned right-wing politician, referred to the allegations against José Luiz Datena, a former TV presenter turned candidate, during the debate Sunday evening and said Datena had wanted to slap him. He added: 'You’re not even man enough to do this.'Datena, who has denied the allegations, then came over toward Marçal’s podium with the chair above his head and slammed it into Marçal’s side as the influencer put up his arms. The moderator of the TV Cultura debate then quickly interrupted and cut to commercials, and the debate resumed later Sunday night without Marçal.Marçal’s team shared video of him subsequently rushing to a hospital in an ambulance while receiving respiratory support. He explained on social media channels Monday that he had felt pain while breathing, and had suffered a fracture at the bottom of his rib cage.Hub peek embed (apf-politics) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) Marçal suffered 'trauma to the right chest region and right wrist, without major associated complications,' the Syrian-Lebanese hospital said in a statement Monday, adding that he had been discharged. A video on social media shows a doctor talking to Marçal in the hospital bed, telling him that he has 'a little line of a fracture.' Marçal referred to the incident on social media as 'attempted homicide,' and compared it to the assassination attempt against Donald Trump earlier this year and to the stabbing of former Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro in the lead up to the 2018 presidential election.Marçal has parlayed his internet fandom and fiery rhetoric into a nascent political movement, shooting up in the polls in recent months and now running neck-and-neck with incumbent Ricardo Nunes and leftist lawmaker Guilherme Boulos. That has drawn even greater attention to the mayoral race in Brazil’s biggest city.An inquiry into the alleged misconduct by Datena never resulted in any charges, and it was shelved when the accuser retracted her statements. Speaking to reporters after the debate, Datena explained that the episode had been especially painful for him because he believes it prompted his mother-in-law to suffer a series of strokes and pass away.On Monday, Datena said in a statement that he had made a mistake, but that he did not regret it 'at all.''If the circumstances were the same, I would not refrain from repeating the gesture, an extreme response to a history of aggression perpetrated against me and many others by my adversary,' his statement said.Marçal’s campaign team said the debate shouldn’t have continued without him, and that it hopes appropriate legal measures will be taken against Datena. A statement from Sao Paulo's public security agency said the incident was registered as 'bodily injury and insult' at a local police station on Sunday night, indicating that an investigation was under way.President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva is backing Boulos. Bolsonaro endorsed Nunes, but many supporters of the former president have rallied behind Marçal, enthralled by his persona.	https://apnews.com/article/brazil-marcal-chair-datena-attack-debate-c5781f54d5583067b2a57494b9339081	2024-09-16T05:16:56-07:00	
An American pastor detained in China for nearly 20 years has been released	WASHINGTON (AP) — A Christian pastor from California has been freed from China after nearly 20 years behind bars and is back home in the U.S., the State Department said Monday.David Lin, 68, was detained after he entered China in 2006, later convicted of contract fraud and sentenced to life in prison, according to the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom and advocacy groups.'Praise God! We got the call late last night!!! Dad is free and over Alaska now,' the pastor’s daughter, Alice Lin, said by text message Sunday to Bob Fu, a longtime supporter and the founder of China Aid, an U.S.-based advocacy group for persecuted activists in China. Fu shared with The Associated Press a screenshot of the text sent before the Lins reunited.The Biden administration has been working on David Lin's case and those of other wrongly detained Americans in China for years and have raised them at every meeting with senior Chinese officials, including Secretary of State Antony Blinken’s meeting this summer with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi in Laos. Such meetings aim to keep communication open between Washington and Beijing despite escalating tensions.Hub peek embed (apf-politics) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) 'We welcome David Lin's release from prison in the People’s Republic of China. He has returned to the United States and reunited with his family for the first time in nearly 20 years,' State Department spokesman Matthew Miller told reporters.'We’ll continue to push the release of other Americans,' he said. 'It’s something that we continue to work on. It’s an important step forward, and we’re going to continue to push for the release of other Americans.'Lin frequently traveled to China in the 1990s to spread the gospel, according to China Aid, which says Lin sought a license from the Chinese government to carry out Christian ministry. It’s unlikely he was granted permission, and he was detained in 2006 when assisting a church not authorized by Chinese officials, the group said. Lin was formally arrested in 2009 on suspicion of contract fraud and, after a court review, was sentenced to life in prison, China Aid said.The charge is frequently used against leaders of churches that operate outside state-sponsored faith groups, and it is a crime that Lin denied, according to the Dui Hua Foundation, a humanitarian group that advocates for prisoners in China. The commission on religious freedom says those leading and taking part in churches not sanctioned by the Chinese government 'often face intimidation, harassment, arrest and harsh sentences.'In China, all Christian churches must pledge loyalty to the ruling Communist Party and register with the government. Any unregistered congregation is considered an underground church whose activities are illegal in China. Beijing has always cracked down on 'unlawful preaching,' and efforts have only intensified in the past decade.Lin's sentence had been reduced and he had been due for release in April 2030. The commission on religious freedom noted in 2019 that there were reports Lin was in declining health and faced possible threats to his safety in prison.The Chinese foreign ministry didn't immediately respond to requests for comment about Lin's release.Other Americans known to remain detained in China include Kai Li, a businessman who is being held on espionage-related charges that his family says are bogus, and Mark Swidan, who was sentenced on drug charges. The State Department’s office of the special presidential envoy on hostage affairs has designated the two as 'wrongful detainees,' a label given to Americans jailed in foreign countries for what the U.S. government considers legally specious allegations or for improper motivations.Nelson Wells Jr. and Dawn Michelle Hunt also are incarcerated in China over drug-related charges, and their families, along with Li's son, will be among those speaking at a congressional hearing Wednesday about Americans held in China.Rep. Michael McCaul, the Texas Republican who chairs the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said he was 'extremely glad' Lin was released after 17 years behind bars and called for Li and Swidan to be freed immediately.Lin's 'capture, like so many others, marks a rising trend of hostage diplomacy by authoritarians around the world,' McCaul said on the social platform X.___Associated Press writers Courtney Bonnell and Matthew Lee contributed from Washington.	https://apnews.com/article/china-american-detainee-released-pastor-ad3a2104bac2490f0d7eb773faaeafda	2024-09-16T04:48:56-07:00	
Putin orders military to boost troop numbers by 180,000 to 1.5 million as Ukraine fighting continues	MOSCOW (AP) — Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday ordered the country’s military to increase its number of troops by 180,000 to a total of 1.5 million, as Moscow’s military action in Ukraine drags on for more than 2 ½ years.Putin’s decree, published on the official government website, will take effect Dec. 1. It sets the overall number of Russian military personnel at nearly 2.4 million, including 1.5 million troops, and orders the government to provide the necessary funding.The previous increase in Russian troop numbers came last December, when a decree by Putin set the total number of Russian military personnel at about 2.2 million, including 1.32 million troops.The most capable Russian troops have been pressing an offensive in eastern Ukraine, where they have made incremental but steady gains in the past few months. In June, Putin put the number of troops involved in what the Kremlin calls the 'special military operation' in Ukraine at nearly 700,000.Hub peek embed (VladimirPutin) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) After calling up 300,000 reservists in the face of Ukraine’s counteroffensive in the fall of 2022, Russian authorities have switched to filling the ranks of troops fighting in Ukraine with volunteer soldiers, who have been attracted by relatively high wages.Many commentators have noted that the Kremlin has been reluctant to call more reservists, fearing domestic destabilization like what happened in 2022 when hundreds of thousands fled Russia to avoid being sent to combat.The shortage of military personnel has been widely cited as a key reason behind the success of Ukraine's incursion into Russia's Kursk region launched Aug. 6. The Kremlin has sought to avoid the redeployment of troops from eastern Ukraine and relied on reinforcements from other areas to stem the Ukrainian incursion. The Russian Defense Ministry on Monday reported reclaiming control of two more villages in the Kursk region from Ukrainian forces.	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-putin-military-numbers-9c5554302486adfe7b3d69cb297f8a98	2024-09-16T03:51:00-07:00	
281 inmates escape after floods brought down prison's walls in northeast Nigeria	ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) — Nigerian authorities said 281 inmates escaped after devastating floods brought down a prison’s walls in the country's northeast.A major dam collapsed on Sept. 10, unleashing severe flooding that left 30 people dead and over a million displaced, and prompted evacuations across the state of Borno.Officers attempted to evacuate the city of Maiduguri's main prison last week when they found out that the prisoners had escaped, Umar Abubakar, spokesperson for the Nigeria Correctional Services said in a statement Sunday night.'The floods brought down the walls of the correctional facilities including the Medium Security Custodial Centre, as well as the staff quarters in the city,' Abubakar said.Security personnel were able to recapture seven of the inmates and an operation is still ongoing to locate the rest, he said.The collapse caused some of the state’s worst flooding since the same dam collapsed 30 years ago. The state government said the dam was at capacity due to unusually high rains.Two years ago, heavy flooding in Nigeria killed more than 600 people across the country.West Africa has experienced some of the heaviest flooding in decades this year, affecting over 2.3 million people, a threefold increase from 2023, according to the UN.	https://apnews.com/article/nigeria-floods-prison-inmates-escape-66776a1bc5df05149b46eaf048874a54	2024-09-16T03:48:56-07:00	
Columnists resign from the Jewish Chronicle over allegations Gaza articles were fabricated	LONDON (AP) — Prominent columnists have resigned from the Jewish Chronicle newspaper over allegations that it published fabricated articles about the Israel-Hamas war.The resignations on Sunday came after the London-based newspaper removed multiple articles by a freelance journalist and apologized to readers, saying it conducted an investigation into the writer and was 'not satisfied with some of his claims.'The newspaper didn't specify which articles by the journalist, Elon Perry, were problematic. Among other claims, Perry — who described himself as a commando in the Israel Defense Forces — alleged that Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar planned to smuggle himself and Israeli hostages out of Gaza through the border area with Egypt known as the Philadelphi corridor. Israeli media initially circulated the article, but later came to question its sourcing. The report has drawn speculation that it may have been part of a disinformation campaign in support of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, because the claims largely mirrored those made by the leader about the Philadelphi corridor earlier this month.Long-time Jewish Chronicle columnist Jonathan Freedland resigned in protest on Sunday, saying 'the latest scandal brings great disgrace on the paper' and that it has 'departed from the traditions that built its reputation as the world's oldest Jewish newspaper.''Too often, the JC (Jewish Chronicle) reads like a partisan, ideological instrument, its judgements political rather than journalistic,' Freedland posted on X.Fellow columnists Hadley Freeman and David Aaronovitch also announced they were quitting, while a spokesperson for author and comedian David Baddiel said he had 'no plans to write any more columns for the paper.'Freeman said in a post that she resigned because 'recent events have made it impossible for me to stay.'The newspaper's editor, Jake Wallis Simons, said that it was 'every newspaper editor’s worst nightmare to be deceived by a journalist' and that the newspaper has cut all ties with Perry. 'His work has now been removed from our website. Readers can be assured that stronger internal procedures are being implemented,' he wrote on X.	https://apnews.com/article/jewish-chronicle-fabricated-articles-israel-hamas-gaza-d6b82c43b7ee400c78ac1901cd92c7ce	2024-09-16T03:07:18-07:00	
Yemen's Houthi rebels say they downed another US-made MQ-9 Reaper drone	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Yemen's Houthi rebels claimed Monday that they shot down another American-made MQ-9 Reaper drone, with video circulating online showing what appeared to be a surface-to-air missile strike and flaming wreckage strewn across the ground. The U.S. military did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the Houthis' claimed downing of a drone over the country's southwestern Dhamar province. The Houthis have exaggerated claims in the past in their ongoing campaign targeting shipping in the Red Sea over the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip. However, the online video bolstered the claim, particularly after two recent claims by the Houthis included no evidence. Other videos showed armed rebels gathered around the flaming wreckage, a propeller similar to those used by the armed drone visible in the flames. One attempted to pick up a piece of the metal before dropping it due to the heat. Brig. Gen. Yahya Saree, a Houthi military spokesperson, identified the drone as an MQ-9, without elaborating on how he came to the determination. He said it was the third downed by the group in a week, though the other two claims did not include similar video or other evidence. The U.S. military similarly has not acknowledged losing any aircraft. Saree said the Houthis used a locally produced missile. However, Iran has armed the rebels with a surface-to-air missile known as the 358 for years. Iran denies arming the rebels, though Tehran-manufactured weaponry has been found on the battlefield and in seaborne shipments heading to Yemen despite a United Nations arms embargo.Reapers, which cost around $30 million apiece, can fly at altitudes up to 50,000 feet (15,240 meters) and have an endurance of up to 24 hours before needing to land. The aircraft have been flown by both the U.S. military and the CIA over Yemen for years.The Houthis have targeted more than 80 merchant vessels with missiles and drones since the war in Gaza started in October. They seized one vessel and sank two in the campaign that has also killed four sailors. Other missiles and drones have either been intercepted by a U.S.-led coalition in the Red Sea or failed to reach their targets, which have included Western military vessels as well.The rebels maintain that they target ships linked to Israel, the U.S. or the U.K. to force an end to Israel’s campaign against Hamas in Gaza. However, many of the ships attacked have little or no connection to the conflict, including some bound for Iran.Those attacks include a barrage that struck the Greek-flagged oil tanker Sounion in the Red Sea. Salvagers have begun towing away the burning oil tanker, hoping to avoid a catastrophic leak of its 1 million barrels of oil on board.	https://apnews.com/article/yemen-houthi-rebels-drone-red-sea-gaza-1eb59e09351de0872de2e23cad720851	2024-09-16T01:11:53-07:00	
The Taliban have suspended polio vaccination campaigns in Afghanistan, the UN says	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — The Taliban have suspended polio vaccination campaigns in Afghanistan, the U.N. said Monday. It’s a devastating setback for polio eradication, since the virus is one of the world’s most infectious and any unvaccinated groups of children where the virus is spreading could undo years of progress.Afghanistan is one of two countries in which the spread of the potentially fatal, paralyzing disease has never been stopped. The other is Pakistan. It’s likely that the Taliban’s decision will have major repercussions for other countries in the region and beyond.News of the suspension was relayed to U.N. agencies right before the September immunization campaign was due to start. No reason was given for the suspension, and no one from the Taliban-controlled government was immediately available for comment.A top official from the World Health Organization said it was aware of discussions to move away from house-to-house vaccinations and instead have immunizations in places like mosques.Hub peek embed (apf-politics) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) The WHO has confirmed 18 polio cases in Afghanistan this year, all but two in the south of the country. That’s up from six cases in 2023.'The Global Polio Eradication Initiative is aware of the recent policy discussions on shifting from house-to-house polio vaccination campaigns to site-to-site vaccination in parts of Afghanistan,' said Dr. Hamid Jafari from the WHO. 'Partners are in the process of discussing and understanding the scope and impact of any change in current policy.' Polio campaigns in neighboring Pakistan are regularly marred by violence. Militants target vaccination teams and police assigned to protect them, falsely claiming that the campaigns are a Western conspiracy to sterilize children.As recently as August, the WHO reported that Afghanistan and Pakistan were continuing to implement an 'intensive and synchronized campaign' focusing on improved vaccination coverage in endemic zones and an effective and timely response to detections elsewhere.During a June 2024 nationwide campaign, Afghanistan used a house-to-house vaccination strategy for the first time in five years, a tactic that helped to reach the majority of children targeted, the WHO said. But southern Kandahar province, the base of Taliban supreme leader Hibatullah Akhundzada, used site-to-site or mosque-to-mosque vaccination campaigns, which are less effective than going to people’s homes. Kandahar continues to have a large pool of susceptible children because it is not carrying out house-to-house vaccinations, the WHO said. 'The overall women’s inclusion in vaccination campaigns remains around 20% in Afghanistan, leading to inadequate access to all children in some areas,' it said.Any setback in Afghanistan poses a risk to the program in Pakistan due to high population movement, the WHO warned last month.Pakistani health official Anwarul Haq said the polio virus would eventually spread and continue affecting children in both countries if vaccination campaigns aren't run regularly and in a synchronized manner.'Afghanistan is the only neighbor from where Afghan people in large numbers come to Pakistan and then go back,' said Haq, the coordinator at the National Emergency Operation Center for Polio Eradication. 'People from other neighboring countries, like India and Iran, don’t come to Pakistan in large numbers.'There needs to be a united effort to eliminate the disease, he told The Associated Press.The campaign suspension is the latest obstacle in what has become a problematic global effort to stop polio. The initiative, which costs about $1 billion every year, has missed multiple deadlines to wipe out the disease and technical mistakes in the vaccination strategy set by WHO and partners have been costly.The oral vaccine has also inadvertently seeded outbreaks in dozens of countries across Africa, Asia and the Middle East and now accounts for the majority of polio cases worldwide.This was seen most recently in Gaza, where a baby was partially paralyzed by a mutated strain of polio first seen in the oral vaccine, marking the territory’s first case in more than 25 years.___Associated Press writers Maria Cheng in London and Munir Ahmed in Islamabad contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/afghanistan-taliban-polio-vaccination-campaign-suspend-9fc299a2e72dddf81f913da9f7f05e81	2024-09-16T00:59:19-07:00	
Flooding in Central Europe leaves 4 dead in Poland and 1 in the Czech Republic	WARSAW, Poland (AP) — Heavy flooding pounded Central Europe on Monday, killing four more people in Poland and one in the Czech Republic.Following an emergency government meeting, Prime Minister Donald Tusk announced a state of natural disaster in the flooded areas to facilitate evacuation and rescue operations, as well as expedite financial support for the victims.Tusk told a news conference that the Finance Ministry has so far earmarked 1 billion zlotys ($258,000) for immediate payouts. Water levels have subsided, leaving streets covered in debris and mud, damaged bridges and some burst dams and embankments. Schools and offices in the affected areas were closed Monday and drinking water and food were being delivered by trucks. Many Polish cities, including Warsaw, have called for food donations for flood survivors. Experts are warning of a flood threat in Opole, a city of some 130,000 residents, where the Oder River has reached high levels and started bursting its banks at some points. Concerns have also been raised in the city of Wroclaw, home to about 640,000 residents, where the flooding was expected on Wednesday. The city suffered a disastrous flood in 1997 and the trauma is still present there. Hub peek embed (Floods) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) The number of flood victims in southwestern Poland rose to five after the body of a surgeon returning from hospital duty was found in the town of Nysa on Monday morning, firefighters said.Earlier, the bodies of two women and two men were found in the towns of Bielsko-Biala and Ladek-Zdroj, and in two villages.Police in the Czech Republic said that one woman drowned in the northeast, which has been pounded by record rainfall since Thursday. Seven other people were missing on Monday, up from four a day earlier.The floods have already killed six people in Romania and one in Austria.Czech authorities declared a state of emergency in two northeastern regions, which have seen the worst flooding, including in the Jeseniky mountains near the Polish border.A number of towns and cities were submerged on Sunday in the northeast, with thousands evacuated. Military helicopters joined rescuers on boats in efforts to transport people to safety.Waters were receding from the mountainous areas on Monday, leaving behind destroyed houses and bridges and damaged roads.In most parts of the country, conditions were expected to improve on Monday.Floods moving toward the southeastern Czech Republic inundated the town of Litovel, while the Oder River flooded parts of the city of Ostrava at the confluence with the Opava River, forcing the evacuation of hundreds of people on Monday after a natural dam broke.Firefighters and others were working to fix the problem.Authorities in Ostrava, the country’s third-largest city, warned against traveling there. Most people were without hot water and heating in the city.Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala visited the town of Jesenik, one of the hardest hit places.'The worst is behind us and now, we have to deal with all the damage,' Fiala said following the visit. After flooding hit Austria, the Czech Republic, Poland and Romania, it might impact Slovakia and Hungary next as a result of a low-pressure system from northern Italy that has been dumping record rainfall in the region since Thursday.In Hungary, the mayor of Budapest warned residents that the largest floods in a decade were expected to hit the capital later in the week, with the waters of the Danube River set to breach the city’s lower quays by Tuesday morning.Prime Minister Viktor Orbán canceled his planned foreign engagements, including an address to a plenary session of the European Parliament on Wednesday where heated debates were expected over his conduct since Hungary took over the European Union’s rotating presidency in July. 'Until we reach the peak and get past the worst of it, I naturally won’t be leaving the country, I’ll be here at home,' he said. Budapest Mayor Gergely Karácsony wrote on Facebook that the city would use 1 million sandbags to bolster flood defenses, and asked residents to take extra care when near the river.___Karel Janicek reported from Prague.

Former prominent BBC news anchor gets suspended sentence for indecent images of children on phone	LONDON (AP) — Former BBC news anchor Huw Edwards, once one of the most prominent media figures in Britain, was given a suspended prison sentence Monday for images of child sexual abuse on his phone.Edwards, 63, pleaded guilty in Westminster Magistrates’ Court in July to three counts of making indecent images of children, a charge related to photos sent to him on the WhatsApp messaging service by a man convicted of distributing images of child sex abuse.Chief Magistrate Paul Goldspring sentenced Edwards to a six-month prison term suspended for two years. He will be listed on a sex offenders register for seven years.'It is not an exaggeration to say your long-earned reputation is in tatters,' Goldspring said. Edwards' fall from grace over the past year has caused turmoil for the BBC after it was revealed the publicly funded broadcaster paid him about 200,000 pounds ($263,000) for five months of his salary after he had been arrested in November while on leave. The BBC has asked him to pay it back.'We are appalled by his crimes,' the BBC said in a statement after the sentencing. 'He has betrayed not just the BBC, but audiences who put their trust in him.'Edwards had been one of the BBC’s top earners when he was suspended in July 2023 over separate claims made last year involving a teenager he allegedly paid for sexually explicit photos. Police investigated and decided not to bring charges.Although Edwards was not publicly named at the time those allegations surfaced, his wife later revealed he was the news presenter investigated and said he was hospitalized for serious mental health issues.He never returned to the air but the BBC kept him on the payroll until he resigned in April for health reasons.Edwards began his BBC career in Wales four decades ago. He went on to become lead anchor on the nighttime news for two decades and led the coverage of the funeral of Queen Elizabeth II in 2022 as well as election coverage.The BBC said at the time of his guilty plea that it was shocked to hear the details of the charges against him.More than 375 sexual images were sent to him on WhatsApp between December 2020 and August 2021. More than 40 were indecent images of children, including seven classified as 'category A' — the most indecent — with children estimated to be between 13 and 15. One child was aged between 7 and 9.In chats with Alex Williams, who was later convicted of distributing child sex abuse images, Edwards was asked if he wanted sexual images of a person whose 'age could be discerned as being between 14 and 16,' and Edwards replied, 'yes xxx,' prosecutor Ian Hope said.'From that chat in December 2020, Alex Williams said that he had ‘a file of vids and pics for you of someone special,’' Hope said. Edwards asked who the subject and was then sent three images that appeared to be the same person who appeared to be aged 14 to 16, Hope said.Williams later sent Edwards a video in February 2021 that involved two children, one possibly as young as seven and the other no older than 13, involving penetration, Hope said.Edwards did not respond, but when asked by Williams if the material was too young, he said, 'don’t send underage.' He also said he didn’t want him to send anything illegal.Defense lawyer Philip Evans said Edwards was 'truly sorry' for the offenses and the damage he had done to his family.'He apologizes sincerely and he makes it clear that he has the utmost regret and he recognizes that he has betrayed the priceless trust and faith of so many people,' Evans said.Evans said Williams had reached out to Edwards on Instagram at a time when he was mentally vulnerable and began sending him images. He said Edwards never received gratification from the images and hadn’t saved them or sent them to anyone.Hope said Edwards paid Williams 'not insignificant sums of money,' as gifts that Williams used while studying at a university.At one point, Williams asked for a 'Christmas gift after all the hot videos' he had sent. Edwards remarked that some of the images were 'amazing,' Hope said.Williams, 25, was given a suspended 1-year sentence in March for possessing and distributing indecent images as well as possessing prohibited images of children.	https://apnews.com/article/huw-edwards-indecent-images-court-95d3ee56ed75340cf334696db69648ef	2024-09-15T23:59:35-07:00	
Papua New Guinea violence leaves between 20 and 50 people dead, UN official says	MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — Violence among illegal miners in Papua New Guinea has left between 20 and 50 people dead, a United Nations official said Monday.The fighting started days ago and is continuing in the Porgera Valley, near the site of a landslide in May estimated to have killed more than 2,000 people, according to the South Pacific island nation’s government.The U.N.'s humanitarian adviser for Papua New Guinea, Mate Bagossy, said the death toll of at least 20 as of Sunday was based on information from community members and local authorities in Enga province in the nation’s mountainous inland.'We have confirmed that at least 20 people have been killed, but as per the last news that I have, it’s likely up to 50 people,' Bagossy told The Associated Press. 'The fighting is continuing.''Today some security forces have started moving in ... so it remains to be seen what effect this will have,' Bagossy said, referring to the army and police.Bagossy did not have information on the numbers wounded.Hub peek embed (apf-politics) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) Papua New Guinea police did not respond to a request on Monday for tallies of dead and wounded in the valley.National Police Commissioner David Manning said an emergency had been declared on Saturday after the violence escalated, with police mobilizing to protect residents and infrastructure.'The deteriorating situation has been caused by illegal miners and illegal settlers who are victimizing traditional landowners and using violence to terrorize local communities,' Manning said in a statement.The nearby New Porgera gold mine has halted most of its operations because of the violence until at least Thursday.'Over the past 24 hours a significant escalation in tribal fighting has impacted many of our local employees. Homes have been destroyed, family and friends injured or killed, and people have been unable to sleep while living in fear,' New Porgera General Manager James McTiernan said in a statement on Sunday.'I am incredibly saddened by these devastating events and sincerely hope that the government will soon restore peace to the valley,' McTiernan added.Enga Governor Peter Ipatas described the violence in the valley as unprecedented.'This situation is dire. We have witnessed innocent lives being claimed and properties destroyed within days. The current situation can't continue,' Ipatas said in a statement.A disaster management team led by the national government and the U.N. Development Program will meet in the national capital, Port Moresby, on Tuesday to coordinate a humanitarian response in a dangerous and remote environment.Tribal warfare is a growing security problem across Papua New Guinea and is rife in Enga, where recovery has been slow since the May 24 landslide.The United Nations conservatively estimated 670 villagers had died, while the Papua New Guinea government said more than 2,000 people had been buried.An unknown number of refugees from tribal violence in neighboring areas are thought to be among the casualties, adding to the complications in calculating a credible death toll.Continued fighting on the road from the disaster area to the provincial capital Wabag delayed the emergency response. Relief workers required army escorts to keep them safe.Pope Francis called for an end to tribal violence during a recent visit to this majority-Christian nation of an estimated 12 million people.Four months after the disaster, the main highway through the province remains buried under the collapsed mountainside.No heavy earthmoving equipment has been used on the huge expanse of boulders, splintered trees and mud for fear of triggering a second landslide, the U.N.’s International Organization for Migration said.But a 4.7-kilometer (3-mile) bypass road that would be safe from landslides was half-finished, the IOM said.Around 5,000 people remain in the pathway of a potential second landslide in what authorities describe as a high-risk zone downhill from the disaster.The provincial government is attempting to buy land outside the danger area to resettle those villagers, but complex negotiations have yet to be finalized, IOM said.Elsewhere in Papua New Guinea on Monday the nation was celebrating 49 years since the country gained independence from neighboring Australia.	https://apnews.com/article/papua-new-guinea-violence-porgera-e98e911db17f48169abf449083f472d8	2024-09-15T23:06:29-07:00

Israel-Hamas war latest: Israeli airstrikes kill 16 in Gaza, including 4 children, Palestinians say	Palestinian officials say Israeli airstrikes killed 16 people in the Gaza Strip on Monday, including five women and four children.A strike flattened a home in the built-up Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza, killing at least 10 people there, including four women and two children. The Awda Hospital, which received the bodies, confirmed the toll and also said 13 people were wounded. Hospital records show that the dead included a mother, her child and her five siblings.Another strike on a home in Gaza City killed six people, including a woman and two children, according to the Civil Defense, first responders who operate under the Hamas-run government.Israel says it only targets militants and accuses Hamas and other armed groups of endangering civilians by operating in residential areas. The military rarely comments on individual strikes, which often kill women and children.Gaza’s Health Ministry says more than 41,000 Palestinians have been killed in the territory since Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack triggered the Israel-Hamas war nearly a year ago. The ministry does not differentiate between fighters and civilians in its count but says a little over half of those killed were women and children. Israel says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence.The war has caused vast destruction and displaced about 90% of Gaza’s population of 2.3 million. Here’s the latest:Israeli settlers storm a West Bank school and beat staffers, Palestinians say. Israeli troops later arrest school's principal and 2 othersRAMALLAH, West Bank — Palestinians say Israeli settlers wielding sticks stormed a Palestinian school in the occupied West Bank, beating staff members and tying up the principal.The Israeli military said Palestinians had attacked an Israeli nearby, inflicting a head injury, before fleeing to the school on Monday. It said a group of Israelis followed the attackers and a confrontation ensued in which a number of Palestinians were hurt. Hassan Malihat, a Palestinian lawyer who at the time was visiting the school near the city of Jericho, said the settlers entered at around 8 a.m. He says the Israeli army arrived about two hours later and arrested three staff members, including the principal.The military said soldiers and police were dispatched to the school, ended the confrontation and arrested a number of suspects.The Palestinian Red Crescent rescue service says seven Palestinians were wounded in the confrontation.Settler violence has surged across the West Bank since Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack ignited the war in Gaza. In some cases, Israeli settlers have stormed Palestinian villages setting cars and properties ablaze.There has also been a rise in car-ramming, stabbing and shooting attacks carried out against Israelis by Palestinian militant groups and lone attackers. Israel captured the West Bank, along with Gaza and east Jerusalem, in the 1967 Mideast war — lands the Palestinians want for a future state.The 3 million Palestinians in the West Bank live under Israeli military rule, with the Western-backed Palestinian Authority exercising limited autonomy in some areas. Over 500,000 settlers with Israeli citizenship live in well over 100 settlements considered illegal by most of the international community.Turkish autopsy indicates American-Turkish activist killed by Israeli fire in the West Bank died from a gunshot wound to the headANKARA, Turkey — Initial findings from an autopsy by Turkish authorities indicate that Turkish-American activist Aysenur Ezgi Eygi who was killed by Israeli fire in the West Bank died from a gunshot wound to the head. The eight-page report, signed by four forensic doctors and a forensic technician, was made available to The Associated Press on Monday. It described details such as skull fractures caused by the gunshot and brain tissue damage, noting that a toxicology report and tissue sample analysis are still pending.The 26-year-old activist from Seattle, who held dual U.S. and Turkish citizenship, was killed on Sept. 6 during a demonstration against Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank. Her funeral and burial took place in the Turkish Aegean coastal town of Didim on Saturday.The Israeli military stated last week that Eygi was likely shot 'indirectly and unintentionally' by Israeli forces. Turkey is conducting its own investigation into her death.A U.N. agency says polio campaign in Gaza has reached 90% of the children targetedJERUSALEM — The U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees says the first round of a polio vaccination campaign in Gaza ended successfully by reaching 90% of the children it targeted.UNRWA head Philippe Lazzarini said in a post on the social media platform X, that Israel and Palestinian militants had largely observed humanitarian pauses to allow the campaign to proceed. The vaccination drive showed that 'when there is a political will, assistance can be provided without disruption,' Lazzarini wrote on Monday.UNRWA is the main provider of humanitarian assistance in the coastal enclave. Health workers plan to administer a second dose of the vaccine at the end of this month.The campaign was launched after the detection of Gaza’s first polio case in 25 years and sought to reach some 640,000 children under the age of 10. Health workers faced a host of challenges, including damaged roads, gutted health facilities and ongoing fighting nearly a year into the Israel-Hamas war.Israeli defense minister says time is running out for agreement with Hezbollah to halt fighting along Israel-Lebanon borderJERUSALEM — Israel’s defense minister has told his U.S. counterpart that time is running out for an agreement with Hezbollah to halt the fighting along the Israel-Lebanon border.Yoav Gallant told Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin that 'the possibility for an agreed framework in the northern arena is running out as Hezbollah continues to ‘tie itself’ to Hamas.''The trajectory is clear,' Gallant added, according to a statement released from his office on Monday.Hezbollah began firing rockets and drones into northern Israel after the outbreak of the war in Gaza, which was ignited by Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack. Both armed groups are allied with Iran, and Hezbollah says it is acting in solidarity with the Palestinians.Israel has responded to the attacks with airstrikes and the targeted killing of Hezbollah commanders. It has threatened a wider operation, raising fears of another all-out war.Hezbollah has said it will halt its attacks if there is a cease-fire in Gaza, but months of talks brokered by the United States, Qatar and Egypt have repeatedly stalled.Hamas has demanded a lasting cease-fire and the full withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza as part of any agreement to release the scores of hostages it still holds from the Oct. 7 attack.Gallant told Austin that 'in any possible scenario, Israel’s defense establishment will continue to operate with the aim of dismantling Hamas and ensuring the return of hostages held by Hamas in Gaza — by any means.'	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-latest-16-september-2024-a794f441dbfddebe87fd9b95c28008fb	2024-09-15T20:31:45-07:00	
Argentina's President Milei presents 2025 budget, vowing austerity and setting up a showdown	BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) — Libertarian President Javier Milei of Argentina presented the 2025 budget to Congress late Sunday, outlining policy priorities that reflected his key pledge to kill the country's chronic fiscal deficit and signaled a new phase of confrontation with lawmakers.In an unprecedented move, Milei personally pitched the budget to Congress instead of his economy minister, lambasting Argentina's history of macroeconomic mismanagement and promising to veto anything that compromised his tough slog of tight fiscal policy. The president's budget proposal followed a week of political clashes in the legislature — where Milei controls less than 15% of the seats — over spending increases that the administration warns would derail its IMF-backed 'zero deficit' budget. Opposition parties have sought to pass laws to raise salaries and pensions with inflation to help hard-hit Argentines cope with brutal austerity. 'The cornerstone of this budget is the first truth of macroeconomics, a truth that for many years has been neglected in Argentina: that of zero deficit,' Milei told lawmakers, facing a handful of empty seats as most of the hard-line opposition Peronist bloc, Unión por la Patria, skipped his address. 'Managing means cleaning up the balance sheet, deactivating the debt bomb that we inherited.'Milei's supporters interrupted his speech — packed with his usual libertarian talking points — with whoops and cheers.It will fall to the opposition-dominated Congress, which controls the government’s purse strings, to approve the final budget. Milei’s political isolation makes matters fraught, setting up weeks of negotiations with political rivals who insist on concessions.But Milei vowed that nothing would stop him from pressing on with austerity. 'The budget is a declaration of principles,' said Argentine economist Agustín Almada. 'Even if there is no compromise from the opposition, Milei will continue pursuing this fiscal contraction.'If the stroke of a veto pen failed to prevent powerful lawmakers from spending, Milei promised to find other ways to cut down the state.'We will only discuss the increase in spending when it comes along with an explanation of what we’ll cut to compensate for it,' Milei said.Over Milei’s past nine months in office, dramatic cuts to public spending — which he says are necessary to restore market confidence in a country ravaged by one of the world's highest annual inflation rates — have racked up a fiscal surplus (0.4% of gross domestic product), something unseen in nearly two decades.The austerity has also caused deep economic pain in Argentina, with nearly 60% of Argentines now living in poverty, up from 44% in December, according to the Catholic University. Milei has largely balanced the budget by slashing financial transfers to provinces, removing energy and transport subsidies and holding wages and pensions steady despite inflation.The fight over pensions reached a head last week, when Milei and his allies defeated a bill that would have boosted social security spending in Argentina, compromising the administration's fiscal discipline. The bill swept through both houses of Congress last month but opposition parties ultimately failed to obtain the two-thirds majority needed to override the president’s veto after government lobbying eroded support for the measure. At news of the bill's rejection Thursday, outraged retirees — who have lost roughly half of their purchasing power due to inflation — poured into the streets of downtown Buenos Aires, where they faced off with riot police spraying tear gas and water canons. Milei warned that his fiscal shock therapy was not going to be easy. But his administration is betting that the worst has passed. Although Argentina's annual inflation hovers around 237%, Milei has retained popular support by working to keep a lid on monthly inflation, which has dropped to 4% since its peak of 26% last December when he took office. In an optimistic statement about the budget Sunday, the Finance Ministry said it expected Milei's proposal to result in an annual inflation rate of just 18% by the end of 2025 and yield a 5% economic growth rate. Argentina's economy contracted by more than 3% in the first half of 2024.But much of Milei's future depends on Congress. The government's pension law victory last week proved short-lived, as lawmakers in the lower house also passed a bill increasing spending on public universities. Milei has vowed to veto the bill. Congress dealt Milei another blow last week when it rejected his plan to raise spending on the intelligence services by more than $100 million. Despite all the belt-tightening, Milei has committed to increasing defense spending from 0.5% of GDP to 2.1%, raising the hackles of some lawmakers as his cuts to health and education hit the populace. Although Milei has repeatedly compromised to get his legislation through Congress, he took a strident tone in Sunday's speech, describing lawmakers as 'miserable rats who bet against the country.'Some analysts warned that Milei's exercise in political messaging spelled trouble. 'The image of a half-empty chamber of deputies during the president’s speech is an indication that it will not be easy for the government to pass this budget,' said Marcelo J. García, Director for the Americas at the New York-based geopolitical risk consultancy Horizon Engage. 'Again, Milei seems to be prioritizing confrontation over compromise.'	https://apnews.com/article/argentina-milei-budget-congress-economy-inflation-c83178217097093d476fab94429768a4	2024-09-15T19:09:57-07:00	
Asian stocks mixed amid weak China data after Wall Street closes the best week of 2024	HONG KONG (AP) — Asian stocks were mixed on Monday with several key markets closed for a holiday, after U.S. stocks finished their best week of the year and climbed to the cusp of their records.Hong Kong’s Hang Seng dropped 0.3% to 17,312.37 after data released over the weekend showed a slowdown in China’s economy in August, as factory output, retail sales and investment figures failed to meet expectations. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate unexpectedly surged to a six-month high, adding further challenges to the fragile economy.'The drums of a deepening economic slowdown are beating louder, and it’s time for China’s leadership to decide whether to step up or risk sliding further into stagnation,' Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management said in a commentary.Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 added 0.4% to 8,133.40.Markets in Japan, mainland China and South Korea were closed for a holiday.Investors will closely watch the Federal Reserve’s policy meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday, when the central bank is expected to announce its first interest rate cut since 2020. The Bank of Japan’s policy meeting on Thursday and Friday is expected to leave Japan's rate unchanged.In currency trading, the Japanese yen strengthened against the greenback, with the dollar falling to 140.53 yen from 140.82 yen. The euro cost $1.1092, inching up from $1.1076.U.S. futures and oil prices were higher.On Friday, the S&P 500 rose 0.5% to 5,626.02 for a fifth-straight gain and is just 0.7% below its all-time high set in July. Rallies for Microsoft, Broadcom and other big technology stocks helped it claw back almost all its losses from last week, which was its worst in nearly 18 months. The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 0.7% to 41,393.78 and the Nasdaq composite added 0.7% to 17,683.98.Stocks also got support from the bond market, where Treasury yields eased ahead of this week’s meeting of the Federal Reserve. The unanimous expectation on Wall Street is for the Fed to deliver the first cut to interest rates in more than four years on Wednesday, and traders are rekindling hopes it may offer bigger-than-usual relief.The Federal Reserve has been keeping its main interest rate at a two-decade high in hopes of slowing the economy enough to stifle high inflation. With inflation having eased substantially from its peak two summers ago, the Fed has said it can turn more focus to bolstering the slowing job market and economy. How much to cut rates by will be a delicate balancing act for the Fed: Lowering them relieves pressure on the economy but can also give inflation more fuel. Reports earlier this week showed some underlying upward pressure may remain on inflation, which initially pushed traders to ratchet back expectations for the size of the Fed’s upcoming move.On Friday last week, though, traders were seeing roughly a coin flip’s chance that the Fed could deliver a large cut of half of a percentage point, instead of the more traditional quarter of a point, according to data from CME Group. The federal funds rate is currently sitting in a range of 5.25% to 5.50%.The yield on the 10-year Treasury eased to 3.65% from 3.68% last Thursday. The two-year yield, which more closely tracks expectations for Fed action, fell more sharply to 3.58% from 3.65%.In energy trading, benchmark U.S. crude gained 22 cents to $67.97 a barrel.

The Coast Guard will hear from former OceanGate employees about the Titan implosion	U.S. Coast Guard officials investigating the implosion of an experimental watercraft en route to the wreck of the Titanic were scheduled Monday to hear from former employees of the company that owned the Titan submersible.The aim of the two-week hearing in Charleston County, South Carolina, is to 'uncover the facts surrounding the incident and develop recommendations to prevent similar tragedies in the future,' the Coast Guard said in a statement earlier this month. The ongoing Marine Board of Investigation is the highest level of marine casualty investigation conducted by the Coast Guard.The Titan imploded in the North Atlantic in June 2023, killing all five people on board and setting off a worldwide debate about the future of private undersea exploration.Among those killed was Stockton Rush, co-founder of OceanGate, the Washington state company that owned the Titan. The company suspended operations after the implosion. Witnesses scheduled to testify on Monday include OceanGate's former engineering director, Tony Nissen; the company's former finance director, Bonnie Carl; and former contractor Tym Catterson.Hub peek embed (apf-politics) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) Some key OceanGate representatives are not scheduled to testify. They include Rush's widow, Wendy Rush, who was the company's communications director. The Coast Guard does not comment on the reasons for not calling specific individuals to a particular hearing during ongoing investigations, said Melissa Leake, a spokesperson for the Coast Guard. She added that it's common for a Marine Board of Investigation to 'hold multiple hearing sessions or conduct additional witness depositions for complex cases.'Scheduled to appear later in the hearing are OceanGate co-founder Guillermo Sohnlein; former operations director, David Lochridge; and former scientific director, Steven Ross, according to a list compiled by the Coast Guard. Numerous guard officials, scientists, and government and industry officials are also expected to testify. The U.S. Coast Guard subpoenaed witnesses who were not government employees, Leake said.OceanGate has no full-time employees at this time but will be represented by an attorney during the hearing, the company said in a statement. The company has been fully cooperating with the Coast Guard and National Transportation Safety Board investigations since they began, the statement said.'There are no words to ease the loss endured by the families impacted by this devastating incident, but we hope that this hearing will help shed light on the cause of the tragedy,' the statement added. The Titan became the subject of scrutiny in the undersea exploration community in part because of its unconventional design and its creator’s decision to forgo standard independent checks. The implosion killed Rush and veteran Titanic explorer Paul-Henri Nargeolet; two members of a prominent Pakistani family, Shahzada Dawood and his 19-year-old son Suleman Dawood; and British adventurer Hamish Harding.The Titan made its final dive on June 18, 2023, losing contact with its support vessel about two hours later. When it was reported overdue, rescuers rushed ships, planes and other equipment to an area about 435 miles (700 kilometers) south of St. John’s, Newfoundland.The search for the submersible attracted worldwide attention, as it became increasingly unlikely that anyone could have survived the implosion. Wreckage of the Titan was subsequently found on the ocean floor about 300 meters (330 yards) off the bow of the Titanic, Coast Guard officials said.The time frame for the investigation was initially a year, but the inquiry has taken longer. The Coast Guard said in July that the hearing would delve into 'all aspects of the loss of the Titan,' including both mechanical considerations as well as compliance with regulations and crewmember qualifications. The Titan had been making voyages to the Titanic wreckage site going back to 2021.	https://apnews.com/article/titan-submersible-implosion-hearing-2ae3c044e50a69647bd42cffe96c7f98	2024-09-15T19:03:51-07:00	
Starmer and Meloni holding talks on curbing migrant boats reaching UK and Italy	ROME (AP) — U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer is meeting Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni in Rome on Monday, as the two very different politicians, from left and right, seek common cause to curb migrants reaching their shores by boat.Support for Ukraine is also on the agenda for the trip, part of Starmer’s effort to reset relations with European neighbors after Britain’s acrimonious 2020 departure from the European Union.The center-left Labour Party prime minister isn't a natural ally of Meloni, who heads the far-right Brothers of Italy party. But migration has climbed the U.K. political agenda, and Starmer hopes lessons from Italy can help him stop people fleeing war and poverty trying to cross the English Channel in flimsy, overcrowded boats.More than 22,000 migrants have made the perilous crossing from France so far this year, a slight increase compared to the same period in 2023. Several dozen people have perished in the frigid Channel, including at least eight who died off the French coast on Saturday night.Hub peek embed (Migration) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) Starmer promised 'a new era of international enforcement to dismantle these networks, protect our shores and bring order to the asylum system.' 'No more gimmicks,' he said before his trip to Rome — a reference to the previous Conservative government’s scuttled plan to send some asylum-seekers on a one-way trip to Rwanda.Meloni pledged a crackdown on migration after taking office in 2022, aiming to deter would-be refugees from paying smugglers to make the dangerous Mediterranean crossing. Her nationalist conservative government has signed deals with individual African countries to block departures, imposed limits on the work of humanitarian rescue ships, cracked down on traffickers and taken measures to deter people from setting off.Italy also has signed a deal with Albania under which some adult male migrants rescued at sea while trying to reach Italy would be taken instead to Albania while their asylum claims are processed.The number of migrants arriving in Italy by boat in the first half of this year was down 60% from 2023, according to the country’s Interior Ministry, and Starmer wants to learn from Italy’s mix of tough enforcement and international cooperation.Starmer will tour Italy’s national immigration crime coordination center with newly appointed U.K. Border Security Commander Martin Hewitt. The government says Hewitt, a former head of Britain’s National Police Chiefs’ Council, will work with law enforcement and intelligence agencies in the U.K. and across Europe to tackle-people smuggling networks.Soon after being elected in July, Starmer scrapped the Conservatives’ contentious plan to send asylum-seekers who cross the Channel to Rwanda, about 4,000 miles (6,400 kilometers) away, with no chance of returning to the U.K. even if their refugee claims were successful.The Conservatives said the deportation plan would act as a deterrent, but refugee and human rights groups called it unethical, judges ruled it illegal and Starmer dismissed it as an expensive gimmick. He has, though, expressed an interest in striking agreements like the one Italy has with Albania that would see asylum-seekers sent temporarily to another country.The Rome trip follows visits to Paris, Berlin and Dublin during Starmer’s first weeks in office — all part of efforts to restore ties with EU neighbors that have been frayed by Brexit. Starmer has ruled out rejoining the now 27-nation bloc, but is keen for a closer relationship on security and other issues.Ukraine will also feature in his talks with the Italian government, which holds the presidency of the Group of Seven leading industrialized nations this year.Unlike some politicians on the European right, Meloni is a staunch supporter of Ukraine. Starmer meets her after returning from Washington, where he and U.S. President Joe Biden discussed Ukraine’s plea to use Western-supplied missiles to strike targets deep inside Russia.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has been pressing allies to allow his forces to use Western weapons to target air bases and launch sites inside Russia as Moscow steps up assaults on Ukraine’s electricity grid and utilities before winter. Russian President Vladimir Putin has said that would mean NATO countries 'are at war with Russia.'So far, the U.S. hasn't announced a change to its policy of allowing Kyiv to use American-provided weapons only in a limited area inside Russia’s border with Ukraine.___Follow AP’s coverage of migration issues at https://apnews.com/hub/migration	https://apnews.com/article/uk-italy-starmer-meloni-migration-c1705b3c44c750f71061eed5719c0d0d	2024-09-15T19:01:48-07:00	
Typhoon hits Shanghai with 94-mph winds after 400,000 people were evacuated	BEIJING (AP) — The strongest typhoon to hit Shanghai since at least 1949 made landfall early Monday with powerful winds and heavy rains after more than 400,000 people were evacuated.Flights, ferries and train services were suspended in the megacity and in neighboring provinces, disrupting travel during China’s three-day Mid-Autumn Festival. Shanghai’s airports canceled hundreds of flights starting Sunday and through Monday, while in Hangzhou, about 170 kilometers (106 miles) southwest of Shanghai, authorities were also planning to cancel more than 180 flights.More than 60,000 emergency responders and firefighters were at hand to lend aid in Shanghai, according to state media. More than 414,000 people had been evacuated by Monday. Bebinca made landfall around 7:30 a.m. in the sprawling Pudong business district with maximum winds of 151 kph (94 mph) near its center. Authorities expected the typhoon would also affect the nearby provinces of Zhejiang, Jiangsu and Anhui.Shanghai, which has 25 million people, is rarely hit by strong typhoons, which usually make landfall further south in China.Typhoon Yagi hit China’s southern Hainan island earlier this month and has caused devastation in Southeast Asia. In Myanmar, Yagi caused at least 74 deaths with dozens missing. Four deaths were reported in Hainan, at least 10 have died in Thailand and 20 in the Philippines.Vietnam has reported more than 230 people killed in the typhoon and subsequent flooding and landslides, with dozens more still missing.	https://apnews.com/article/china-typhoon-bebinca-shanghai-74e8af786c5cf9bac56542df81af5ac4	2024-09-15T18:36:48-07:00	
Emmy Moments: Hosts gently mock 'The Bear,' while TV moms, 'Happy Days' and 'West Wing' celebrated	The last Emmys — in January, the 75th edition — went reunion crazy on such a big birthday, with cast reunions of such classic series as 'Cheers,' 'The Sopranos,' 'It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia' and 'All in the Family.' The latest Emmys said: 'Hold my applause.''Shogun,' 'Baby Reindeer' and 'The Bear' all picked up trophies throughout the night that was peppered with reunions of shows like 'Saturday Night Live' and 'Happy Days,' as well as themes, like TV dads and moms.Here are some of the night’s notable moments:Gentle hosts The father-and-son duo of Eugene and Dan Levy, the winning stars of the 2020 Emmys aboard 'Schitt’s Creek,' hosted and they were warm, mocking themselves as they noted the TV telecast was honoring 'movie stars on streaming services.'Even when the Candians went after a show — like 'The Bear,' competing in the best comedy series category, even though it's not a traditional yukfest — it was gentle. Hub peek embed (EmmyAwards) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) 'Now, I love the show, I love the show, and I know some of you will be expecting us to make a joke about whether ‘The Bear’ is really a comedy — but in the true spirit of ‘The Bear,’ we will not be making any jokes,' Eugene Levy said.In one bit, the two found themselves in the audience but in different rows, mistaking stage left for house left. Awkwardness ensued. When they tried to push through, Eugene Levy wailed: 'I can't see the prompter!'The show goes to the dogsJohn Oliver thanked a lot of people after his 'Last Week Tonight' won for outstanding scripted variety series, but things got weird when he ended up honoring his family’s recently dead dog.'We have the most fantastic dog, and she was at our wedding and she got us through the pandemic. She was with us for two pregnancies…,' he said, before getting the leave-the-stage music swelled.Oliver didn’t take the hint: 'We had to say goodbye to her. I feel like Sarah McLaughlin right now. She was an amazing dog,' he said. He then shouted an expletive and tried to make it more than about his deceased canine.'This isn’t just for her. This is for all dogs,' he continued as the auditorium roared. 'All dogs, you are all very good girls. You are very good boys. You all deserve a treat. Play me off now! Thanks so much.'‘The West Wing’ reunited'The West Wing' celebrated its 25th anniversary with castmembers Martin Sheen, Dulé Hill, Richard Schiff, Janel Moloney and Allison Janney gathering to help hand out the best drama trophy. Created by Aaron Sorkin and first airing on NBC in the fall 1999, 'The West Wing' offed an idealistic depiction of what politics can be. The castmembers gathered in a set mimicking the Oval Office. It ended in 2006.'It's hard to believe that just 25 years ago, Aaron and the writers actually had to use their imaginations to create interesting plot lines for ‘The West Wing,’' Janney said. Added Schiff: 'Unlike today, where storylines can be plucked right off the news, storylines that writers would have deemed a bit far-fetched if not utterly ridiculous 25 years ago.' Put me in, coachJane Lynch, who played vicious cheerleading coach Sue Sylvester on 'Glee' and Brendan Hunt, the quiet Coach Willis Beard on 'Ted Lasso,' teamed up to help hand out the award for best director of a drama series. They appeared in a locker room set, with Lynch teasing Hunt that she was a head coach on TV and he was just an assistant coach. But the stage seemed a little too big for just these two TV coaches.That changed when the stage revealed Paris Olympians Ilona Maher, Caeleb Dressel and Stephen 'Pommel Horse Guy' Nedoroscik alongside Paralympian Ezra Frech.'Saturday Night Live' greats mock its creator'Saturday Night Live' got a head start to its 50th anniversary next year with a mini-reunion, as Kristen Wiig, Maya Rudolph, Seth Meyers and Bowen Yang presented the award for best writing for a variety special. Three of the four mocked creator and producer Lorne Michaels in the audience, who they claimed was nominated and lost 85 times at the Emmys. Rudolph said he was 'robbed.' Yang said 'it gets better' and 'keep winning.' Meyers corrected them all to say that, in fact, Michaels has actually won 21 Emmys. Yang then leaned into mispronouncing his boss' first name.It may have been a taste for 2025, when the trailblazing sketch show will be celebrated, including a three-hour live primetime special in February. It has been the springboard for such stars as Eddie Murphy, Adam Sandler, Tina Fey, Will Ferrell and Mike Myers.Bad guys and galsAntony Starr of 'The Boys,' Giancarlo Esposito from 'Breaking Bad' and Kathy Bates of 'Misery' came out to represent an oddly key part of TV — the villains.'Without villains or antagonists, there wouldn’t be much of a story,' Esposito said. But it takes its toll. 'Do you know how hard it was to get a date after ‘Misery,'' Bates joked about her Stephen King role as a crazed kidnapper.Esposito complained that drug dealers will interrupt his dinner to ask his advice about building their empires and Starr said so many 12-year-old critics have approached him to say his superhero is 'bad.' He responds that the show has an R rating. 'It’s sloppy, sloppy parenting,' he observed.Moms and dadsGeorge Lopez, Damon Wayans, Jesse Tyler Ferguson, who have all played memorable TV dads, gathered to recognize the lead actor in a comedy series. They walked into a mancave set and Lopez and Wayans said they wanted to thank their TV wives, but Ferguson balked, having starred with a TV husband instead on 'Modern Family.' 'I’m so sorry, did you watch my show, or...?' he asked them. 'Yes, all 90 seasons,' Wayans responded. Later, it was the moms’ turn. Meredith Baxter, who played the 'Family Ties' matriarch, Connie Britton of 'Friday Night Lights' and Susan Kelechi Watson of 'This Is Us' presented the award for best writing for a comedy series. 'We have come a long way,' said Baxter. 'TV moms are no longer one-dimensional,' said Watson. 'It’s OK to ask for as much as a TV dad.''Tuesday, Wednesday, happy days'Director-producer Ron Howard and actor-author Henry Winkler reunited to celebrate the 50th anniversary of 'Happy Days,' a romanticized take on teenage life in the 1950s that pivoted on adolescent humor about cars and dating.Winkler, who played cool guy Fonzie with his signature 'Aaaayy!' with both thumbs up, and Howard, who played the goody-goody Richie Cunningham, became household names thanks to the sitcom, which ran from 1974–1980. Winkler went on to win an Emmy on HBO’s dark comedy 'Barry' and spread awareness about dyslexia as a best-selling author; Howard went on direct such Oscar-winners as 'Apollo 13' and 'A Beautiful Mind.'The two men met onstage in a set dressed like the diner the show was mostly set in. Winkler congratulated Howard for his Emmy-winning documentary on Jim Henson. But despite some prodding by Howard, Winkler wouldn’t sing the theme song. 'I'm out of practice,' he said. 'And it takes schooling.' So Winkler nudged the jukebox with his elbow instead and the theme played.Order & LawThe TV criminal justice system was represented Sunday by two separate but equal parts. There were the cops – Jimmy Smits of 'NYPD Blue,' Niecy Nash-Betts of 'Reno 911!' and Don Johnson of 'Miami Vice.' They appeared on a set with a New York City police car onstage. Smits noted that he died in episode one of 'Miami Vice' and later as a cast member of 'NYPD Blue.' Nash-Betts said she never died: 'I’m Black and I survived ‘Dahmer,’' she joked.And then there were the TV lawyers who took cases to court: Viola Davis of 'How to Get Away with Murder,' Gina Torres from 'Suits' and Christine Baranski from 'The Good Wife' and 'The Good Fight.' (Though, to be honest, Smits was also a good lawyer in 'L.A. Law.') 'Lawyers have seen every combination of the human condition,' Davis said. Added Torres: 'In so many ways, they try to better that human condition and uplift us.' ___For more coverage of the 2024 Emmys, visit https://apnews.com/hub/emmy-awards	https://apnews.com/article/emmy-moments-2024-7dba313a6fde0d1b53ec8de2a645f0fd	2024-09-15T16:47:34-07:00	
PSG sends support to defender Nuno Mendes after racial abuse	PARIS (AP) — Paris Saint-Germain defender Nuno Mendes was the target of abusive and racist comments on social media after a French league game.The club condemned the abuse and expressed its 'full support' Sunday for the Portugal left back, who was targeted following PSG's 3-1 win against Brest on Saturday. Mendes, who is Black, shared on his Instagram account a racist message he received. During the match, Mendes brought down Ludovic Ajorque in the box for a penalty that Romain Del Castillo converted to give Brest the lead.'Paris Saint-Germain doesn't tolerate racism, antisemitism or any other form of discrimination,' the club said.

The Life of Chuck' wins the Toronto Film Festival's People's Choice Award	The Toronto International Film Festival's People's Choice Award went to 'The Life of Chuck,' handing Mike Flanagan's Stephen King adaptation one of the most-watched prizes of the fall film festival circuit. The award for 'The Life of Chuck' was announced Sunday as North American's largest film festival drew to a close. 'The Life of Chuck,' based on King's 2020 novella of the same name, stars Tom Hiddleston as Charles 'Chuck' Krantz, an ordinary man living through apocalyptic cataclysms. Mark Hamill, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Karen Gillan and Jacob Tremblay co-star. TIFF's People's Choice Award is regarded as a reliable Oscar harbinger. Since 2012, every winner of the festival's top prize has gone on to be nominated for best picture at the Academy Awards. Last year, Cord Jefferson's 'American Fiction' won, and went on to be a major awards contender. But 'The Life of Chuck' could test that track record. The film is up for sale and doesn't yet have distribution. It could be acquired and quickly readied for release this fall, or it might end up a 2025 release. 'The Life of Chuck' drew mixed — though mostly positive reviews — out of Toronto, though audiences were clearly charmed by the uplifting drama. Runners-up for the People's Choice Award, which is voted on by festival attendees, were both films that first premiered at the Cannes Film Festival in May. The first was Jacques Audiard's 'Emilia Pérez.' The second runner-up was Sean Baker's 'Anora,' the Palme d'Or winner at Cannes. The audience award for top documentary went to Mike Downie's 'The Tragically Hip: No Dress Rehearsal.' In the festival's Midnight Madness section, the prize went to Coralie Fargeat's 'The Substance,' starring Demi Moore and Margaret Qualley.	https://apnews.com/article/peoples-choice-toronto-film-life-of-chuck-11715166a6ce8d9b5b9af90ac52768e7	2024-09-15T07:23:18-07:00	
A boat capsizes in Nigeria drowning at least 40 people, president says	ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) — A boat carrying mostly farmers capsized on a river in northwest Nigeria, drowning at least 40 people, President Bola Tinub u said Sunday.The accident happened in Zamfara state, as farmers were trying to get to their land, Tinubu said in a statement. The president promised support for the victims and directed emergency agencies to assess the incident.Yazid Abubakar, a police spokesperson in Zamfara, told The Associated Press the accident happened on Saturday and that five people were rescued, but 40 are still missing. It was not immediately clear how many people were on the boat when it went down. The boat was carrying mostly farmers who use the crossing regularly to sell produce at the markets and locals say they’re often overloaded.Zamfara state is rampant with armed groups who kidnap for ransom, steel cattle and engage in illegal mining.Boat accidents are common in remote communities across Nigeria because of overloading and boats that are in poor condition.In August, more than 20 people died in a boat accident on a river in southern Nigeria after the engine exploded.Most boats don’t carry life jackets or have proper safety measures in place, say locals.	https://apnews.com/article/nigeria-boat-capsizes-zamfara-bola-tinuba-332d71ac1828e9ba817e70693dd58353	2024-09-15T06:59:20-07:00	
Army to guard a hospital in Italy after a spate of attacks on medical staff across the country	ROME (AP) — Italy's army will guard medical staff at a hospital in the southern Calabria region starting Monday, after a string of violent attacks on doctors and nurses by enraged patients and relatives across Italy, local media reported.Prefect Paolo Giovanni Grieco approved a plan to reinforce the surveillance services already operated by soldiers on sensitive targets in the Calabrian town of Vibo Valentia, including the hospital, the reports said. Recent attacks on health care workers have been particularly frequent in southern Italy, prompting the doctors’ national guild to request that the army be deployed to ensure medical staff safety.The turning point was an assault at the Policlinico hospital in the southern city of Foggia in early September. A group of about 50 relatives and friends of a 23-year-old woman — who died during emergency surgery — turned their grief and rage into violence, attacking the hospital staff.Video footage, widely circulated on social media, showed doctors and nurses barricading in a room to escape the attack. Some of them were punched and injured. The director of the hospital threatened to close its emergency room after denouncing three similar attacks in less than a week.With over 16,000 reported cases of physical and verbal assaults nationwide in 2023 alone, Italian doctors and nurses have called for drastic measures.'We have never seen such levels of aggression in the past decade,' said Antonio De Palma, president of the Nursing Up union, stressing the urgent need for action.'We are now at a point where considering military protection in hospitals is no longer a far-fetched idea. We cannot wait any longer,' he said.The Italian Federation of Medical-Scientific Societies has also proposed more severe measures for offenders, such as suspending access to free medical care for three years for anyone who assaults healthcare workers or damages hospital facilities.Understaffing and long waiting lists are the main reasons behind patients' frustration with health workers. According to Italy’s largest union for doctors, nearly half of emergency medicine positions remained unfilled as of 2022. Doctors lament that Italy’s legislation has kept wages low, leading to overworked and burned out staff at hospitals.These problems have been further aggravated by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has pushed many health workers to leave Italy in search of better opportunities abroad.In 2023, Italy was short of about 30,000 doctors, and between 2010 and 2020, the country saw the closure of 111 hospitals and 113 emergency rooms, data from a specialized forum showed.	https://apnews.com/article/italy-hospitals-attacks-medical-staff-army-calabria-patients-families-27e4684e40df9dd73264e02f4f39573d	2024-09-15T06:37:31-07:00	
US-China military leaders hold routine talks to discuss South China Sea tensions and other issues	BANGKOK (AP) — Military leaders from the U.S. and China met in Beijing for routine talks that only resumed in January after being suspended for two years as ties between the two countries soured. The meetings ended on Sunday and officials discussed ongoing issues such as Taiwan, the Russia-Ukraine war and clashes in the South China Sea. Michael Chase, deputy assistant secretary of defense for China, Taiwan and Mongolia led a delegation to engage in the bilateral Defense Policy Coordination Talks, which were last held in January.. While the talks weren't expected to resolve long-standing differences in stances over issues ranging from South China Sea claims to Taiwan, the U.S. has continued to push for the discussions as a way to avoid conflict. The meetings were held after Chase attended the Xiangshan forum in Beijing, a defense forum that is China's answer to the Shangri-La Dialogue.Hub peek embed (Taiwan) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) Communication between the two militaries broke off in 2021, as U.S.-China tensions ratcheted up over widening differences on issues such as Taiwan's sovereignty, the origin of COVID-19 and economic issues.Beijing has ignored U.S. requests to engage in the past, especially over intercepts between U.S. and Chinese aircraft and ships. While communications resumed after U.S. President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping met in San Francisco last November, it is unclear whether the talks could continue as the U.S. is poised for a presidential election. In the bilateral talks, the two sides discussed China's support for Russia during the ongoing Ukraine war, as well as China's actions in the South China Sea, said a U.S. senior defense official briefing reporters on the meetings. On Sunday, the Philippine ship at a disputed shoal, BRP Teresa Magbanua, had left in order to resupply and provide medical care to its crew members. The defense official said that they were 'watching further developments there very closely.'China's claims over the South China Sea have become increasingly assertive, with increasing clashes with the Philippine coast guard. In August, both sides accused each other over a collision between their ships which left gaping holes in the Philippine ships.The maritime claims have meant clashes at sea, such as at the Sabina Shoal, which both China and the Philippines claim. China had blocked attempts to resupply the BRP Teresa Magbanua, in August, with a force of 40 ships. The Philippines said it would replace the ship immediately, but the departure of the ship raises questions of whether China would seize the shoal. Filipino scientists had previously found submerged piles of crushed corals in its shallows, leading to concern that China may be preparing to build a structure to stake its claim.China confirmed the departure of the ship, which it said 'infringed on China's territorial sovereignty.''During this period, China had taken control measures against the ship in accordance with the law and multiple attempts by the Philippine side to forcibly resupply the ship had failed,' China Coast Guard spokesperson Liu Dejun said in a statement.	https://apnews.com/article/china-us-philippines-south-china-sea-talks-6669213d7c6452c48fc6118e17c5737f	2024-09-15T04:29:15-07:00	
A high-level US delegation in Dhaka to foster economic growth with interim government	DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) — A high-level U.S. delegation met Sunday with the head of Bangladesh's interim government, Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, to affirm 'dedication to fostering inclusive economic growth,' according to the American embassy in Dhaka.Yunus took over after former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina fled the country last month amid a mass uprising. She was accused of corruption, violation of human rights and excessive use of force against the protesters.During her 15-year rule, Hasina enjoyed close relations with India, China and Russia who have heavily invested in the country’s infrastructure development, trade and investment. The U.S. has also become the single largest foreign investor in Bangladesh under Hasina.Yunus on Sunday said he sought U.S. support 'to rebuild the country, carry out vital reforms, and bring back stolen assets,' his press office said in a statement after he met the delegation at the State Guest House Jamuna in Dhaka.Hub peek embed (apf-politics) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) He told the U.S. representatives his interim administration has moved fast to 'reset, reform, and restart' the economy, initiate reforms in financial sectors, and fix institutions such as the judiciary and police, the statement said.The U.S. delegation, led by Brent Neiman, assistant secretary for International Finance at the U.S. Department of the Treasury, had representatives from the U.S. Agency for International Development, and Office of the U.S. Trade Representative. Donald Lu, assistant secretary of State for South and Central Asian Affairs, joined the delegation after visiting India. They met with several officials in Dhaka, including Touhid Hossain, the country’s adviser to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The USAID also signed an agreement to provide $202.25 million in aid to Bangladesh.The U.S. embassy on X underscored how American companies are entrenched in the South Asian country.'With the right economic reforms in place, the American private sector can help unlock Bangladesh’s growth potential through trade and investment,' the embassy wrote on its official account.The delegation also met representatives of the American companies under the American Chamber of Commerce in Bangladesh (AmCham) operating in Bangladesh upon arriving Saturday. Concerns over safety and lack of order in Bangladesh were relayed by the companies' agents.AmCham President Syed Ershad Ahmed said at the meeting that while there were improvements after the interim government was installed, 'there are some bottlenecks too.' Profit repatriation amid the ongoing crisis of U.S. dollars and challenges in the supply chain resulting from congestion at ports were among the issues he raised.The meeting came as unrest took hold of the country's major garment industry with workers walking out, leaving factories shuttered, as they demanded better benefits including higher wages. The factory owners, the government and workers’ leaders are holding meetings to ease the tension. Bangladesh is one of the most vulnerable countries to climate-induced disasters. The U.S. embassy on its official Facebook page said the United States wanted to help it 'mitigate climate risks.'	https://apnews.com/article/bangladesh-us-delegation-yunus-hasina-economy-4c1ab22b419aba4373f9d094b100b69d	2024-09-15T03:48:50-07:00	
Leading Lebanese novelist Elias Khoury dies at 76	BEIRUT (AP) — Lebanese novelist Elias Khoury who dedicated much of his writings to the Palestinian cause and taught at universities around the world, making him one of Lebanon’s most prominent intellectuals, has died. He was 76.Khoury, a leading voice of Arab literature, had been ill for months and admitted and discharged from hospital several times over the past year until his death early Sunday, Al-Quds Al-Arabi daily that he worked for said.The Lebanese writer, born and raised in Beirut, was outspoken in defense of freedom of speech and harsh criticism of dictatorships in the Middle East.In addition to his novels, Khoury wrote articles in different Arab media outlets over the past five decades making him well known throughout the Arab world.Two days after the Israel-Hamas war broke out on Oct. 7, Khoury wrote an article in Al-Quds A-Arab daily titled 'It’s Palestine.' Khoury wrote then that 'the biggest open-air prison, the besieged Ghetto of Gaza, has launched a war against Israel, occupied settlements and forced settlers to flee.' Born in Beirut on July 12, 1948, Khoury had been known for his political stances from his support of Palestinians to his harsh criticism of Israel and what he called its 'brutal' settling policy in Palestinian territories. He studied at the Lebanese University and later at the University of Paris, where he received a PhD in social history.'The Catastrophe began in 1948 and it is still going on,' he once wrote referring to Israel’s settlement policies in occupied Palestinian territories. The 'nakba,' or 'catastrophe' is a term used by many Arabs to describe the displacement of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians when Israel was created in 1948.Khoury was an outspoken supporter of Arab uprisings that broke out in the region starting in 2011 and toppled several governments.'The question is not why the Arab revolts broke out,' Khoury wrote after uprisings that toppled long-serving leaders such as Hosni Mubarak of Egypt and Tunisia’s Zine El Abidine Ben Ali. 'The question is not how people tore down the wall of fear but how fear built Arab kingdoms of silence for five decades.'Khoury, who belonged to a Greek Orthodox Christian family, took part in Lebanon’s 1975-90 civil war and was wounded in one of the battles.From 1992 until 2009, Khoury was the editor of the cultural section of Lebanon’s leading An-Nahar newspaper. Until his death, he was the editor-in-chief of the Palestine Studies magazine, a bulletin issued by the Beirut-based Institute for Palestine Studies.His first novel was published in 1975, but his second, Little Mountain, which he released in 1977 and was about Lebanon’s devastating civil war was very successful.Bab al-Shams, or Gate of the Sun, released in 2000, was about Palestinian refugees in Lebanon since 1948. A movie about the novel was made in Egypt.His novels were translated to several languages including Hebrew.Khoury also taught at different universities including New York University, Columbia, Princeton and Houston, as well as the University of London.	https://apnews.com/article/elias-khoury-lebanon-novelist-palestinian-cause-israel-1b6e79f6a17f5d9f5dbdaf809b728653	2024-09-15T03:15:56-07:00

Shanghai cancels hundreds of flights as Typhoon Bebinca draws near	BANGKOK (AP) — Shanghai's airports are canceling hundreds of flights Sunday as they brace for impact from Typhoon Bebinca, which is due to make landfall in the early hours of Monday morning, the authorities said. Flights past 8 p.m. local time will be canceled at Hongqiao and Pudong airports in the city, the airport officials said in a statement, affecting more than six hundred flights. The city also announced that it was suspending travel on some bridges while restricting that on other highways. Typhoon Bebinca is currently a few hundred kilometers away from the coast. The typhoon's winds are expected to reach 151 km (94 miles) per hour by Sunday night, according to the China Meteorological Administration, which has categorized it as a strong typhoon.State media reported that 9,318 people had been evacuated from one district in Shanghai. Meanwhile, in the nearby city of Zhoushan, restaurants, supermarkets and shops shut down early for the day, and public transportation services were halted. The storm is expected to bring up to 10 inches (254 millimeters) of rain in parts of the eastern coast that will be hardest hit, according to state media.	https://apnews.com/article/typhoon-bebinca-shanghai-china-597e96f6362db31e8c9dbcb5cfc4cc0a	2024-09-15T02:30:19-07:00	
Rising floodwaters trigger evacuations in Czech Republic and Poland	PRAGUE (AP) — Another night of torrential rains pounding Central Europe forced massive evacuations in the hardest hit areas in the Czech Republic, where floods reached extreme levels on Sunday.Meteorologists have warned the situation still might get worse as waters in most rivers are rising, the flood wave made its way through the country and more heavy rains could return overnight.Authorities declared the highest flood warnings in almost 90 places across the country and in two northeastern regions that recorded the biggest rainfall in recent days, including the Jeseniky mountains near the Polish border.In the city of Opava, up to 10,000 people out of a population of some 56,000 have been asked to leave their homes for higher ground. Rescuers used boats to transport people to safety in a neighborhood flooded by the raging Opava River.'There’s no reason to wait,' Mayor Tomáš Navrátil told the Czech public radio. He said the situation was worse than during the last devastating floods in 1997, known as the 'flood of the century.'Hub peek embed (Floods) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) 'We have to focus on saving lives,' Prime Minister Petr Fiala told the Czech public television Sunday. His government was to possibly meet Monday to assess the damages.At least four missing and villages cut off Thousands of others also were evacuated in the towns of Krnov and Cesky Tesin. The Oder River that flows to Poland was expected to reach extreme levels in the city of Ostrava and later in Bohumin.Towns and villages in the Jeseniky mountains, including the local center of Jesenik, were inundated and isolated by raging waters that turned roads into rivers. The military sent a helicopter to help with evacuations. Four people who were swept away by waters were missing, police said. About 260,000 households were without power Sunday morning in the entire country while traffic was halted on many roads, including the major D1 highway.A firefighter dies as Lower Austria declared a disaster zoneA firefighter died after 'slipping on stairs' while pumping out a flooded basement in the town of Tulln, the head of the fire department of Lower Austria Dietmar Fahrafellner told reporters on Sunday.Authorities declared the entire state of Lower Austria a disaster zone. The situation remains tense, especially at the water reservoir of Ottenstein, which is expected to reach its maximum capacity on Sunday.Romania reports another flooding victimRomanian authorities said Sunday that another person had died in the hard-hit eastern county of Galati after four were reported dead there a day before following unprecedented rain.Dramatic flooding in Poland In Poland, one person was presumed dead in floods in the southwest, Prime Minister Donald Tusk said Sunday. Tusk said the situation was 'dramatic' around the town of Klodzko, with some 25,000 residents, located in a valley in the Sudetes mountains near the border with the Czech Republic.In Glucholazy, rising waters overflowed a river embankment and flooded streets and houses. Mayor Paweł Szymkowicz said, 'we are drowning' and appealed to residents to evacuate to high ground. Energy supplies and communications were cut off in some flooded areas and regions may resort to using the satellite-based Starlink service, Tusk said.Several Central European nations have been hit by severe flooding, including Romania, Austria, Germany, Slovakia and Hungary, as a result of a low-pressure system from northern Italy dumping heavy rainfall in the wide region. The weather change arrived following a hot start to September in the region. Scientists have documented Earth’s hottest summer, breaking a record set just a year ago.A hotter atmosphere, driven by human-caused climate change, can lead to more intense rainfall.___Associated Press writer Monika Scislowska in Warsaw, Poland, video journalist Philipp-Moritz Jenne in Vienna and Stephen McGrath in Bucharest, Romania, contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/floods-central-europe-289648d14b39da5883b9f48fffa2d817	2024-09-15T00:42:28-07:00	
New Delhi's chief minister announces resignation two days after he was released on bail	NEW DELHI (AP) — One of India's main opposition figures and New Delhi’s chief minister said he would resign from office Sunday, two days after he was granted bail in a bribery case.Arvind Kejriwal, a fierce critic of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, was arrested nearly six months ago ahead of national elections on charges of receiving bribes from a liquor distributor. India's top court released him on bail Friday.Kejriwal has consistently denied the accusations and called them a political conspiracy.'Today I have come to ask the public whether you consider Kejriwal honest or a criminal,' he said in a public address Sunday at the headquarters of his Aam Aadmi Party, which governs New Delhi. 'I will resign from the post of chief minister two days from today.'Kejriwal said his party — a part of a broad alliance of opposition parties called INDIA and was the main challenger to Modi’s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party in June's elections — will hold a meeting later to decide who will take over his position. He also demanded the New Delhi elections, scheduled for February next year, be held in November instead. Opposition parties widely condemned Kejriwal’s arrest. They accused Modi's government of misusing federal investigation agencies to harass and weaken its political opponents. They pointed to several raids, arrests, and corruption investigations of key opposition figures in the months before the elections.Kejriwal's supporters celebrated his release by lighting firecrackers and dancing in the rain outside his New Delhi residence, with many carrying placards with photos of the popular politician. Some leaders from Modi's party warned that he was released on bail and not acquitted. Government agencies have accused Kejriwal’s party and ministers of accepting 1 billion rupees ($12 million) in bribes from a liquor distributor nearly two years ago in return for revising a liquor sales policy in New Delhi, allowing private companies greater profits.Kejriwal, a former civil servant, launched the Aam Aadmi Party in 2012. He promised to rid the Indian political system and governance of corruption and inefficiency.The party’s symbol — a broom — and its promise to sweep the administration of graft struck a chord with New Delhi’s residents, fed up with runaway inflation and slow economic growth.	https://apnews.com/article/arvind-kejriwal-chief-minister-resigns-bail-bribery-0be22faffd411c30861f3c6399429ce9	2024-09-15T00:25:50-07:00	
A least 8 people have died trying to cross the English Channel, French authorities say	NICE, France (AP) — At least eight people died during a failed attempt to cross the English Channel from northern France, French maritime authorities said Sunday.The incident occurred Saturday just before midnight when authorities spotted a boat, carrying dozens, in distress near a beach in the northern town of Ambleteuse.A French rescue ship was deployed to the area, but could not offer assistance at sea. Once the vessel reached the beach, rescue services offered medical assistance to 53 migrants, a statement from the French maritime authorities in charge of the Channel and the North Sea said.'Despite the emergency care provided, eight people have died,' the statement said.No people were discovered during the search at sea, it added. Six people were taken to hospitals in Boulogne and Calais 'in relative emergency,' including a 10-month-old baby with hypothermia, Jacques Billant, the Pas-de-Calais prefect, told French media on Sunday. He said survivors of the accident come from Eritrea, Sudan, Syria, Afghanistan, Egypt and Iran. Hub peek embed (apf-politics) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) The deceased were all male adults, Billant said. Survivors of the tragedy have been taken to the sports hall in Ambleteuse, according to a statement from the prefecture of Pas-de-Calais region. Prosecutor's office in Boulogne-sur-mer has opened an investigation into the accident. The incident Saturday occurred nearly two weeks after a boat carrying migrants ripped apart in the English Channel as they attempted to reach Britain from northern France, plunging dozens into the treacherous waterway and leaving 12 dead. British officials were quick to express sadness over another English Channel incident.'It’s awful,’’ Foreign Secretary David Lammy told the BBC. 'It’s a further loss of life.'The new Labour Party government has pledged to crack down on criminal gangs plying the migrant boats trade in the channel and had discussed with European partners 'how we go after those gangs, in co-operation upstream.’’ UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer will be in Italy on Monday for talks with counterpart Giorgia Meloni about her efforts to tackle the problem 'and the work they have done, particularly, with Albania.’’Starmer is interested in the policy, under which Tirana will accept asylum seekers on Italy’s behalf while their claims are processed.Europe’s increasingly strict asylum rules, growing xenophobia and hostile treatment of migrants have been pushing them north. Before Saturday’s accident, at least 43 migrants had died or gone missing while trying to cross to the U.K. this year, according to the International Organization for Migration.Other surveillance and rescue operations are underway Sunday along the entire Pas-de-Calais coast amid stormy weather conditions and agitated sea, French maritime authorities said. They warned anyone who tries to cross the Channel on flimsy and overloaded boats and in often difficult weather conditions of 'significant risks.' On Saturday, French coast guard and navy vessels rescued 200 people from the treacherous waters in the Pas-de-Calais area, according to a report sent by French maritime authorities in charge of the Channel and the North Sea. The French coast guard and other naval services have rescued people from four different boats, one carrying 61 and the other 55 people. The other two boats carried 48 and 36 people each, authorities said. They said they observed 18 attempts of boat departures from France to Britain on Saturday. In July, four migrants died while attempting the crossing on an inflatable boat that capsized and punctured. Five others, including a child, died in another attempt in April. Five dead were recovered from the sea or found washed up along a beach after a migrant boat ran into difficulties in the dark and winter cold of January.——Associated Press journalist Danica Kirka in London contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/france-migrants-english-channel-5b3b36a0ea06b85d89e8ccd22d1d864f	2024-09-15T00:17:09-07:00	
Two people die in Ukraine's Odesa after Moscow and Kyiv exchange drone and missile attacks	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Two people died in a missile attack on the Ukrainian Black Sea port city of Odesa, local officials said, as Moscow and Kyiv exchanged drone and missile attacks.The Ukrainian air force said Sunday it shot down 10 of the 14 drones and one of the three missiles Russia launched overnight.Oleh Kiper, Odesa's regional governor, said the two who died in the suburbs of Odesa on Saturday night were a married couple, and that another person was wounded in the attack.At least 28 people were wounded Sunday afternoon when a Russian aerial bomb struck a multi-story residential building in Kharkiv, Mayor Ihor Terekhov said.Meanwhile, the Russian Defense Ministry said it downed 29 Ukrainian drones overnight into Sunday over western and southwestern regions, with no damage caused by the falling debris. It also said another Ukrainian drone was shot down Sunday morning over the western Ryazan region.While Ukraine and Russia regularly launch overnight drone raids on each other’s territory, Ukrainian officials generally do not confirm or deny attacks within Russia’s borders.The latest attacks came after Ukraine made a new call Saturday on the West to allow it to use the long-range missiles they have provided to strike targets deep inside Russia, as Ukrainian forces struggle to hold back Russian advances in eastern Ukraine. So far, the U.S. has allowed Kyiv to use American-provided weapons only in a limited area inside Russia’s border with Ukraine.Kyiv officials argue the weapons are vital to weaken Russia’s ability to strike Ukraine and force it to move its strike capabilities further from the border. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy took to social media on Sunday to again appeal for a shift in the West's policy on the use of long-range weapons, noting that Russia had launched 'around 30 missiles of various types, more than 800 guided aerial bombs, and nearly 300 strike drones against Ukraine' this week.'Ukraine needs strong support from our partners to defend lives against Russian terror—air defense, long-range capabilities, support for our warriors. Everything that will help force Russia to end this war,' Zelenskyy wrote on X.	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-drones-odesa-missiles-0bbd98f8c894490ccb1f0c486325d209	2024-09-14T23:24:43-07:00

Air Canada and pilots union reach a tentative agreement to avoid a shutdown	OTTAWA, Ontario (AP) — Air Canada and the union representing its pilots have come to terms on a labor agreement that is likely to prevent a shutdown of Canada’s largest airline.Talks betwen the company and the Air Line Pilots Association produced a tentative, four-year collective agreement, the airline announced in a statement early Sunday.The prospective deal recognizes the contributions of the pilots flying for Air Canada and Air Canada Rouge while setting a new framework for company growth. The terms will remain confidential until ratification by union members and approval by the airline’s board of directors over the next month, the airline said.The pilots association said its Air Canada Master Executive Council voted to approve the tentative agreement on behalf of more than 5,400 Air Canada pilots. After review and ratification by a majority of members, the deal is expected to generate an additional $1.9 billion for the pilots over the period of the agreement, the union said in a statement.'While it has been an exceptionally long road to this agreement, the consistent engagement and unified determination of our pilots have been the catalyst for achieving this contract,' Charlene Hudy, the executive council's chair, said in the statement. 'After several consecutive weeks of intense round-the-clock negotiations, progress was made on several key issues including compensation, retirement, and work rules.'Federal Labor Minister Steven MacKinnon confirmed the agreement on Sunday and lauded the company and the union.'Thanks to the hard work of the parties and federal mediators, disruptions have been prevented for Canadians,' MacKinnon said in a statement. 'Negotiated agreements are always the best way forward and yield positive results for companies and workers.'The airline and its pilots have been in contract talks for more than a year. The pilots have sought wages competitive with their U.S. counterparts, but Air Canada continues to post record profits while expecting pilots to accept below-market compensation, the union saidThe two sides could have issued a 72-hour notice of a strike or lockout beginning Sunday. The airline said the notice would have triggered its three-day wind down plan and started the clock on a full work stoppage as soon as Sept. 18.Air Canada spokesman Christophe Hennebelle previously said the airline was committed to negotiations, but faced union wage demands that the company could not meet.The airline was not seeking federal intervention, but cautioned the government should be prepared to help avoid major disruptions from the possible shutdown of an airline carrying more than 110,000 passengers daily, Hennebelle said.Business leaders had urged the federal government to intervene in the talks earlier in the week, but MacKinnon said there was no reason the sides should not have been able to reach a collective agreement.In August, the Canadian government asked the country’s industrial relations board to issue a back-to-work order to end a railway shutdown.Leaders of numerous business groups including the Canadian Chamber of Commerce and the Business Council of Canada convened in Ottawa on Thursday to call for action, including binding arbitration, to avoid the widespread economic disruptions of an airline shutdown.NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh said Thursday his party would not support efforts to force pilots back to work.'If there’s any bills being proposed on back to work legislation, we’re going to oppose that,' he said.	https://apnews.com/article/air-canada-pilots-association-labor-agreement-d5bf01ec58293fe381b8eca22dfb9c58	2024-09-14T22:54:14-07:00	
A missile fired by Yemen's rebels lands in Israel and triggers sirens at international airport	JERUSALEM (AP) — A missile fired by Yemen's Iran-backed rebels landed in an open area in central Israel early Sunday and triggered air raid sirens at its international airport, in the latest reverberation from the nearly yearlong war in Gaza. Israel hinted that it would respond militarily.There were no reports of casualties or major damage, but Israeli media aired footage showing people racing to shelters in Ben Gurion International Airport. The airport authority said it resumed normal operations shortly thereafter.A fire could be seen in a rural area of central Israel, and local media showed images of what appeared to be a fragment from an interceptor that landed on an escalator in a train station in the central town of Modiin.The Israeli military said it made several attempts to intercept the missile using its multitiered air defenses but had not yet determined whether any had been successful. It said the missile appeared to have fragmented midair, and that the incident is still under review. The military said the sound of explosions in the area came from interceptors.Hub peek embed (Israel-Hamaswar) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) The Yemeni rebels, known as Houthis, have repeatedly fired drones and missiles toward Israel since the start of the war in Gaza between Israel and the Palestinian militant group Hamas, but nearly all of them have been intercepted over the Red Sea.In July, an Iranian-made drone launched by the Houthis struck Tel Aviv, killing one person and wounding 10 others. Israel responded with a wave of airstrikes on Houthi-held areas of Yemen, including the port city of Hodeidah, a Houthi stronghold.Israel indicates it will respond to attackIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu hinted at a similar response in remarks at a Cabinet meeting after Sunday's attack. 'The Houthis should have known by now that we exact a heavy price for any attempt to harm us,' he said. 'Anyone who needs a reminder is invited to visit the port of Hodeidah.' Brig. Gen. Yahya Saree, a military spokesman for the rebels, said they fired a ballistic missile targeting 'a military target' in the area of Tel Aviv.The Houthis have also repeatedly attacked commercial shipping in the Red Sea, in what the rebels portray as a blockade on Israel in support of the Palestinians. Most of the targeted ships have no connection to Israel.On Sunday, a European Union naval mission operating in the Red Sea said salvagers had begun towing a tanker that had been on fire for weeks after a Houthi attack. Operations Aspides said the Greek-flagged Sounion was being taken to a 'safe location.'The war in Gaza, which began with Hamas' Oct. 7 attack into southern Israel, has rippled across the region, with Iran and allied militant groups attacking Israeli and U.S. targets and drawing retaliatory strikes from Israel and its Western allies. On several occasions, the strikes and counterstrikes have threatened to trigger a wider conflict.International carriers have canceled flights into and out of Israel on a number of occasions since the start of the war, adding to the war's economic toll on the country.Iran supports militant groups across the region, including Hamas, the Houthis and Lebanon's Hezbollah, its most powerful ally, which has traded fire with Israel on a near-daily basis since the war in Gaza began. Iran and its allies say they are acting in solidarity with the Palestinians.Rockets fired from LebanonThe military said around 40 projectiles were fired from Lebanon early Sunday, with most intercepted or falling in open areas.In a separate incident, Israeli forces dropped leaflets over the Lebanese border town of al-Wazzani calling on residents to evacuate. The military later said there were no such evacuation orders, and that a local commander had acted without the approval of his superiors. It said the incident was under investigation.It was not clear if anyone had evacuated the town, or if any message had been conveyed to residents that the leaflets were dropped in error.The strikes along the Israel-Lebanon border have displaced tens of thousands of people on both sides. Israel has repeatedly threatened to launch a wider military operation against Hezbollah to ensure its citizens can return to their homes.'The status quo will not continue,' Netanyahu said at the Cabinet meeting. 'This requires a change in the balance of power on our northern border. We will do everything necessary to return our residents safely to their homes.'Gaza smuggling tunnels blockedHezbollah has said it would halt its attacks if there is a cease-fire in Gaza. The United States and Arab mediators Egypt and Qatar have spent much of this year trying to broker a truce and the release of scores of hostages held by Hamas, but the talks have repeatedly bogged down.In recent weeks, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has insisted on lasting Israeli control over the Gaza side of the border with Egypt, which Israeli forces captured in May. He has said Hamas used a network of tunnels beneath the border to import arms, allegations denied by Egypt, which along with Hamas is opposed to any lasting Israeli presence there.An Israeli military official said late Saturday that of the dozens of tunnels discovered along the border, only nine entered Egypt, and all were found to have been sealed off. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive intelligence, said it was not clear when the tunnels were sealed.The discovery appeared to weaken Netanyahu’s argument that Israel needs to keep open-ended control of the corridor to prevent cross-border smuggling.Egypt has said it sealed off the tunnels on its side of the border years ago, in part by creating its own military buffer zone along the frontier.___Melzer reported from Nahariya, Israel.

87 and hobbled, Pope Francis goes off-script in Asia and reminds world he can still draw a crowd	DILI, East Timor (AP) — It was the farthest trip of his pontificate and one of the longest papal trips ever in terms of days on the road and distance traveled. But Pope Francis, age 87, hobbled by bad knees and bent over with sciatica, appeared to be having the time of his life.With half of East Timor’s population gathered at a seaside park, Francis couldn’t help but oblige them with a final good night and languid loops in his popemobile, long after the sun had set and the field was lit by cellphone screens.It was late, the heat and humidity had turned Tasitolu park into something of a sauna, and most of the journalists had already gone back to their air-conditioned hotel to watch the Mass on TV. But there was Francis, defying the doubters who had questioned if he could, would or should make such an arduous trip to Asia given everything that could go wrong.'How many children you have!' Francis marveled to the crowd of 600,000, which amounted to the biggest-ever turnout for a papal event as a proportion of the population. 'A people that teaches its children to smile is a people that has a future.'Hub peek embed (PopeFrancis) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) The moment seemed to serve as proof that, despite his age, ailments and seven hours of jet lag, Pope Francis still could pope, still likes to pope and has it in him to pope like he used to at the start of his pontificate.That’s never truer than when he’s in his element: in the peripheries of the world, among people forgotten by the big powers, where he can go off-script to respond to the spirit of the moment.And it was certainly the case on his 11-day trip through Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, East Timor and Singapore, during which he clocked nearly 33,000 kilometers (20,505 miles) in air travel alone. It was a trip that he had originally planned to make in 2020 but COVID-19 intervened.Four years and a handful of hospitalizations later (for intestinal and pulmonary problems), Francis finally pulled it off. He seemed to relish getting out of the Vatican and away from the weighty grind of the Holy See after being cooped up all year, much of it battling a long bout of bronchitis.Francis does tend to rally during foreign trips, though he usually sticks to a script when he’s in the protocol meetings with heads of state, dutifully delivering speeches that were written in advance by Vatican diplomats.But when he’s meeting with young people or local priests and nuns, he tends to show his true colors. He’ll ditch his prepared remarks and speak off-the-cuff, often engaging in back-and-forth banter with the faithful to make sure his message has stuck.Doing so thrills the crowd, terrorizes his translators and complicates the work of journalists, but you always know Francis is enjoying himself and feels energized when he goes rogue. And he went rogue plenty of times in Asia — and on the in-flight press conference coming back to Rome, during which he urged American Catholics to vote for who they think is the 'lesser evil' for president.Francis started in Indonesia, arguably the most delicate destination on his itinerary given the country is home to the world’s largest Muslim population. The Vatican would be loathe to say or do anything that might cause offense.And yet from his very first encounter with President Joko Widodo, Francis appeared in a feisty mood, praising Indonesia’s relatively high birthrate while lamenting that in the West, 'some prefer a cat or a little dog.'Francis has frequently made the same demographic quip at home in Italy, which has one of the world’s lowest birthrates. But the high-profile trip meant that his trademark sarcasm got amplified. American commentators immediately assumed Francis had entered the 'childless cat ladies' debate roiling U.S. politics, but there was no indication he had JD Vance in mind. Even in the most delicate moment in Jakarta, at Southeast Asia's biggest mosque, Francis threw protocol aside and kissed the hand of the grand imam and brought it to his cheek in gratitude.In Papua New Guinea, Francis was similarly jazzed after pulling off a visit to a remote jungle outpost that had seemed impossible for him to reach: The airport in Vanimo, population 11,000, doesn’t have an ambulift wheelchair elevator that Francis now needs to get on and off planes, and bringing one in just for him was out of the question.The stubborn pope, who really, really wanted to go to Vanimo, ended up rolling on and off the back ramp of a C-130 cargo plane that Australia had offered to get him, and the metric ton of medicine and other supplies he brought with him, to the town.Despite the considerable security concerns of entering a region torn by tribal rivalries, Francis seemed to relish the jungle visit, perhaps because he felt so much at home. A dozen Argentine missionary priests and nuns have lived in Vanimo with the local community for years and had invited him to come. They decorated the simple stage in front of the church with a statue of Argentina’s beloved Virgin of Lujan, to whom Francis is particularly devoted, and had a gourd of mate, the Argentine tea, waiting for him.In East Timor Francis had to negotiate perhaps the most sensitive issue clouding the visit: the case of Bishop Carlos Ximenes Belo, the revered national hero who won the Nobel Peace Prize for his nonviolent independence campaign. The Vatican revealed in 2022 that it had sanctioned Belo, who now lives in Portugal, for having sexually abused young boys and ordered him to cease contact with East Timor.Francis didn’t mention Belo by name and didn’t meet with his victims, but he did reaffirm the need to protect children from 'abuse.' There was nary a mention of Belo’s name in any official speech during a visit in which East Timor’s traumatic history and independence fight were repeatedly evoked.In Singapore, his final stop, Francis once again ditched his remarks when he arrived at the last event, a meeting of Singaporean youth on Friday morning.'That’s the talk I prepared,' he said, pointing to his speech and then proceeding to launch into a spontaneous back-and-forth with the young people about the need to have courage and take risks.'What’s worse: Make a mistake because I take a certain path, or not make a mistake and stay home?' he asked them.He answered his own question, with a response that could explain his own risky decision to embark on the Asia trip in the first place.'A young person who doesn’t take a risk, who is afraid of making a mistake, is an old person,' the 87-year-old pope said.'I hope all of you go forward,' he said. 'Don’t go back. Don’t go back. Take risks.'___Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

Shogun,' 'The Bear' and 'Baby Reindeer' are at the top of the queue as the Emmys arrive	LOS ANGELES (AP) — 'Shogun' could be in for an epic night, 'The Bear' could clean up for the second time in less than a year, and 'Baby Reindeer' has gone from dark horse to contender as the 76th Primetime Emmy Awards arrive on Sunday. Back in their traditional mid-September spot after a single strike-delayed edition in January, the Emmys will air live on ABC from the Peacock Theater in downtown Los Angeles. The father and son duo of Eugene and Dan Levy, the winning stars of the 2020 Emmys with their show 'Schitt's Creek,' will host.Here's a look at the how the evening could play out across the major categories. How to watch and stream the EmmysThe show begins at 8 p.m. Eastern and is being shown live on ABC, which is available with an antenna or through cable and satellite providers. The Emmys can be also streamed live through live TV streaming services that include ABC in their lineup, like Hulu+ Live TV, YouTube TV and FuboTV. For those without a live TV streaming service, the show will be streaming Monday on Hulu.Who's nominated for drama series at the EmmysHub peek embed (EmmyAwards) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) It may be impossible to slow the roll of 'Shogun.'With its 14 wins at the precursor Creative Arts Emmy Awards last weekend, the FX series about lordly politicking in feudal Japan has already set a record for most Emmys for a single season of a series. On Sunday night it can extend its record by six, and industry prognosticators are predicting it will get them all. The show seized all the Emmy power in the top categories by shifting from the limited series to the drama category in May when it began developing more seasons. And it was in some ways Emmy royalty from the start. During the golden age of the miniseries, the original 1980 'Shogun,' based on James Clavell's historical novel, won three including best limited series. If it faces any competition at all for the best drama prize, it could come for the sixth and final season of 'The Crown,' the only show among the nominees that has won before in a category recently dominated by the retired 'Succession.' Veteran screen star Hiroyuki Sanada, up for best actor, and Anna Sawai, up for best actress, are in position to become the first Japanese actors to win Emmys. Sanada could face a challenge from Gary Oldman, who has been quietly creating one of his career defining roles on Apple TV+ as schlubby spy chief Jackson Lamb on 'Slow Horses.'Sawai's competition comes from Emmy luminary Jennifer Aniston of 'The Morning Show,' who has only won once before in 10 nominations. Imelda Staunton could win her first for playing Queen Elizabeth II on 'The Crown.'The comedy landscape at the EmmysThis looks to be the year of FX, which is also in for a likely victory lap for 'The Bear.' 'The Bear' took most of the big comedy Emmys home in January for its first season, and is expected to do the same Sunday for its second, which includes nominations for best comedy series, best actor for Jeremy Allen White and best supporting actor for Ebon Moss-Bachrach. Ayo Edebiri, reigning best supporting actress, moves to the lead actress category for a character who is essentially a co-lead on the culinary dramedy. That means she'll be up against Jean Smart, a two-time winner in the category for 'Hacks' who is back in the competition after a year off.Meryl Streep, among several Academy Award winners among the night's nominees, could win her fourth Emmy to go with her three Oscars. She's up for best supporting actress in a comedy for 'Only Murders in the Building.'Limited series categories at the EmmysAnother multiple Oscar winner, Jodie Foster, could get her first Emmy for best actress in a limited series for 'True Detective: Night Country.'The HBO show that features Foster as a police chief investigating mysterious deaths in the darkness of a north Alaskan winter was the top nominee among limited or anthology series. Kali Reis could become the first Indigenous woman to win an Emmy in the supporting actress category. A few months ago it looked as though the show would vie with 'Fargo' for the top prizes, but Netflix's darkly quirky 'Baby Reindeer' surged on the eve of nominations and is now the popular pick for best limited series, best actor for creator and star Richard Gadd and best supporting actress for the woman who plays his tormentor, Jessica Gunning.Gadd's category also includes Andrew Scott for Netflix's 'Ripley,' and Jon Hamm, who has two shots at winning his second Emmy between his nomination here for 'Fargo' and for supporting actor in a drama for 'The Morning Show.' ___For more on this year’s Emmy Awards, visit: https://apnews.com/hub/emmy-awards	https://apnews.com/article/2024-emmy-awards-show-8588922c128c775092509b70a599a6d0	2024-09-14T19:04:30-07:00	
The presidential campaign season in Tunisia is officially underway a day after protests	TUNIS, Tunisia (AP) — The official start of the presidential campaign season in Tunisia began on Saturday, a day after Tunisians took their anger to the streets of the capital to decry what protesters say is the deteriorating state of the country.In what appeared to be the largest protest since authorities began a monthslong wave of arrests earlier this year, hundreds of Tunisians marched peacefully on Friday and called for an end to what they called a police state.'We’re here to say no and show that we don’t all agree with what’s really happening in the country,' Khaled Ben Abdeslam, a father and urban development consultant, told The Associated Press.In 2011, longtime Tunisian President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali was toppled by nationwide protests that unleashed revolt across the Arab world.More than a decade later, Ben Abdelslam said he was worried about the growing number of political figures who’ve been thrown in jail under President Kais Saied and said he wants to ensure Tunisia 'turns the page' for the good of his kids.'Nobody dares to say or do anything anymore today,' he said as protesters neared Tunisia’s powerful Interior Ministry.He and other demonstrators slammed both Tunisia’s economic and political woes, carrying signs that grouped together the growing costs of staple items and growing concerns about civil liberties.'Where is sugar? Where is oil? Where is freedom? Where is democracy?' signs read.Some carried posters telling the government that 'human rights are not optional' while others revived the popular slogans that mobilized Tunisia’s masses against Ben Ali.This time though, they directed scorn toward Saied.The protests capped off a week in which the North African country’s largest opposition party, Ennahda, said its senior members had been arrested en masse, at a scale not previously seen.They come as Saied prepares to campaign for reelection on Oct. 6, when he will ask voters to grant him a second term.When first elected in 2019, Saied used anti-corruption promises to win over people disillusioned with the political controversies that plagued Tunisia’s young democracy in the years that followed the Arab Spring.Since taking office, the 66-year-old former law professor has gone to lengths to consolidate his own power, freezing the country’s parliament and rewriting the constitution. Throughout his tenure, authorities have arrested journalists, activists, civil society figures and political opponents across the ideological spectrum.And though he promised to chart a new course for the country, its unemployment rate has steadily increased to one of the region’s highest at 16%, with young Tunisians hit particularly hard.The economy continues to face significant challenges, yet Saied has managed to energize supporters with populist rhetoric, often accusing migrants from sub-Saharan Africa of violence and crime and aiming at changing the country’s demography.In the months leading up to his reelection bid, the political crackdown has expanded.His opponents have been arrested, placed under gag order or faced criminal investigations that observers have called politically motivated. Figures who said they planned to challenge him have been sentenced for breaking campaign finance laws. Others have been ruled ineligible to challenge him by Tunisia’s election authority.Even those the authority approved have later faced arrest.Ayachi Zammel, a businessman planning to challenge Saied, was promptly arrested after being announced as one of the two candidates approved to appear on the ballot alongside Saied. His attorney, Abdessattar Messaoudi, told The Associated Press that she feared a court may bar him from politics for life as it had done to other Saied challengers.The Tunisian Network for the Defense of Rights and Freedoms — a newly formed coalition of civil society groups and political parties — organized Friday’s protest to draw attention to what it called a surge of authoritarianism.Outrage swelled among many members of the network after the country’s election authority — made up of Saied appointees — dismissed a court ruling ordering it to reinstate three challengers to Saied.The authority has defied judges who have ruled in favor of candidates who have appealed its decisions and pledged not to allow Mondher Zenaidi, Abdellatif El Mekki and Imed Daimi to appear on the ballot alongside Saied next month.​​In less than a month, Tunisian voters are expected to cast their choice in the Oct. 6 poll, amid spreading worrying and doubts about the country’s political future.Hajer Mohamed, a 33-year-old law firm assistant said that she and her friends were terrified about the direction Tunisia was heading in ways they couldn’t have imagined when people rejoiced the freedoms won 13 years ago.'We never thought that after the 2011 revolution we’d live to see the country’s suffocating situation,' she said. 'even under former dictator Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, the situation wasn’t as scandalous as it is today.'___Sam Metz contributed to this report from Rabat, Morocco.	https://apnews.com/article/tunisia-election-president-campaign-season-protests-f7f6c0fdaadacbdf56b46d351c2ce7dc	2024-09-14T11:12:18-07:00	
Nigerian army rescues 13 hostages from extremist group	ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) — Nigerian troops have rescued 13 hostages who were kidnapped by an extremist group in the northwestern state of Kaduna, the country's army said on Saturday. The army said in a statement that 'the troops successfully overwhelmed the terrorists, forcing them to abandon their captives.'Several kidnappers were killed and others captured, the military added. It didn't specify what armed group the kidnappers belonged to.The rescued hostages were taken to a military facility for a medical assessment before being reunited with their families. Weapons, ammunition, solar panels and cash were also discovered during the rescue operation.Kidnappings have become common in parts of northern Nigeria, where dozens of armed groups take advantage of a limited security presence to carry out attacks in villages and along major roads. Most victims are released only after the payment of ransoms that sometimes run into the thousands of dollars. At least 1,400 students have been taken from Nigerian schools since the 2014 kidnapping of 276 schoolgirls by Boko Haram militants in the village of Chibok in Borno state shocked the world. Boko Haram, Nigeria’s homegrown jihadi rebels, launched its insurgency in 2009 to establish Islamic Shariah law in the country. At least 35,000 people have been killed and 2.1 million people displaced as a result of the extremist violence, according to U.N. agencies in Nigeria.	https://apnews.com/article/nigeria-army-hostages-rescued-extremist-group-10a4aa1503cf9cb92567bc0aace267cb	2024-09-14T10:22:13-07:00	
Roadside explosions in Somali capital Mogadishu kill 5, official says	MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) — Roadside explosions in the Somali capital killed five people and wounded eight others Saturday, according to a city official. An explosive device had been planted at a spot in a street where many young people had gathered to take photos, Abdullahi Sheikh Abdirahman, district commissioner of Mogadishu's Kahda district, told reporters.'I saw several people lying on the street minutes after the first explosion, and when rescuers came to assist, another blast happeneed, causing most of the casualties,' witness Abdisamad Osman told The Associated Press. No group immediately claimed responsibility for Saturday’s attack. But the Islamic extremist group al-Shabab, which opposes Somalia’s federal government, frequently carries out such assaults. The attack comes just weeks after a similar explosion at a beach where more than 30 people were killed and over 60 others wounded. That attack, one of the deadliest in recent months, raised concern over the increasing frequency of violent attacks in Mogadishu.	https://apnews.com/article/somalia-mogadishu-roadside-explosion-956278334ebf751244263623eda0c0df	2024-09-14T09:42:05-07:00	
NATO military committee chair, others back Ukraine's use of long range weapons to hit Russia	PRAGUE (AP) — The head of NATO's military committee said Saturday that Ukraine has the solid legal and military right to strike deep inside Russia to gain combat advantage — reflecting the beliefs of a number of U.S. allies — even as the Biden administration balks at allowing Kyiv to do so using American-made weapons. 'Every nation that is attacked has the right to defend itself. And that right doesn’t stop at the border of your own nation,' said Adm. Rob Bauer, speaking at the close of the committee's annual meeting, also attended by U.S. Gen. CQ Brown, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.Bauer, of Netherlands, also added that nations have the sovereign right to put limits on the weapons they send to Ukraine. But, standing next to him at a press briefing, Lt. Gen. Karel Řehka, chief of the General Staff of the Czech Armed Forces, made it clear his nation places no such weapons restrictions on Kyiv.'We believe that the Ukrainians should decide themselves how to use it,' Řehka said.Hub peek embed (Kyiv) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) Their comments came as U.S. President Joe Biden is weighing whether to allow Ukraine to use American-provided long-range weapons to hit deep into Russia. And they hint at the divisions over the issue.Biden met with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Friday, after this week’s visit to Kyiv by their top diplomats, who came under fresh pressure to loosen weapons restrictions. U.S. officials familiar with discussions said they believed Starmer was seeking Biden’s approval to allow Ukraine to use British Storm Shadow missiles for expanded strikes in Russia. Biden’s approval may be needed because Storm Shadow components are made in the U.S. The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to share the status of private conversations, said they believed Biden would be amenable, but there has been no decision announced yet.Providing additional support and training for Ukraine was a key topic at the NATO chiefs’ meeting, but it wasn't clear Saturday if the debate over the U.S. restrictions was discussed. Many of the European nations have been vigorously supportive of Ukraine in part because they worry about being the next victim of an empowered Russia.At the opening of the meeting, Czech Republic President Petr Pavel broadly urged the military chiefs gathered in the room to be 'bold and open in articulating your assessments and recommendations. The rounder and the softer they are, the less they will be understood by the political level.'The allies, he said, must 'take the right steps and the right decisions to protect our countries and our way of life.'The military leaders routinely develop plans and recommendations that are then sent to the civilian NATO defense secretaries for discussion and then on to the nations' leaders in the alliance.The U.S. allows Ukraine to use American-provided weapons in cross-border strikes to counter attacks by Russian forces. But it doesn’t allow Kyiv to fire long-range missiles, such as the ATACMS, deep into Russia. The U.S. has argued that Ukraine has drones that can strike far and should use ATACMS judiciously because they only have a limited number.Ukraine has increased its pleas with Washington to lift the restrictions, particularly as winter looms and Kyiv worries about Russian gains during the colder months.'You want to weaken the enemy that attacks you in order to not only fight the arrows that come your way, but also attack the archer that is, as we see, very often operating from Russia proper into Ukraine,' said Bauer. 'So militarily, there’s a good reason to do that, to weaken the enemy, to weaken its logistic lines, fuel, ammunition that comes to the front. That is what you want to stop, if at all possible.'Brown, for his part, told reporters traveling with him to the meeting that the U.S. policy on long-range weapons remains in place.But, he added, 'by the same token, what we want to do is — regardless of that policy — we want to continue to make Ukraine successful with the capabilities that have been provided' by the U.S. and other nations in the coalition, as well as the weapons Kyiv has been able to build itself.'They’ve proven themselves fairly effective in building out uncrewed aerial vehicles, in building out drones,' Brown told reporters traveling with him to meetings in Europe.Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has made similar points, arguing that one weapons system won't determine success in the war.'There are a number of things that go into the overall equation as to whether or not you know you want to provide one capability or another,' Austin said Friday. 'There is no silver bullet when it comes to things like this.'He also noted that Ukraine has already been able to strike inside Russia with its own internally produced systems, including drones.	https://apnews.com/article/ukraine-russia-war-nato-military-chiefs-d020f72aaa3abec8e5fa971f7123ffe1	2024-09-14T09:27:07-07:00	
Fuel truck explosion kills at least 15 people in Haiti	PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) — A tanker truck carrying gasoline in Haiti on Saturday flipped and exploded, killing at least 15 people and seriously injuring 40 others, officials said.Prime Minister Garry Conille provided the figures in an X post. Earlier, Radio Caraibes reported that 17 people had been killed.Haiti’s hospitals are poorly equipped to treat victims of severe burns. The nation of 12 million people has also been struggling with fuel shortages, as fighting between gangs makes it more difficult to import goods into the country. Saturday's explosion happened in Miragoane, a city of 60,000 people that was hit by a strong earthquake three years ago. In 2021, 75 people were killed in Haiti's second largest city Cap Haitien, when another fuel truck overturned and unleashed a fireball that swept through several homes and businesses that were built closely next to each other. Some of those killed were onlookers who had rushed to the truck to try and scoop up fuel.	https://apnews.com/article/haiti-truck-explosion-gasoline-3b2f50d848224dbfcb3ef842ef06e023	2024-09-14T09:25:31-07:00	
Death toll in Myanmar from Typhoon Yagi reaches 74. Dozens of other people are missing	BANGKOK (AP) — The death toll in Myanmar from flooding and landslides caused by Typhoon Yagi has reached at least 74, with 89 people missing, Myanmar’s state television said Saturday. Difficulties in compiling information have raised fears that the number of casualties may be higher.The new official death toll announced by the country’s military government was more than double the 33 reported on Friday. Typhoon Yagi earlier hit Vietnam, northern Thailand and Laos, killing more than 260 people and causing major damage.The new totals were announced after state media reported that Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, the head of the ruling military council, said that Myanmar was requesting relief aid from foreign countries.Nearly 240,000 people have been displaced, according to the reports. There were already 3.4 million displaced people in Myanmar at the beginning of September, according to the U.N. refugee agency, mostly because of war and unrest in recent years.Hub peek embed (apf-politics) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) In Myanmar, low-lying areas in the central regions of Mandalay and Bago, as well as eastern Shan state and the country’s capital, Naypyitaw, have been inundated by water since Wednesday. Min Aung Hlaing and other military officials inspected flooded areas and reviewed rescue, relief and rehabilitation efforts in Naypyitaw on Friday, the state-run Myanma Alinn newspaper reported. Its report said that he instructed officials to contact foreign countries, as other countries affected by the storm did, to receive rescue and relief aid for the victims.'It is necessary to manage rescue, relief and rehabilitation measures as quickly as possible,' he was quoted as saying.The exact extent of the damage still wasn't clear, but there were fears that the death toll may rise sharply. Local news outlets reported more than 100 people missing. Efforts to tally casualties and damage and provide relief are complicated. Myanmar is in a state of civil war that began in 2021, after the army seized power from the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi. Independent analysts believe the military controls much less than half of the country’s territory.Myanmar experiences extreme weather virtually every year during the monsoon season. In 2008, Cyclone Nargis killed more than 138,000 people. In that case, the military government then in power delayed accepting international assistance, and when it finally relented, tightly controlled its distribution, with little or no oversight by aid donors.Saturday evening’s state television news said that 24 bridges, 375 school buildings, one Buddhist monastery, five dams, four pagodas, 14 electrical transformers, 456 lampposts and more than 65,000 houses were damaged by floods in central and eastern parts of the country.Naypyitaw is one of the areas that was hit hardest by the floods. Myanmar’s Eleven Media group reported on Friday that record rainfall had damaged several pagodas in Bagan, the country’s ancient capital that is a UNESCO World Heritage site. The rain, said to be the heaviest in 60 years, collapsed walls at several centuries-old old temples, it said.	https://apnews.com/article/myanmar-typhoon-yagi-floods-dead-missing-f41b7e73b7ed72bd58e1221e7f620456	2024-09-14T08:35:26-07:00	
Ukraine renews calls on the West to approve long-range strikes on Russian territory	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukraine made a new call Saturday on the West to allow it to strike deeper into Russia after a meeting between U.S. and British leaders a day earlier produced no visible shift in their policy on the use of long-range weapons.The renewed appeal came as Kyiv said Russia launched more drone and artillery attacks into Ukraine overnight.'Russian terror begins at weapons depots, airfields and military bases inside the Russian Federation,' Ukrainian presidential adviser Andriy Yermak said Saturday. 'Permission to strike deep into Russia will speed up the solution.'Ukrainian officials have repeatedly called on allies to greenlight the use of Western-provided long-range weapons to strike targets deep inside Russian territory. So far, the U.S. has allowed Kyiv to use American-provided weapons only in a limited area inside Russia’s border with Ukraine.Discussions on allowing long-range strikes were believed to be on the table when U.S. President Joe Biden and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer met in Washington on Friday but no decision was announced immediately.Hub peek embed (Russia-Ukraine) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has been pressing the U.S. and other allies to allow his forces to use Western weapons to target air bases and launch sites farther afield as Russia has stepped up assaults on Ukraine’s electricity grid and utilities before winter. He did not directly comment on the meeting Saturday morning, but said that more than 70 Russian drones had been launched into Ukraine overnight. The Ukrainian air force later said that 76 Russian drones had been sighted, of which 72 were shot down.'We need to boost our air defense and long-range capabilities to protect our people,' Zelenskyy wrote on social media. 'We are working on this with all of Ukraine’s partners.'Other overnight attacks saw one person killed by Russian artillery fire as energy infrastructure was targeted in Ukraine’s Sumy region. A 54-year-old driver was killed and seven more people were hospitalized, Ukraine’s Ministry of Energy said.Another three people died Saturday in a Russian strike on an agricultural enterprise in the front-line town of Huliaipole in the Zaporizhzhia region, Gov. Ivan Fedorov said.Moscow warns Western nations Meanwhile, officials in Moscow have continued to make public statements warning that long-range strikes would provoke further escalation between Russia and the West. The remarks are in line with the narrative the Kremlin has promoted since early in the war, accusing NATO countries of de-facto participation in the conflict and threatening a response.Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov told state news agency Tass on Saturday that the U.S. and British governments were pushing the conflict, which began with Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, toward 'poorly controlled escalation.'Biden on Friday brushed off similar comments by Russian President Vladimir Putin, who said on Thursday that allowing long-range strikes 'would mean that NATO countries, the United States and European countries, are at war with Russia.' Asked what he thought about Putin’s threat, Biden answered, 'I don’t think much about Vladimir Putin.'POWs exchanged Russian and Ukrainian officials also announced on Saturday a prisoner swap brokered by the United Arab Emirates. It included 206 prisoners on both sides, including Russians captured in Ukraine’s incursion in the Kursk region.The swap is the eighth of its kind since the beginning of 2024, and puts the total number of POWs exchanged at 1,994. Previous exchanges were also brokered by the UAE. Both sides released images of soldiers traveling to meet friends and family, with Zelenskyy commenting, 'Our people are home.'Elsewhere, Russia’s Defense Ministry said that 19 Ukrainian drones had been shot down over the country’s Kursk and Belgorod regions. A woman also died Saturday after a Ukrainian shell hit her home in the border village of Bezlyudovka, Belgorod regional Gov. Vyacheslav Gladkov said.___Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-long-distance-missile-biden-starmer-e4c7b590e8f89167f639969f75762fbb	2024-09-14T03:12:10-07:00	
Salvagers launch new attempt to tow an oil tanker blown up by Yemen's Houthi rebels	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — A new attempt has begun to try to salvage an oil tanker burning in the Red Sea after attacks by Yemen’s Houthi rebels, a European Union naval mission said Saturday.The EU’s Operation Aspides published images dated Saturday of its vessels escorting three ships heading to the Greek-flagged oil tanker Sounion.The mission has 'been actively involved in this complex endeavor, by creating a secure environment, which is necessary for the tugboats to conduct the towing operation,' the EU said.A phone number for the mission rang unanswered Saturday. However, satellite images taken Saturday morning by Planet Labs PBC and later analyzed by The Associated Press showed what appeared to be the three salvage vessels close to the Sounion. A warship could be seen nearby.The Greek state news agency ANA-MPA later reported the Aigaion Pelagos, a Greek-flagged tugboat, was involved in the effort. It said 'three frigates, helicopters and a special forces unit' backed the salvagers.'Despite challenging conditions, with temperatures reaching up to 400 degrees Celsius (752 degrees Fahrenheit) due to the fire, the specialized salvage team successfully secured the tanker to the Aigaion Pelagos,' the report said. The Sounion came under attack from the Houthis beginning Aug. 21. The vessel had been staffed by a crew of 25 Filipinos and Russians, as well as four private security personnel, who were taken by a French destroyer to nearby Djibouti.The Houthis later planted explosives aboard the ship and detonated them. That’s led to fears the ship’s 1 million barrels of crude oil could spill into the Red Sea.The Houthis have targeted more than 80 vessels with missiles and drones since the war in Gaza started in October. They seized one vessel and sank two in the campaign that also killed four sailors. One of the sunken vessels, the Tutor, went down after the Houthis planted explosives aboard it and after its crew abandoned it due to an earlier attack, the rebel group later acknowledged.Other missiles and drones have either been intercepted by a U.S.-led coalition in the Red Sea or failed to reach their targets.The rebels maintain that they target ships linked to Israel, the U.S. or the U.K. to force an end to Israel’s campaign against Hamas in Gaza. However, many of the ships attacked have little or no connection to the conflict, including some bound for Iran.	https://apnews.com/article/yemen-houthi-rebels-red-sea-tanker-e56669ea8ea5ea9f9658cdd262c07b29	2024-09-14T00:37:01-07:00	
4 people found dead in eastern Romania as rainstorms leave hundreds stranded	BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) — Four people in eastern Romania have been found dead after torrential storms dumped unprecedented rain, leaving hundreds stranded in flooded areas, emergency authorities said Saturday.Rescue services scrambled to save people in the hard-hit eastern counties of Galati and Vaslui. The bodies of three older women and one man were found in four localities, the Department for Emergency Situations said. Emergency authorities released video footage showing teams of rescuers evacuating people using small lifeboats through muddy waters and carrying some older people to safety. Some of the most significant flood damage was concentrated in Galati where 5,000 households were affected. A Black Hawk helicopter was also deployed there to help with the search and rescue efforts. The storms battered 19 localities in eight counties in Romania, with strong winds downing dozens of trees that damaged cars and blocked roads and traffic. Authorities sent text message alerts to residents to warn them of adverse weather as emergency services rushed to remove floodwaters from homes. Hub peek embed (Floods) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) By 1 p.m. local time on Saturday, more than 250 people had been evacuated with the help of 700 interior ministry personnel deployed to affected communities, authorities said.Romanian Environment Minister Mircea Fechet told The Associated Press that in some of the badly flooded areas, more than 160 liters (42 gallons) of rain fell per square meter (about 10.7 square feet), which he said is a rare occurrence. 'What we are trying to do right now is save as many lives as possible,' said the minister, who was on his way to Galati to assess the situation. Romanian President Klaus Iohannis offered his condolences to the victims' bereaved families, writing on Facebook: 'We must continue to strengthen our capacity to anticipate extreme weather phenomena.''Severe floods that have affected a large part of the country have led to loss of lives and significant damage,' Iohannis said. 'We are again dealing with the effects of climate change, which are increasingly present throughout the European continent, with dramatic consequences on people.'Central Europe braces for intense floodingThe stormy weather comes as several central European nations anticipate severe flooding to hit the Czech Republic, Poland, Austria, Germany, Slovakia, and Hungary over the weekend. In the Czech Republic, river waters reached dangerously high levels in dozens of areas, prompting the authorities to evacuate hundreds of people, including from a hospital in the second-largest city of Brno, to escape raging floods. A 54-year-old man was missing, police said, after he fell in a flooded stream in the southeast of the country, while another three people were swept away in a car by a river in the northeast.By Saturday evening, Czech authorities had declared the highest flood warnings in more than 70 areas across the country, and said that thousands more people should be prepared to be evacuated as the rains continued to slam down. The Czech Hydrometeorological Institute said such 'extreme floods' in those regions only occur about once a century. In neighboring Austria, authorities declared 24 villages in the northeast Lower Austria province 'disaster zones' on Saturday afternoon and began evacuating residents from those areas. 'The coming hours will be the hours of truth for flood protection, for our emergency forces and numerous compatriots,' said the province’s state governor, Johanna Mikl-Leitner, adding that in one area 'we expect challenges of historical dimensions.'The torrential downpours have also caused a sharp rise in water levels on the Danube River in Austrian capital Vienna, where special flood relief channels were built in the 1970s and ’80s, and are likely to be tested over the weekend. The Kamp River, a tributary of the Danube, is also swelling because of the unprecedented weather event. Heavy rain also hit Moldova on Saturday, where emergency workers pumped floodwater from dozens of peoples’ homes in several localities, and 13 localities in three districts suffered partial electricity outages, authorities said. Meteorologists say a low-pressure system from northern Italy was predicted to dump heavy rainfall in most parts of the Czech Republic, including the capital and border regions with Austria and Germany in the south, and Poland in the north.'We have to be ready for worst-case scenarios,' Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala said after the government’s central crisis committee met. 'A tough weekend is ahead of us.'In Poland, dozens of people were evacuated as a precautionary measure on Saturday from two villages near the town of Nysa, in the Nysa River basin, after meteorologists warned of unprecedented rainfall. Some farms were flooded. Water levels continued to rise in rain Saturday and some roads and streets in the cities of Krakow and Katowice were flooded, and water penetrated the basement of a hospital in Krakow though firefighters quickly pumped it out. Interior Minister Tomasz Siemoniak said that 'the worst is yet to come.' Polish authorities appealed to residents on Friday to stock up on food and to prepare for power outages by charging power banks.The weather change arrived following a hot start to September in the region, including in Romania. Scientists have documented Earth’s hottest summer, breaking a record set just a year ago.A hotter atmosphere, driven by human-caused climate change, can lead to more intense rainfall.___Stephen McGrath reported from Sighisoara.

An American activist killed by Israeli fire is buried in Turkey as Israel strikes Gaza	ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) — A Turkish-American activist who was killed by Israeli fire in the West Bank was laid to rest on Saturday in her hometown in Turkey with thousands lining the streets and anti-Israeli feelings in the country rising from a conflict that threatens to spread across the region.Aysenur Ezgi Eygi, a 26-year-old woman from Seattle, was shot dead Sept. 6 by an Israeli soldier during a demonstration against Israeli West Bank settlements, according to an Israeli protester who witnessed the shooting. Thousands of people lined the streets in the Turkish coastal town of Didim on the Aegean Sea, as Eygi was buried in a coffin draped in a Turkish flag, which was taken from her family home. A portrait of her wearing her graduation gown was propped against the coffin as people paid their respects.Her body was earlier brought from a hospital to her family home and Didim’s Central Mosque. Hub peek embed (Israel-Hamaswar) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) Turkey condemned the killing and announced it will conduct its own investigation into her death. 'We are not going to leave our daughter’s blood on the ground and we demand responsibility and accountability for this murder,' Numan Kurtulmus, the speaker of Turkey’s parliament told mourners at the funeral. On Friday, an autopsy had been carried out at Izmir Forensic Medicine Institute. Kurtulmus said the examination showed Eygi was hit by a round that struck her in the back of the head below her left ear.The Israeli military said Tuesday that Eygi was likely shot 'indirectly and unintentionally' by Israeli forces. Her death was condemned by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken as the United States, Egypt and Qatar push for a cease-fire in the 11-month-long Israel-Hamas war and the release of the remaining hostages held by Hamas. Talks have repeatedly bogged down as Israel and Hamas accuse each other of making new and unacceptable demands.The war began when Hamas-led fighters killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, in an Oct. 7 attack on southern Israel. They abducted another 250 people and are still holding around 100 hostages after releasing most of the rest in exchange for Palestinians imprisoned by Israel during a weeklong cease-fire in November. Around a third of the remaining hostages are believed to be dead.Israelis are growing increasingly frustrated with the government for not reaching a cease-fire with Hamas to bring the remaining captives home. On Saturday night, thousands of Israelis streamed into the streets in Tel Aviv demanding Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu bring the hostages back. At one of the rallies, Anat Angrest, mother of kidnapped soldier Matan Angrest, shared a voice recording from her son while in captivity asking Netanyahu to make a deal. 'I want to see my family and friends,' said Matan in the message. Angrest then addressed the head of Israel’s Mossad spy agency. 'Where are you, negotiation team? There is no deal for over eight months, so what are you doing?'Anger has spiked since the bodies of six hostages were found in a tunnel beneath the southern Gaza city of Rafah earlier this month. The military said the six were killed shortly before Israeli forces were to rescue them.Many blame Netanyahu for failing to reach a deal, which opinion polls show a majority of Israelis favor. However, the country is also extremely divided and Netanyahu has significant support for his strategy of 'total victory' against Hamas, even if a deal for the hostages has to wait.Israeli airstrikes hit Gaza Israeli airstrikes pounded central and southern Gaza overnight into Saturday, killing at least 14 people.The strikes in Gaza City hit one home housing 11 people, including three women and four children, and another strike hit a tent in Khan Younis with Palestinians displaced by the Israel-Hamas war, Gaza's Civil Defense said. They followed airstrikes earlier this week that hit a tent camp on Tuesday and a United Nations school sheltering displaced on Wednesday.The Israeli army on Saturday ordered Palestinians sheltering in the northern neighborhoods of Manshiyeh, Beit Lahia and Sheikh Zayed to evacuate south toward Gaza City. The order came after projectiles were fired from the area, the Israeli army said in a post on X. It remains unclear how many people are sheltering in those areas.First phase of anti-polio campaign ends Meanwhile, a campaign to inoculate children in Gaza against polio drew down and the World Health Organization said about 559,000 under the age of 10 have recovered from their first dose, seven out of every eight children the campaign aimed to vaccinate. The second doses are expected to begin later this month as part of an effort in which the WHO said parties had already agreed to.'As we prepare for the next round in four weeks, we’re hopeful these pauses will hold, because this campaign has clearly shown the world what’s possible when peace is given a chance,' Richard Peeperkorn, WHO’s representative in Gaza and the West Bank, said in a statement on Saturday.The war has caused vast destruction and displaced around 90% of Gaza’s population of 2.3 million, often multiple times, and plunged the territory into a severe humanitarian crisis. Gaza’s Health Ministry says over 41,000 Palestinians have been killed since the war began. The ministry does not distinguish between civilians and militants in its count, but says women and children make up just over half of the dead. Israel says it has killed more than 17,000 militants in the war.__Shurafa reported from Deir al-Balah, Gaza Strip.

Iran says it successfully launched a satellite in its program criticized by West over missile fears	TEHRAN, Iran (AP) — Iran launched a satellite into space Saturday with a rocket built by the country's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard, state-run media reported, the latest for a program the West fears helps Tehran advance its ballistic missile program. Iran described the launch as the second such launch to put a satellite into orbit with the rocket. Independent scientists later confirmed the launch and that the satellite reached orbit.Footage later released by Iranian media showed the rocket blast off from a mobile launcher. An Associated Press analysis of the video and other imagery later released suggested the launch happened at the Guard’s launch pad on the outskirts of the city of Shahroud, some 350 kilometers (215 miles) east of the capital, Tehran. The launch comes amid heightened tensions gripping the wider Middle East over the ongoing Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip, during which Tehran launched an unprecedented direct missile-and-drone attack on Israel. Meanwhile, Iran continues to enrich uranium to nearly weapons-grade levels, raising concerns among nonproliferation experts about Tehran's program. Hub peek embed (Spacelaunches) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) Iran identified the satellite-carrying rocket as the Qaem-100, which the Guard used in January for another successful launch. Qaem means 'upright' in Iran's Farsi language. The solid-fuel, three-stage rocket put the Chamran-1 satellite, weighing 60 kilograms (132 pounds), into a 550-kilometer (340-mile) orbit, state media reported. The rocket bore a Quranic verse: 'That which is left by Allah is better for you, if you are believers.'A state-owned subsidiary of Iran's Defense Ministry and experts at the Aerospace Research Institute built the satellite with others to 'test hardware and software systems for orbital maneuver technology validation,' state media said, without elaborating.Gen. Hossein Salami, the head of the Guard, praised the launch in a statement and said scientists successfully overcame 'the atmosphere of extensive and oppressive international sanctions.'Responding to questions from The Associated Press, the U.S. State Department said it has 'long made clear our concern that Iran’s space launch vehicle programs provide a pathway to expand its longer-range missile systems.''We continue to use a variety of nonproliferation tools, in coordination with our allies and partners, to counter the further advancement of Iran’s ballistic missile program and its ability to proliferate missiles and related technology,' it added.The United States had previously said Iran’s satellite launches defy a U.N. Security Council resolution and called on Tehran to undertake no activity involving ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons. U.N. sanctions related to Iran’s ballistic missile program expired last October.Under Iran’s relatively moderate former President Hassan Rouhani, the Islamic Republic slowed its space program for fear of raising tensions with the West. Hard-line President Ebrahim Raisi, a protege of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei who came to power in 2021, has pushed the program forward. Raisi died in a helicopter crash in May. It's unclear what Iran's new president, the reformist Masoud Pezeshkian, wants for the program as he was silent on the issue while campaigning. The U.S. intelligence community’s worldwide threat assessment this year said Iran's development of satellite launch vehicles 'would shorten the timeline' for Iran to develop an intercontinental ballistic missile because it uses similar technology.Intercontinental ballistic missiles can be used to deliver nuclear weapons. Iran is now producing uranium close to weapons-grade levels after the collapse of its nuclear deal with world powers. Tehran has enough enriched uranium for 'several' nuclear weapons, if it chooses to produce them, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency repeatedly has warned.Iran has always denied seeking nuclear weapons and says its space program, like its nuclear activities, is for purely civilian purposes. However, U.S. intelligence agencies and the IAEA say Iran had an organized military nuclear program up until 2003.The launch also came ahead of the second anniversary of the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini, which sparked nationwide protests against Iran's mandatory headscarf, or hijab, law and the country's Shiite theocracy. ___Gambrell reported from Dubai, United Arab Emirates.	https://apnews.com/article/iran-satellite-chamran-space-52022a743be4e3ffca5df9d30de7b04c	2024-09-13T22:30:02-07:00	
Tropical Storm Ileana weakens to a depression	MEXICO CITY (AP) — Storm Ileana has weakened to a tropical depression, the National Hurricane Center said Sunday.The tropical storm formed Thursday off Mexico’s Pacific coast as it moved ashore, making landfall on the coast of the Mexican state of Sinaloa Saturday, a day after it pounded the resort-studded Los Cabos.On Sunday, wind speed dropped to 35 mph (55 kph), NOAA said in an advisory, as Ileana was nearly 30 miles (45 kilometers) southwest of Los Mochis, Mexico, and moving west-northwest at 2 mph (4 kph). It also forecasts the storm to become a remnant low — a post-tropical cyclone with maximum sustained winds less than 34 knots.On Friday, a warning had been in effect for portions of the Baja California Peninsula, including Cabo San Lucas and San Jose del Cabo. Juan Manuel Arce Ortega, from Los Cabos Civil Protection, said the municipalities of La Paz and Los Cabos had suspended classes in schools due to the storm. Hub peek embed (Weather) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) Authorities prepared 20 temporary shelters in San Jose del Cabo and Cabo San Lucas, according to Los Cabos Civil Protection.At the Hacienda Beach Club and Residences in Cabo San Lucas, valet worker Alan Galvan said the rain arrived late Thursday night and has been constant. 'The rain isn’t very strong right now, but the waves are choppy,' he said.'The guests are very calm and already came down for coffee,' Galvan said. 'There’s some flights canceled but everything is ok at the moment.'The rain remained consistent through Los Cabos Friday afternoon, with several roads flooded and some resorts stacking up sandbags on their perimeters. Some people were still walking around boat docks with their umbrellas.'The priority has to be safety, starting with the workers. We always have to check on our colleagues who live in risk areas,' said Lyzzette Liceaga, a tour operator at Los Cabos.Ileana was the only active tropical storm in the National Weather Service’s Eastern Pacific basin on Friday. In the Atlantic basin, post-tropical cyclone Francine was bringing heavy rain to parts of the southern United States, and Tropical Storm Gordon formed on Friday in the Atlantic Ocean, with forecasters saying it is expected to remain over open water for several days.	https://apnews.com/article/tropical-storm-ileana-cabo-san-lucas-970c4df9c396c98286a5abcb10b87ed4	2024-09-13T22:03:32-07:00	
Women in Iran are going without hijabs as the 2nd anniversary of Mahsa Amini's death approaches	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — On the streets of Iranian cities, it's becoming more common to see a woman passing by without a mandatory headscarf, or hijab, as the second anniversary of the death of Mahsa Amini and the mass protests it sparked approaches. There's no government official or study acknowledging the phenomenon, which began as Iran entered its hot summer months and power cuts in its overburdened electrical system became common. But across social media, videos of people filming neighborhood streets or just talking about a normal day in their life, women and girls can be seen walking past with their long hair out over their shoulders, particularly after sunset. This defiance comes despite what United Nations investigators describe as 'expanded repressive measures and policies' by Iran's theocracy to punish them — though there's been no recent catalyzing event like Amini's death to galvanize demonstrators. Hub peek embed (Iran) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) The country's new reformist President Masoud Pezeshkian campaigned on a promise to halt the harassment of women by morality police. But the country's ultimate authority remains the 85-year-old Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who in the past said 'unveiling is both religiously forbidden and politically forbidden.' For some observant Muslim women, the head covering is a sign of piety before God and modesty in front of men outside their families. In Iran, the hijab — and the all-encompassing black chador worn by some — has long been a political symbol as well.'Meaningful institutional changes and accountability for gross human rights violations and crimes under international law, and crimes against humanity, remains elusive for victims and survivors, especially for women and children,' warned a U.N. fact-finding mission on Iran on Friday. Amini, 22, died on Sept. 16, 2022, in a hospital after her arrest by the country’s morality police over allegedly not wearing her hijab to the liking of the authorities. The protests that followed Amini’s death started first with the chant 'Women, Life, Freedom.' However, the protesters’ cries soon grew into open calls of revolt against Khamenei.A monthslong security crackdown that followed killed more than 500 people and saw over 22,000 detained.Today, passersby on the streets of Tehran, whether its tony northern suburbs for the wealthy or the working-class neighborhoods of the capital's southern reaches, now routinely see women without the hijab. It particularly starts at dusk, though even during the daylight on weekends women can be seen with their hair uncovered at major parks. Online videos — specifically a sub-genre showing walking tours of city streets for those in rural areas or abroad who want to see life in the bustling neighborhoods of Tehran — include women without the hijab. Something that would have stopped a person in their tracks in the decades follwing the 1979 Islamic Revolution now goes unacknowledged. 'My quasi-courage for not wearing scarves is a legacy of Mahsa Amini and we have to protect this as an achievement,' said a 25-year-old student at Tehran Sharif University, who gave only her first name Azadeh out of fear of reprisal. 'She could be at my current age if she did not pass away.'The disobedience still comes with risk. Months after the protests halted, Iranian morality police returned to the streets. There have been scattered videos of women and young girls being roughed up by officers in the time since. In 2023, a teenage Iranian girl was injured in a mysterious incident on Tehran’s Metro while not wearing a headscarf and later died in hospital. In July, activists say police opened fire on a woman fleeing a checkpoint in an attempt to avoid her car being impounded for her not wearing the hijab. Meanwhile, the government has targeted private businesses where women are seen without their headscarves. Surveillance cameras search for women uncovered in vehicles to fine and impound their cars. The government has gone as far as use aerial drones to monitor the 2024 Tehran International Book Fair and Kish Island for uncovered women, the U.N. said. Yet some feel the election of Pezeshkian in July, after a helicopter crash killed Iranian hard-line President Ebrahim Raisi in May, is helping ease tensions over the hijab. 'I think the current peaceful environment is part of the status after Pezeshkian took office,' said Hamid Zarrinjouei, a 38-year-old bookseller. 'In some way, Pezeshkian could convince powerful people that more restrictions do not necessarily make women more faithful to the hijab.'On Wednesday, Iran’s Prosecutor General Mohammad Movahedi Azad warned security forces about starting physical altercations over the hijab. 'We prosecuted violators, and we will,' Movahedi Azad said, according to Iranian media. 'Nobody has right to have improper attitude even though an individual commits an offense.'While the government isn't directly addressing the increase in women not wearing hijabs, there are other signs of a recognition the political landscape has shifted. In August, authorities dismissed a university teacher a day after he appeared on state television and dismissively referred to Amini as having 'croaked.'Meanwhile, the pre-reform newspaper Ham Mihan reported in August on an unpublished survey conducted under the supervision of Iran's Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance that found the hijab had become one of the most important issues in the country — something it hadn't seen previously. 'This issue has been on people’s minds more than ever before,' sociologist Simin Kazemi told the newspaper. ___Associated Press writers Nasser Karimi and Amir Vahdat in Tehran, Iran, contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/iran-hijab-protests-mahsa-amini-anniversary-59641e9254eea45c069b54d590c7e818	2024-09-13T20:10:09-07:00	
In Belarus, the native language is vanishing as Russian takes prominence	TALLINN, Estonia (AP) — When school started this year for Mikalay in Belarus, the 15-year-old discovered that his teachers and administrators no longer called him by that name. Instead, they referred to him as Nikolai, its Russian equivalent.What's more, classes at his school — one of the country's best — are now taught in Russian, not Belarusian, which he has spoken for most of his life.Belarusians like Mikalay are experiencing a new wave of Russification as Moscow expands its economic, political and cultural dominance to overtake the identity of its neighbor.It's not the first time. Russia under the czars and in the era of the Soviet Union imposed its language, symbols and cultural institutions on Belarus. But with the demise of the USSR in 1991, the country began to assert its identity, and Belarusian briefly became the official language, with the white-red-white national flag replacing a version of the red hammer and sickle.But all that changed in 1994, after Alexander Lukashenko, a former Soviet collective farm official, came to power. The authoritarian leader made Russian an official language, alongside Belarusian, and did away with the nationalist symbols.Now, with Lukashenko in control of the country for over three decades, he has allowed Russia to dominate all aspects of life in Belarus, a country of 9.5 million people. Belarusian, which like Russian uses the Cyrillic alphabet, is hardly heard on the streets of Minsk and other large cities anymore.Official business is conducted in Russian, which dominates the majority of the media. Lukashenko speaks only Russian, and government officials often don't use their native tongue.The country depends on Russian loans and cheap energy and has created a political and military alliance with Moscow, allowing President Vladimir Putin to deploy troops and missiles on its soil, which was used as a staging area for the war in Ukraine.'I understand that our Belarus is occupied. … And who is the president there? Not Lukashenko. The president is Putin,' said Svetlana Alexievich, who won the 2015 Nobel Prize for literature and lives in Germany in effective exile. 'The nation has been humiliated and it will be very difficult for Belarusians to recover from this.' Belarusian cultural figures have been persecuted and hundreds of its nationalist organizations have been closed. Experts say Moscow is seeking to implement in Belarus what the Kremlin intended to do in neighboring Ukraine when the war there began in 2022.'It is obvious that our children are being deliberately deprived of their native language, history and Belarusian identity, but parents have been strongly advised not to ask questions about Russification,' said Mikalay’s father, Anatoly, who spoke to The Associated Press on condition his last name not be used, for fear of retribution.'We were informed about the synchronization of the curriculum with Russia this year and were shown a propaganda film about how the Ukrainian special services are allegedly recruiting our teenagers and forcing them to commit sabotage in Belarus,' he said.Mikalay's school was one of the few where paperwork and some courses were conducted in Belarusian. In recent years, however, dozens of teachers were fired and the Belarusian-language section of its website vanished.Human rights advocate Ales Bialiatski, convicted in 2023 on charges stemming from his Nobel Peace Prize-winning work, demanded his trial be conducted in Belarusian. The court rejected it and sentenced him to 10 years.Lukashenko derides his native language, saying 'nothing great can be expressed in Belarusian. … There are only two great languages in the world: Russian and English.'Speaking to Russian state media, Lukashenko recounted how Putin once thanked him for making Russian the dominant language in Belarus.'I said, ‘Wait, what are you thanking me for? ... The Russian language is my language, we were part of one empire, and we're taking part in (helping) that language develop,'' Lukashenko said.Belarus was part of the Russian empire for centuries and became one of 15 Soviet republics after the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution. Daily use of the Belarusian language decreased and continued only in the country's west and north and in rural areas. In 1994, about 40% of students were taught in Belarusian; it's now down to under 9%. Although Belarusian, like Russian, is an eastern Slavic language, its vocabulary is considerably different. In 1517, Belarusian publisher Francysk Skaryna was one of the first in eastern Europe to translate the Bible into his native language.Even speaking Belarusian is seen as a show of opposition to Lukashenko and a declaration of national identity. That played a key role in the mass protests after the disputed 2020 election gave the authoritarian leader a sixth term. In the harsh crackdown that followed, a half-million people fled the country.'The Belarusian language is increasingly perceived as a sign of political disloyalty and is being abandoned in favor of Russian in the public administration, education, culture and the mass media, upon orders from the hierarchy or out of fear of discrimination,' said Anaïs Marin, the United Nations special rapporteur for human rights in Belarus.At the same time, 'more people want to speak Belarusian, which has become one of the symbols of freedom, but they're afraid to do it in public,' said Alina Nahornaja, author of 'Language 404,' a book about Belarusians who experienced discrimination for speaking their native language.Like Ukraine, Belarusians had a desire for rapprochement with Europe that accompanied their nationalist sentiment, said Belarusian analyst Valery Karbalevich.'But the Kremlin quickly realized the danger and began the process of creeping Russification in Belarus,' he added.That prompted pro-Russian organizations, joint educational programs and cultural projects to spring up 'like mushrooms after the rain — against the backdrop of harsh repressions against everything Belarusian,' Karbalevich said.Censorship and bans affect not only contemporary Belarusian literature but also its classics. In 2023, the prosecutor’s office declared as extremist the 19th-century poems of Vincent Dunin-Martsinkyevich, who opposed the Russian Empire.When the Kremlin began supporting Lukashenko against the anti-government protests in 2020, it ensured his loyalty and received carte blanche in Belarus.'Today, Lukashenko is paying Putin with our sovereignty,' said exiled opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya. 'Belarusian national identity, cultures and language are our strongest weapons against the Russian world and Russification.'Four cities in Belarus now host a 'Russia House' to promote its culture and influence, offering seminars, film clubs, exhibitions and competitions.'The goal is to plant Russian narratives so that as many Belarusians as possible view Russian as their own,' said analyst Alexander Friedman. 'The Kremlin spares no expense and acts on a grand scale, which could be especially effective and dangerous in a situation where Belarus has found itself in information isolation, and there is almost no one left inside the country to resist the Russian world.'Almost the entire troupe of the Yanka Kupala Theater, the country’s oldest, fled Belarus amid the political crackdown. Its former director, Pavel Latushka, now an opposition figure abroad, said the new management couldn't recruit enough new actors, and had to invite Russians, 'but it turned out that no one knew the Belarusian language.''Putin published an article denying the existence of an independent Ukraine back in 2021, and even then we understood perfectly well that he was pursuing similar goals in Belarus,' Latushka said.'The main course was supposed to be Ukraine,' he added, with a Russified Belarus 'as a dessert.'	https://apnews.com/article/belarus-language-russia-lukashenko-russification-bcc4eb1881ca6c93f98ef9951068dde7	2024-09-13T19:18:49-07:00	
US hits Russian state media with sanctions for raising money for Moscow's troops in Ukraine	WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. State Department announced new sanctions on Russian state media Friday, accusing a Kremlin news outlet of working hand-in-hand with the Russian military and running fundraising campaigns to pay for sniper rifles, body armor and other equipment for soldiers fighting in Ukraine.While the outlet, RT, has previously been sanctioned for its work to spread Kremlin propaganda and disinformation, the new allegations suggest its role goes far beyond influence operations. Instead, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said, RT is a key part of Russia's war machine and its efforts to undermine its democratic adversaries.'RT wants its new covert intelligence capabilities, like its longstanding propaganda disinformation efforts, to remain hidden,' Blinken told reporters. 'Our most powerful antidote to Russia’s lies is the truth. It’s shining a bright light on what the Kremlin is trying to do under the cover of darkness.'Hub peek embed (apf-politics) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) RT has also created websites posing as legitimate news sites to spread disinformation and propaganda in Europe, Africa, South America and elsewhere, officials said. They say the outlet has also expanded its use of cyber operations with a new unit with ties to Russian intelligence created last year.The crowd-sourcing effort ran on Russian social media platforms and sought to raise funds for military supplies, some of which were procured in China, officials said. There were no obvious connections between RT and the fundraising campaign, or any indication that Chinese officials knew their products were being sold to Russia. The list of supplies also included night-vision equipment, drones, radios and generators.RT's actions show 'it's not just a firehouse of disinformation, but a fully-fledged member of the intelligence apparatus and operation of the Russian government,' said Jamie Rubin, who heads the State Department's Global Engagement Center.President Putin’s spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told The Associated Press that the allegations were 'nonsense.' RT is 'media' and 'quite effective,' Peskov said.The sanctions announced Friday target RT’s parent organization, TV-Novosti, as well as a related state media group called Rossiya Segodnya and its general director Dmitry Kiselyov. A third organization and its leader, Nelli Parutenko, were also sanctioned for allegedly running a vote-buying scheme in Moldova designed to help Moscow’s preferred candidates in an upcoming election.Russia’s Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova suggested the sanctions against RT were unnecessary because it has already been sanctioned.'I think a new profession should appear in the United States — a specialist in sanctions already imposed against Russia,' she wrote on her Telegram channel.Russia's global propaganda work is receiving extra scrutiny in the months leading up to the U.S. election. Last week, the Biden administration seized Kremlin-run websites and charged two RT employees with covertly paying a Tennessee company nearly $10 million for its content. The company then paid several popular far-right influencers, whose content often mirrored Russian talking points. Two of the influencers said they had no idea their work was being supported by Russia.This summer, intelligence officials warned that Russia was using unwitting Americans to spread its propaganda by disguising it in English on sites popular with Americans. Officials say Russia seeks to divide Americans ahead of the election as a way of reducing support for Ukraine. Russia's influence operations also appear designed to support former President Donald Trump, who has criticized Ukraine and the NATO alliance while praising Russian President Vladimir Putin.___Associated Press writer Emma Burrows contributed to this report from London.	https://apnews.com/article/russia-putin-trump-sanctions-harris-rt-f7e3ff262fdf24695048cffe2529b937	2024-09-13T08:54:03-07:00	
Today in History: September 19, state funeral of Queen Elizabeth II	Today is Thursday, Sept. 19, the 263rd day of 2024. There are 103 days left in the year. Today in history: On Sept. 19, 2022, Great Britain and the world said a final goodbye to Queen Elizabeth II at a state funeral that drew presidents and kings, princes and prime ministers — and crowds who thronged the streets of London. Also on this date: In 1796, President George Washington’s farewell address was published. In it, America’s first chief executive advised, 'Observe good faith and justice toward all nations. Cultivate peace and harmony with all.' In 1881, the 20th president of the United States, James A. Garfield, died 2 1/2 months after being shot by Charles Guiteau; he was succeeded by Vice President Chester A. Arthur. In 1955, President Juan Peron of Argentina was ousted after a revolt by the army and navy. In 1957, the United States conducted its first contained underground nuclear test, code-named 'Rainier,' in the Nevada desert. In 1985, the Mexico City area was struck by a devastating earthquake that killed at least 9,500 people. In 1988, Olympic diver Greg Louganis suffered a concussion after striking his head on the diving board during the preliminary round of the 3-meter springboard diving competition at the Seoul Summer Games; Louganis would recover from the injury and win a gold medal in the event the following day. In 1995, The New York Times and The Washington Post published the manifesto of Unabomber Ted Kaczynski (kah-ZIHN’-skee), which proved instrumental in identifying and capturing him. In 2004, Hu Jintao (hoo jin-tow) became the undisputed leader of China with the departure of former President Jiang Zemin (jahng zuh-MEEN’) from his top military post. In 2008, struggling to stave off financial catastrophe, the Bush administration laid out a radical bailout plan calling for a takeover of a half-trillion dollars or more in worthless mortgages and other bad debt held by tottering institutions. Relieved investors sent stocks soaring on Wall Street and around the globe.
