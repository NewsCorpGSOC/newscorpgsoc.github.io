Volcanic eruption burns houses in Indonesia, killing at least 6 people	MAUMERE, Indonesia (AP) — Indonesia’s National Disaster Management Agency said Monday that at least six people have died as a series of volcanic eruptions widens on the remote island of Flores. The eruption at Mount Lewotobi Laki Laki just after midnight on Monday spewed thick brownish ash as high as 2,000 meters (6,500 feet) into the air and hot ashes hit a nearby village, burning down several houses including a convent of Catholic nuns, said Firman Yosef, an official at the Mount Lewotobi Laki Laki monitoring post. The Disaster Management Agency lowered the known death toll from an earlier report of nine, saying it had received updated information from local authorities. It said that information was still being collected about the extent of casualties and damage, as local media reports said more people were buried in collapsed houses. Authorities also raised the danger level and widened the danger zone for Mount Lewotobi Laki Laki on Monday, following a series of eruptions that began last week. The country’s volcano monitoring agency increased the volcano’s alert status to the highest level and more than doubled the exclusion zone to a 7-kilometer (4.3-mile) radius after midnight on Monday as eruptions became more frequent. The agency said at least 10,000 people have been affected by the eruption in Wulanggitang District, in the six nearby villages of Pululera, Nawokote, Hokeng Jaya, Klatanlo, Boru and Boru Kedang. In Ile Bura District, 4 villages were affected, namely Dulipali Village, Nobo, Nurabelen and Riang Rita, while in Titehena District it affected four villages, namely Konga Village, Kobasoma, Bokang Wolomatang and Watowara. He said volcanic material was thrown up to 6 kilometers (3.7 miles) from its crater, blanketeing nearby villages and towns with tons of volcanic debris and forcing residents to flee. A nun in Hokeng village died and another was missing, said Agusta Palma, the head of the Saint Gabriel Foundation that oversees convents on the majority-Catholic island. 'Our nuns ran out in panic under a rain of volcanic ash in the darkness,' Palma said. Photos and videos circulated on social media showed tons of volcanic debris covering houses up to their rooftops in villages like Hokeng, where hot volcanic material set fire to houses. It’s Indonesia’s second volcanic eruption in as many weeks. West Sumatra province’s Mount Marapi, one of the country’s most active volcanos, erupted on Oct. 27, spewing thick columns of ash at least three times and blanketing nearby villages with debris, but no casualties were reported. ___ Associated Press writers Niniek Karmini and Edna Tarigan contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/indonesia-mount-lewotobi-laki-laki-volcano-eruption-73f898102d514b9bd093be65b8188002	2024-11-03T18:18:38-08:00	
Stock market today: Asian shares are mostly higher as China begins major economic meeting	Shares were mostly higher in Asia on Monday as China’s leaders began a major meeting expected to bring fresh pledges of help for the world’s second-largest economy. Oil prices gained more than $1 a barrel after the OPEC+ oil producing nations said they would extend production cuts until the end of the year. No reason was given for the move, which came ahead of the U.S. presidential election on Tuesday. U.S. benchmark crude oil gained $1.27 to $70.76 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude, the international standard, picked up $1.30 to $74.70 a barrel. The Standing Committee of China's National People's Congress is meeting this week and analysts were predicting the government may endorse major spending initiatives to boost the economy. 'Markets are alive with whispers of a fresh stimulus package, setting expectations sky-high and creating a buzz that’s hard to ignore,' Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management said in a commentary. Hong Kong's Hang Seng gained 0.1% to 20,540.44, while the Shanghai Composite index was up 0.3% at 3,281,76. Markets in Tokyo were closed for a holiday. Australia's S&amp;P/ASX 200 edged 0.2% higher to 8,134.60 and the Kospi in Seoul jumped 1% to 2,568.85. Taiwan's Taiex was up 0.3%. On Friday, Amazon led U.S. stock indexes higher, while a surprisingly weak jobs report marred by some unusual occurrences cemented bets on Wall Street for another cut to interest rates next week. The S&amp;P 500 rose 0.4% to 5,728.80, recovering some of its loss from the day before, its worst in eight weeks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.7% to 42,052.19, while the Nasdaq composite gained 0.8% to 18,239.92. Amazon climbed 6.2% after delivering a bigger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected and was the strongest force pushing the S&amp;P 500 higher. Intel, meanwhile, rallied 7.8% despite reporting a worse loss than expected. Its revenue topped analysts’ estimates, and it gave a forecast for results in the current quarter that likewise topped expectations. Cardinal Health was another one of the market’s bigger gainers and jumped 7% after topping analysts’ forecasts for profit and revenue in the latest quarter. It also raised its profit forecast for its fiscal year, which is only in its second quarter. They helped offset a 1.2% slide for Apple, which said it expects revenue growth in the important holiday quarter to be in the low to mid-single digit percentages. That was below several analysts’ forecasts. Treasury yields pushed higher after a highly anticipated report said U.S. employers added only 12,000 workers to their payrolls last month, far short of the 115,000 in hiring that economists were expecting or the 223,00 jobs that employers created in September. A separate report said U.S. manufacturing contracted by more last month than economists expected. It’s been one of the areas of the economy hurt most by the Federal Reserve’s keeping interest rates at a two-decade high until September. The nearly unanimous expectation on Wall Street remains for the Fed to cut its main interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point next week. The two-year Treasury yield, which closely tracks expectations for the Fed’s actions, initially fell following the jobs report but then climbed to 4.20% from 4.18% late Thursday. The yield on the 10-year Treasury, which also takes future economic growth and other factors into account, likewise rose after a knee-jerk drop. It climbed to 4.37%, up from 4.29% late Thursday. The hope on Wall Street is that the economy will still avoid a recession, even with the slowdown in the job market, thanks in part to coming cuts to interest rates by the Fed. The overall economy has so far remained more resilient than feared. In currency dealings early Monday, the dollar slipped to 152.05 Japanese yen from 152.42 yen late Friday. The euro fell to $1.0879 from $1.0881.	https://apnews.com/article/stock-markets-rates-opec-china-c9e140c9ad29f8450613ce0a19550b18	2024-11-03T17:42:17-08:00

OPEC extends its oil output cuts by one month until the end of December	Saudi Arabia and allied oil producing countries said on Sunday they would postpone a plan to gradually increase oil output until the end of the year, extending their output cuts by one month. No reason was given for the move, which comes ahead of the U.S. presidential election on Tuesday. In June, OPEC said 2.2 million barrels a day in voluntary cuts were extended until September but would then be gradually reduced month by month until they are eliminated by September 2025. OPEC later extended the cuts until November. On Sunday, the group, which includes Saudi Arabia, Russia, Iraq, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Kazakhstan, Algeria and Oman, extended the cuts again by one month until the end of December. The announcement was made on the website for the OPEC+ alliance. Oil prices have been edging down as weak global demand overtakes the risk of a wider war in the Mideast.	https://apnews.com/article/oil-opec-mideast-3f6d65f80f7077e16be1a247bc4c9598	2024-11-03T13:48:16-08:00	
Bolivia's Evo Morales tells AP he'll press on with a hunger strike until his rival accepts dialogue	LAUCA Ñ, Bolivia (AP) — Bolivia's transformative and divisive former President Evo Morales said Sunday that he would press on with a hunger strike until the government of his protégé-turned-rival agreed to a political dialogue. The act, exposing the depth of the Andean country's divisions, aims to defuse the protests over Morales' claims of political persecution that have paralyzed the nation in recent weeks. Morales, a larger-than-life figure still towering over Bolivian politics, spoke from the misty tropics of Chapare, Bolivia’s rural coca-growing region that serves as his stronghold. 'My fight is to improve the situation in the country and to start a dialogue without conditions on two fronts, one economic and one political,' Morales told The Associated Press from the office of the coca growers’ federation that he has long led. He said he began his hunger strike on Friday in hopes of 'international organizations or friendly governments' facilitating his outreach to his political nemesis, President Luis Arce. Tensions have surged over the past three weeks since pro-Morales supporters erected crippling roadblocks aimed at rebuking Arce — the ex-president’s former economy minister with whom he’s vying to lead Bolivia’s governing socialist party into next year’s elections. Calling for Arce's resignation, the protesters have also sought to challenge his government’s attempt to revive a 2016 statutory rape case against Morales, an ethnic Aymara who was the first member of an Indigenous community to become the president of Latin America’s only Indigenous-majority nation. Morales has denied any wrongdoing. 'My crime is being Indigenous,' he said on Sunday. The AP reached Morales after an arduous 11-hour journey by car, motorcycle and foot over hills and through the highlands, circumventing road blockades, crisscrossing routes littered with debris and squeaking through over a dozen security checkpoints, in some cases manned by profiteers. Roadblocks are a common protest tactic in Bolivia, where the mountainous terrain means a few strategically positioned checkpoints can can isolate major cities and bring the country to a halt. Morales' supporters have used it over past decades to great effect and did so again this month, escalating pressure on Arce to take action against protesters who have marooned hundreds of thousands of residents in the highlands, raising fears of food and gasoline shortages and hiking up already inflated prices in major cities, even the capital of La Paz. 'I see people rising up even more,' said Eusebio Urbano, a farmer protesting in support of Morales at one of the road blockades Sunday. 'I don’t know what this government thinks. ... They don’t try to solve anything. We'll have to exert pressure until it leaves.' Last Friday, Arce's government sent some 3,000 police officers armed with tear gas and backed by helicopters to break up the blockades by force. Senior Minister Eduardo Del Castillo said security forces had arrested dozens of protesters in a crackdown that succeeded in clearing the road linking Cochabamba, Bolivia’s third-biggest city, and La Paz. He said security forces transferred over 50 of them to pre-trial detention in the capital. 'What happened was very inhumane,' Morales said, adding that his refusal to eat was also aimed at pressuring authorities to release the 66 detainees. 'These are humble people who were presented as terrorists.' It was the latest turn in Bolivia’s long-running political crisis, which escalated last week when gunmen ambushed Morales’ convoy in what the former president claimed was a government-led assassination attempt. Officials in Arce’s government denied this, alleging that police opened fire because Morales’ van had barreled through a security checkpoint. 'They’ve been using any tactic they can, politically, legally, morally and now, to end my life physically,' Morales said. From there, protests in Morales' defense only intensified. On Friday, Arce’s government accused his demonstrators of occupying military barracks in Chapare, a flashpoint for conflict since the U.S.-backed war on drugs in the 1990s. Authorities said that protesters seized weapons and held some 200 soldiers hostage Friday. Morales and his supporters rejected reports of a violent hostage situation, with the leader's Kausachun Coca radio station airing footage that showed protesting union members and soldiers negotiating calmly while munching on coca leaves. 'Please, it’s not a take-over of military barracks,' Morales said. 'They are vigils until their economic and political demands are met.' Del Castillo, the minister, said Sunday that the government is, in principle, open to negotiation with Morales. But he said authorities didn’t trust his motives. 'Morales doesn’t care about the country, he cares about himself. He is looking for new confrontations,' said Del Castillo. 'Morales has a whole script to destabilize the government.' The surge in tensions comes against the backdrop of a bitter rift at the highest rungs of Bolivia’s long-dominant Movement Toward Socialism party, which deepened last month when authorities announced their intention to arrest Morales on charges that he fathered a daughter with a 15-year-old girl in 2016 when he was 56 years old and president. Morales and his supporters have decried the case as a political witch hunt aimed at blocking his candidacy in the 2025 election. Arce insists that the current constitution — which permits just two consecutive terms — forbids Morales, who held power from 2006-2019, from running next year, anyway. 'It is a betrayal of the people, of the party activists, of the revolution,' Morales said of Arce's efforts to undercut him. In neighboring Argentina, the government of far-right President Javier Milei on Saturday announced it had lodged a complaint accusing Morales of child abuse committed during the former president’s monthslong political exile in Argentina, from 2019 to 2020. At that time, allegations of election fraud sparked mass protests that led Morales to resign under pressure from the military and flee to Mexico before seeking asylum in Argentina — an ouster that Morales and his supporters view as a coup. Now, years later, Morales — who continues to evince intense support from the Indigenous population — has seized upon growing discontent with his chosen successor. 'It’s not that I, Evo, want to be president, the people have asked me to return,' Morales said. 'During my administration there was stability. When there is economic and political stability, there is happiness.' Many in the country have soured on Arce over the collapse of Bolivia’s once-growing economy built on cheap dollars and fuel. They look back fondly on the tenure of Morales, credited with lifting millions out of poverty and drastically narrowing Bolivia's wealth divide during the nation's natural gas boom. 'Now with more experience, we are ready to save Bolivia,' Morales said, promising he would revive the flailing economy by having Bolivia join BRICS, a group of emerging economies seeking to counter Western dominance of the world order, and collaborating more closely with China. The former president, now 65, isn't sure how long his hunger strike will last. But he said he's prepared for the deprivation. 'I do a lot of sports,' Morales said. 'Today I woke up at 4 a.m. and did 1,015 sit-ups.' ___ DeBre reported from Buenos Aires, Argentina.

Weather system in southwestern Caribbean expected to strengthen and head northward this week	MIAMI (AP) — A weather system in the southwestern Caribbean is expected to develop and strengthen this week, prompting a tropical storm warning for Jamaica and a hurricane watch for the Cayman Islands to be issued Sunday, the National Hurricane Center in Miami said. The system also could bring heavy rainfall to Cuba and Florida as well as the northern coast of the Gulf of Mexico later this week, the center said. At 4 p.m. EST Sunday, the system was located about 345 miles (555 kilometers) south of Kingston, Jamaica, with maximum sustained winds of 35 mph (55kph), the center said. It was moving to the northeast at 7 mph (11 kph), with a turn to the north and then northwest expected. It was expected to become a tropical storm Monday with steady strengthening forecast. A tropical storm is defined as having maximum sustained winds of 39 mph (62.8 kph) up to 73 mph (117.5 kph). Hurricane-force winds are 74 miles (119.1 kph) and greater. The disturbance was expected to be near Jamaica by late Monday and the Cayman Islands on Tuesday and Wednesday, according to the hurricane center, which urged residents in Cuba and the Florida Keys to monitor the storm's progress. Heavy rainfall will affect the western Caribbean with totals of 3 to 6 inches (76 to 152 mm), and up to 9 inches (229 mm) expected locally in Jamaica and southern Cuba. Flooding and mudslides are possible in those nations. Heavy rains will reach Florida and adjacent areas of the southeast U.S. by mid- to late-week, the center said.	https://apnews.com/article/tropical-weather-caribbean-jamaica-cuba-florida-069e5fe8d494135771a752345704705f	2024-11-03T12:59:20-08:00	
Dani Olmo leads Barcelona to city derby win over Espanyol	MADRID (AP) — Dani Olmo made the most out of his return as a starter with Barcelona, scoring twice to lead the Catalan club to a 3-1 win over Espanyol in the city derby on Sunday in the Spanish league. Raphinha also scored for Barcelona, which a week ago had routed Real Madrid 4-0 in the clasico at the Santiago Bernabeu Stadium. Barcelona is now nine points ahead of Madrid, whose game at Valencia on Saturday was postponed because of the deadly floods that killed more than 200 people in southern Spain last week. The game between Villarreal and Rayo Vallecano also was postponed, as were three second-division games scheduled to be played in the region this weekend. The victory extended Barcelona's 27-match unbeaten streak against Espanyol in the league. Espanyol, sitting in 17th place, has lost six of its last seven league matches. Olmo scored his double in his return as a starter after hurting his right hamstring on Sept. 15 against Girona. He had come off the bench in the team's wins against Bayern Munich in the Champions League and Madrid in the Spanish league. 'I was excited about coming back,' Olmo said. 'I'm feeling well. It was important to keep winning.' He put Barcelona ahead in the 12th minute from close range after a neat cross by Lamine Yamal with the outside of his left foot. Olmo's second goal came with a strike from outside the area in the 31st. In his first season with Barcelona, Olmo now has five goals in five matches. Raphinha added to the lead in the 23rd by redirecting the ball into the net with one touch after Marc Casadó's long cross into the area. Barcelona has outscored its league opponents 40-11 in 12 matches. Madrid has the second-best attack with 21 goals scored. 'We are a team that can score a lot, not only with our strikers but also with the players in the second line,' Olmo said. 'We play very direct and create many opportunities.' Espanyol thought it had moved closer in the 27th but Jofre Carrera's goal was called off after video review because of offside. It also had a goal by Álvaro Tejero disallowed for offside in the 58th, then Javi Puado finally scored a goal that counted in the 63rd. Barcelona also had a goal called off in stoppage time. Before the match, Barcelona honored those who received awards at the Ballon d'Or ceremony last week, including Yamal, who earned the Kopa Trophy award for best Under-21 player, and Aitana Bonmatí, who won the award for the world’s best woman soccer player. Barcelona also won the best women’s team prize. There was also a moment of silence in honor of the flood victims, as has taken place in all league matches this weekend. Simeone's son scores Giuliano Simeone, son of Atletico Madrid coach Diego Simeone, scored his first goal with the club in the team's 2-0 win against Las Palmas. The goal came more than 20 years after Simeone's last league goal with the club as a player. Alexander Sorloth netted Atletico's second goal on Sunday, helping move the club back to third place, 10 points behind Barcelona. ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer	https://apnews.com/article/barcelona-olmo-spanish-league-scores-simeone-atletico-61dc9876689a5231ad152572c3712e11	2024-11-03T09:37:19-08:00	
Iran’s help has transformed Yemen's Houthi rebels into a potent military force, UN experts say	UNITED NATIONS (AP) — Yemen’s Houthi rebels have been transformed from a local armed group with limited capabilities to a powerful military organization with support from Iran, Iraqi armed groups, Lebanon’s Hezbollah militants and others, U.N. experts said in a new report. The Iranian-backed Houthis have exploited the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza and worked to enhance their status in Iran’s self-described 'Axis of Resistance' to gain popularity in the region and beyond, the experts monitoring sanctions against the Houthis said in the 537-page report to the U.N. Security Council. To support Iranian-backed Hamas militants, whose surprise attacks in southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, sparked the war in Gaza, the Houthis have been attacking vessels in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, disrupting global shipping in a key geopolitical area. Despite Houthi claims that they would target ships linked to Israel, the panel said its investigations revealed the rebels have been targeting vessels indiscriminately. Its analysis of data from the International Maritime Organization, the U.S. and the United Kingdom revealed that at least 134 attacks were carried out from Houthi-controlled areas against merchant and commercial vessels and U.S. and U.K. warships in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden between Nov. 15, 2023, and July 31, 2024. 'The group’s shift to actions at sea increased their influence in the region,' the U.N. experts said. 'Such a scale of attacks, using weapon systems on civilian vessels, had never occurred since the Second World War.' In their attacks, the experts said, the Houthis used a new and previously undisclosed ballistic missile, the Hatem-2. The five-member U.N. panel includes experts on arms, finance, regional affairs, international humanitarian law and armed groups. The experts hail from India, Egypt, Switzerland, Belgium and Cabo Verde. Confidential sources told the panel that the Houthis are coordinating operations with al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula and strengthening ties to the al-Qaida-linked al-Shabab militant group in Somalia. The Houthis have been engaged in a civil war with Yemen’s internationally recognized government, backed by a Saudi-led coalition, since 2014, when they took control of the capital Sanaa and most of the north. Hopes for peace talks to end the war vanished after the Oct. 7, 2023, attacks. The U.N. experts said the Yemen conflict, which started as an internal fight and expanded into a regional confrontation, 'has now escalated into a major international crisis.' According to the experts, the number of Houthi fighters is estimated at 350,000 now, compared with 220,000 in 2022 and 30,000 in 2015. 'The panel observes the transformation of the Houthis from a localized armed group with limited capabilities to a powerful military organization, extending their operational capabilities well beyond the territories under their control,' the report said. The experts said the transformation has been possible due to the transfer of military materiel and training provided by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard’s elite Quds Force, Hezbollah and Iraqi specialists and technicians. Military experts, Yemeni officials and even officials close to the Houthis indicated that the rebel group couldn’t produce complex weapons systems such as ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, surveillance and attack drones, portable air defense systems, and thermal sights, which they have used without foreign support, the U.N. experts said. 'The scale, nature and extent of transfers of diverse military materiel and technology provided to the Houthis from external sources, including financial support and training of its combatants, is unprecedented,' the experts said. The panel said it observed similarities between multiple military items used by the Houthis and those produced and operated by Iran or its allies in the Axis of Resistance, which includes Hezbollah and Hamas and armed groups in Iraq and Syria. It said joint operations centers have been set up in Iraq and Lebanon with Houthi representatives 'aimed at coordinating joint military actions of the Axis of Resistance.' Inside Yemen, the panel said the Houthis have been intensifying military operations against the government. 'The internal military situation is fragile, and any internal or external trigger could lead to the resumption of military confrontations,' it said. The Houthis also have been recruiting large numbers of Yemeni youths and children as well as exploiting Ethiopian migrants, forcing them to join the fight against the government and engage in trafficking narcotics, it said. 'Exploiting high illiteracy rates, particularly in tribal areas, they have reportedly mobilized boys as young as 10 or 11, often despite parental opposition,' they said. 'Recruitment sermons and weekly classes on jihad are reportedly delivered in schools.' Child recruitment reportedly increased after the war in Gaza started and the U.S. and U.K. airstrikes in Yemen, the experts said. Yemen’s government said it received 3,298 reports of child recruitment in the first half of 2024, with youngsters reportedly used as human shields, spies and in combat — and for planting landmines and explosives, reconnaissance and as cooks.	https://apnews.com/article/houthis-yemen-united-nations-sanctions-2368b285b8872d08008998cbb8453a2a	2024-11-03T06:36:40-08:00	
Russia sends nearly 100 drones into Ukraine, as Zelenskyy urges tougher sanctions against Moscow	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Moscow sent 96 drones and a guided air missile into Ukraine overnight into Sunday, Ukrainian officials said. According to Ukraine’s Air Force, 66 drones were destroyed during the overnight barrage, along with the missile. A further 27 drones were 'lost' over various areas, it said, likely having been electronically jammed, while one drone flew into Belarusian airspace. No casualties were reported. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Sunday that Russia had launched around 900 guided aerial bombs, 500 drones and 30 missiles against Ukraine over the past week. Zelenskyy appealed Sunday on X to Ukraine’s allies to provide 'long-range capabilities for our security', saying that these 'attacks would have been impossible if we had sufficient support from the world.' Kyiv is still awaiting word from its Western partners on its repeated requests to use the long-range weapons they provide to hit targets on Russian soil, including for preemptive Ukrainian strikes on camps where North Korean troops are being trained. The Ukrainian President also urged partners to enact 'truly effective sanctions to prevent Russia from importing critical components for drone and missile production'. This appeal followed an address on Saturday, in which he said over 2,000 drones and missiles 'still using Western components' were launched against Ukraine in October, and underlined the need for more stringent export controls to prevent sanctions evasion. In Russia, the Defense Ministry said that 19 Ukrainian drones were shot down overnight into Sunday in three regions of Russia: 16 in the Rostov region, two in the Belgorod region and one in the Volgograd region. A man died Sunday in a Ukrainian drone attack in the Belgorod region, according to regional Gov. Vyacheslav Gladkov.	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-drones-zelenskyy-missiles-3bc28b0e3dcc9c9379957399a7e81d68	2024-11-03T06:13:21-08:00	
Israel investigates leaks that appear to have bolstered Netanyahu as Gaza truce talks stalled	TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — An Israeli court on Sunday loosened a gag order on a case investigating leaks of classified information suspected to involve one of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s media advisers. Critics say the leaks were aimed at giving Netanyahu political cover as Gaza cease-fire talks ground to a halt. Netanyahu has denied any wrongdoing, downplaying the affair and publicly calling for the gag order to be lifted. Netanyahu has said the person in question 'never participated in security discussions, was not exposed to or received classified information, and did not take part in secret visits.' On Sunday, an Israeli court allowed the publication of the name of the central suspect in the case, Eli Feldstein, whom Israeli media said was one of Netanyahu’s media advisers. Israeli media reports say the case concerns the leak of classified information to two European media outlets, allegedly by Feldstein, who may not have been formally employed and did not have security clearance. The media reported Feldstein joined Netanyahu as an adviser weeks after the Oct. 7, 2023 attacks and previously worked as an adviser to far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir. The court did not release the names of three other suspects who are also being investigated in connection with the leak. The leaked documents are said to have formed the basis of a widely discredited article in the London-based Jewish Chronicle — which was later withdrawn — suggesting Hamas planned to spirit hostages out of Gaza through Egypt, and an article in Germany's Bild newspaper that said Hamas was drawing out the talks as a form of psychological warfare on Israel. Israeli media and other observers expressed skepticism about the articles, which appeared to support Netanyahu's demands in the talks and absolve him of blame for their failure. Netanyahu made no mention of the case in a visit to Israel’s northern border with Israel Sunday, according to a video released by his office. The articles came out as Netanyahu was calling for lasting Israeli control over the Philadelphi corridor along the Gaza-Egypt border, a demand that was first made public over the summer. Hamas rejected the demand and accused Netanyahu of deliberately sabotaging the talks, which have been mediated by the United States, Qatar and Egypt. The articles also seemed to provide political cover as Netanyahu faced intense criticism from the families of the hostages and much of the Israeli public, who blame him for the failure to reach a deal. The criticism reached a fever pitch in early September, with mass protests and calls for a general strike, after Hamas killed six hostages as Israeli troops closed in on them. A court document confirmed that an investigation by police, the military and the Shin Bet internal security agency is underway and that a number of suspects have been arrested for questioning. It said the affair poses 'a risk to sensitive information and sources' and 'harms the achievement of the goals of the war in the Gaza Strip.' The leak led to a scandal at the Jewish Chronicle, where prominent columnists resigned in protest over the discredited articles. The London-based newspaper removed the article in question and others by a freelance journalist, saying it was 'not satisfied with some of his claims.' The Bild article suggested Hamas was not serious about the negotiations and was using psychological warfare to stoke Israeli divisions. Netanyahu cited it in a meeting with his Cabinet after it was published. He again defended the article in a statement released over the weekend, saying it had 'exposed the Hamas methods of exerting psychological pressure from home and abroad on the Israeli government and public by blaming Israel for the failure of the talks to release the hostages.' Netanyahu has sought to blame Hamas, whose Oct. 7, 2023, attack into Israel ignited the war, for the failure of the talks. Hamas, which is still holding scores of hostages, has said it will only release them in exchange for a lasting cease-fire, a complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and the release of a large number of Palestinian prisoners. Hamas says those demands have not changed following last month's killing of its top leader Yahya Sinwar, as the United States, Egypt and Qatar seek to restart the negotiations. Netanyahu, often described by critics as image-obsessed, is on trial for corruption in three separate cases, two of which involve accusations that he gave favors to media moguls in exchange for positive coverage. His office has downplayed the latest affair and accused the judiciary of bias, citing the many other leaks over the course of the war. It has also denied the leak in question had any impact on the cease-fire talks. 'The document only helped the effort to return the hostages, and certainly did not harm it,' Netanyahu's office said in a statement Saturday, adding that he only learned about the document when it was publicized. His critics say the allegations are far more serious. Yoav Limor, writing in the pro-Netanyahu daily Israel Hayom, called it 'one of the gravest affairs Israel has ever known.' 'The damage it caused extends beyond the realm of national security and gives rise to suspicion that the prime minister’s bureau acted to scuttle a hostage deal, contrary to the war’s objectives.' ___ Follow AP’s war coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war	https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-netanyahu-leaks-6075c848c8b32c8fd69835434c67046a	2024-11-03T06:01:32-08:00	
Cyprus is committed to expanding defense ties with the US, says its president	NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) — The president of Cyprus said Sunday his administration is committed to expanding defense and security cooperation with the U.S., as his meeting with American President Joe Biden last week charted a course for the 'next ambitious steps' in bilateral relations that are currently at a 'historic high.' President Nikos Christodoulides says his government's 'clear foreign policy orientation' has resulted in deepening the Cyprus-U.S. strategic partnership over the first 18 months of his five-year term in fields including law enforcement cooperation on countering money laundering and sanctions evasion, as well as energy. A centerpiece of that security cooperation is the U.S.-funded center for port and maritime security known by its acronym CYCLOPS where officials from neighboring countries including Libya, Yemen and Lebanon, receive key training ranging from cybersecurity to ship inspections. Christodoulides said his Oct. 30 visit to the White House 'is proof and recognition of the geostrategic role of Cyprus and the country’s potential and capabilities.' 'Cyprus can be a reliable ‘port of stability’ and at the same time a country that has a vision to transform its immediate region, alongside its partners, into a region of promise, stability, cooperation and prosperity,' Christodoulides said in an email response to an Associated Press questionnaire. The Cypriot president said his administration is 'certainly considering' procuring U.S.-made weapons following the 2020 lifting of a decades-long arms embargo. But what must precede such purchases is for the U.S. Congress to lift its embargo for an extended period. Currently, that is renewed annually. Christodoulides said Cyprus’ geostrategic role is highlighted by the fact that since Sept. 27, some 3,635 third-country nationals from 29 countries have been repatriated through the island nation following their evacuation from Lebanon. He said several countries consider Cyprus an 'assisted departure hub and a Temporary Safe Location (TSL)' where the island’s ports, airports and designated temporary accommodations are used for civilian or military-led departures. He did not specify those countries. He said Cyprus is ready to respond if and when a mass evacuation from Lebanon is set in motion. Another key initiative for which Cyprus has gained international plaudits and was singled out by Biden is the so-called Amalthea plan that saw the establishment of the Cyprus-Gaza maritime corridor through which some 20,000 metric tons of aid flowed into the Palestinian territory earlier this year. Most of that aid reached Gaza through a U.S.-built, $230 million temporary pier project that lasted about four months after being beset by turbulent weather, security threats and sweeping personnel restrictions. Christodoulides said work is underway in cooperation with the U.S. the U.K. the United Arab Emirates and the European Union, to re-activate the maritime route to Gaza through the Israeli port of Ashdod. Collected aid will be security-screened in Cyprus and shipped to Ashdod 'for swift onward delivery to Gaza.' 'We maintain excellent, longstanding relations with our neighboring countries, underpinned by trust, and we have consistently acted as the region’s voice in the European Union, and as a reliable interlocutor and partner with all the states of the region,' Christodoulides said. On his decision to invite FBI and U.S. Department of Justice officials to help Cypriot law enforcement to halt Russian sanctions evasion through Cypriot lawyers and accountants, Christodoulides said, 'we are strongly determined to clear our country’s name internationally and prove that Cyprus is a state fully aligned with the principles and values of the West.' He said 'several cases' of possible sanctions evasion are under investigation' and the aim is to bring them to justice as quickly as possible.' Regarding energy cooperation, Christodoulides said the fact that both U.S. energy giants ExxonMobil and Chevron are active in the search for hydrocarbons in Cyprus’ offshore economic zone is 'a vote of confidence' in the island nation. He said next year will be a 'milestone' for both energy companies. ExxonMobil and partner QatarEnergy, which discovered a sizeable natural gas deposit in one of two areas, or blocks, they hold exploration licenses for, are scheduled to drill two additional wells in January of next year. Chevron is expected to complete fine-tuning a revised development plan for its Aphrodite gas field, estimated to hold around 4.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. 'As the first gas from the Aphrodite is directed to the market, this automatically makes Cyprus a gas seller, which is extremely important not only in monetary terms but also for geopolitical reasons,' said Christodoulides.	https://apnews.com/article/cyprus-us-president-biden-security-defense-cooperation-bdc23ad4b351fcc25def1e43cb26bc69	2024-11-03T05:25:44-08:00	
Flood survivors pelt Spain's royals with mud and premier is evacuated during a visit	VALENCIA, Spain (AP) — Spain's King Felipe VI and top government officials were pelted with mud by a crowd of enraged flood survivors during the first visit by the country's leaders Sunday to the epicenter of the nation's deadliest natural disaster in living memory. Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez was evacuated from the scene, according to Spanish broadcaster RTVE, when the official contingent started to walk the mud-covered streets of Paiporta, one of the hardest hit areas where over 60 people perished and thousands of lives were shattered. Police had to step in, with some officers on horseback, to keep back the crowd of several dozens who hurled mud and wielded shovels and poles threateningly. 'Get out! Get out!' and 'Killers!' the crowd shouted among other insults. Bodyguards opened umbrellas to protect the royals and officials from the barrage of muck. After being forced to seek protection, the king, with flecks of mud on his face, remained calm and made several efforts to speak to individual residents. One person appeared to have wept on his shoulder. He shook the hand of a man. 'They knew it, they knew it, and yet they did nothing,' one young man shouted at the king while waving a finger in his face. One young woman swatted a bodyguard with a long pole. It was an unprecedented incident for a royal house that takes great care to craft an image of a monarch who is liked by the nation. But the public rage over the haphazard management of the crisis came to a boil on Sunday. Queen Letizia and regional Valencia President Carlo Mazón were also in the contingent. The queen had small glops of mud on her hands and arms as she spoke to women. 'We don´t have any water,' one woman told the queen. Many people still don’t have drinking water five days after the floods struck. Internet and mobile phone coverage remains patchy. Most people only got power back on Saturday. The neighborhood's stores and supermarkets are in ruins. Paiporta, population 30,000, still has many city blocks completely clogged with piles of detritus, countless totaled cars and a ubiquitous layer of mud. Over 200 people have died from Tuesday’s floods and thousands have had their homes destroyed by the tsunami-like wave. Indignation at the management the disaster started after the initial shock wore off. The floods had already hit Paiporta when the regional officials issued an alert to mobile phones. It sounded two hours too late. And more anger has been fueled by the inability of officials to respond quickly to the aftermath. Most of the cleanup of the layers and layers of mud and debris that has invaded countless homes has been done by residents and thousands of volunteers. 'We have lost everything!' someone shouted. Shouts included demands for Mazón, whose administration is in charge of civil protection, and 'Where is Pedro Sánchez?' Felipe insisted on trying to speak with people as he tried to continue his visit. He spoke to several people, patting two young men on their backs and sharing a quick embrace, with mud stains on his black raincoat. According to a journalist for Spanish broadcaster RTVE who was near Felipe, one woman wept and told him she didn’t have food or diapers while another person said 'don’t abandon us.' But after approximately half an hour of tension, the monarchs got in officials cars and left with a mounted police escort. One woman smacked an official car with an umbrella and another kicked it before it sped off.	https://apnews.com/article/spain-floods-king-protest-mud-a8525bd82cf4cc3fc6273d535cbb9d66	2024-11-03T03:37:57-08:00	
Crashing waves in a hilltop village, a night of terror from Spain's floods	CHIVA, Spain (AP) — Irene Cuevas will never forget the sound of the waves crashing below her apartment’s balcony. If only there had been a flash of lightning in the darkness to let her glimpse what sounded like a roaring sea. 'It was a constant fear because we didn’t have light to see by,' Cuevas told The Associated Press. 'We could hear the roar of the waves, which was unbelievable. The street was completely flooded and we were hoping for some lightning so that we could at least see what situation we were in. It was all waves, currents everywhere. 'We have that sound of the waves burned in our memory.' The devastating flash floods in eastern Spain this week that claimed over 200 lives and destroyed countless homes and livelihoods also seared a scar of terror in many survivors Cuevas, a 48-year-old embryologist, is a resident of Chiva, a village perched on a hill about 30 kilometers (18 miles) from Valencia city, whose southern outskirts were likewise ravaged by the floods on Tuesday and Wednesday. Chiva got more rain in eight hours than the town had experienced in the preceding 20 months. Cuevas was at home and saw how the gorge dividing her village suddenly overflowed with rushing water. The tsunami-like wall of water claimed at least seven lives in Chiva, home to some 16,000 people, and the search goes on for more missing, either in collapsed houses or in the gorge. 'It was terrifying because that night it began to rain and the water began to overflow the gorge and started carrying away cars and trees,' Cuevas said. 'The underpasses of the bridges started to clog with debris, and the water started to flow through the entire village.' The gorge, called the 'Barranco de Chiva,' is normally dry, but it is fed into by several other runoff gorges and channels water to vineyards below. The huge storm sent a blast of water that knocked down two of the four bridges crossing the gorge, while a third was left unsafe to cross. The sides of the gorge were eaten out, bringing down a sidewalk and several houses and tearing holes in others. Cuevas, who moved to Chiva when she got married 18 years ago, lives one street over from the buildings bordering the gorge. She and other people living in her apartment building helped several neighbors from the building in front when they feared it would come down. The neighbors said their building trembled from the force of the water. Cuevas and her fellow residents helped tie ropes or cords across the street so that the people on the other side could hang on as they waded through the rushing water. They then made it up the stairs and some 20 people spent a sleepless night in her second-floor apartment and the apartment above. Amparo Cerda, Cuevas' upstairs neighbor, described herself as traumatized by her memories of the fury of the waves and the sound of 'doors exploding' from the water’s force. It was as if their building had become a ship lost in a storm at sea in the pitch black night. 'There were waves in the gorge, waves in the street below where the water came in the other direction and ran into the water coming from the gorge,' Cuevas said. 'So right here, at this corner, just where the houses fell down, the two currents hit and produced terrifying waves.' 'When the daylight came we could see the damage,' Cuevas said. 'We saw all the houses that had disappeared and there was a feeling of impotence because you didn’t know where to start looking for people.' Five days have passed since that night of terror, and in Chiva and other localities, such as Paiporta, Barrio de la Torre, and Massanassa, citizens and volunteers are pitching in to clean up the mountains of debris and the thick brown layers of mud left by the water. Five thousand more soldiers are arriving in the area this weekend to help the 2,500 already deployed. Thousands of police officers have also been sent in. But for now it is the people themselves still leading the way. 'Now we need to clean up and try to get back to normal because there are more rains forecast for the weekend, and that won’t help,' Cuevas said. 'We are trying to get everything ready for when the rains comes back. Because they will.'	https://apnews.com/article/spain-floods-valencia-chiva-edcef9ff9430d0d35e2f464b068cec7d	2024-11-03T02:33:32-08:00	
A grenade explosion in a busy market in Indian-controlled Kashmir wounds 9	SRINAGAR, India (AP) — An assailant threw a grenade at a marketplace bustling with shoppers in the main city of Indian-controlled Kashmir on Sunday, wounding at least nine people, police said. The attack comes a day after a suspected militant was killed in a daylong gunbattle in Srinagar, a rare occurrence in the city where security is tight. Police said an unidentified attacker hurled a grenade from a flyover bridge, apparently targeting a stationed paramilitary vehicle, in the main business center of Srinagar, where Sunday's flea market is visited by thousands of people. The grenade exploded in the midst of shoppers and vendors, wounding at least nine, police said. All were taken to a hospital and reinforcements of police and paramilitary soldiers launched a search for the attacker. In the past, Indian authorities have blamed rebels fighting against Indian rule in the disputed region for similar grenade attacks. Rebels have in turn accused government agents of carrying out the attacks to defame their movement. 'There can be no justification for targeting innocent civilians,' Kashmir’s Chief Minister Omar Abdullah wrote on the social media platform X. 'The security apparatus must do everything possible to end this spurt of attacks at the earliest so that people can go about their lives without any fear.' India and Pakistan each administer a part of Kashmir, but both claim the territory in its entirety. The nuclear-armed rivals have fought two of their three wars over the territory since they gained independence from British colonial rule in 1947. Militants in the Indian-controlled portion of Kashmir have been fighting New Delhi’s rule since 1989. Many Muslim Kashmiris support the rebels’ goal of uniting the territory, either under Pakistani rule or as an independent country. India insists the Kashmir militancy is Pakistan-sponsored terrorism. Pakistan denies the charge, and many Kashmiris consider it a legitimate freedom struggle. Tens of thousands of civilians, rebels and government forces have been killed in the conflict.	https://apnews.com/article/kashmir-india-pakistan-grenade-attack-ffb56c11bde0b124a02440d88cd535bf	2024-11-03T02:01:22-08:00	
Palestinians say Israel struck a Gaza clinic during a polio campaign. The army denies it	CAIRO (AP) — Palestinian officials say an Israeli drone strike on a clinic in northern Gaza where children were being vaccinated for polio wounded six people, including four children. The Israeli military denied responsibility. The alleged strike occurred Saturday in northern Gaza, which has been encircled by Israeli forces and largely isolated for the past year. Israel has been carrying out another offensive there in recent weeks that has killed hundreds of people and displaced tens of thousands. It was not possible to resolve the conflicting accounts. Israeli forces have repeatedly raided hospitals in Gaza over the course of the war, saying Hamas uses them for militant purposes, allegations denied by Palestinian health officials. Dr. Munir al-Boursh, director general of the Gaza Health Ministry, told The Associated Press that a quadcopter struck the Sheikh Radwan clinic in Gaza City early Saturday afternoon, just a few minutes after a United Nations delegation left the facility. The World Health Organization and the U.N. children's agency, known as UNICEF, which are jointly carrying out the polio vaccination campaign, expressed concern over the reported strike. 'The reports of this attack are even more disturbing as the Sheikh Radwan Clinic is one of the health points where parents can get their children vaccinated,' said Rosalia Bollen, a spokesperson for UNICEF. 'Today’s attack occurred while the humanitarian pause was still in effect, despite assurances given that the pause would be respected from 6 a.m. to 4 p.m.' Lt. Col. Nadav Shoshani, an Israeli military spokesman, said that 'contrary to the claims, an initial review determined that the (Israeli military) did not strike in the area at the specified time.' A scaled-down campaign to administer a second dose of the polio vaccine began Saturday in parts of northern Gaza. It had been postponed from Oct. 23 due to lack of access, Israeli bombings and mass evacuation orders, and the lack of assurances for humanitarian pauses, a U.N. statement said. The administration of the first dose was carried out in September across the Gaza Strip, including areas of northern Gaza that are now completely sealed off. Health officials said the campaign's first round, and the administration of the second dose across central and southern Gaza, were successful. At least 100,000 people have been forced to evacuate from areas of north Gaza toward Gaza City in the past few weeks, but around 15,000 children under the age of 10 remain in northern towns, including Jabaliya, Beit Lahiya and Beit Hanoun, which are inaccessible, according to the U.N. The final phase of the polio vaccination campaign had aimed to reach an estimated 119,000 children in the north with a second dose of oral polio vaccine, the agencies said, but 'achieving this target is now unlikely due to access constraints.' They say 90% of children in every community must be vaccinated to prevent the spread of the disease. The campaign was launched after the first polio case was reported in Gaza in 25 years — a 10-month-old boy, now paralyzed in the leg. The World Health Organization said the presence of a paralysis case indicates there could be hundreds more who have been infected but aren’t showing symptoms. The war began on Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting another 250. Israel’s offensive has killed over 43,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza health authorities, who do not say how many were combatants but say more than half were women and children. ___ Follow AP’s war coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war	https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-lebanon-hezbollah-iran-news-11-03-2024-9806fad6404f68737c5192c6fa1c7b9f	2024-11-03T00:07:35-07:00	
Lawmakers are vetting the EU chief's new team. It might be tough but she has the right on her side	BRUSSELS (AP) — Five months after the European Union lurched to the political right, the influence of nationalist and populist parties will go on public display in Brussels on Monday when lawmakers vet the proposed new members of the EU’s increasingly powerful executive branch. Over five days of hearings, the EU parliamentarians will grill 26 top officials — nominated by their national governments — to establish whether they are suitable to lead the next European Commission on policies like agriculture, trade, economic affairs, health or migration. The commission is the only EU body with the power to draft laws which, once passed by the Parliament and the council of member states, apply in all 27 countries of the bloc. They cover everything from water quality to data protection to competition policy. Commission President Ursula von der Leyen assembled her new-look executive in September, seeking to balance sensitive political, geographical and gender concerns within a team that will lead the European project for the next five years. The vast majority of the would-be commissioners come from the right of the political spectrum, mostly the European People’s Party (EPP), a conservative EU-wide political family that counts von der Leyen as a member and is the biggest in the parliament. That should makes things easier for her. Despite that advantage, the EPP has already worked with hard-right groups — including Italian Premier Georgia Meloni’s Brothers of Italy, which has neo-fascist roots, and stridently nationalist lawmakers from Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán's ruling Fidesz — to secure majorities in the European Parliament. Other pro-European parties were weakened in the June 6-9 EU elections and von der Leyen can operate without them. The second-biggest group — the center-left Socialists and Democrats — seems ready to rubber-stamp her team. Its leaders say it does not have a 'kill list' of nominees that it intends to remove. A commission that's hard to ignore The commission is akin to a government cabinet, with commissioners instead of ministers. But it proposes laws that influence all aspects of the lives of around 450 million people in the 27 countries that make up the world’s biggest trading bloc. Von der Leyen is the boss of more than 33,000 employees. The commission handles trade talks, sealing agreements with EU partners in the outside world and managing disputes at the World Trade Organization. It’s also a powerful competition watchdog, whose influence has been felt by tech giants like Apple, Google and Meta. Von der Leyen's power is growing. Her team led the European drive to secure COVID-19 vaccines, and whipped up a massive rescue package to help Europe's economies cope with the cost of trying to stop the pandemic spreading. It also helped the EU weather the energy crisis sparked by Russia’s war on Ukraine. New faces to represent Europe on the world stage This is von der Leyen’s second term. More than half the nominees — 14 of them, compared to 10 last time — are from EPP parties, like her. Ten of them are women. Von der Leyen, a German, is keeping Europe's other major powers France, Italy and Spain close by her side. To the disappointment of mainstream parties, she has penciled in Meloni ally Raffaele Fitto as a new executive vice president — one of five — to oversee 'cohesion policy,' which helps finance infrastructure projects with a big slice of the EU’s massive budget. Former French Foreign Minister Stéphane Séjourné was made a VP and secured the industry portfolio. Spanish Socialist Teresa Ribera, another VP, has a powerful post combining the transition toward a green economy and competition policies. Former Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas will be von der Leyen's foreign policy chief. Ultimately, though, they will all answer to the president. The first hurdle: confirmation hearings Nominees are questioned for three hours by the leaders of committees and senior lawmakers most closely linked to their portfolios. The nominees must demonstrate general competence, a commitment to Europe, independence, and good communications skills. Immediately after, an evaluation is made behind closed doors. Candidates must win a two-thirds majority vote. If they fall short, lawmakers can ask additional questions in writing or request a further 90-minute grilling. Some candidates are deemed not good enough. Lawmakers might reject others as a show of strength. Three were vetoed in 2019. Sometimes portfolios are switched among the commissioners, or their responsibilities redefined, to satisfy the parliament’s demands. The vote results should remain secret until the entire hearing process ends on Nov. 12. But given the high political stakes, lawmakers will probably leak the news. Any group that vetoes a candidate risks seeing their own knocked out in revenge. Some appear more at risk than others Von der Leyen's EPP and the hard right ganged up to set the hearing agenda. As a result, the most controversial candidate — Italy's Fitto — is the first of the six VPs to be questioned on the final day of hearings. Any mainstream lawmakers who target him risk seeing their favorite ousted in return. One of the first candidates to make his case will be Glenn Micallef — the socialist nominee for youth, culture and sport — who hails from Malta, the EU's smallest country. He's been branded as a political lightweight, compared to the former ministers and premiers being questioned. His fate could set the tone. Marta Kos, a liberal from Slovenia foreseen as the next enlargement commissioner, is inexperienced too. She's also been criticized for being pro-Russian. Oliver Varhelyi is Orbán's man in Brussels. He's been given the health and animal welfare portfolio. Lawmakers still seethe about a hot mic incident in which he referred to them as 'idiots.' Some doubt the wisdom of putting him in charge of health after Orbán opted for Russian and Chinese-made vaccines rather than join the EU's joint purchasing effort. But voting him down poses risks. Orbán has been at war with the commission and he could simply refuse to name a replacement, blocking the entire process.	https://apnews.com/article/eu-commission-parliament-hearings-leyen-right-fitto-561e8c0abfb4f87c8740c4969984952a	2024-11-02T23:10:28-07:00	
US says Iranian-American held in Iran as tensions high following Israeli attack on country	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — An Iranian-American journalist who once worked for a U.S. government-funded broadcaster is believed to have been detained by Iran for months now, authorities said Sunday, further raising the stakes as Tehran threatens to retaliate over an Israeli attack on the country. The imprisonment of Reza Valizadeh, acknowledged to The Associated Press by the U.S. State Department, came as Iran marked the 45th anniversary of the American Embassy takeover and hostage crisis on Sunday. It also followed Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei threatening both Israel and the U.S. the day before with 'a crushing response' as long-range B-52 bombers reached the Middle East in an attempt to deter Tehran. Valizadeh had worked for Radio Farda, an outlet under Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty that's overseen by the U.S. Agency for Global Media. In February, he wrote on the social platform X that his family members had been detained in an effort to see him return to Iran. In August, Valizadeh apparently posted two messages suggesting he had returned to Iran despite Radio Farda being viewed by Iran's theocracy as a hostile outlet. 'I arrived in Tehran on March 6, 2024. Before that, I had unfinished negotiations with the (Revolutionary Guard's) intelligence department,' the message read in part. 'Eventually I came back to my country after 13 years without any security guarantee, even a verbal one.' Valizadeh added the name of a man who he claimed belonged to Iran's Intelligence Ministry. The AP could not verify if the person worked for the ministry. Rumors have been circulating for weeks that Valizadeh had been detained. The Human Rights Activists News Agency, which monitors cases in Iran, said that he had been detained on arrival to the country earlier this year, but later released. He was then rearrested and sent to Evin prison, where he now faces a case in Iran's Revolutionary Court, which routinely holds closed-door hearings in which defendants face secret evidence, the agency reported. Valizadeh had faced arrest in 2007 as well, it said. The State Department told the AP that it was 'aware of reports that this dual U.S.-Iranian citizen has been arrested in Iran' when asked about Valizadeh. 'We are working with our Swiss partners who serve as the protecting power for the United States in Iran to gather more information about this case,' the State Department said. 'Iran routinely imprisons U.S. citizens and other countries’ citizens unjustly for political purposes. This practice is cruel and contrary to international law.' Iran has not acknowledged detaining Valizadeh. Iran's mission to the United Nations did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Voice of America, another U.S. government-funded media outlet overseen by the Agency for Global Media, first reported the State Department was acknowledging Valizadeh's detention in Iran. Since the 1979 U.S. Embassy crisis, which saw dozens of hostages released after 444 days in captivity, Iran has used prisoners with Western ties as bargaining chips in negotiations with the world. In September 2023, five Americans detained for years in Iran were freed in exchange for five Iranians in U.S. custody and for $6 billion in frozen Iranian assets to be released by South Korea. Valizadeh is the first American known to be detained by Iran in the time since. Meanwhile, Iranian state television aired footage Sunday of different cities across the country marking the anniversary of the embassy takeover. Gen. Hossein Salami, the head of the Guard, also spoke in Tehran, where he repeated a pledge made the day before by Khamenei. 'The resistance front and Iran will equip itself with whatever necessary to confront and defeat the enemy,' he said, referring to the militant groups like Hamas and Lebanon’s Hezbollah backed by Tehran. In Tehran, thousands at the gate of the former U.S. Embassy chanted 'Death to America' and 'Death to Israel.' Some burned flags of the countries and effigies of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. They also carried images of killed top figures of Iran’s allied militant groups including Lebanese Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and Palestinian Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar. The crowd in the state-organized rallies chanted they were ready to defend the Palestinians. — Associated Press writer Nasser Karimi in Tehran, Iran, contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/iran-us-prisoner-israel-hamas-war-lebanon-fe47ab33a4ac29a19ac0177ee06786ef	2024-11-02T22:41:52-07:00	
Moldovans to choose president in decisive runoff overshadowed by fraud and intimidation claims	CHISINAU, Moldova (AP) — Moldovans are casting votes in a decisive presidential runoff Sunday that pits pro-Western incumbent Maia Sandu against a Russia-friendly opponent, as ongoing claims of voter fraud and intimidation threaten democracy in the European Union candidate country. In the first round held Oct. 20, Sandu obtained 42% of the ballot but failed to win an outright majority. She will face Alexandr Stoianoglo, a former prosecutor general, who outperformed polls in the first round with almost 26% of the vote. Polling stations opened Sunday at 7 a.m. local time (0500 GMT) and will close at 9 p.m. (1900 GMT). A poll released by research company iData indicates a tight race that leans toward a narrow Sandu victory, an outcome that might rely on Moldova’s large diaspora. The presidential role carries significant powers in areas such as foreign policy and national security and has a four-year term. Moldova's diaspora played a key role in a nationwide referendum also held on Oct. 20, when a narrow majority of 50.35% voted to secure Moldova's path toward EU membership. But the results of the ballots including Sunday's vote have been overshadowed by allegations of a major vote-buying scheme and voter intimidation. Instead of winning the overwhelming support that Sandu had hoped, the results in both races exposed Moldova’s judiciary as unable to adequately protect the democratic process. On Friday, Moldova’s Prime Minister Dorin Recean said that people throughout the country were receiving 'anonymous death threats via phone calls' in what he called 'an extreme attack' to scare voters in the former Soviet republic, which has a population of about 2.5 million people. 'These acts of intimidation have only one purpose: to create panic and fear,' Recean said in a statement posted on social media. 'I assure you that state institutions will ensure order and protect citizens.' Outside a polling station on Sunday in Romania’s capital, Bucharest, 20-year-old medical student Silviana Zestrea said the runoff would be a 'definitive step' toward Moldova’s future. 'People need to understand that we have to choose a true candidate that will fulfill our expectations,' she said. 'Because I think even if we are a diaspora now, none of us actually wanted to leave.' In the wake of the two October votes, Moldovan law enforcement said that a vote-buying scheme was orchestrated by Ilan Shor, an exiled oligarch who lives in Russia and was convicted in absentia last year of fraud and money laundering. Shor denies any wrongdoing. Prosecutors say $39 million was paid to more than 130,000 recipients through an internationally sanctioned Russian bank to voters between September and October. Anticorruption authorities have conducted hundreds of searches and seized over $2.7 million (2.5 million euros) in cash as they attempt to crack down. In one case in Gagauzia, an autonomous part of Moldova where only 5% voted in favor of the EU, a physician was detained after allegedly coercing 25 residents of a home for older adults to vote for a candidate they did not choose. Police said they obtained 'conclusive evidence,' including financial transfers from the same Russian bank. On Saturday at a church in Comrat, the capital of Gagauzia, Father Vasilii told the Associated Press that he's urged people to go and vote because it's a 'civic obligation' and that they do not name any candidates. 'We use the goods the country offers us — light, gas,' he said. 'Whether we like what the government does or not, we must go and vote. ... The church always prays for peace.' On Thursday, prosecutors also raided a political party headquarters and said 12 people were suspected of paying voters to select a candidate in the presidential race. A criminal case was also opened in which 40 state agency employees were suspected of taking electoral bribes. Cristian Cantir, a Moldovan associate professor of international relations at Oakland University, told the AP that whatever the outcome of the second round, it 'will not deflate' geopolitical tensions. 'On the contrary, I expect geopolitical polarization to be amplified by the campaign for the 2025 legislative elections,' he said. Moldovan law enforcement needs more resources and better-trained staff working at a faster pace to tackle voter fraud, he added, to 'create an environment in which anyone tempted to either buy or sell votes knows there will be clear and fast consequences.' Savlina Adasan, a 21-year-old economics student in Bucharest, says she voted for Sandu and cited concerns about corruption and voters uninformed about the two candidates. 'We want a European future for our country,' she said, adding that it offers 'many opportunities, development for our country … and I feel like if the other candidate wins, then it means that we are going ten steps back as a country.' A pro-Western government has been in power in Moldova since 2021, and a parliamentary election will be held in 2025. Moldova watchers warn that next year’s vote could be Moscow’s main target. In the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Moldova applied to join the EU. It was granted candidate status in June of that year, and in summer 2024, Brussels agreed to start membership negotiations. The sharp Westward shift irked Moscow and significantly soured relations with Chisinau. Since then, Moldovan authorities have repeatedly accused Russia of waging a vast 'hybrid war,' from sprawling disinformation campaigns to protests by pro-Russia parties to vote-buying schemes that undermine countrywide elections. Russia has denied it is meddling. —— Stephen McGrath reported from Bucharest, Romania; Nicolae Dumitrache from Comrat, Moldova.	https://apnews.com/article/moldova-presidential-election-russia-corruption-fraud-5886447779a4a818e9f30fdadcb8bbe5	2024-11-02T21:07:28-07:00	
Nevada lithium mine will crush rare plant habitat US said is critical to its survival, lawsuit says	RENO, Nev. (AP) — Conservationists and a Native American tribe are suing the U.S. to try to block a Nevada lithium mine they say will drive an endangered desert wildflower to extinction, disrupt groundwater flows and threaten cultural resources. The Center for Biological Diversity promised the court battle a week ago when the U.S. Interior Department approved Ioneer Ltd.’s Rhyolite Ridge lithium-boron mine at the only place Tiehm's buckwheat is known to exist in the world, near the California line halfway between Reno and Las Vegas. It is the latest in a series of legal fights over projects President Joe Biden’s administration is pushing under his clean energy agenda intended to cut reliance on fossil fuels, in part by increasing the production of lithium to make electric vehicle batteries and solar panels. The new lawsuit says the Interior Department’s approval of the mine marks a dramatic about-face by U.S wildlife experts who warned nearly two years ago that Tiehm’s buckwheat was 'in danger of extinction now' when they listed it as an endangered species in December 2022. 'One cannot save the planet from climate change while simultaneously destroying biodiversity,' said Fermina Stevens, director of the Western Shoshone Defense Project, which joined the center in the lawsuit filed Thursday in federal court in Reno. 'The use of minerals, whether for EVs or solar panels, does not justify this disregard for Indigenous cultural areas and keystone environmental laws,' said John Hadder, director of the Great Basin Resource Watch, another co-plaintiff. Rita Henderson, spokeswoman for Interior's Bureau of Land Management in Reno, said Friday the agency had no immediate comment. Ioneer Vice President Chad Yeftich said the Australia-based mining company intends to intervene on behalf of the U.S. and 'vigorously defend' approval of the project, 'which was based on its careful and thorough permitting process.' 'We are confident that the BLM will prevail,' Yeftich said. He added that he doesn't expect the lawsuit will postpone plans to begin construction next year. The lawsuit says the mine will harm sites sacred to the Western Shoshone people. That includes Cave Spring, a natural spring less than a mile (1.6 kilometers) away described as 'a site of intergenerational transmission of cultural and spiritual knowledge.' But it centers on alleged violations of the Endangered Species Act. It details the Fish and Wildlife Service's departure from the dire picture it painted earlier of threats to the 6-inch-tall (15-centimeter-tall) wildflower with cream or yellow blooms bordering the open-pit mine Ioneer plans to dig three times as deep as the length of a football field. The mine's permit anticipates up to one-fifth of the nearly 1.5 square miles (3.6 square kilometers) the agency designated as critical habitat surrounding the plants — home to various pollinators important to their survival — would be lost for decades, some permanently. When proposing protection of the 910 acres (368 hectares) of critical habitat, the service said 'this unit is essential to the conservation and recovery of Tiehm’s buckwheat.' The agency formalized the designation when it listed the plant in December 2022, dismissing the alternative of less-stringent threatened status. 'We find that a threatened species status is not appropriate because the threats are severe and imminent, and Tiehm’s buckwheat is in danger of extinction now, as opposed to likely to become endangered in the future,' the agency concluded. The lawsuit also discloses for the first time that the plant's population, numbering fewer than 30,000 in the government's latest estimates, has suffered additional losses since August that were not considered in the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's biological opinion. The damage is similar to what the bureau concluded was caused by rodents eating the plants in a 2020 incident that reduced the population as much as 60%, the lawsuit says. The Fish and Wildlife Service said in its August biological opinion that while the project 'will result in the long-term disturbance (approximately 23 years) of 146 acres (59 hectares) of the plant community ... and the permanent loss of 45 acres (18 hectares), we do not expect the adverse effects to appreciably diminish the value of critical habitat as a whole.'	https://apnews.com/article/climate-lithium-mine-endangered-species-energy-nevada-2b61e65f6d06ec1e1517a03364c34d4f	2024-11-02T20:58:04-07:00	
US flies long-range bomber in drill with South Korea, Japan in reaction to the North's missile test	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — The United States flew a long-range bomber in a trilateral drill with South Korea and Japan on Sunday in response to North Korea’s recent test-firing of a new intercontinental ballistic missile designed to strike the U.S. mainland, South Korea’s military said. North Korea on Thursday tested the newly developed Hwasong-19 ICBM, which flew higher and stayed in the air longer than any other missile it has fired. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un called it 'an appropriate military action' to cope with external security threats posed by its rivals. On Sunday, the U.S. flew the B-1B bomber to train with South Korean and Japanese fighter jets near the Korean Peninsula, demonstrating the three countries’ firm resolve and readiness to respond to North Korea’s advancing nuclear and missile programs, South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a statement. The trilateral aerial training was the second by South Korea, the U.S. and Japan this year, the statement said. The U.S. often responds to major North Korean missile tests with temporary deployments of some of its powerful military assets such as long-range bombers, aircraft carriers and nuclear-powered submarines to and near the Korean Peninsula. North Korea typically responds angrily to such U.S. actions, calling them part of a U.S.-led plot to invade the North and performing additional weapons tests. The U.S. has flown the B-1B bomber over or near the Korean Peninsula four times this year, according to South Korea’s military. A B-1B is capable of carrying a large conventional weapons payload. Thursday's Hwasong-19 test, North Korea's first ICBM test-firing in almost a year, showed progress in North Korea’s missile program. But many experts say North Korea still has some technological issues to master to acquire functioning ICBMs that can deliver nuclear strikes on the U.S. mainland. The experts say the Hwasong-19 shown in North Korea’s state media photos and videos looked too big to be useful in a war. The ICBM test was seen as an effort to grab American attention ahead of the U.S. presidential election this week and respond to international condemnation of North Korea's reported dispatch of thousands of troops to Russia to support its war against Ukraine, observers say.	https://apnews.com/article/us-bomber-north-korea-missile-test-43b568921a7521468167fe30915cd943	2024-11-02T20:41:30-07:00	
Still wrecked from past Israeli raids, hospitals in northern Gaza come under attack again	JERUSALEM (AP) — They were built to be places of healing. But once again, three hospitals in northern Gaza are encircled by Israeli troops and under fire. Bombardment is pounding around them as Israel wages a new offensive against Hamas fighters that it says have regrouped nearby. As staff scramble to treat waves of wounded, they remain haunted by a war that has seen hospitals targeted with an intensity and overtness rarely seen in modern warfare. All three were besieged and raided by Israeli troops some 10 months ago. The Kamal Adwan, al-Awda and Indonesian hospitals still have not recovered from the damage, yet are the only hospitals even partially operational in the area. Medical facilities often come under fire in wars, but combatants usually depict such incidents as accidental or exceptional, since hospitals enjoy special protection under international law. In its yearlong campaign in Gaza, Israel has stood out by carrying out an open campaign on hospitals, besieging and raiding at least 10 of them across the Gaza Strip, some several times, as well as hitting multiple others in strikes. It has said this is a military necessity in its aim to destroy Hamas after the militants’ Oct. 7, 2023 attacks. It claims Hamas uses hospitals as 'command and control bases' to plan attacks, to shelter fighters and to hide hostages. It argues that nullifies the protections for hospitals. 'If we intend to take down the military infrastructure in the north, we have to take down the philosophy of (using) the hospitals,' Israeli military spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said of Hamas during an interview with The Associated Press in January after the first round of hospital raids. Most prominently, Israel twice raided Gaza City’s Shifa Hospital, the biggest medical facility in the strip, producing a video animation depicting it as a major Hamas base, though the evidence it presented remains disputed. But the focus on Shifa has overshadowed raids on other facilities. The AP spent months gathering accounts of the raids on al-Awda, Indonesian and Kamal Adwan Hospitals, interviewing more than three dozen patients, witnesses and medical and humanitarian workers as well as Israeli officials. It found that Israel has presented little or even no evidence of a significant Hamas presence in those cases. The AP presented a dossier listing the incidents reported by those it interviewed to the Israeli military spokesman’s office. The office said it could not comment on specific events. Al-Awda Hospital: ‘A death sentence’ The Israeli military has never made any claims of a Hamas presence at al-Awda. When asked what intelligence led troops to besiege and raid the hospital last year, the military spokesman’s office did not reply. In recent weeks, the hospital has been paralyzed once again, with Israeli troops fighting in nearby Jabalia refugee camp and no food, water or medical supplies entering areas of northern Gaza. Its director Mohammed Salha said last month that the facility was surrounded by troops and was unable to evacuate six critical patients. Staff were down to eating one meal a day, usually just a flat bread or a bit of rice, he said. As war-wounded poured in, exhausted surgeons were struggling to treat them. No vascular surgeons or neurosurgeons remain north of Gaza City, so the doctors often resort to amputating shrapnel-shattered limbs to save lives. 'We are reliving the nightmares of November and December of last year, but worse,' Salha said. 'We have fewer supplies, fewer doctors and less hope that anything will be done to stop this.' The military, which did not respond to a specific request for comment on al-Awda hospital, says it takes all possible precautions to prevent civilian casualties. Last year, fighting was raging around al-Awda when, on Nov. 21, a shell exploded in the facility's operating room. Dr. Mahmoud Abu Nujaila, two other doctors and a patient’s uncle died almost instantly, according to international charity Doctors Without Borders, which said it had informed the Israeli military of its coordinates. Dr. Mohammed Obeid, Abu Nujaila’s colleague, recalled dodging shellfire inside the hospital complex. Israeli sniper fire killed a nurse and two janitors and wounded a surgeon, hospital officials said. By Dec. 5, al-Awda was surrounded. For 18 days, coming or going became 'a death sentence,' Obeid said. Survivors and hospital administrators recounted at least four occasions when Israeli drones or snipers killed or badly wounded Palestinians trying to enter. Two women about to give birth were shot and bled to death in the street, staff said. Salha, the administrator, watched gunfire kill his cousin, Souma, and her 6-year-old son as she brought the boy for treatment of wounds. Shaza al-Shuraim said labor pains left her no choice but to walk an hour to al-Awda to give birth. She, her mother-in-law and 16-year-old brother-in-law raised flags made of white blouses. 'Civilians!' her mother-in-law, Khatam Sharir, kept shouting. Just outside the gate, a burst of gunfire answered, killing Sharir. On Dec. 23, troops stormed the hospital, ordering men ages 15 to 65 to strip and undergo interrogation in the yard. Mazen Khalidi, whose infected right leg had been amputated, said nurses pleaded with soldiers to let him rest rather than join the blindfolded and handcuffed men outside. They refused, and he hobbled downstairs, his stump bleeding. 'The humiliation scared me more than death,' Khalidi said. The hospital’s director, Ahmed Muhanna, was seized by Israeli troops; his whereabouts remain unknown. One of Gaza’s leading doctors, orthopedist Adnan al-Bursh, was also detained during the raid and died in Israeli custody in May. In the wreckage from the November shelling, staff found a message that Abu Nujaila had written on a whiteboard in the previous weeks. 'Whoever stays until the end will tell the story,' it read in English. 'We did what we could. Remember us.' Indonesian Hospital: ‘Patients dying before your eyes’ Several blocks away, on Oct. 18, artillery hit the upper floors of Indonesian Hospital, staff said. People fled for their lives. They'd already been surrounded by Israeli troops, leaving doctors and patients inside without enough food, water and supplies. 'The bombing around us has increased. They’ve paralyzed us,' said Edi Wahyudi, an Indonesian volunteer. Two patients died because of a power outage and lack of supplies, said Muhannad Hadi, the U.N. humanitarian coordinator for Palestinian territories. Tamer al-Kurd, a nurse at the hospital, said around 44 patients and only two doctors remain. He said he was so dehydrated he was starting to hallucinate. 'People come to me to save them. … I can’t do that by myself, with two doctors,' he said in a voice message, his voice weak. 'I’m tired.' On Saturday, the Israeli military said it had facilitated the evacuation of 29 patients from Indonesian and al-Awda hospitals. The Indonesian is Northern Gaza’s largest hospital. Today its top floors are charred, its walls pockmarked by shrapnel, its gates strewn with piled-up rubble — all the legacy of Israel's siege in the autumn of 2023. Before the assault, the Israeli army claimed an underground command-and-control center lay beneath the hospital. It released blurry satellite images of what it said was a tunnel entrance in the yard and a rocket launchpad nearby, outside the hospital compound. The Indonesia-based group that funds the hospital denied any Hamas presence. 'If there’s a tunnel, we would know. We know this building because we built it brick by brick, layer by layer. It’s ridiculous,' Arief Rachman, a hospital manager from the Indonesia-based Medical Emergency Rescue Committee, told the AP last month. After besieging and raiding the hospital, the military did not mention or show evidence of the underground facility or tunnels it had earlier claimed. When asked if any tunnels were found, the military spokesman's office did not reply. It released images of two vehicles found in the compound — a pickup truck with military vests and a bloodstained car belonging to an abducted Israeli, suggesting he had been brought to the hospital on Oct. 7. Hamas has said it brought wounded hostages to hospitals for treatment. During the siege, Israeli shelling crept closer and closer until, on Nov. 20, it hit the Indonesian’s second floor, killing 12 people and wounding dozens, according to staff. Israel said troops responded to 'enemy fire' from the hospital but denied using shells. Gunfire over the next days hit walls and whizzed through intensive care. Explosions sparked fires outside the hospital courtyard where some 1,000 displaced Palestinians sheltered, according to staff. The Israeli military denied targeting the hospital, although it acknowledged nearby bombardment may have damaged it. For three weeks, wounded poured in — up to 500 a day to a facility with capacity for 200. Supplies hadn’t entered in weeks. Bloodstained linens piled up. Doctors, some working 24-hour shifts, ate a few dates a day. The discovery of moldy flour on Nov. 23 was almost thrilling. Without medicines or ventilators, there was little doctors could do. Wounds became infected. Doctors said they performed dozens of amputations on infected limbs. Medics estimated a fifth of incoming patients died. At least 60 corpses lay in the courtyard. Others were buried beneath a nearby playground. 'To see patients dying before your eyes because you don’t have the ability to help them, you have to ask yourself: ‘Where is humanity?’' asked Dergham Abu Ibrahim, a volunteer. Kamal Adwan: ‘This makes no sense’ Kamal Adwan Hospital, once a linchpin of northern Gaza’s health system, was burning on Thursday of last week. Israeli shells crashed into the third floor, igniting a fire that destroyed medical supplies, according to the World Health Organization, which had delivered the equipment just days before. The artillery hit water tanks and damaged the dialysis unit, badly burning four medics who tried to extinguish the blaze, said the hospital’s director, Hossam Abu Safiya. In videos pleading for help over the past weeks, Abu Safiya had fought to maintain his composure as Israeli forces surrounded the hospital. But last weekend, there were tears in his eyes. 'Everything we have built, they have burned,' he said, his voice cracking. 'They burned our hearts. They killed my son.' On Oct. 25, Israeli troops stormed the hospital after what an Israeli military official described as an intense fight with militants nearby. During the battle, Israeli fire targeted the hospital’s oxygen tanks because they 'can be booby traps,' the official said. Israeli forces withdrew after three days, during which Palestinian health officials said nearly all of Kamal Adwan's medical workers were detained, an Israeli drone killed at least one doctor and two children in intensive care died when generators stopped working. Days later, a drone struck Abu Safiya’s son in nearby Jabalia. The 21-year-old had been wounded by Israeli snipers during the first military raid on Kamal Adwan last December. Now he is buried in the yard of the hospital, where just Abu Safiya and one other doctor remain to treat the dozens of wounded pouring in each day from new strikes in Jabalia. The Israeli military said troops detained 100 people, some who were 'posing as medical staff.' Soldiers stripped the men to check for weapons, the military said, before those deemed militants were sent to detention camps. The military claimed that the hospital was 'fully operational, with all departments continuing to treat patients.' It released footage of several guns and an RPG launcher with several rounds it said it found inside the hospital. Kamal Adwan staff say more than 30 medical personnel remain detained, including the head of nursing, who is employed by MedGlobal, an American organization that sends medical teams to disaster regions, and Dr. Mohammed Obeid, the surgeon employed by Doctors without Borders who previously worked at al-Awda Hospital and had moved to Kamal Adwan. The turmoil echoed Israel’s nine-day siege of Kamal Adwan last December. On Dec. 12, soldiers entered and allowed police dogs to attack staff, patients and others, multiple witnesses said. Ahmed Atbail, a 36-year-old who had sought refuge at the hospital, said he saw a dog bite off one man’s finger. Witnesses said the troops ordered boys and men, ranging from their mid-teens to 60, to line up outside crouched in the cold, blindfolded and nearly naked for hours of interrogation. 'Every time someone lifted their heads, they were beaten,' said Mohammed al-Masri, a lawyer who was detained. The military later published footage of men exiting the hospital. Al-Masri identified himself in the footage. He said soldiers staged the images, ordering men to lay down rifles belonging to the hospital guards as if they were militants surrendering. Israel said all photos released are authentic and that it apprehended dozens of suspected militants. As they released some of the men after interrogation, soldiers fired on them as they tried to reenter the hospital, wounding five, three detainees said. Ahmed Abu Hajjaj recalled hearing bursts of gunfire as he made his way back in the dark. 'I thought, this makes no sense — who would they be shooting at?' Witnesses also said a bulldozer lumbered into the hospital compound, plowing into buildings. Abu Safiya, Abu Hajjaj and al-Masri described being held by soldiers inside the hospital as they heard people screaming outside. After the soldiers withdrew, the men saw the bulldozer had crushed tents that previously sheltered some 2,500 people. Most of the displaced had evacuated, but Abu Safiya said he found bodies of four people crushed, with splints from recent treatment in the hospital still on their limbs. Asked about the incident, the Israeli military spokesman’s office said: 'Lies were spread on social media' about troops’ activities at the hospital. It said bodies were discovered that had been buried previously, unrelated to the military’s activities. Later, the military said Hamas used the hospital as a command center but produced no evidence. It said soldiers uncovered weapons, but it showed footage only of a single pistol. The hospital’s director, Dr. Ahmed al-Kahlout, remains in Israeli custody. The military released footage of him under interrogation saying he was a Hamas agent and that militants were based in the hospital. His colleagues said he spoke under duress. The fallout Hagari, the military spokesperson, said hospitals 'provide a life of their own ... to the (Hamas) war system.' He said hospitals were linked to tunnels allowing fighters movement. 'And when you take it, they have no way to move. Not from the south to the north.' Despite often suggesting hospitals are linked to Hamas' underground networks, the military has shown only one tunnel shaft from all the hospitals it raided — one leading to Shifa's grounds. In a report last month, a U.N. investigation commission determined that 'Israel has implemented a concerted policy to destroy the health-care system of Gaza.' It described Israeli actions at hospitals as 'collective punishment against the Palestinians in Gaza.' Some patients now fear hospitals, refusing to go to them or leaving before treatment is complete. 'They are places of death,' Ahmed al-Qamar, a 35-year-old economist in Jabalia refugee camp, said of his fear of taking his children to the hospital. 'You can feel it.' Zaher Sahloul, the president of MedGlobal who has also worked in Gaza during the war, said the sense of safety that should surround hospitals has been destroyed. 'This war has become a scar in the minds of every doctor and nurse.'	https://apnews.com/article/gaza-hospitals-israel-civilians-7f3d7db74304cbe1b12d2b2e950dec82	2024-11-02T20:21:55-07:00	
Japan has grounded its V-22 Osprey fleet again after flight incident	WASHINGTON (AP) — Japan has grounded its fleet of V-22 Osprey aircraft again after an incident last Sunday where one of the hybrid helicopter-aircraft tilted unexpectedly and hit the ground while trying to take off. The V-22 was taking part in the joint U.S. military exercise Keen Sword and carrying 16 passengers, including three U.S. service members. During takeoff it 'became unstable as it swayed from side to side, and the left wing, the lower part of the aircraft came into contact with the ground and part of the aircraft was damaged, so the flight was aborted,' Japan's Ground Self Defense Forces said in a statement. It was the first major incident for Japan's V-22 fleet since an Osprey crash last November killed eight Air Force Special Operations Command service members and led to a months long grounding of the entire fleet in both Japan and the U.S. The aircraft resumed flight operations earlier this year, but the Osprey’s use remains controversial particularly in Okinawa, where residents have questioned its safety record. The Osprey in last Sunday's incident was able to land and no one was injured, however Japan will keep its fleet of more than a dozen V-22s grounded while it investigates the incident, Defense Minister Gen Nakatani told reporters last week. 'We believe there is no safety problem with Ospreys, although ensuring flight safety is a prerequisite for aircraft operations,' Nakatani said. The Pentagon's V-22 joint program office is supporting Japan's investigation into the incident, spokesman Neil Lobeda said Saturday. The V-22 was operating on the Japanese island of Yonaguni during the joint exercise Keen Sword. Yonaguni is only 100 kilometers (62 miles) east of Taiwan. ___ Yamaguchi reported from Tokyo	https://apnews.com/article/pentagon-osprey-crash-5a86751c8dcb33cef91cab1edc34e7ef	2024-11-02T18:45:37-07:00

Nearly 200 families separated by US-Mexico border reunite briefly in annual event	CIUDAD JUAREZ, Mexico (AP) — Nearly 200 families gathered Saturday along a stretch of the U.S.-Mexico border for heartfelt but brief reunions with loved ones they had not seen for years because they live in opposite countries. Tears flowed and people embraced as Mexican families were allowed to reunite for a few minutes at the border with relatives who migrated to the U.S. Adults and children passed over the Rio Grande to meet with their loved ones. This year, the annual event organized by an immigrant rights advocacy group happened three days before the U.S. presidential election, whose monthslong campaigns have focused heavily on immigration and border security. It also took place under increased security, according to the Network in Defense of the Rights of Migrants. 'We did not have barbed wire, we did not have so many soldiers deployed in our community,' said Fernando García, the organization’s director, highlighting the border security changes that the border has seen since the reunions began last decade. 'The barbed wire had to be opened so that the families could have this event.' García said he expects migration into the U.S. to continue regardless of who wins Tuesday’s election. Family reunions, he said, will continue, too. 'Deportation policy, border policy, immigration policy, is separating families in an extraordinary way and is deeply impacting these families,' he told reporters ahead of the event.	https://apnews.com/article/mexico-us-border-family-reunion-immigration-33c6141bee2d0455d433eea785490110	2024-11-02T15:27:43-07:00

Osasuna dedicates soccer win to its coach and to victims of deadly floods in Valencia region	MADRID (AP) — After scoring Osasuna's winning goal, Ante Budimir showed fans a jersey with the words 'Be strong Valencia.' He and his teammates dedicated Osasuna's 1-0 win over Valladolid in the Spanish league on Saturday to the victims of the deadly floods that hit the Valencia region this week, and especially to Osasuna coach Vicente Moreno, who is from the area and a day earlier gave an emotional interview during his news conference. Moreno is from Massanassa, one of the cities affected the most by the floods that killed more than 200 people in southern Spain. He cried while talking about this week's tragedy and those affected by it. The coach was not on the bench during Saturday's match because of a suspension. 'We dedicate the victory to Vicente because he is suffering a lot,' Osasuna assistant coach Daniel Pendín said. 'He deserves it and we dedicate the victory to him.' Two first-division games were postponed on Saturday because of the floods — Real Madrid at Valencia and Villarreal against Rayo Vallecano. Three second-division games scheduled to be played in the region this weekend also had to be moved to a new date. Budimir scored the winner by converting a 19th-minute penalty kick, helping Osasuna move into fourth place with 21 points from 12 matches. Valladolid, which has lost five of its last six league games, stayed second-to-last with eight points. Also Saturday, Girona ended a two-game losing streak in the league with a 4-3 win over Leganes. Miguel Gutiérrez, who scored Girona's first goal, also marked the occasion by displaying a 'Be Strong Valencia' shirt. On Sunday, leader Barcelona hosts Espanyol in the city derby. Fifth-place Atletico Madrid hosts 18th-place Las Palmas and is looking to get back into the top three with a victory. Diego Simeone's team is coming off three straight losses across all competitions. ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer	https://apnews.com/article/osasuna-floods-moreno-girona-spanish-league-42f0b65f8e4a48dbca248cbb26dd1411	2024-11-02T13:31:36-07:00	
Bolivia's government accuses supporters of ex-President Evo Morales of taking 200 soldiers hostage	LA PAZ, Bolivia (AP) — Supporters of former President Evo Morales in Bolivia have taken more than 200 soldiers hostage, the country’s government reported Saturday, as unrest prompted by an abuse investigation of the ex-leader continued for a third week. Bolivia's Foreign Ministry in a statement identified those involved in the hostage taking as members of 'irregular groups' and accused them of also stealing weapons and ammunition. It did not identify the groups, nor did it explain how the soldiers were taken hostage. But a day earlier, President Luis Arce said those protesting and attacking military units were supporters of Morales. Arce characterized the seizing of three military barracks in a coca-growing area in central Bolivia as 'an absolutely reprehensible criminal act that is far from any legitimate social claim of the Indigenous peasant movement.' The conflict broke out three weeks ago when Bolivian prosecutors launched an investigation into accusations that Morales fathered a child with a 15-year-old girl in 2016, classifying their relationship as statutory rape. Morales has refused to testify in court. Morales has been holed up in the rural area of Chapare, in central Bolivia, since reports of a possible warrant for his arrest emerged. Loyalist coca growers have kept watch to prevent his arrest, and supporters have threatened to take over police and military barracks, demanding the closure of the judicial cases against the former president. The Foreign Ministry in its statement Saturday said it is open to dialogue with 'all social sectors of the country' but warned that the process 'cannot be established while the Bolivian people continue to be victims of abuse by these groups who are not interested in the national and popular economy, and who only seek to materialize the personal and electoral interests of a former president.' Last week, 30 police officers were injured and more than 50 protesters were arrested after a standoff between security forces and supporters of Morales. Arce and Morales are in a fierce battle for control of the ruling party, which remains divided between their supporters ahead of the 2025 elections.	https://apnews.com/article/bolivia-protests-evo-morales-luis-arce-investigation-2087c408a202b591f5e0f806cf57c18f	2024-11-02T13:11:26-07:00	
A leader of Mexican folk saint cult 'La Santa Muerte' is killed at an altar to the skeletal figure	MEXICO CITY (AP) — A local leader of the Mexican folk saint cult 'La Santa Muerte' was gunned down at an altar to the skeletal figure late Friday, authorities said. Two other people were killed and eight injured in the attack in the city of Leon, in Guanajuato state, the authorities added. The saint — whose name means roughly 'Holy Death' — is often worshipped by convicts, drug addicts and criminals, along with other people who feel excluded or are experiencing difficulties in life. The saint, who is not recognized by the Roman Catholic church, is usually depicted as a female skeleton, and is supposed to protect her followers from death. But that didn’t work for 'La Madrina Chayo,' a woman considered a leader of the cult in the north-central state of Guanajuato. Prosecutors did not give her real name, in keeping with Mexican law, but the nickname 'La Madrina Chayo' was used by a faith healer also known as 'Chayito.' She, another woman and a boy were shot dead Friday as they prepared the annual Santa Muerte celebration. There was no immediate information on the condition of the eight people, including two children wounded in the shooting attack on the street corner altar. Like Mexico's Day of the Dead holiday, the Santa Muerte is honored on Nov. 1 and 2. Roman Catholic leaders in Mexico have condemned the deity’s connection to violence and the illicit drug trade. Clad in a black nun’s robe and holding a scythe in one hand, Santa Muerte appeals to people seeking all manner of otherworldly help: from fending off wrongdoing and carrying out vengeance to stopping lovers from cheating and landing better jobs. Others seek her protection for their drug shipments and to ward off law enforcement. While the cult may sound ominous, the annual celebrations honoring the Santa Muerte are friendly affairs, with people warmly greeting fellow worshippers and offering them small gifts. For years, Guanajuato has had the highest number of homicides of any state in Mexico because of ongoing turf battles between rival drug cartels.	https://apnews.com/article/mexico-cult-santa-muerte-leader-killed-criminals-violence-64cf13cfba32c7321ebe7303413011a3	2024-11-02T11:41:05-07:00	
With Ohtani and Yamamoto playing, the World Series averaged a record 12.9 million viewers in Japan	LOS ANGELES (AP) — With Shohei Ohtani and Yoshinobu Yamamoto making their first appearance, the World Series averaged 12.9 million viewers in Japan, making it the most-watched Fall Classic in the nation's history. Along with the United States ratings, the five-game series between the Los Angeles Dodgers and New York Yankees had a combined 28.7 million average in the two countries. The Dodgers’ 4-2 victory in Game 2 averaged 15.9 million in Japan, making it the most-watched postseason game in the nation’s history, according to Major League Baseball. Yamamoto was the Dodgers' starting pitcher and allowed only one run and one hit in 6 1/3 innings. Tokyo is 19 hours ahead of New York and 16 hours ahead of Los Angeles, meaning the games started around 9 a.m. on Saturday and Sunday morning in Japan. The games were carried through Fuji TV, NHK BS and J Sports. The Series also delivered record viewership in Canada, Mexico, the Dominican Republic and Taiwan, according to MLB. The World Series averaged 15.8 million viewers in the U.S. on Fox, Fox Deportes and streaming, its best performance since 2017. That is a 67% increase over last year, when the Texas Rangers' victory over the Arizona Diamondbacks in five games averaged only 9.11 million, which was the lowest-recorded Series average. Los Angeles was the top market with a 18.9 rating and 53 share while New York was third with a 12.4 rating and 41 share. San Diego was second at 12.4 and 41. The rating is the percentage of television households tuned in. The share refers to a percentage of the audience viewing it at the time. Fox and FS1 averaged 7.49 million for the postseason, a 42% jump over last year, and its best average in seven years. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb	https://apnews.com/article/world-series-dodgers-yankees-japan-fox-c8051f1171dbcf29be7d4bc8e3aabc18	2024-11-02T08:27:11-07:00	
TGI Fridays files for bankruptcy protection as sit-down restaurant struggles continue	Restaurant chain TGI Fridays filed for bankruptcy protection Saturday, saying it is looking for ways to 'ensure the long-term viability' of the casual dining brand after closing many of its branches this year. The Dallas-based company's Chapter 11 filing in a Texas federal court accelerates a gradual decline for an iconic chain that was once near the center of American pop culture but has seen its customer base dwindle as tastes changed. The company has boasted that its bartenders trained Tom Cruise for his role in the 1988 film 'Cocktail.' Its serving staff's button-filled uniforms, meant to evoke a fun atmosphere, were later parodied in the 1999 satire 'Office Space,' starring Jennifer Aniston. Rohit Manocha, executive chairman of TGI Fridays, said in a statement that the 'primary driver of our financial challenges resulted from COVID-19 and our capital structure.' Sit-down chain restaurants more broadly have faced challenges in recent years as diners choose to get food delivered or visit upscale fast-food chains like Chipotle and Shake Shack. In September a U.S. bankruptcy judge approved a reorganization plan for the seafood chain Red Lobster after years of mounting losses and dwindling customers. Founded in 1965 as a bar on Manhattan's Upper East Side, TGI Fridays expanded over the following decades to become a ubiquitous suburban gathering spot known for its ribs, potato skins topped with cheese and bacon, and a decor bedecked with red stripes and Tiffany-style lamps. Its empire peaked in 2008 with 601 restaurants in the U.S. and a $2 billion business, according to Kevin Schimpf, director of industry research at Technomic. Its sales in the U.S. were $728 million in 2023, down 15% from the prior year, according to Technomic. It now counts 163 restaurants in the U.S., down from 269 last year. It closed 36 in January and dozens more in the past week. TGI Fridays Inc. said it only owns and operates 39 restaurants in the U.S., which is just a small fraction of the 461 TGI Fridays-branded restaurants around the world. A separate entity, TGI Fridays Franchisor, owns the intellectual property and has franchised the brand to 56 independent owners in 41 countries. Those remain open. During the pandemic TGI Fridays made an effort to expand into the delivery market by making itself a hub for so-called ghost kitchens, which have no storefront and only prepare food for delivery. Among the major creditors owed money by TGI Fridays is the delivery service DoorDash, according to Saturday's bankruptcy court filings.	https://apnews.com/article/tgi-fridays-bankruptcy-5979e002f72f5595a80d12beee5eeef1	2024-11-02T08:11:32-07:00	
Nvidia replaces Intel on the Dow index in AI-driven shift for semiconductor industry	NEW YORK (AP) — Nvidia is replacing Intel on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, ending a 25-year-run for a pioneering semiconductor company that has fallen behind as Nvidia cornered the market for chips that run artificial intelligence systems. Paint-maker Sherwin-Williams will also replace chemical company Dow Inc. among the companies that make up the 30-stock average. S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices said Friday that the changes that take effect Nov. 7 'were initiated to ensure a more representative exposure to the semiconductors industry and the materials sector respectively.' It added that because the Dow is price-weighted, 'persistently lower priced stocks have a minimal impact.' Dow Inc., a major producer of chemicals and plastics and unrelated to the similarly named company behind the index, has also been the smallest company on the Dow in terms of market capitalization. In another index, the Dow Jones Utility Average, Texas-based energy company Vistra will replace Virginia-based AES Corp.	https://apnews.com/article/dow-intel-nvidia-sherwinwilliams-dji-edc5430cad4696c650b5cb2e4fd2d0bf	2024-11-02T06:21:53-07:00	
Who is Kemi Badenoch, the first Black woman to lead Britain's Conservative Party?	LONDON (AP) — The first Black woman to lead a major U.K. political party, Kemi Badenoch is an upbeat and outspoken libertarian who thinks the British state is broken — and that she's the one to fix it with smaller government and radical new ideas. The new leader of Britain’s right-of-center Conservative Party was born Olukemi Adegoke in London in 1980 to well-off Nigerian parents — a doctor and an academic — and spent much of her childhood in the West African country. She has said that the experience of Nigeria’s economic and social upheavals shaped her political outlook. 'I grew up somewhere where the lights didn’t come on, where we ran out of fuel frequently despite being an oil-producing country,' Badenoch told the BBC last week. 'I don’t take what we have in this country for granted,' she said. 'I meet a lot of people who assume that things are good here because things are good here and they always will be. They don’t realize just how much work and sacrifice was required in order to get that.' Returning to the U.K. aged 16 during a period of turmoil in Nigeria, she worked part-time at McDonalds while completing school, then studied computer systems engineering at the University of Sussex. She later got a law degree and worked in financial services. In 2012, she married banker Hamish Badenoch, with whom she has three children. She was elected to the London Assembly in 2015 and to Parliament in 2017. She held a series of government posts in the 2019-22 government of Prime Minister Boris Johnson, before becoming part of a mass ministerial exodus in July 2022 over a series of ethics scandals that triggered Johnson’s downfall. Badenoch ran unsuccessfully to succeed Johnson, boosting her profile in the process. She was appointed trade secretary in the 49-day government of Prime Minister Liz Truss, and business secretary under Prime Minister Rishi Sunak. She held onto her seat in Parliament in July's national election, which saw the Labour Party win a huge majority and the Conservatives reduced to 121 lawmakers in the 650-seat House of Commons. Like many Conservatives, Badenoch idolizes Margaret Thatcher, the party’s first female leader, who transformed Britain with her free-market policies in the 1980s. Citing her engineering background as evidence she’s a problem-solver, she depicts herself as a disruptor, arguing for a low-tax, free-market economy and pledging to 'rewire, reboot and reprogram' the British state. A critic of multiculturalism and self-proclaimed enemy of wokeness, Badenoch is an opponent of 'identity politics,' gender-neutral bathrooms and government plans to reduce U.K. carbon emissions. Supporters think her charismatic, outspoken style is just what the Conservative Party needs to come back from its worst-ever election defeat. During her leadership campaign, her backers wore T-shirts urging: 'Be more Kemi.' Critics say Badenoch has clashed with colleagues and civil servants and has a tendency to make rash statements and provoke unnecessary fights. During the leadership campaign she drew criticism for saying that 'not all cultures are equally valid,' and for suggesting that maternity pay was excessive — though she later backtracked on that claim. 'I do speak my mind,' she told the BBC. 'And I tell the truth.'	https://apnews.com/article/uk-conservative-leader-kemi-badenoch-profile-bd73343d5508fc7aa936471629f5730b	2024-11-02T06:07:06-07:00	
Patty to bring heavy rain to the Azores; Tropical Storm Lane to dissipate without threatening land	MIAMI (AP) — A storm system will likely bring heavy rain to the Azores islands over the weekend, the National Hurricane Center in Miami said Saturday. Subtropical Storm Patty is expected to produce rainfall amounts of 1 to 2 inches (about 2.5 to 5 centimeters) across the archipelago through Sunday. The Hurricane Center says swells generated by Patty are likely to cause dangerous surf and rip current conditions. Patty is clocking maximum sustained winds of nearly 50 mph (about 80 kph) with higher gusts. The Azores are an island chain are located about 800 miles (about 1,287 kilometers) off Portugal. Separately, a tropical storm formed over the Pacific Ocean early Saturday but remained far off the coast of Mexico. Tropical Storm Lane was located about 1,525 miles (2,455 kilometers) west-southwest off the southern tip of the Baja California Peninsula, the National Hurricane Center in Miami reported in an advisory early Saturday. There were no immediate coastal watches or warnings in effect. The storm is expected to begin weakening on Sunday.	https://apnews.com/article/tropical-storm-lane-pacific-834013c82700494c9414138b160f56ea	2024-11-02T03:46:00-07:00	
Ukraine's Zelenskyy urges allies to act before North Korean troops reach the front	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy urged its allies to stop 'watching' and take steps before North Koreans troops deployed in Russia reach the battlefield. Zelenskyy raised the prospect of a preemptive Ukrainian strike on camps where the North Korean troops are being trained, and said Kyiv knows their location. But he said Ukraine can’t do it without permission from allies to use Western-made long-range weapons to hit targets deep inside Russia. 'But instead … America is watching, Britain is watching, Germany is watching. Everyone is just waiting for the North Korean military to start attacking Ukrainians as well,' Zelenskyy said in a post late Friday on the Telegram messaging app. The Biden administration said Thursday that some 8,000 North Korean soldiers are now in Russia’s Kursk region near Ukraine’s border and are preparing to help the Kremlin fight against Ukrainian troops in the coming days. On Saturday, Ukraine's military intelligence said that more than 7,000 North Koreans equipped with Russian gear and weapons had been transported to areas near Ukraine. The agency, known by its acronym GUR, said that North Korean troops were being trained at five locations in Russia's Far East. It did not specify its source of information. Western leaders have described the North Korean troop deployment as a significant escalation that could also jolt relations in the Indo-Pacific region, and open the door to technology transfers from Moscow to Pyongyang that could advance the threat posed by North Korea’s nuclear weapons and missile program. North Korean Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui met with her Russian counterpart in Moscow in Friday. Ukrainian leaders have repeatedly said they need permission to use Western weapons to strike arms depots, airfields and military bases far from the border to motivate Russia to seek peace. In response, U.S. defense officials have argued that the missiles are limited in number, and that Ukraine is already using its own long-range drones to hit targets farther into Russia. Moscow has also consistently signaled that it would view any such strikes as a major escalation. President Vladimir Putin warned on Sept. 12 that Russia would be 'at war' with the U.S. and NATO states if they approve them. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-north-korea-troops-912e5e54ad3170bd77580405c6f97018	2024-11-02T03:40:44-07:00	
UK Conservatives pick Kemi Badenoch as new leader, first Black woman to head a big British party	LONDON (AP) — Britain’s Conservative Party on Saturday elected outspoken lawmaker Kemi Badenoch as its new leader as it tries to rebound from a crushing election defeat that ended 14 years in power. The first Black woman to lead a major British political party, Badenoch (pronounced BADE-enock) defeated rival candidate Robert Jenrick in a vote of almost 100,000 members of the right-of-center Conservatives. She got 53,806 votes in the online and postal ballot of party members, to Jenrick's 41,388. Badenoch replaces former Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, who in July led the Conservatives to their worst election result since 1832. The new leader’s daunting task is to try to restore the party’s reputation after years of division, scandal and economic tumult, hammer Labour Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s policies on key issues including the economy and immigration, and return the Conservatives to power at the next election, due by 2029. 'The task that stands before us is tough but simple,' Badenoch said in a victory speech to a roomful of Conservative lawmakers, staff and journalists in London. She said the party's job was to hold the Labour government to account, and to craft pledges and a plan for government. Addressing the party's election drubbing, she said 'we have to be honest — honest about the fact that we made mistakes, honest about the fact that we let standards slip.' 'The time has come to tell the truth, to stand up for our principles, to plan for our future, to reset our politics and our thinking, and to give our party, and our country, the new start that they deserve,' Badenoch said. A business secretary in Sunak's government, Badenoch was born in London to Nigerian parents and spent much of her childhood in the West African country. The 44-year-old former software engineer depicts herself as a disruptor, arguing for a low-tax, free-market economy and pledging to 'rewire, reboot and reprogram' the British state. Like her rival Jenrick, she has criticized multiculturalism and called for lower immigration, though unlike him she has not demanded that Britain leave the European Convention on Human Rights. A self-proclaimed enemy of wokeness Badenoch opposes identity politics, gender-neutral bathrooms and government plans to reduce U.K. carbon emissions. During the leadership campaign she drew criticism for saying that 'not all cultures are equally valid,' and for suggesting that maternity pay was excessive. Tim Bale, professor of politics at Queen Mary University of London, said the Conservative Party was likely to 'swing towards the right both in terms of its economic policies and its social policies' under Badenoch. He predicted Badenoch would pursue 'what you might call the boats, boilers and bathrooms strategy .... focusing very much on the trans issue, the immigration issue and skepticism about progress towards net zero.' While the Conservative Party is unrepresentative of the country as a whole — its 132,000 members are largely affluent, older white men – its upper echelons have become markedly more diverse. Badenoch is the Tories’ fourth female leader, after Margaret Thatcher, Theresa May and Liz Truss, all of whom became prime minister. She’s the second Conservative leader of color, after Sunak, and the first with African roots. The center-left Labour Party, in contrast, has only ever been led by white men. In a leadership contest that lasted more than three months, Conservative lawmakers reduced the field from six candidates in a series of votes before putting the final two to the wider party membership. Both finalists came from the right of the party, and argued they could win voters back from Reform U.K., the hard-right, anti-immigrant party led by populist politician Nigel Farage that has eaten away at Conservative support. But the party also lost many voters to the winning party, Labour, and to the centrist Liberal Democrats, and some Conservatives worry that tacking right will lead the party away from public opinion. Starmer's government has had a rocky first few months in office, beset by negative headlines, fiscal gloom and a plummeting approval rating. But Bale said that the historical record suggests the odds are against Badenoch leading the Conservatives back to power in 2029. 'It’s quite unusual for someone to take over when a party gets very badly beaten and manage to lead it to election victory,' he said. 'However, Keir Starmer did exactly that after 2019. So records are there to be broken.' ___ This story has been corrected to say Badenoch is the fourth female Conservative leader, not the third.	https://apnews.com/article/uk-conservative-party-new-leader-elected-b2300368b66deb930dce1d9068ba0770	2024-11-02T03:14:35-07:00	
Attack on central Israel injures 11 as Iran's leader promises a punishing response	JERUSALEM (AP) — An attack on a central Israeli town early Saturday injured 11 people as Iran's supreme leader vowed a punishing response to Israel's attack last week. The predawn strike on Tira, which followed air raid sirens across central Israel, was one of several barrages fired from Lebanon early in the day. Many of the projectiles were intercepted by Israeli air defenses, while others landed in unpopulated areas. The Magen David Adom emergency service said 11 people were hurt by shrapnel and glass shards in a direct strike on a building in Tira, a predominantly Israeli Arab town. Three were in moderate condition, while the others suffered milder injuries. Footage showed significant damage to the roof and top floor of the three-story building and cars below. Lebanon’s Iran-backed Hezbollah group said on Saturday that it had used missiles and explosive drones to target military and intelligence facilities in northern and central Israel. It claimed responsibility for firing missiles toward the Israeli military’s Unit 8200 base in Glilot, on the edge of Tel Aviv, and for firing rockets toward military facilities in Zvulun. Hezbollah also said it had targeted central Israel's Palmachim Air Base with explosive drones, saying they 'scored precise hits on targets.' Israel's military did not confirm whether any of the three Hezbollah targets had been hit and said it had no comment on the group's claims. Hezbollah said the Saturday dawn missile attack directed at Glilot was in retaliation for the 'massacres' that are being committed by Israel. Tira, is about 20 kilometers (12.5 miles) from Glilot. Tamar Abdel Hai, a resident of Tira, said that the attack was frightening. 'I call upon all the leaders in the Arab world and the leaders in Israel and to everyone who can help to end this war. It’s enough,' he said. Hezbollah also said that its fighters fired salvos of rockets into northern Israeli towns including Dalton, Yesud HaMa’ala and Bar Yohai. Israeli media showed images of damage reportedly caused by a drone that hit a factory north of Nahariya. The army said several drones crossed from Lebanon into Israel, one was intercepted but 'fallen targets were identified in the area.' Meanwhile, an Israeli airstrike on a southern suburb of Beirut on Saturday afternoon wounded 11 people, the Lebanese Health Ministry said. Israeli planes resumed strikes on on the southern suburb of Dahiyeh overnight Friday, following four day lull in the capital. In a separate incident, a Lebanese ship captain was taken away by a group of armed men who landed on a coast north of Beirut, Lebanese authorities said Saturday. Officials said the incident occurred Friday at dawn and authorities are investigating whether Israel was involved. There has been no immediate Israeli comment on the matter. In the past, Israel has carried out commando operations deep inside Lebanon to kidnap or kill Hezbollah and Palestinian officials. Iran threatens more attacks The early Saturday attacks may be only a precursor to a more severe strike against Israel. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran’s supreme leader, on Saturday threatened Israel and the U.S. with a punishing response over attacks on Iran and its allies following Israel's Oct. 26 airstrikes that targeted Iran's military bases and other locations. 'The enemies, whether the Zionist regime or the United States of America, will definitely receive a crushing response to what they are doing to Iran and the Iranian nation and to the resistance front,' Khamenei said in video released by Iranian state media. A further attack by Iran, which has already launched two direct attacks against Israel this year, could push the wider Middle East closer to a broader conflict. Israel is already battling the Iran-backed militant group Hamas in the Gaza Strip and Hezbollah in Lebanon. The fight against Hezbollah has weakened the group but has also taken a heavy toll on southern Lebanon and other parts of the country. On Friday, Israel launched dozens of intense airstrikes across Lebanon’s northeastern farming villages, killing at least 52 people and wounding scores more, the Lebanese Health Ministry reported. Since the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah erupted in 2023, more than 2,897 people have been killed and 13,150 wounded in Lebanon, according to a Health Ministry update early Friday. United Nations agencies estimate that Israel’s ground invasion and bombardment of Lebanon has displaced 1.4 million people. Residents of Israel’s northern communities near Lebanon, roughly 60,000 people, have also been displaced for more than a year. Israeli strikes in Gaza kill at least 42 people in 24 hours Israel has also stepped up its offensive against Hamas’ remaining fighters in Gaza, raising concerns about humanitarian conditions for civilians still there. A series of Israeli strikes on Nuseirat, a refugee camp in central Gaza, killed at least 42 people, more than a half of them women and children, in 24 hours, Dr. Marwan Abu Naser, director of Al-Awda Hospital that received the casualties, told The Associated Press. A further 150 were wounded, he said. The World Health Organization began a scaled-down polio vaccination campaign on Saturday, giving second doses to at-risk children only in Gaza City after providing first doses in multiple parts of northern Gaza, which has seen intense Israeli bombardment. The second round was initially set to start Oct. 23 but was postponed due to lack of access amid intense Israeli bombing, mass evacuation orders and a lack of assurance about humanitarian pauses. Israel’s war in Gaza has killed more than 43,000 Palestinians since Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas militants killed roughly 1,200 people in Israel and took some 250 hostages back to Gaza. Health officials inside Hamas-run Gaza do not distinguish between civilians and combatants, but say more than half of the dead in the enclave are women and children. ___ Associated Press journalists Bassem Mroue in Beirut, Natalie Melzer in Tel Aviv, Israel, and Shlomo Mor in Tira, Israel, contributed to this report. ___ Follow AP’s war coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war	https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-lebanon-iran-news-11-02-2024-f7a3c3f1d6b6ea2c54615a367ffb6ac1	2024-11-02T02:55:38-07:00	
Spain's government to send 10,000 soldiers and police to Valencia after deadly floods	MADRID (AP) — Spain is sending 5,000 more soldiers and 5,000 more police to the eastern region of Valencia after deadly floods this week that killed at least 211 people, Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez announced Saturday. Most of the victims of Spain’s deadliest natural disaster in living memory are in Valencia, in the east of the country. Rescuers were still searching for bodies in stranded cars and sodden buildings on Saturday, four days after the monstrous flash floods that swept away everything in their path in the east of Spain. An unknown number of people remain missing. Thousands of volunteers are helping to clean up the thick mud that is covering everything in streets, houses and businesses in the hardest-hit towns. At present there are some 2,000 soldiers involved in the emergency work, as well as almost 2,500 Civil Guard gendarmes — who have carried out 4,500 rescues during the floods — and 1,800 national police officers.	https://apnews.com/article/flash-floods-spain-valencia-f52e40c9fdf2af44814617948afdb920	2024-11-02T02:50:37-07:00	
Rescuers end search for survivors after 14 die in canopy collapse in northern Serbia	NOVI SAD, Serbia (AP) — Serbian rescuers stopped searching for survivors on Saturday after pulling out 14 bodies from underneath tons of concrete from a fallen canopy at the entrance of a railway station in the northern city of Novi Sad. Serbia’s government declared Saturday a day of mourning as officials promised a thorough investigation into Friday's collapse of the roof that fell on people sitting below it. The dead included a 6-year-old girl and a citizen of North Macedonia while three people were seriously injured, Interior Minister Ivica Dacic said. Doctors said the injured ranged from 18 to 24 years old and remained in life-threatening condition on Saturday. The train station has been renovated twice in recent years, and critics of Serbia’s populist government attributed the disaster to corruption and sloppy renovations. Members of the opposition planned to protest in front of the station later on Saturday. Officials have insisted that the canopy had not been part of the renovation work. Goran Vesic, the government minister for construction and infrastructure, told the state RTS television the tragedy would not have happened had the canopy been renovated as well. Dacic said some 20 people will be questioned on Saturday as part of the investigation, including Vesic. Authorities deployed heavy machinery and some 80 rescuers who struggled for hours to remove large parts of concrete that crashed just before noon Friday. The rescue effort lasted until late Friday evening. Residents of Novi Sad lit candles and held a vigil for the victims at the site. Many responded to a call to donate blood. 'This morning I drank my coffee in tears. It is hard this has happened in our city,' said Dragica Camber, a resident of Novi Sad, Surveillance camera footage on Friday showed people moving in and out of the building and sitting on benches on a bright, sunny day before the concrete canopy suddenly collapsed. Windows shook on nearby buildings. The railway station, including the canopy, was built in 1964. The renovation work was carried out by Chinese companies. The renovated station was inaugurated by President Aleksandar Vucic and his populist ally, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, over two years ago as a major stopover for a planned fast train line between Belgrade and Budapest.	https://apnews.com/article/serbia-roof-collapse-rescue-mourning-66adec34537a93b2c9b73285a0017511	2024-11-02T01:43:31-07:00	
Iran's supreme leader threatens Israel and US with 'a crushing response' over Israeli attack	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Iran's supreme leader on Saturday threatened Israel and the U.S. with 'a crushing response' over attacks on Iran and its allies. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei spoke as Iranian officials are increasingly threatening to launch yet another strike against Israel after its Oct. 26 attack on the Islamic Republic that targeted military bases and other locations and killed at least five people. Any further attacks from either side could engulf the wider Middle East, already teetering over the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip and Israel’s ground invasion of Lebanon, into a wider regional conflict just ahead of the U.S. presidential election this Tuesday. 'The enemies, whether the Zionist regime or the United States of America, will definitely receive a crushing response to what they are doing to Iran and the Iranian nation and to the resistance front,' Khamenei said in video released by Iranian state media. The supreme leader did not elaborate on the timing of the threatened attack, nor the scope. The U.S. military operates on bases throughout the Middle East, with some troops now manning a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, or THAAD, battery in Israel. The USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier likely is in the Arabian Sea, while Pentagon press secretary Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said Friday that more destroyers, fighter squadrons, tankers and B-52 long-range bombers would be coming to the region to deter Iran and its militant allies. The 85-year-old Khamenei had struck a more cautious approach in earlier remarks, saying officials would weigh Iran’s response and that Israel’s attack 'should not be exaggerated nor downplayed.' Iran has launched two major direct attacks on Israel, in April and October. But efforts by Iran to downplay the Israeli attack faltered as satellite photos analyzed by The Associated Press showed damage to military bases near Tehran linked to the country's ballistic missile program, as well as at a Revolutionary Guard base used in satellite launches. Iran's allies, called the 'Axis of Resistance' by Tehran, also have been severely hurt by ongoing Israeli attacks, particularly Lebanon's Hezbollah and Hamas in the Gaza Strip. Iran long has used those groups as both an asymmetrical way to attack Israel and as a shield against a direct assault. Some analysts believe those groups want Iran to do more to back them militarily. Iran, however, has been dealing with its own problems at home, as its economy struggles under the weight of international sanctions and it has faced years of widespread, multiple protests. After Khamenei's speech, the Iranian rial fell to 691,500 against the dollar, near an all-time low. It had been 32,000 rials to the dollar when Tehran reached its 2015 nuclear deal with world powers. Gen. Mohammad Ali Naini, a spokesman for Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard which controls the ballistic missiles needed to target Israel, gave an interview published by the semiofficial Fars news agency just before Khamenei's remarks were released. In it, he warned Iran's response 'will be wise, powerful and beyond the enemy’s comprehension.' 'The leaders of the Zionist regime should look out from the windows of their bedrooms and protect their criminal pilots within their small territory,' he warned. Israeli air force pilots appear to have used air-launched ballistic missiles in the Oct. 26 attack. Khamenei on Saturday met with university students to mark Students Day, which commemorates a Nov. 4, 1978, incident in which Iranian soldiers opened fire on students protesting the rule of the shah at Tehran University. The shooting killed and wounded several students and further escalated the tensions consuming Iran at the time that eventually led to the shah fleeing the country and the 1979 Islamic Revolution. The crowd offered a raucous welcome to Khamenei, chanting: 'The blood in our veins is a gift to our leader!' Some also made a hand gesture — similar to a 'timeout' signal — given by the slain Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in 2020 in a speech in which he threatened that American troops who arrived in the Mideast standing up would 'return in coffins' horizontally. Iran will mark the 45th anniversary of the U.S. Embassy hostage crisis this Sunday, following the Persian calendar. The Nov. 4, 1979, storming of the embassy by Islamist students led to the 444-day crisis, which cemented the decades-long enmity between Tehran and Washington that persists today.	https://apnews.com/article/iran-khamenei-israel-hamas-lebanon-war-30385c3a17d1fca9415eb37db86dc9c5	2024-11-02T00:48:28-07:00	
Israel's path of destruction in southern Lebanon raises fears of an attempt to create a buffer zone	BEIRUT (AP) — Perched on a hilltop a short walk from the Israeli border, the tiny southern Lebanese village of Ramyah has almost been wiped off the map. In a neighboring village, satellite photos show a similar scene: a hill once covered with houses, now reduced to a gray smear of rubble. Israeli warplanes and ground forces have blasted a trail of destruction through southern Lebanon the past month. The aim, Israel says, is to debilitate the Hezbollah militant group, push it away from the border and end more than a year of Hezbollah fire into northern Israel. Even United Nations peacekeepers and Lebanese troops in the south have come under fire from Israeli forces, raising questions over whether they can remain in place. More than 1 million people have fled bombardment, emptying much of the south. Some experts say Israel may be aiming to create a depopulated buffer zone, a strategy it has already deployed along its border with Gaza. Some conditions for such a zone appear already in place, according to an Associated Press analysis of satellite imagery and data collected by mapping experts that show the breadth of destruction across 11 villages next to the border. The Israeli military has said the bombardment is necessary to destroy Hezbollah tunnels and other infrastructure it says the group embedded within towns. The blasts have also destroyed homes, neighborhoods and sometimes entire villages, where families have lived for generations. Israel says it aims to push Hezbollah far enough back that its citizens can return safely to homes in the north, but Israeli officials acknowledge they don’t have a concrete plan for ensuring Hezbollah stays away from the border long term. That is a key focus in attempts by the United States to broker a cease-fire. Orna Mizrahi, a senior researcher at Israel’s Institute for National Security Studies, said Israel's immediate aim is not to create a buffer zone — but that might change. 'Maybe we’ll have no other choice than staying there until we have an arrangement that promises us that Hezbollah will not come back to the zone,' she said. A path of destruction Troops pushed into southern Lebanon on Oct. 1, backed by heavy bombardment that has intensified since. Using satellite images provided by Planet Labs PBC, AP identified a line of 11 villages — all within 4 miles (6.5 kilometers) of Lebanon's border with Israel — that have been severely damaged in the past month, either by strikes or detonations of explosives laid by Israeli soldiers. Analysis found the most intense damage in the south came in villages closest to the border, with between 100 and 500 buildings likely destroyed or damaged in each, according to Corey Scher of CUNY Graduate Center and Jamon Van Der Hoek of Oregon State University, experts in damage assessments. In Ramyah, barely a single structure still stands on the village’s central hilltop, after a controlled detonation that Israeli soldiers showed themselves carrying out in videos posted on social media. In the next town over, Aita al-Shaab — a village with strong Hezbollah influence — bombardment turned the hilltop with the highest concentration of buildings into a gray wasteland of rubble. In other villages, the damage is more selective. In some, bombardment tore scars through blocks of houses; in others, certain homes were crushed while their neighbors remained intact. Another controlled detonation leveled much of the village of Odeissah, with an explosion so strong it set off earthquake alerts in Israel. In videos of the blast, Lubnan Baalbaki, conductor of the Lebanese Philharmonic Orchestra, watched in disbelief as his parents’ house — containing the art collection and a library his father had built up for years — was destroyed. 'This house was a project and a dream for both of my parents,' he told the AP. His parents’ graves in the garden are now lost. When asked whether its intention was to create a buffer zone, Israel’s military said it was 'conducting localized, limited, targeted raids based on precise intelligence' against Hezbollah targets. It said Hezbollah had 'deliberately embedded' weapons in homes and villages. Israeli journalist Danny Kushmaro even helped blow up a home that the military said was being used to store Hezbollah ammunition. In a television segment, Kushmaro and soldiers counted down before they pressed a button, setting off a massive explosion. Videos posted online by Israel’s military and individual soldiers show Israeli troops planting flags on Lebanese soil. Still, Israel has not built any bases or managed to hold a permanent presence in southern Lebanon. Troops appear to move back and forth across the border, sometimes under heavy fire from Hezbollah. October has been the deadliest month of 2024 for the Israeli military, with around 60 soldiers killed. Attacks on UN peacekeeping troops and the Lebanese Army The bombardment has been punctuated by Israeli attacks on U.N. troops and the Lebanese Army — forces which, under international law, are supposed to keep the peace in the area. Israel has long complained that their presence has not prevented Hezbollah from building up its infrastructure across the south. Israel denies targeting either force. The Lebanese military has said at least 11 of its soldiers were killed in eight Israeli strikes, either at their positions or while assisting evacuations. The peacekeeping force, known as UNIFIL, said its forces and infrastructure have been harmed at least 30 times since late September, blaming Israeli military fire or actions for about 20 of them, 'with seven being clearly deliberate.' A rocket likely fired by Hezbollah or an allied group hit UNIFIL’s headquarters in Naqoura on Tuesday, causing some minor injuries, said UNIFIL spokesperson Andrea Tenenti. UNIFIL has refused to leave southern Lebanon, despite calls by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for them to go. Experts warn that could change if peacekeepers come under greater fire. 'If you went from the U.N. taking casualties to the U.N. actually taking fatalities,' some nations contributing troops may 'say ‘enough is enough,’ and you might see the mission start to crumble,' said Richard Gowan of the International Crisis Group. The future of the territory is uncertain International cease-fire efforts appear to be centered on implementing U.N. Resolution 1701, which ended the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war. It specified that Israeli forces would fully withdraw from Lebanon while the Lebanese army and UNIFIL — not Hezbollah — would be the exclusive armed presence in a zone about 25 kilometers (15 miles) from the border. But the resolution was not fully implemented. Hezbollah never left the border zone, and Lebanon accuses Israel of continuing to occupy small areas of its land and carrying out frequent military overflights above its territory. During a recent visit to Beirut, U.S. envoy Amos Hochstein said a new agreement was needed to enforce Resolution 1701. Israel could be trying to pressure an agreement into existence through the destruction wreaked in southern Lebanon. Yossi Yehoshua, military correspondent for the Israeli daily Yedioth Ahronoth, wrote that the military needs to 'entrench further its operational achievements' to push Hezbollah, the Lebanese government and mediating countries 'to accept an end (of the war) under conditions that are convenient for Israel.' Some Lebanese fear that means an occupation of parts of the south, 25 years after Israel ended its occupation there. Lebanese parliamentarian Mark Daou, a critic of both Hezbollah and of Israel’s military operations in Lebanon, said he believed Israel was trying to degrade Hezbollah’s capabilities and turn the Lebanese public 'against the will to resist Israeli incursions.' Gowan, of the International Crisis Group, said one aim of Resolution 1701 was to give the Lebanese army enough credibility that it, not Hezbollah, would be seen 'as the legitimate defender' in the south. 'That evaporates if they become (Israel’s) gendarmerie of southern Lebanon,' he said. ___ Frankel reported from Jerusalem.

Moldovans are voting in a pivotal presidential runoff. But voter fraud threatens its democracy	CHISINAU, Moldova (AP) — Moldovan historian and politician Octavian Ticu remembers when the Soviet Union collapsed in the early 1990s, a seismic event that enabled him to become one of the first amateur boxers to fight for his country at the pinnacle of his sport: the Olympic Games. 'It was a happy moment for me,' the 52-year-old recalls, as he wraps his fists at a boxing gym in the capital, Chisinau. 'In 1996, I participated in the Olympics in Atlanta. … If I were in the Soviet Union, I would never have accomplished this.' But today, more than three decades after proclaiming independence, Moldova is being targeted by Russia in a hybrid war of propaganda and disinformation that 'wreaks havoc,' Ticu, who competed in the lightweight division, told The Associated Press. Like Ukraine and Georgia, the former Soviet republic aspires to join the European Union but is caught in a constant geopolitical tug between Moscow and the West. 'Russian propaganda is a reality of 30 years of independence,' added Ticu, who has written several books on his country’s history. ____ This story, supported by the Pulitzer Center for Crisis Reporting, is part of an ongoing Associated Press series covering threats to democracy in Europe. ____ In a national referendum on Oct. 20, Moldovans voted by a razor-thin majority of 50.35% in favor of securing a path toward EU membership. But the result was overshadowed by allegations of a Moscow-backed vote-buying scheme. In a presidential election held the same day, incumbent pro-Western President Maia Sandu obtained 42% of the vote, but failed to win an outright majority. On Sunday, she will face Alexandr Stoianoglo, a Russia-friendly former prosecutor general, in a runoff viewed as a choice between geopolitical opposites — again. As in the EU referendum, a poll released this week by research company iData indicates a tight race on Sunday that leans toward a narrow Sandu victory, an outcome that might rely on Moldova's large diaspora. The presidential role carries significant powers in areas such as foreign policy and national security. In the wake of the two October votes, Moldovan law enforcement said that a vote-buying scheme was orchestrated by Ilan Shor, an exiled oligarch who currently lives in Russia and was convicted in absentia in 2023 of fraud and money laundering. Prosecutors say $39 million was paid to more than 130,000 recipients through an internationally sanctioned Russian bank to voters between September and October. Shor denies any wrongdoing. 'These people who go to Moscow, the so-called government-in-exile of Ilan Shor, who come with very large sums of money, are left to roam free,' said Ticu, who ran as a long-shot candidate in the presidential race. It was 'obvious,' Ticu added, that the votes would 'not be fair or democratic.' Of the 11 first-round candidates, he was the only one to endorse Sandu in the runoff. Voters from Moldova’s Kremlin-friendly breakaway region of Transnistria, which declared independence after a short war in the early 1990s, can cast ballots in Moldova proper. Transnistria has been a source of tension during the war in neighboring Ukraine, especially since it is home to a military base with 1,500 Russian troops. Ticu warned that if Russian troops in Ukraine reach the port city of Odesa, they could 'join the Transnistrian region, and then the Republic of Moldova will be occupied.' In Gagauzia, an autonomous part of Moldova where only 5% voted in favor of the EU, a doctor was detained after allegedly coercing 25 residents of a home for older adults to vote for a candidate they did not choose. Police said they obtained 'conclusive evidence,' including financial transfers from the same sanctioned Russian bank. Anticorruption authorities have conducted hundreds of searches and seized over $2.7 million (2.5 million euros) in cash as they attempt to crack down. On Thursday, prosecutors raided a political party headquarters and said 12 people were suspected of paying voters to select a candidate in the presidential race. A criminal case was also opened in which 40 state agency employees were suspected of taking electoral bribes. Instead of winning the overwhelming support that Sandu had hoped, the results in both races exposed Moldova’s judiciary as unable to adequately protect the democratic process. It also allowed some pro-Moscow opposition to question the validity of the votes. Igor Dodon, the Party of Socialists leader and former president who has close ties to Russia, stated this week that 'we don’t recognize' the referendum result, and labeled Sandu 'a dictator in a skirt' who will 'do whatever it takes to stay in power.' Sandu admitted the ballots suffered from unprecedented fraud and foreign meddling, which undermined the results, calling the interference a 'vile attack' on Moldova’s sovereignty. 'If the judiciary does not wake up … if it closes its eyes to selling the country, the future of Moldova will be in danger for decades,' she warned. Moldova is one of Europe’s poorest countries and has been hit hard by inflation since the war started. Tatiana Cojocari, a Russia foreign policy expert at Chisinau-based think-tank WatchDog, says this means many citizens could 'fall prey to electoral corruption' for relatively small amounts of money. 'For Russia, it’s very important to have as many resources as possible to work with. It creates chaos, both informationally and politically,' Cojocari said, adding that Russia 'has turned a bit to the tactics of the Cold War and uses them skillfully, only now adapted to social media.' In the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Moldova applied to join the EU. It was granted candidate status in June of that year, and in summer 2024, Brussels agreed to start membership negotiations. The sharp Westward shift irked Moscow and significantly soured relations with Chisinau. Since then, Moldovan authorities have repeatedly accused Russia of waging a vast 'hybrid war,' from sprawling disinformation campaigns to protests by pro-Russia parties to vote-buying schemes that undermine countrywide elections. Russia has denied it is meddling. Social media platforms have played a crucial role in disseminating Russian propaganda in Moldova, says Andrei Rusu, a media monitoring expert at WatchDog. 'One of the biggest lies is that if Moldovans join the EU, they will go to war with Russia, they will lose their faith and traditional values, or they will be forced to follow LGBT propaganda,' he said. Moldovans who lived through the Soviet Union, he added, can struggle to spot Russian propaganda about the EU and the West, and differentiate between real videos and ones generated by artificial intelligence, such as those that have frequently appeared online depicting Sandu. In recent weeks, Meta and Telegram removed multiple fake accounts that railed against the EU and Sandu, and that expressed support for pro-Russian parties. However, Moldova watchers warn that Moscow’s main target could be the 2025 parliamentary elections. Waning support for the governing pro-Western Party of Action and Solidarity suggests it could lose its majority in the 101-seat legislature. 'We are already waiting for the parliamentary elections to see other tactics and strategies,' added Cojocari, the Russia analyst. 'This government will no longer be able … to secure a parliamentary majority.' Back at the boxing gym, Ticu warned more must be done to counter foreign interference, or face a 'danger of hybrid governance' with pro-Russian forces. 'Very good laws have been adopted, but are not implemented,' he said. Russian President Vladimir 'Putin does not want a war in Moldova, he wants to show the world and Europe a case in which European integration policies have failed.'	https://apnews.com/article/moldova-democracy-election-russia-disinformation-corruption-0a23e330da7121dbc34b085fc5d0d8ad	2024-11-01T21:24:40-07:00	
Delegates agree to establish Indigenous subsidiary body at COP16 biodiversity summit in Colombia	CALI, Colombia (AP) — Delegates came to an agreement late Friday at the United Nations conference on biodiversity to establish a subsidiary body that will include Indigenous peoples in future talks and decisions on nature conservation. The COP16 summit hosted in Cali, Colombia, was a follow-up to the historic 2022 accord in Montreal, which includes 23 measures to save Earth’s plant and animal life, including putting 30% of the planet and 30% of degraded ecosystems under protection by 2030. A measure to recognize the importance of the role of people of African descent in the protection of nature was also adopted Friday. Negotiators struggled to find common ground on some key issues in the final week, but were able to come to a consensus after negotiating late into Friday. Global Indigenous delegations erupted into cheers and tears over the historic decision. The decision recognizes and protects the traditional knowledge systems of Indigenous peoples and local communities for the benefit of global and national biodiversity management, said Sushil Raj, Executive Director of the Rights and Communities Global Program at the Wildlife Conservation Society. 'It strengthens representation, coordination, inclusive decision making, and creates a space for dialogue with parties to the COP,' Raj told The Associated Press. 'It promotes support for Indigenous and traditional territorial biodiversity management and furthers international human rights standards referenced in the Global Biodiversity Framework.' The body will be formed by two co-chairs elected by COP: one nominated by U.N. parties of the regional group, and the other nominated by representatives of Indigenous peoples and local communities, the AP saw in the document. At least one of the co-chairs will be selected from a developing country, taking into account gender balance, the document said. 'With this decision, the value of the traditional knowledge of indigenous peoples, Afro-descendants and local communities is recognized, and a 26-year-old historical debt in the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) is settled,' Susana Muhamad, Colombia’s environment minister and COP16 president, posted on social media platform X shortly after the announcement. Also adopted was an agreement to protect human health from Earth’s increasing biodiversity issues. Ecosystem degradation and loss of ecological integrity directly threaten human and animal health, environmental groups say. Pledges made by countries during the two weeks were far short of the billions needed to tackle plummeting global biodiversity, with only around $400 million in the fund. In Montreal's summit, wealthy nations pledged to raise $20 billion in annual conservation financing for developing nations by 2025, with that number rising to $30 billion annually by 2030. Global wildlife populations have plunged on average by 73% in 50 years, according to the World Wildlife Fund and the Zoological Society of London biennial Living Planet report in October.	https://apnews.com/article/biodiversity-cop16-colombia-decisions-indigenous-53a8b16befaf621d75a2fc9b9828c2a8	2024-11-01T21:04:53-07:00

Negotiations stall over some crucial issues on final day of UN biodiversity summit in Colombia	CALI, Colombia (AP) — At the United Nations biodiversity summit in Colombia, negotiators have struggled to find common ground on key issues. These include how to finance protections for 30% of the world's plants and animals by 2030, how to establish a permanent body for Indigenous peoples and how to make payments for nature’s genetic data that's used to create commercial products. The two-week conference, known as COP16, was due to wrap up Friday, although observers say negotiations could go into the weekend. In 2022, the biodiversity summit in Montreal, COP15, established a framework for countries to go about saving plummeting global ecosystems. This year’s follow-up summit was to put plans into motion. 'COP15 was all about the ‘what’; this was supposed to be about the ‘how,’' Georgina Chandler, head of policy and campaigns at The Zoological Society of London, told The Associated Press. Wealthy nations pledged in Montreal’s summit to raise $20 billion in annual conservation financing for developing nations by 2025 — with that rising to $30 billion annually by 2030. 'I don’t think we’ve seen governments come here with increased commitments towards the $20 billion significant enough that we’re going to achieve that,' Chandler said. 'That’s fallen a bit short.' The lack of financial pledges from wealthy countries prompted 20 ministers from the Global South to release a joint statement calling for the need to build trust among nations and for the Global North to meet its finance targets. In the run-up to negotiations, over 230 businesses and financial institutions demanded stronger policy ambitions to address the growing risks of nature loss, said Eva Zabey, CEO of Business for Nature. 'In the final stretch at COP16, negotiations are stalling on crucial issues — including the mobilization of meaningful financial resources and a way for companies to ensure the benefits of nature are valued and shared fairly,' Zabey said. 'We need governments to put aside their differences and demonstrate real and urgent leadership to deliver a strong COP16 outcome that incentivizes and drives necessary business action, further and faster, to halt and reverse nature loss by 2030,' she said. Who owns nature's DNA was a major topic at the summit. There was tension between poorer and developed countries over digital sequence information on genetic resources (DSI). This would oblige the sharing of benefits when genetic resources from animals, plants or microorganisms are used in biotechnologies. In Montreal, countries agreed to set up a global fund. 'The DSI fund was scheduled to be adopted here two years ago. There is no clarity on how money will be gathered from companies,' said Oscar Soria, director of The Common Initiative. 'As the text reads it is purely voluntary.' Sources told AP that there has been significant back and forth over wording in the draft agreement by nations. ’It’s clear that a number of points are going down to the wire in the COP16 negotiations,' Catherine Weller, Director of Global Policy at charity Fauna &amp; Flora said. One of the biggest controversies during talks was the blocking by a few countries of a Permanent Subsidiary Body for Indigenous Peoples and local communities, who Weller says bring valuable insights to many discussions. 'We urge the negotiators to step up and ensure this is finalized,' she said. ____ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Brazilian state law overturns soy moratorium that helped curb Amazon deforestation	AGUA CLARA, Brazil (AP) — A historic agreement that's helped curb deforestation in Brazil’s Amazon for nearly two decades suffered a major blow after Mato Grosso, the country´s largest soybean-producing state, passed a law ending incentives for participating processing and trade companies. The law passed last week was designed to void the Soy Moratorium — a 2006 deal in reaction to a Greenpeace investigation that linked soy produced in illegally deforested areas to U.S. commodities giants Cargill, Bunge and ADM. Under pressure, the companies agreed at the time not to buy soy produced in areas cleared after 2006. The date was later revised to July 2008. Several studies in recent years have shown the moratorium contributed to the Amazon’s preservation. A 2020 study in the journal Nature Food found that the agreement, in combination with public policies, contributed to the steepest reduction of deforestation recorded in Brazil’s Amazon, between 2003 and 2016. Backed by soybean producers and most of Mato Grosso´s lawmakers and mayors, the new legislation cuts tax benefits to companies that participate in any agreement that imposes restrictions on expanding agricultural activities into areas that can be legally deforested. Governor Mauro Mendes signed the law Oct. 24. It goes into effect on Jan. 1, 2025, but regulations are pending. It states that only the illegally deforested area of a farm will be prevented from selling soy. In other words, if a 4,000-acre (1,618-hectare) property clears 200 acres (81 hectares) unlawfully, just the output from that specific area is blocked. Specialists warn that such refined monitoring is technically challenging, if not unfeasible. Under the moratorium, property with any post-2008 deforestation is forbidden altogether to sell its crops, regardless of whether the deforestation is legal. Supporters of the new state law have long claimed the moratorium´s 2008 limit is stricter than Brazilian legislation that allows the deforestation of up to 20% of a large rural property in the Amazon. 'We will not rest as long as the moratorium harms even one producer,' the Mato Grosso soy producers president Lucas Costa Beber said in a celebratory statement. 'And until this agreement is extinct, the trading companies will not have a peaceful sleep.' Environmental nonprofits and the entity representing leading soybean trade and processing companies have criticized Mato Grosso´s initiative. 'The law is a setback,' said Bernardo Pires, sustainability director of the Brazilian Association of Vegetable Oil Industries (Abiove), which supports the moratorium. 'Companies committed to sustainability should receive twice as many benefits instead of losing them.' Abiove members, which include Cargill, Bunge and ADM, buy over 90% of Mato Grosso´s soy production. The state tax benefits amount to $308 million a year. Pires said the moratorium´s zero deforestation policy is a market demand. 'Our European customers demand not to consume any products associated with deforestation,' he said. Cristiane Mazzetti, coordinator of the forests campaign at Greenpeace Brazil, said the law reveals a double standard among politicians connected to agribusiness, who oppose the moratorium as unnecessary yet seek to weaken these same environmental protection. The new law sparked mixed reactions within President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva’s government, which has promised zero deforestation by 2030. André Lima, secretary of deforestation control at the Ministry of the Environment and Climate Change, said that although state governments have the right to choose which economic activities they want to support, it is unconstitutional to withdraw tax incentives from companies that have adopted sustainability and climate criteria aligned with Brazil’s deforestation reduction goals. 'It also goes against the national tax reform guidelines, which have incorporated sustainable development as an important criterion for promoting more and new tax incentives for the green economy,' he told The Associated Press. Agriculture Minister Carlos Fávaro, however, praised the law. 'The project (moratorium) is stricter than the law, and this creates legitimate dissatisfaction among producers,' he told reporters in an event last week. ___ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Brazil criticizes Venezuela for escalating tensions and personal attacks	SAO PAULO (AP) — Brazil's government broke its silence Friday over growing tensions with neighboring Venezuela, with the Foreign Ministry saying it was surprised by 'the offensive tone' adopted by Venezuelan authorities toward Brazil. In recent days, Venezuela’s government has escalated its criticism of Brazilian foreign relations officials and even President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, a long-time ally. 'The choice of personal attacks and rhetorical escalations, instead of political and diplomatic channels, does not align with the respectful manner in which the Brazilian government treats Venezuela and its people,' the Brazilian Foreign Ministry said in a statement. President Nicolás Maduro’s government intensified its criticism of Brazil after a top adviser to Brazil’s president said the country had not supported Venezuela’s bid to join the BRICS bloc of developing economies at the recent summit in Russia. That decision added to tensions between the two nations over disputed results in Venezuela’s July presidential election and calls for transparency from Brazil and other countries. Venezuela’s Foreign Ministry said Wednesday it summoned Brazil’s chargé d’affaires in Venezuela, Breno Hermann, to 'express its strongest rejection of the recurrent interventionist and rude statements of spokespersons authorized by the Brazilian government.' The ministry also accused Celso Amorim, Brazil’s former foreign minister and special adviser to Lula, of acting 'like a messenger of American imperialism' by 'issuing value judgments on processes that only correspond to Venezuelans and their democratic institutions.' It added that his actions threaten the 'ties that unite both countries.' Initially, Brazil’s diplomatic approach was to avoid commenting to prevent escalating tensions, a Foreign Ministry source told The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the issue publicly. However, this stance shifted after Venezuela’s Bolivarian National Police shared an image Thursday on social media depicting what appeared to be Lula’s silhouette over Brazil’s national flag with the text: 'If you mess with Venezuela, you wilt.' 'Our homeland is independent, free, and sovereign. We do not accept blackmail from anyone; we are not anyone’s colony,' the publication added. In the Friday statement, Brazil’s Foreign Ministry said it values non-intervention and fully respects the sovereignty of each neighboring country. The statement explained that Brazil’s interest in Venezuela’s electoral process stems from its role as a witness to the 2023 Barbados Agreements, in which Venezuela’s government and opposition settled on electoral conditions. 'The Brazilian government remains convinced that partnerships should be based on open dialogue, respect for differences, and mutual understanding,' the statement said. Amorim, the former foreign minister, in a Tuesday hearing before Brazilian lawmakers, acknowledged 'discomfort' between the two countries, attributing it to the Maduro administration’s refusal to publish detailed election results. He said that improving diplomatic relations 'will depend on actions' taken by Venezuela, without providing specifics. Venezuela’s electoral authorities claimed they could not publish the detailed results because their website was hacked. At the same time, the main opposition coalition secured vote tally sheets from more than 80% of the electronic voting machines used across the country, published them online and declared that its candidate, former diplomat Edmundo González, had defeated Maduro by a landslide. After the July 28 election, Lula, Colombian President Gustavo Petro and then-Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador — all leftists and friendly with Maduro — inserted themselves into Venezuela’s election standoff to attempt a peacemaking effort. But it went nowhere, and Maduro has since consolidated his rule, reshuffled his Cabinet and jailed more than 2,000 opponents. The BRICS bloc, which initially included Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, has expanded to embrace Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia. Brazil opposed including Venezuela at the group’s summit earlier this month. 'Brazil does not want an indefinite expansion,' Amorim, Lula's special adviser, told lawmakers. 'Brazil believes its members should be countries with influence that can help represent the region. And Venezuela today does not meet these conditions, in our opinion.' Venezuela’s Foreign Affairs Ministry characterized the move as 'irrational behavior' and likened it to the economic sanctions that the U.S. imposed against the South American country.	https://apnews.com/article/brazil-venezuela-diplomacy-maduro-lula-celso-amorim-9c6f7d837c6d15307d2562f6cdfe683a	2024-11-01T12:52:11-07:00	
29 Nigerian children may be sentenced to death for protesting against cost-of-living crisis	ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) — Twenty-nine children could be facing the death penalty in Nigeria after they were arraigned Friday for participating in a protest against the country’s record cost-of-living crisis. Four of them collapsed in court due to exhaustion before they could enter a plea. A total of 76 protesters were charged with 10 felony counts, including treason, destruction of property, public disturbance and mutiny, according to the charge sheet seen by The Associated Press. According to the charge sheet, the minors ranged in age from 14 to 17 years old. Frustration over the cost-of-living crisis has led to several mass protests in recent months. In August, at least 20 people were shot dead and hundreds more were arrested at a protest demanding better opportunities and jobs for young people. The death sentence was introduced in the 1970s in Nigeria, but there have been no executions in the country since 2016. Akintayo Balogun, a private lawyer based in Abuja, said the Child Rights Act does not allow any child to be subject to criminal proceedings and sentenced to death. 'So taking minors before a federal high court is wrong, ab initio, except if the government is able to prove that the boys are all above 19 years,' Balogun said. The court eventually granted 10 million naira ($5,900) bail to each the defendants and imposed stringent conditions they are yet to meet, Marshal Abubakar, counsel to some of the boys, said. 'A country that has a duty to educate its children will decide to punish those children. These children have been in detention for 90 days without food,' Abubakar said. Yemi Adamolekun, executive director of Enough is Enough, a civil society organization promoting good governance in Nigeria, said authorities have no business prosecuting children. 'The chief justice of Nigeria should be ashamed, she is a woman and a mother,' Adamolekun said. Despite being one of the top crude oil producers in Africa, Nigeria remains one of the world’s poorest countries. Chronic corruption means the lifestyle of its public officials rarely mirrors that of the general population. Medical professionals often strike to protest meager wages. The country's politicians and lawmakers, often accused of corruption, are some of the best-paid in Africa. Even the president’s wife — her office nowhere in the constitution — is entitled to SUVs and other luxuries funded by taxpayers. Nigeria’s population of over 210 million people — the continent’s largest — is also among the hungriest in the world and its government has struggled to create jobs. The inflation rate is also at 28-year high and the local naira currency at record lows against the dollar. On Thursday, Nigeria was classified as a 'hotspot of very high concern,' in a report from United Nations’ food agencies, as large numbers of people are facing or are projected to face critical levels of acute food insecurity in the West African country.	https://apnews.com/article/nigeria-minors-death-sentence-costofliving-crisis-5ee0c4023575f31bbf569c3e49045d54	2024-11-01T12:47:45-07:00	
US is sending $425 million in military assistance to Ukraine	WASHINGTON (AP) — The Pentagon announced Friday it was sending an additional $425 million in military assistance to Ukraine as Kyiv prepares to face Russian forces augmented by more than 10,000 North Korean troops. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin had said more aid was coming, and soon, during his visit to Kyiv last week. This aid package includes weapons that will be pulled from existing U.S. stockpiles, including air defense interceptors for National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile Systems, munitions for High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems and 155 mm artillery, and armored vehicles and anti-tank weapons. Ukraine's eastern cities continue to face an onslaught of Russian missile strikes, including one on Kharkiv by a 500-kilogram (1,100-pound) glide bomb. The attack Thursday hit an apartment complex, killing three and injuring scores. In addition, Ukraine is facing new uncertainty as waves of North Korean soldiers deployed to Russia have arrived near Ukraine’s border and are preparing to join the fight against Ukrainian troops in coming days. Russia has increasingly used powerful glide bombs to pummel Ukrainian positions along the 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) line of contact and strike cities dozens of kilometers (miles) from the front line. Kharkiv, a city of 1.1 million, is about 30 kilometers (less than 20 miles) from the border. The aid package announced Friday by the Pentagon brings the total amount of military assistance the U.S. has provided Ukraine since Russia invaded in February 2022 to $60.4 billion.	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-military-aid-f188add84ba11349dcbbf2d5de719124	2024-11-01T10:06:59-07:00	
FBI links video falsely depicting voter fraud in Georgia to 'Russian influence actors'	WASHINGTON (AP) — A video purporting to depict voter fraud in Georgia is fake and the work of 'Russian influence actors,' U.S. intelligence officials said Friday as they warned that foreign efforts to undermine faith in the integrity of next week's elections may persist long after votes have been cast. The announcement that the video was fake represented an effort by the FBI and other federal agencies, four days before Tuesday's elections, to combat foreign disinformation by calling it out rather than letting it spread for days unchecked. It follows a similar statement last week that also attributed to Russian actors a widely circulated video falsely depicting mail-in ballots for Donald Trump being destroyed in Pennsylvania. The 20-second video, which began circulating on the social media platform X on Thursday afternoon, shows someone who describes himself as a Haitian immigrant talking about how he’s intending to vote multiple times in two Georgia counties for Vice President Kamala Harris. He flashes several purported Georgia IDs with different names and addresses. An Associated Press analysis of the information on two of the IDs confirms it does not match any registered voters in Gwinnett or Fulton counties, the two counties he mentioned. Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger said Thursday night that the video is 'obviously fake' and likely the product of Russian trolls 'attempting to sow discord and chaos on the eve of the election.' Intelligence officials echoed that finding Friday, saying the video was manufactured by 'Russian influence actors' and was part of 'Moscow’s broader effort to raise unfounded questions about the integrity of the U.S. election and stoke divisions among Americans.' The intelligence community expects Russia, in the days before the election and weeks and months after, 'to create and release additional media content that seeks to undermine trust in the integrity of the election and divide Americans,' said the joint statement from the FBI, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. The post that originally popularized the video was no longer available on Friday morning, but copycat versions of the video were still being shared widely with false claims it showed election fraud. The video in its style and method of dissemination is similar to other videos created by Storm-1516, also known as CopyCop, a known Russian disinformation network that has created several fake videos this election, according to Darren Linvill, co-director of the Media Forensics Hub at Clemson University, who has researched the group. Also Friday, the agencies attributed to Russia a separate manufactured video falsely accusing 'an individual associated with the Democratic presidential ticket of taking a bribe from a U.S. entertainer.' They did not elaborate.	https://apnews.com/article/fbi-russia-georgia-fraud-disinformation-eebea4ab200682ccd3e97fb9f164e6ca	2024-11-01T09:41:30-07:00	
Head of UN-backed team of experts cites paramilitary force in Sudan for sexual violence as war rages	GENEVA (AP) — The head of a U.N.-backed fact-finding team looking into human rights violations and abuses in Sudan said Friday it found the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces responsible for large-scale sexual violence in areas that it controls. Mohamed Chande Othman has denounced 'staggering violence' in Sudan since war broke out more than 18 months ago between the Sudanese military and the RSF, starting with open fighting in the capital, Khartoum, that later spread across the country. 'We said in our report that we attribute sexual gender-based violence to RSF in West Darfur, in Darfur, in greater Khartoum, and in al-Gezira (state),' the Tanzanian lawyer said Friday by phone from Zimbabwe, where he was attending a conference. However, Othman said a renewed mandate from the U.N. Human Rights Council would allow his team of independent experts to investigate 'credible' allegations of sexual exploitation by the Sudanese armed forces as well. The fact-finding mission on Tuesday released a more comprehensive version of its report presented in September to the rights council, which has 47 member countries. The broader report cited gang rapes, sexual slavery and the abduction of victims in areas the RSF controls. 'It’s important to highlight the horrendous nature and the widespread nature — the patterns of violence — that were committed,' Othman said. His team found the sexual violence and allegations of enforced marriages and human trafficking across borders for sexual purposes took place mostly during invasions of towns and cities. 'Victims and witnesses consistently reported that perpetrators threatened them with weapons, including firearms, knives and whips to intimidate and coerce them,' the latest report said, citing violence like punching, beatings with sticks, and lashing before and during rape. 'Men and boys were also reportedly targeted while in detention with sexual violence, including rape, threats of rape, forced nudity and beating on the genitals, requiring further investigation,' it added. The violence in Sudan has been unrelenting. On Sunday, a doctors group and the United Nations reported that RSF fighters riot in east central Sudan carried out? took part in? a multi-day attack that killed more than 120 people in one town. On Tuesday, the U.N. migration agency said 14 million people — or over 30% of the country's population — have been displaced either within Sudan or abroad because of the conflict, making it the world's largest displacement crisis.	https://apnews.com/article/othman-human-rights-sudan-war-rsf-b659ad643af6e3b4852f2046349a83e2	2024-11-01T07:37:34-07:00	
Israel is falling far short of a US ultimatum to surge aid to Gaza	WASHINGTON (AP) — Halfway through the Biden administration's 30-day ultimatum for Israel to surge the level of humanitarian assistance allowed into Gaza or risk possible restrictions on U.S. military funding, Israel is falling far short, an Associated Press review of U.N. and Israeli data shows. Israel also has missed some other deadlines and demands outlined in a Oct. 13 letter from Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin. The mid-November deadline — following the U.S. election — may serve as a final test of President Joe Biden 's willingness to check a close ally that has shrugged off repeated U.S. appeals to protect Palestinian civilians during the war against Hamas. In their letter, Blinken and Austin demanded improvements to the deteriorating humanitarian condition in Gaza, saying that Israel must allow in a minimum of 350 trucks a day carrying desperately needed food and other supplies. By the end of October, an average of just 71 trucks a day were entering Gaza, according to the latest U.N. figures. Blinken said the State Department and Pentagon were closely following Israel’s response to the letter. 'There’s been progress, but it’s insufficient, and we’re working on a daily basis to make sure Israel does what it must do to ensure that this assistance gets to people who need it inside of Gaza,' Blinken told reporters. 'It’s not enough to get trucks to Gaza. It’s vital that what they bring with them can get distributed effectively inside of Gaza,' he added. Blinken and Austin’s letter marked one of the toughest stands that the Biden administration has taken in a year of appeals and warnings to Israel to lessen the harm to Palestinian civilians. Support for Israel is a bedrock issue for many Republican voters and some Democrats. That makes any Biden administration decision on restricting military funding to the U.S. ally a fraught one for the tight presidential race between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump. In hard-hit north Gaza in particular, an escalated Israeli military campaign and restrictions on aid has kept all food and other care from reaching populated areas since mid-October, aid organizations say. It could set the stage for famine in coming weeks or months, international monitors say. And despite U.S. objections, Israeli lawmakers this week voted to effectively ban the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, known as UNRWA. Governments worldwide, the U.N. and aid organizations say cutting off UNRWA would shatter the aid networks struggling to get food and other supplies to people in Gaza. 'Catastrophic,' Amber Alayyan, a medical program manager for Gaza at Doctors Without Borders, said of the move. Humanitarian officials are deeply skeptical Israel will significantly improve assistance to Gaza’s civilians even with the U.S. warning — or that the Biden administration will do anything if it doesn’t. At this point in the war, 'neither of those has happened,' said Scott Paul, an associate director of the Oxfam humanitarian organization. 'Over and over and again, we’ve been told' by Biden administration officials 'that there are processes to evaluate the situation on the ground' in Gaza 'and some movement’s been made to implement U.S. law, and time and again that has not happened,' Paul said. Before the war, an average of 500 trucks daily brought aid into the territory. Relief groups have said that's the minimum needed for Gaza’s 2.3 million people, most of whom have since been uprooted from their homes, often multiple times. There has never been a month where Israel came close to meeting that figure since the conflict began, peaking in April at 225 trucks a day, according to Israeli government figures. By the time Blinken and Austin sent their letter this month, concerns were rising that aid restrictions were starving civilians. The number of aid trucks that Israel has allowed into Gaza has plunged since last spring and summer, falling to a daily average of just 13 a day by the beginning of October, according to U.N. figures. By the end of the month, it rose to an average of 71 trucks a day, the U.N. figures show. Once supplies get to Gaza, groups still face obstacles distributing the aid to warehouses and then to people in need, organizations and the State Department said this week. That includes slow Israeli processing, Israeli restrictions on shipments, lawlessness and other obstacles, aid groups said. Data from COGAT, the Israeli military body in charge of humanitarian aid to Gaza, shows aid has fallen to under a third of its levels in September and August. In September, 87,446 tons of aid entered the Gaza Strip. In October, 26,399 tons got in. Elad Goren, a senior COGAT official, said last week that aid delivery and distribution in the north has been mainly confined to Gaza City. When asked why aid was not being delivered to other parts of the north — like Jabaliya, a crowded urban refugee camp where Israel is staging an offensive — he said the population there was being evacuated and those who remained had 'enough assistance' from previous months. In other areas like Beit Hanoun and Beit Lahiya, Goren claimed falsely that there was 'no population' left there. COGAT declined to comment on the standard in the U.S. letter. It said it was complying with government directives on aid to Gaza. Israel’s U.N. Ambassador Danny Danon blamed Hamas for plundering aid. Paul of Oxfam said no aid at all was reaching populated areas in northern Gaza and only small amounts getting to Gaza City. 'No way' has Israel made progress in getting humanitarian support to the hundreds of thousands of people in north Gaza in particular since the U.S. ultimatum, said Alayyan of Doctors Without Borders. Israel’s government appeared to blow past another deadline set in Austin and Blinken's letter. It called for Israel to set up a senior-level channel for U.S. officials to raise concerns about reported harm to Palestinian civilians and hold a first meeting by the end of October. No such channel — requested repeatedly by the U.S. during the war — had been created by the final day of the month. The U.S. is by far the biggest provider of arms and other military aid to Israel, including nearly $18 billion during the war in Gaza, according to a study for Brown University's Costs of War project. The Biden administration paused a planned shipment of 2,000-pound bombs to Israel last spring, citing concerns for civilians in an Israeli offensive. In a formal review in May, the administration concluded that Israel’s use of U.S.-provided weapons in Gaza likely violated international humanitarian law but said wartime conditions prevented officials from determining that for certain in specific strikes. ___ AP writers Matthew Lee in Washington, Julia Frankel in Jerusalem and Edith M.

Hindus in Muslim-majority Bangladesh rally to demand protection from attacks	DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) — Tens of thousands of minority Hindus rallied Friday to demand that the interim government in Muslim-majority Bangladesh protect them from a wave of attacks and harassment and drop sedition cases against Hindu community leaders. About 30,000 Hindus demonstrated at a major intersection in the southeastern city of Chattogram chanting slogans demanding their rights while police and soldiers guarded the area. Other protests were reported elsewhere in the country. Hindu groups say thousands of attacks against Hindus have happened since early August when the secular government of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina was overthrown and Hasina fled the country following a student-led uprising. Muhammad Yunus, the Nobel peace laureate named to lead an interim government after Hasina's downfall, says those figures have been exaggerated. Hindus make up about 8% of the country's nearly 170 million people, while Muslims are about 91%. The country’s influential minority group Bangladesh Hindu Buddhist Christian Unity Council has said that there have been more than 2,000 attacks on Hindus since Aug. 4, as the interim government has struggled to restore order. U.N. human rights officials and other rights groups have expressed concern over human rights in the country under Yunus. Hindus and other minority communities say the interim government hasn't adequately protected them and that hardline Islamists are becoming increasingly influential since Hasina's ouster. The issue has reached beyond Bangladesh, with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi voicing concern over reports of attacks. While the administration of U.S. Presdent Joe Biden has said it is monitoring Bangladesh’s human rights issues since Hasina’s ouster, U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump has condemned what he described as 'barbaric' violence against Hindus, Christians, and other minorities in Bangladesh. In a post on X, he said: 'I strongly condemn the barbaric violence against Hindus, Christians, and other minorities who are getting attacked and looted by mobs in Bangladesh, which remains in a total state of chaos.' Hindu activists have been staging protest rallies in the capital, Dhaka, and elsewhere since August to press a set of eight demands including a law to protect minorities, a ministry for minorities and a tribunal to prosecute acts of oppression against minorities. They also seek a five-day holiday for their largest festival, the Durga Puja. Friday's protest in Chattogram was hastily organized after sedition charges were filed Wednesday against 19 Hindu leaders, including prominent priest Chandan Kumar Dhar, over an Oct. 25 rally in that city. Police arrested two of the leaders, angering Hindus. The charges stem from an incident when a group of rally-goers allegedly placed a saffron flag above the Bangladesh flag on a pillar, which was considered disrespecting the national flag. Hindu community leaders say the cases are politically motivated and on Thursday demanded that they be withdrawn within 72 hours. Another Hindu rally has been planned for Saturday in Dhaka. Separately, supporters of Hasina's Awami League party and its allied Jatiya Party have said they also have been targeted since Hasina's ouster. Jatiya's headquarters was vandalized and set on fire late Thursday. On Friday, Jatiya Party Chairman G.M. Quader said his supporters would continue to hold rallies to demand their rights despite risking their lives. He said they would hold a rally Saturday at the party headquarters in Dhaka to protest price hikes of commodities, and what they call false charges against their leaders and activists. Later Friday, the Dhaka Metropolitan Police announced it was banning any rallies near the Jatiya headquarters. There was no immediate response from the party about whether it press ahead with its attempts to hold the rally, or change the venue. The police decision came after a student group strongly criticized the police administration for initially granting permission for the rally, and threatened to block it.	https://apnews.com/article/bangladesh-hindu-minority-attacks-hasina-yunus-beaddefd93f1b9dcf14d287543b023f5	2024-11-01T06:17:03-07:00

Deaths of 10 newborns shake millions' trust in Turkey's health care system	ANKARA, Turkey (AP) — The mother thought her baby looked healthy when he was born 1.5 months early, but staff swiftly whisked him to the neonatal intensive care unit. It was the last time Burcu Gokdeniz would see her baby alive. The doctor in charge told her that Umut Ali's heart stopped after his health deteriorated unexpectedly. Seeing her son wrapped in a shroud 10 days after he was born was the 'worst moment' of her life, the 32-year-old e-commerce specialist told The Associated Press. Gokdeniz is among hundreds of parents who have come forward seeking an investigation into the deaths of their children or other loved ones since Turkish prosecutors accused 47 doctors, nurses and ambulance drivers and other medical workers of neglect or malpractice in the deaths of 10 newborns since last year. The medical workers say they made the best possible judgment calls while caring for the most delicate patients imaginable, and face criminal penalties for unwanted outcomes. Shattered parents say they have lost trust in the system and the cases have prompted so much outrage that demonstrators staged protests in October outside hospitals where some of the deaths occurred, hurling stones at the buildings. Prosecutors haven’t said how much the defendants allegedly earned. After the scandal emerged, at least 350 families petitioned prosecutors, the Health Ministry or the president’s office seeking an investigation into the deaths of their loved ones, the state-run Anadolu Agency reported. The prosecution's case Prosecutors are demanding up to 583 years in prison for the main defendant, Dr. Firat Sari, who operated the neonatal intensive care units of several hospitals in Istanbul. Sari is charged with 'establishing an organization with the aim of committing a crime,' 'defrauding public institutions,' 'forgery of official documents' and 'homicide by negligence.' Prosecutors say that the evidence clearly shows medical fraud for profit. An indictment issued this month accused the defendants of falsifying records, and placing patients in the neonatal care units of some private hospitals for prolonged and sometimes unnecessary treatments in facilities unprepared to treat them. Turkey guarantees all citizens health care, and its public health system reimburses private hospitals that treat eligible patients. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s ruling party, in power since 2002, has promoted the expansion of private health care facilities to improve access in the country of 85 million people. Years without a family, then a death After years of fertility treatment, Ozan Eskici and his wife welcomed twins — a boy and a girl — to one of Sari's hospitals in 2019. Although the babies initially appeared to be healthy, both were admitted to intensive care. The girl was discharged after 11 days, but the boy died 24 days later. During questioning by prosecutors, Sari denied accusations that the babies were not given the proper care, that the neonatal units were understaffed or that his employees were not appropriately qualified, according to a 1,400-page indictment. He told prosecutors: 'Everything is in accordance with procedures.' This week, a court in Istanbul approved the indictment — which includes hundreds of pages of transcripts of secretly taped recordings of telephone conversations between suspects — and scheduled the trial date for Nov. 18. The way that the case has horrified the nation has left the defendants increasingly isolated. Lawyer Ali Karaoglan said he and two other attorneys who represented Sari during the investigation have recently withdrawn from the case. And authorities have since revoked the licenses and closed nine of the 19 hospitals implicated in the scandal, including one owned by a former health minister. The scandal has led main opposition party leader Ozgur Ozel to call for all hospitals involved to be seized by the state and nationalized. Erdogan said those responsible for the deaths would be severely punished but warned against placing all blame on the country’s health care system. 'We will not allow our health care community to be battered because of a few rotten apples,' Erdogan said, calling the alleged culprits 'a gang of people devoid of humanity.' 'This gang ... committed such despicable atrocities by exploiting the facilities provided by our state to ensure citizens with higher quality and more accessible, affordable healthcare,' Erdogan said. He added: 'Those who commit such barbarism will be held accountable before the law in the most severe way for their crimes. As the president, I will continue to follow this issue personally to ensure that these killers, who played with the lives of innocent babies for financial gain, never see the light of day again.' No more trust in the system Gokdeniz, who gave birth in 2020, said she trusted Sari and accepted her son’s death as natural until she watched the scandal unfold in TV news and on social media. 'It all started to fall into place like dominoes,' she said. Eskici, too, had placed complete trust in Sari, whose assurances he now views as cruel deceptions. 'The sentences he told me are in front of my eyes like it was yesterday,' he said. Sibel Kosal, who lost her baby daughter Zeynep at a private hospital in 2017, is also seeking answers. She says the scandal has shattered her trust in the health care system and left her in constant fear for her surviving children. 'They have ruined a dad and a mom,' she said. Kosal pleaded to the authorities to take immediate action. 'Don’t let babies die, don’t let mothers cry,' she said. 'We want a livable world, one where our children are safe.' —— Badendieck reported from Hamburg, Germany.	https://apnews.com/article/turkey-premature-babies-medical-worker-killings-fraud-d99b0e3bb58295b4dc31e9b44fd49201	2024-11-01T04:45:09-07:00	
Israel pummels Gaza and Lebanon, killing dozens in latest waves of deadly airstrikes	DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — The Israeli military launched waves of deadly airstrikes across Lebanon and Gaza, killing at least 24 people in Lebanon's northeast on Friday, the country's state-run National News Agency reported. Palestinians, meanwhile, recovered the bodies of 25 people killed in a barrage of Israeli attacks on central Gaza that began Thursday, hospital officials said. It was another day of bloodshed both in Lebanon, where Israel stepped up airstrikes against Hezbollah in the northeast this week, and in Gaza, where Israel said it had targeted Hamas infrastructure near the Nuseirat refugee camp. Despite growing pressure from the United States and others in the international community for a cease-fire in the fighting in Gaza and Lebanon, Israeli strikes against the militant Hezbollah group are increasingly expanding beyond Lebanon's periphery. Israeli attacks that initially targeted smaller border villages in southern Lebanon, where the Iran-backed Hezbollah holds sway, have broadened to bigger urban hubs in recent weeks where the group — which is also a major political party and provider of social services — counts many supporters. The intensified strikes on and around the northeastern city of Baalbek this week have prompted roughly 60,000 people to flee their homes, according to Hussein Haj Hassan, a Lebanese lawmaker representing the region. Lebanon’s state National News Agency reported four airstrikes in different villages across the northeast that had largely been spared the worst of Israeli bombardment until last month. The agency reported that rescuers were still searching for survivors in Younine, a town in the Bekaa Valley, from the rubble of a targeted building that was believed to have housed 20 people. Further attacks in the northeastern Baalbek-Hermel region killed eight people in the village of Amhaz and another two in the village of Taraya. Israel’s military has said that its operation in Lebanon is targeting Hezbollah’s military infrastructure as the group continues firing rockets, drones and missiles into Israel. Rockets fired from Lebanon killed seven people in northern Israel on Thursday, including four Thai workers. Israeli planes also pounded Beirut’s southern suburb of Dahiyeh overnight and early Friday, destroying dozens of buildings in several neighborhoods, according to the country's news agency. The Israeli military said those attacks hit Hezbollah weapons manufacturing sites and command centers. There was no word from the Lebanese officials on any casualty figures from the Dahiyeh strikes, Lebanon’s Heath Ministry said more than 2,800 people have been killed and 13,000 wounded since Oct. 8, 2023, when Hezbollah began firing rockets almost daily into Israel, drawing retaliation. The latest violence comes against the backdrop of the Biden administration's renewed diplomatic push days before the U.S. election to reach temporary cease-fire deals between Israel, Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza. In Gaza, officials from the al-Aqsa Hospital in central Gaza said they continued to receive bodies from a barrage of Israeli airstrikes on Nuseirat camp that left 21 dead, including an 18-month-old and his 10-year-old sister. Israeli strikes also hit a motorcycle in Zuwaida and a house in Deir al-Balah, killing four more people, the hospital officials said, bringing the overall death toll in Gaza to 25 on Friday. Within the last 24 hours, Gaza-based Health Ministry reported that 55 people had been killed and another 196 had been wounded in the battered enclave. The Israeli military did not comment on the strikes outside Nuseirat camp. It said it was aware of reports of civilian casualties and was investigating. Israel’s blistering offensive on the Gaza Strip has killed more than 43,000 Palestinians since October 7, 2023, say health officials inside Gaza who do not distinguish between civilians and combatants. They say more than half of the dead are women and children. Israel began bombarding Gaza after the Hamas attack on Israel on Oct. 7 last year, when the militants killed roughly 1,200 people and took some 250 hostages back to Gaza. ___ Frankel reported from Jerusalem.

North Korea's top diplomat is in Moscow as Pyongyang sent troops to help the war on Ukraine	Russia's top diplomat on Friday hosted his North Korean counterpart for talks amid reports that Pyongyang has sent thousands of troops to Russia to support its military in the war in Ukraine. Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui's visit to Moscow and her meeting with Russia's Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov came on the heels of the Pentagon's statement that North Korea has deployed about 10,000 troops to Russia to fight against Ukraine within 'the next several weeks.' Western leaders have described the North Korean troop deployment as a significant escalation that could also jolt relations in the Indo-Pacific region. Neither Moscow nor Pyongyang have specified the agenda for Choe's talks in Moscow, but in a closed-door hearing at South Korea’s parliament, the South’s spy agency said Choe may be involved in high-level discussions on sending additional troops to Russia and negotiating what the North would get in return. South Korean and Western officials have voiced concern that Russia may offer technology that could advance the threat posed by North Korea’s nuclear weapons and missile program. Meeting Choe in Moscow on Friday, Russia’s Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov hailed ties between Moscow and Pyongyang, saying that they 'have reached an unprecedented high level over the past few years,' and proposed discussing the implementation of the strategic partnership agreement the two nations signed earlier this year. 'We will have discussions on a series of issues regarding politics and foreign policy as well as matters that require a joint response between the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and the Russian Federation,' Choe said, invoking the North’s formal name. She reiterated Pyongyang's support 'for the just fight of Russia’s military and people to defend their country’s sovereign rights and security interests' in Ukraine. Moscow and Pyongyang have responded vaguely to South Korean and Western claims of the North Korean troop deployment to Russia, emphasizing that their military cooperation conforms with international law, without directly admitting the presence of the North’s forces in Russia. The United States and its allies also have accused North Korea of providing millions of artillery shells and other equipment to Russia to fuel its military action in Ukraine. Russia, along with China, has blocked U.S.-led efforts at the Security Council to tighten sanctions on North Korea over its recent missile testing, which intensified after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Russia also vetoed a U.N. resolution to extend the mandate of monitors in March, in a move that effectively abolished oversight by U.N. experts of Security Council sanctions against North Korea. South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol last month raised the possibility of supplying Ukraine with weapons while saying Seoul is preparing countermeasures that could be rolled out in stages depending on the degree of military cooperation between Pyongyang and Moscow. South Korea, a growing arms exporter, has provided humanitarian aid and other non-lethal support to Ukraine and joined U.S.-led economic sanctions against Moscow. It has so far resisted calls by Kyiv and NATO to directly supply Ukraine with weapons, citing a longstanding policy of not providing arms to countries engaged in active conflict. In other developments: — Russia launched three aviation missiles and 48 drones of various types, including Shaheds, at Ukraine overnight, Ukrainian air force said. One missile and 31 drones were intercepted, 14 drones were jammed, three drones flew to the territory of Belarus, the air force said in a report on Friday morning said. Several civilian facilities, as well as apartment buildings and private houses in Poltava, Cherkasy, Kyiv and Odesa regions were damaged by drone debris. — The Russian military on Friday said it intercepted and destroyed a total of 83 Ukrainian drones over four Russian regions near the border with Ukraine and the annexed Crimean Peninsula. In the Bryansk region, a drone hit a residential block, local authorities said. No casualties were reported. In the Stavropol region, a drone hit an oil depot, according to local officials.

After Halloween, Christians observe All Saints' Day	WARSAW, Poland (AP) — It's the time of year — tradition says — when the veil between the worlds of the living and the dead is lifted. That traditional belief has morphed over the centuries into the spooky and secular celebration of Halloween. But one day later, Christians in many countries around the world are celebrating All Saints' Day on Friday, a somber and spiritual day in the church's liturgical calendar that shares pagan roots with Halloween. The word 'Halloween' derives from 'All Hallows Eve,' which means the eve of All Saints’ Day, a holiday that has also been known as All Hallows. It honors martyrs and saints — those who were hallowed, or deemed holy — a tradition begun by the Roman Catholic church in the early medieval period. Scholars believe that the spectral aspects of Halloween emerged primarily from Samhain, an ancient Celtic festival that occurred during the harvest season, said Morgan Shipley, a professor of religious studies at Michigan State University in East Lansing. It was a time when people were 'transitioning from harvest and bounty and the fullness of summer to the desolation of winter,' he said. 'And it was said that in this time the veil between the physical, material human world and the spiritual world essentially dissipates away.' Some of the spirits or spectral beings were viewed as demonic in nature, and bonfires became a way to ward them away, or were used in divination by druid priests and priestesses when the veil between the material and spiritual world broke down, he said. As Christianity spread, many pagan rituals were adapted to the new faith to be more attractive to converts. The period of reflecting on the dead continues though Nov. 2, which is All Souls’ Day. In Central Europe, the Slavic and Baltic populations had their own rituals in which the living communed with the dead between Oct. 31 and Nov. 1. Believers and non-believers alike in many traditionally Roman Catholic societies observe the day. Finka Heynemann, 34, visited Warsaw's Brodno cemetery on Friday morning with her mother. The two had plans to visit six cemeteries in Warsaw where generations of ancestors are buried over three days — even though they are not religious. 'It's just important to keep the tradition and visit the graves and to respect and honor ancestors,' Heynemann said. 'This day is more important than Christmas or Easter,' added her mother, Maja Gąssowska, who paused to drop money in a collection box for a Polish cemetery in the Ukrainian city of Lviv, which was once part of Poland. In Poland, many travel back to their family homes to gather with those still living and reflect on those who have left them. So many people observe the holiday that cemeteries are transformed into flickering carpets of light so impressive that even the most secular cannot help but feel moved. Cities, including Warsaw and Krakow, run many additional tram and bus lines to ferry the huge numbers to — and between — cemeteries. While the reflections are mostly personal, people also leave candles at the graves of national heroes. So many people visit cemeteries at the same time that the celebration takes on a communal quality. It has become so much part of the wider culture in Poland that people place candles in the Jewish and Muslim cemeteries as well. In the Philippines, millions trooped to cemeteries across the country Friday to observe the annual tradition, visiting tombs of their loved ones. 'Even if I’m old, I still visit the tombs of my relatives, especially my husband’s, during All Saints’ Day,' said Manila resident Dory Oliquino, who was among thousands offering flowers and candles at the Manila North Cemetery in the country's capital. 'As long as I can walk, I will visit him.' All Saints’ Day has been a family reunion for many Filipinos, where they keep vigil at the tombs. Italians traditionally visit cemeteries to pay tribute to deceased family members on All Souls' Day, lighting candles or laying flowers. Pope Francis will visit Rome’s third-largest cemetery, the Laurentino Cemetery, to celebrate Mass and lead prayers for the dead. The pope visited the same cemetery in 2018, stopping to pray in an area dedicated to fetuses. In recent years as the holiday approaches, there are discussions about Halloween and its compatibility with Christian beliefs in the afterlife. Poles began to celebrate Halloween after the fall of communism in 1989, but some worry that the foreign cultural import could eventual dilute the tradition of All Saints' Day. Some Catholics worry that it also might be sinful due to allusions to devils and ghosts. Pushing back, some church groups have begun holding alternative events for All Saints’ Day. This week, a church group organized the 3rd All Saints’ Ball in the Polish town of Plock, according to a Catholic news site, Niedziela — meaning Sunday — which reported that 'the children came dressed as saints and blessed of the Catholic Church and as angels.' ___ Associated Press writers Colleen Barry in Milan and Basilio Sepe in Manila, Philippines, contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/all-saints-day-2024-world-christian-catholic-36f7b8599b2336d7c700c532db2e26dc	2024-11-01T01:34:43-07:00	
Spanish residents appeal for help, 3 days after historic floods left at least 158 dead	MADRID (AP) — Three days after historic flash floods swept through several towns in southern Valencia, in eastern Spain, the initial shock was giving way to anger, frustration and a wave of solidarity on Friday. Many streets are still blocked by piled-up vehicles and debris, in some cases trapping residents in their homes. Some places still don't have electricity, running water, or stable telephone connections. Residents turned to media to appeal for help. 'This is a disaster. There are a lot of elderly people who don’t have medicine. There are children who don’t have food. We don’t have milk, we don’t have water. We have no access to anything,' a resident of Alfafar, one of the most affected towns in south Valencia, told state television station TVE. 'No one even came to warn us on the first day.' So far 158 bodies have been recovered — 155 in Valencia, two in the Castilla La Mancha region and one more in Andalusia — after Spain's deadliest natural disaster in living memory. Members of the security forces and soldiers are busy searching for an unknown number of missing people, many feared to still be trapped in wrecked vehicles or flooded garages. And as authorities repeat over and over, more storms are expected. The Spanish weather agency issued alerts for strong rains in Tarragona, Catalonia, as well as part of the Balearic Islands. Meanwhile, flood survivors and volunteers are engaged in the titanic task of clearing an omnipresent layer of dense mud. Residents in communities like Paiporta, where at least 62 people died, and Catarroja, have been walking kilometers (miles) to Valencia to get provisions, passing neighbors from unaffected areas who are bringing carry water, essential products or shovels to help remove the mud. Juan Ramón Adsuara, the mayor of Alfafar, one of the hardest hit towns, said the aid isn't nearly enough for residents trapped in an 'extreme situation.' 'There are people living with corpses at home. It’s very sad. We are organizing ourselves, but we are running out of everything,' he told reporters. 'We go with vans to Valencia, we buy and we come back, but here we are totally forgotten.' Rushing water turned narrow streets into death traps and spawned rivers that tore through homes and businesses, leaving many uninhabitable. Social networks have channeled the needs of those affected. Some posted images of missing people in the hope of getting information about their whereabouts, while others launched initiatives such as Suport Mutu — or Mutual Support — which connects requests for help with people who are offering it; and others organized collections of basic goods throughout all the country or launched fundraisers. Spain’s Mediterranean coast is used to autumn storms that can cause flooding, but this was the most powerful flash flooding in recent memory. Scientists link it to climate change, which is also behind increasingly high temperatures and droughts in Spain and the heating up of the Mediterranean Sea. Human-caused climate change has doubled the likelihood of a storm like this week’s deluge in Valencia, according to a partial analysis issued Thursday by World Weather Attribution, a group made up of dozens of international scientists who study global warming’s role in extreme weather. Spain has suffered through an almost two-year drought, making the flooding worse because the dry ground was so hard that it could not absorb the rain. In August 1996, a flood swept away a campsite along the Gallego river in Biescas, in the northeast, killing 87 people.	https://apnews.com/article/flash-floods-spain-valencia-climate-change-c49df08e233b3f791ed27921acdbb752	2024-11-01T01:33:35-07:00	
Greek police say fatal Athens apartment blast was likely caused by improvised bomb	ATHENS, Greece (AP) — Greek police said Friday that an explosion in an Athens apartment that killed a man and severely wounded a woman appeared to have been caused by an improvised bomb. Police searching the wrecked apartment seized two handguns and ammunition, authorities said in a statement, as well as mobile phones and other 'digital evidence.' The statement added that the blast is being investigated by the police’s special violent crimes unit. Firefighters who responded to the explosion Thursday afternoon freed the wounded woman from the wreckage, and later found the man’s body while using sniffer dogs to search the apartment for other survivors, the fire service said. The injured woman is Greek, police said, while the dead man has not been identified. No further details on her identity were released. The explosion in the capital’s central residential neighborhood of Ambelokipi demolished internal and external walls in a third-floor apartment, blowing away its balcony railings and damaging neighboring apartments. Greece has a decades-long history of far-left extremism involving small urban groups, while organized crime and racketeering groups have also carried out small-scale bombings and targeted killings. The major extremist groups that carried out a string of assassinations from the mid 1970s to the early 2000s have been eradicated and their members jailed. They were succeeded by smaller and less efficient groups which mostly staged bomb attacks on symbols of state authority and wealth but have been largely dormant in recent years.	https://apnews.com/article/greece-apartment-blast-investigation-bomb-d5e33088eb3fa578b3eeea64a67cf9b3	2024-11-01T01:04:56-07:00	
Colm McLoughlin, Irishman who led Dubai Duty Free to become an airport retail giant, dies at age 81	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Colm McLoughlin, an Irishman who landed in the deserts of the United Arab Emirates and helped lead Dubai Duty Free into becoming an airport retail behemoth generating billions of dollars, has died. He was 81. McLoughlin ran Dubai Duty Free from 1983 until he retired earlier this year, a span of over 40 years that saw Dubai grow from a creekside trading port into a modern metropolis, home to the world's tallest building and other attractions. And all the millions of passengers coming into Dubai International Airport, now the world's busiest for international travel, saw the rows of electronics, cigarettes, cigars, alcohol and other goods available duty-free at his stores, hawked by a salesforce in green suit jackets, yellow ties and conversing in multiple languages. 'It’s a very Middle Eastern kind of thing,' McLoughlin told the Los Angeles Times in 1987 as he showed off its gold market. 'We have to cater to a lot of tastes.' Dubai Duty Free said in a statement that McLoughlin died Wednesday after a short illness, without elaborating. The operation's new managing director, Ramesh Cidambi, praised McLoughlin for steering its 'growth to a $2 billion dollar business with over 6,000 employees at the time of his retirement.' Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum, the CEO of long-haul carrier Emirates and chairman of Dubai Duty Free, offered his condolences. 'His passion, commitment and pioneering spirit have left a lasting legacy,' Sheikh Ahmed said in a post on the social platform X. Born in Ballinasloe, Ireland, in 1943, McLoughlin joined Shannon Airport's first-in-the-world duty-free operation in 1969. In July 1983, he came with a 10-man team to Dubai to set up the sandy airport's duty-free operation. His six-month contract ended up stretching into 40 years. Like the rest of the aviation industry, Dubai Duty Free took a hit during the years of the coronavirus pandemic and airline groundings. But sales have since bounced back. In 2023 alone, under McLoughlin, Dubai Duty Free sold 6 million cans of beer, 2.3 million bottles of whiskey, 2.3 million cartons of cigarettes, 10.2 million cigars and 3.3 million bottles of perfume. One big segment has been Chinese travelers, after Dubai Duty Free worked to accept their credit cards, had staff speaking Mandarin and put in goods they wanted. 'We would be silly if we didn’t take advantage of it and try to serve them,' McLoughlin told The Associated Press in 2012. And many a bleary-eyed traveler in Dubai's cavernous airport tried their luck at the constant raffles being offered, whether for $1 million, a luxury automobile or a racing motorcycle. McLoughlin also was known for Dubai Duty Free's sponsorship of tennis and golf tournaments, as well as his work supporting Dubai's Irish community. He received the Irish Presidential Distinguished Service Award in 2014. 'Colm McLoughlin has been an integral part of the Irish community in the UAE,' his award citation read. 'Both in his highly successful professional career with Dubai Duty Free and in his leadership roles across almost every Irish organization, Colm McLouglin has played a hugely positive role in the promotion of Irish interests in the UAE.' McLoughlin is survived by his wife Breeda, son Niall, daughters Tyna and Mandy, and their families.	https://apnews.com/article/colm-mcloughlin-obituary-dubai-duty-free-emirates-uae-82a1855bcc19735262f8645cc6a86b93	2024-11-01T00:34:15-07:00	
Algeria pardons and releases journalist Ihsane El Kadi	ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) — Algeria has pardoned a journalist who emerged as a key voice during the country’s 2019 pro-democracy protests and was later imprisoned for taking foreign funding for his media outlets and threatening state security. Ihsane El Kadi was released from prison on Thursday evening, along with eight others who were imprisoned after criticizing the state. Their release coincided with the 70th anniversary of the start of Algeria's revolution, a date that authorities have in the past used as an occasion to offer pardons. Fetta Saddat, one of El Kadi's lawyers, told The Associated Press that he was released from El Harrah prison after receiving a presidential pardon. He had been serving a sentence for receiving foreign financing for Radio M and Maghreb Emergent, two media projects that were key outlets during the Hirak protests that led to the resignation of octogenarian president Abdelaziz Bouteflika in 2019. He was among 4,000 released on Thursday based on clemency decrees signed by President Abdelmadjid Tebboune, according to a statement from his office. Those released included people imprisoned for low level crimes and for 'undermining public order,' a charge that Algerian authorities have used to target dissidents in the past.	https://apnews.com/article/algeria-journalist-pardon-el-kadi-cdbc754b51e40f09777cd944bf4bc1ab	2024-11-01T00:13:33-07:00	
Seismic change in Botswana as party that ruled for 58 years loses power	GABORONE, Botswana (AP) — Botswana's President Mokgweetsi Masisi conceded defeat in the general election Friday, in a seismic moment of change for the country that ended the ruling party's 58 years in power since independence from Britain in the 1960s. Masisi's concession came before final results were announced, with his Botswana Democratic Party trailing in fourth place in the parliamentary elections in what appeared to be a humbling rejection by voters and a landslide victory for the main opposition party. The opposition Umbrella for Democratic Change held an overwhelming lead in the partial results, making its candidate, Duma Boko, the favorite to become president of a southern African country that is one of the world's biggest producers of mined diamonds. Masisi said he had called Boko to inform him he was conceding defeat and said that Boko was now effectively the president-elect. Final results were expected to be announced later Friday, but the BDP had no path to a majority. 'I concede the election,' Masisi said in an early-morning press conference two days after the vote. 'I am proud of our democratic processes. Although I wanted a second term, I will respectfully step aside and participate in a smooth transition process.' 'I look forward to attending the coming inauguration and cheering on my successor. He will enjoy my support.' Masisi's BDP dominated politics in Botswana for nearly six decades, since independence in 1966. The nation of just 2.5 million people will now be governed by another party for the first time in its democratic history. So far, the Umbrella for Democratic Change has won 25 out of the 61 parliamentary seats decided by voters, according to the official partial count. It needs 31 to clinch a majority. The Botswana Congress Party has seven seats, the Botswana Patriotic Front five seats, and the ruling BDP just three. 'We lost this election massively,' Masisi said. Botswana has been held up as one of Africa's most stable democracies and is regarded as a post-colonial success story having built one of the highest standards of living in the region through an economy that largely relies on diamonds. Botswana is the world's second biggest natural diamond producer behind Russia and has been responsible for all the biggest diamonds found in the last decade. But Botswana faces new challenges and the mood for change became evident as a downturn in the global demand for diamonds badly impacted the economy, becoming the central issue for the campaign. Unemployment rose to more than 27% this year, and significantly higher for young people, as the government saw a sharp decrease in revenue from diamonds. Masisi and his party had faced criticism for not having done enough to diversify the economy and the nation has been forced to adopt recent austerity measures. Even the BDP conceded throughout its campaign that policy change was needed and tried to convince voters it was capable of leading the country out of its economic troubles. Diamonds account for more than 80% of Botswana's exports and a quarter of its GDP, according to the World Bank. Masisi said the country had hardly sold any diamonds since April through its Debswana company, which the government jointly owns with diamond miner De Beers. Botswana's general elections decide the makeup of its Parliament, and lawmakers then choose the president. The party that gains a majority is in position to choose its candidate as president. All five of Botswana's post-independence presidents have been from the BDP. Boko is a 54-year-old lawyer and Harvard Law School graduate who also ran in 2014 and 2019. He posted on his official page on X: 'Botswana First' with a picture of a UDC campaign poster with the words 'Change is Here.' The BDP was one of the longest-serving parties in Africa still in power and its sharp defeat came as a surprise after what was expected to be a tight race. It followed an equally momentous change in neighboring South Africa, where the long-ruling African National Congress lost its 30-year majority in an election in May and was forced to share power for the first time in a coalition government. Masisi, a 63-year-old former high school teacher and UNICEF employee, said he had not expected the results and had 'not packed a shoe.' ___ This story has been updated to correct the spelling of President Mokgweetsi Masisi's first name. ___ AP Africa news: https://apnews.com/hub/africa	https://apnews.com/article/botswana-election-masisi-concedes-80951b62fdb7169f073c2b13acaff1b6	2024-10-31T22:31:07-07:00	
Middle East latest: Israel pounds Beirut suburb Dahiyeh with airstrikes overnight	Israel’s air force pounded Beirut’s southern suburb of Dahiyeh overnight, destroying dozens of buildings in several neighborhoods, Lebanon’s state-run National News Agency said Friday. There was no immediate word on casualties. Recently, Israel has intensified its airstrikes on the northeastern city of Baalbek and nearby villages, as well as different parts of southern Lebanon. International mediators are ramping up efforts to halt the wars in Lebanon and the Gaza Strip, circulating new proposals to wind down the regional conflict. Lebanon’s Heath Ministry said more than 2,800 people have been killed and 13,000 wounded since Oct. 8, 2023, when Hezbollah began firing rockets almost daily into Israel, drawing retaliation. The death toll from more than a year of the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza has passed 43,000, Palestinian officials reported this week, without distinguishing between civilians and combatants. The war began after Hamas-led militants stormed into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people — mostly civilians — and abducting 250 others. ___ Here’s the latest: An Israeli airstrike on the edge of Qamatiyeh in Lebanon kills 3 and wounds 5 BERIUT — Lebanon’s Health Ministry says an Israeli airstrike on a mountain town overlooking Beirut has killed three people and wounded five. The ministry gave no further details about the early Friday airstrike on the edge of Qamatiyeh, southeast of Beirut. An Associated Press journalist who visited the scene said the strike was closer to the nearby village of Ein al-Rummaneh, adding that it caused minor damage to an apartment on the first floor of a building. On Oct. 6, an Israeli strike in Qamatiyeh killed six people, including three children, Lebanon’s Health Ministry said. Thailand tells Israel not to allow workers to enter closed military zones after 4 are killed in northern Israel BANGKOK — The employer of the Thai workers killed and injured in northern Israel had received permission from the Israeli military to bring the workers to the area for about 1-2 hours, said Nikorndej Balankura, spokesperson of Thailand’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, adding Friday that the employer was also killed. The worker who was injured was in serious condition and was being treated at a hospital in Haifa, he said, and the Thai embassy was already in touch with the families of the deceased. Projectiles fired Thursday from Lebanon into northern Israel killed seven people, including four Thai workers, in the deadliest such attack since Israeli troops invaded Lebanon in early October. Israel’s northernmost town, Metula is surrounded by Lebanon on three sides and has sustained heavy damage from rockets. The town’s residents evacuated in October 2023, and only security officials and agricultural workers remain there. Nikorndej said Thailand has called on Israel to refrain from granting permissions for Thai workers to enter closed military zones from now on, to prevent such losses from happening again. 'Thailand reiterates its call on all conflicting parties to immediately cease any retaliatory actions to prevent the situation from prolonging and aggravating, and to restore regional peace and stability in the Middle East region,' he said. Israel pounds Beirut suburb overnight with airstrikes BEIRUT — Israel’s air force resumed airstrikes on Beirut’s southern suburb, destroying buildings in several neighborhoods, Lebanon’s state-run National News Agency said Friday. There was no immediate word on casualties. The early Friday airstrikes on Dahiyeh — after a four-day lull during which no airstrikes were reported in the suburb — destroyed dozens of buildings and caused fires in the area, the agency said. In recent days, Israel has intensified its airstrikes on the northeastern city of Baalbek and nearby villages, as well as different parts of southern Lebanon.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-hezbollah-mideast-latest-1-november-2024-6ea222bd6dbe87123934833e92626aeb	2024-10-31T22:17:14-07:00	
Australian judge rules senator broke race law by telling rival legislator to return to Pakistan	MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — An Australian judge ruled Friday that anti-immigration party leader Sen. Pauline Hanson breached a racial anti-discrimination law by crudely telling Pakistan-born Sen. Mehreen Faruqi to return to her homeland. Faruqi sued Hanson in Federal Court over a 2022 exchange on the social media platform X, then called Twitter, under a provision of the Racial Discrimination Act that bans public actions and statements that offend, insult, humiliate or intimidate people because of their race, color or national or ethnic origin. After the death of Queen Elizabeth II, Faruqi, deputy leader of the Australian Greens party, posted, 'I cannot mourn the leader of a racist empire built on stolen lives, land and wealth of colonized peoples.' Hanson, the leader of the One Nation party, replied that Faruqi had immigrated to take 'advantage' of Australia, and told the Lahore-born Muslim to return to Pakistan, using an expletive. Hanson has been known for her views on race since her first speech to Parliament in 1996, in which she said Australia was 'in danger of being swamped by Asians' because of its non-discriminatory immigration policy. She once wore a burqa in the Senate as part of a campaign to have Islamic face coverings banned. Faruqi, a trained engineer, moved to Australia with her husband in 1992 as skilled economic migrants. Justice Angus Stewart found that Hanson had engaged in 'seriously offensive' and intimidating behavior. The post was racist, nativist and anti-Muslim, Stewart said. 'It is a strong form of racism,' he said. Stewart ordered Hanson to delete the offensive post and pay Faruqi’s legal costs, saying they would 'amount to a fairly substantial sum.' Faruqi welcomed the ruling as a vindication for 'every single person who has been told to go back to where they came from. And believe me, there are too many of us who have been subjected to this ultimate racist slur, far too many times in this country.' 'Today’s ruling tells us that telling someone to go back to where they came from is a strong form of racism,' Faruqi told reporters. 'Today is a good day for people of color, for Muslims and all of us who have been working so hard to build an anti-racist society,' she said. The Australian Muslim Advocacy Network, a human and civil rights organization representing the 3.2% of Australians who identified as Muslim in the latest census, said the ruling 'serves as a strong warning to those who perpetrate racism in politics and the media.' Hanson said she was 'deeply disappointed' by the ruling and would appeal. The verdict demonstrated an 'inappropriately broad application' of the section of the Racial Discrimination Act that she was found to have breached, particularly in how that section impinged upon freedom of political expression, Hanson said in a statement. Hanson’s lawyers argued that that her post was exempt from the law because of constitutionally implied freedom of political communication. Hanson said she considered the queen’s death a matter of public interest and that Faruqi’s views on the death were also a matter of public interest. Stewart found that Hanson’s tweet did not respond to any point made in Faruqi’s tweet. 'Sen. Hanson’s tweet was merely an angry ad hominem attack devoid of discernible content (or comment) in response to what Sen. Faruqi had said,' Stewart wrote in his decision. Stewart described Hanson’s testimony as 'generally unreliable,' rejecting her claim that she did not know Faruqi’s religion when she posted her response. Hanson told the court she had called for a ban on Muslim immigration in the past, but described that as her personal opinion rather than her minor party’s policy. She conceded she had once said in a media interview she would not sell her house to a Muslim, but would not say whether she had meant what she had said. Australia is an increasingly multicultural society. Australians born overseas or who have at least one overseas-born parent became a majority in the latest census in 2021.	https://apnews.com/article/australia-racial-discrimination-pakistan-pauline-hanson-mehreen-faruqi-3a4bfbf4f3c3051bd55da6f89f59419a	2024-10-31T21:21:08-07:00	
Stock market today: Global stocks are mixed after a sharp decline on Wall St driven by Big Tech	HONG KONG (AP) — European markets opened higher while Asian stocks were mostly lower on Friday, with Japan's benchmark Nikkei losing over 2% after a sharp decline on Wall Street. France’s CAC 40 added 0.4% in early trading to 7,377.79, and Germany’s DAX gained 0.2% to 19,116.71. Britain’s FTSE 100 climbed 0.4% to 8,143.82. Dow futures edged up 0.1% to 42,004.00, and S&amp;P 500 futures were up 0.3% at 5,753.00. Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 sank 2.6% to 38,053.67. On Thursday, the Bank of Japan announced it would keep its benchmark rate unchanged at 0.25%, ​​which was in line with market expectations. The Japanese yen traded lower Friday. The dollar rose to 152.61 Japanese yen from 152.00 yen. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index was the exception to Friday's downturn vibe. It added 0.9% to 20,506.43, while the Shanghai Composite index was up in morning trading but slipped 0.2% later in the day to close at 3,272.01. Factory activity in China went back into growth in October, with the official manufacturing purchasing managers’ index released Thursday reaching 50.1, ending five straight months of contraction. Another private survey Friday showed a reading of 50.3, above the expansion line of 50. Australia’s S&amp;P/ASX 200 dropped 0.5% to 8,118.80 after its producer price index in the third quarter rose 3.9% year-on-year — a return to below 4.0% annual growth for the first time since September 2023, according to data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics. Elsewhere, South Korea’s Kospi lost 0.5% to 2,543.36. Taiwan’s Taiex fell 0.2%, weighed down by a 0.5% decline in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp., Apple's chip supplier. Apple’s quarterly earnings report Thursday revealed a drop in sales revenue from China. On Thursday, the S&amp;P 500 sank 1.9% to 5,705.45 for its worst day in eight weeks, falling further from its record set earlier in October. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0.9% to 41,763.46, while the Nasdaq composite tumbled 2.8% to 18,095.15 for a second-straight loss after setting its latest all-time high. The tumble for Big Tech on the last day of October wiped out the S&amp;P 500’s gain for the month. The index fell 1% for its first down month in the past six, even though it set an all-time high during that period. In the bond market, Treasury yields edged lower following a mixed set of reports on the U.S. economy. One report said a measure of inflation that the Federal Reserve likes to use slowed to 2.1% in September from 2.3%. That’s almost all the way back to the Fed’s 2% target, though underlying trends — after ignoring food and energy costs — were a touch hotter than economists expected. A separate report said growth in workers’ wages and benefits slowed during the summer. That could put less pressure on upcoming inflation. A third report, meanwhile, said fewer U.S. workers applied for unemployment benefits the previous week. That’s an indication that the number of layoffs remains relatively low across the country. Treasury yields bobbed up and down several times after the reports, before moving lower. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.27% from 4.30% late Wednesday. That’s still up sharply from the roughly 3.60% level it was at in the middle of September. In other dealings, U.S. benchmark crude oil gained $2.03 to $71.29 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude, the international standard, surged $1.82 to $74.63 per barrel. The euro fell to $1.0859 from $1.0885.	https://apnews.com/article/stock-market-1-november-2024-e38ab146c7e9d1148cbdd215a22a1796	2024-10-31T21:03:42-07:00	
Israel fights a seemingly endless war in Gaza's most devastated region	JERUSALEM (AP) — More than a year into a war that has ricocheted across the Middle East, Israeli troops are still battling Hamas in the most heavily destroyed and isolated part of the Gaza Strip. In northern Gaza, Hamas militants carry out hit-and-run attacks from bombed-out buildings. Residents say Israeli forces have raided shelters for the displaced, forcing people out at gunpoint. First responders say they can barely operate because of the Israeli bombardment. Since its Oct. 7 attack into Israel that sparked the war in Gaza, Hamas has taken heavy losses. The recent killing of its top leader, Yahya Sinwar, was viewed as a possible turning point, yet the two sides do not appear any closer to a cease-fire, and Hamas, which still holds scores of hostages, remains the dominant power in Gaza. The conflict has drawn in militants from Lebanon to Yemen, and their key sponsor, Iran, has inched closer to all-out war with Israel. But in northern Gaza, the war seems stuck in a loop of devastating Israeli offensives, followed by Hamas fighters regrouping. Israel is once again ordering mass evacuations, severely restricting aid despite global outrage and raiding hospitals it says are used by militants. In the northern border town of Beit Lahiya — one of the first targets of last year’s ground invasion — two Israeli strikes this week killed at least 88 Palestinians, including dozens of women and children. The military said its target was a spotter on the roof. As the war grinds on, Israel is resorting to ever more draconian measures. There is even talk of adopting a surrender-or-starve strategy proposed by former generals. On Monday, Israel passed legislation that could severely restrict the U.N. agency that is the largest aid provider in Gaza despite protests by the United States and other close allies. It accuses the agency of allowing itself to be infiltrated by Hamas, allegations denied by the U.N. Another offensive, as Hamas keeps filling the void Israel launched its latest offensive in northern Gaza in early October, focusing on Jabaliya, a crowded, decades-old urban refugee camp where it says Hamas had regrouped. Hamas-led militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted another 250 that day. Israel’s offensive has killed over 43,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza health authorities, who do not say how many were combatants but say more than half were women and children. Israel says it has killed over 17,000 fighters, without providing evidence, and the United States says Hamas is no longer capable of mounting an Oct. 7-style attack. But Israeli forces have repeatedly returned to areas where they had battled before — only to face renewed attacks. At least 16 Israeli soldiers have been killed in northern Gaza since the latest operation began, including a 41-year-old colonel. Israel has yet to lay out a plan for postwar Gaza and has rejected a U.S. push for the Western-backed Palestinian Authority to return and govern with Arab support. Plainclothes Hamas security men still patrol most areas. 'It’s endless war,' said Michael Milshtein, a former Israeli military intelligence officer who now leads a Palestinian studies program at Tel Aviv University. He says Israel has only two options to break the cycle: Either completely reoccupy Gaza, which would require several thousand troops to be stationed there indefinitely. Or secure a cease-fire with Hamas that involves the release of its hostages in exchange for Palestinians in Israeli jails, and a full Israeli withdrawal — the kind of deal that has long eluded U.S. and Arab mediators. 'We are in Jabaliya for the fourth time, and maybe in the next month we will find ourselves there for the fifth and the sixth.' he said. ‘Leave now’ if you care about the lives of your children Around a million people fled the north, including Gaza City, when Israel ordered its wholesale evacuation at the start of the war. They have not been allowed to return. Some 400,000 have remained, even as Israel has encircled the area and obliterated entire neighborhoods and critical infrastructure. The U.N. says at least 60,000 people have fled to Gaza City in recent weeks from Jabaliya and the northern border towns of Beit Hanoun and Beit Lahiya. Residents who remain describe being stuck in their homes for days at a time because of the fighting, with bodies rotting in the streets and rescue teams unable to venture out. Amna Mustafa and her children were asleep before dawn in a crowded school-turned-shelter in Beit Lahiya last week when an Israeli drone hovering overhead ordered everyone to evacuate. 'If you care about your life and the lives of your children, leave now,' it said. She said men were ordered to strip down and taken away in trucks. The military says it makes every effort to avoid harming civilians, and that such procedures are used to search and detain militants who it says hide among civilians. Women and children were ordered to walk to a nearby hospital, where Israeli soldiers searched them before allowing most to walk onward to Gaza City, several miles (kilometers) to the south. Mustafa said she spent two nights in the open before moving into a new tent camp in a soccer field. 'There is no food, no water, no blankets, no diapers and no milk for the children,' she said. 'We are here waiting for God’s mercy.' The Israeli military shared drone footage of a similar exodus, showing thousands of people walking down a plowed up road past tanks. It said Hamas had prevented them from leaving before its forces arrived, without providing evidence. The U.N. human rights office warned earlier this month that Israel 'may be causing the destruction of the Palestinian population in Gaza’s northernmost governate through death and displacement.' Israel restricts aid despite U.S. warnings Israel has severely restricted aid to Gaza in October, allowing in only about a third of the humanitarian assistance that entered the previous month. Alia Zaki, a spokesperson for the World Food Program, said Israel has not allowed U.N. agencies to deliver aid to the north outside of Gaza City since the latest offensive began. Col. Elad Goren, a spokesperson for COGAT, the Israeli military body in charge of civilian affairs in Gaza, attributed the lack of aid in the first half of the month to Jewish holiday closures and troop movements. At a briefing last week, he said there was no need for aid deliveries in Beit Hanoun and Beit Lahiya because there was 'no population' left in either town. That was before this week’s strikes on Beit Lahiya killed scores of people. The Biden administration has told Israel to increase the supply of aid entering Gaza, warning it of U.S. laws that could require it to reduce its crucial military support. Does Israel plan to empty the north? Palestinians fear Israel is carrying out a strategy proposed by former generals in which aid to the north would be cut off, civilians would be ordered to leave and anyone remaining would be branded a militant. Rights groups say the plan would violate international law. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who visited the region last week for the 11th time since the start of the war, said Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told him that Israel had not adopted the plan. The military has denied receiving such orders. But the Israeli government has not publicly repudiated the plan, even after Blinken’s visit. Milshtein says the fact that Israel is even considering it is 'a post-traumatic phenomenon' born of desperation. 'Many people in the (Israeli military) know it’s a bad idea... But they say: ’OK, we don’t have any other plan, so let’s try it.' ___ Magdy reported from Cairo and Krauss from Dubai, United Arab Emirates. ___ Follow AP’s war coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-northern-gaza-displacement-aid-20628253b26a2bdcf3c844850f20da38	2024-10-31T21:01:18-07:00	
Taiwanese driver recounts his narrow escape during Typhoon Kong-rey	TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) — A ride-hailing driver recounted Friday how he had narrow escape when a huge tree smashed onto his vehicle as Typhoon Kong-rey swept over Taiwan, also sweeping away metal roofs and sending landslides onto roads and railway tracks and into houses. Song Zi-jie had just dropped off riders in Taipei, the capital city, and was stopped at a red light on Thursday night when a tree was uprooted and fell squarely onto the passenger compartment of his car. He felt the roof hit his head and reclined his seat but couldn’t open the rear door. He lay there until police found him. 'I was so frightened that I didn’t know what to do,' said Song, who wasn’t injured despite the extensive damage to his vehicle. 'It took me a while to return to normal.' Two people died, four people are missing and 580 others were injured by Kong-rey in Taiwan. It weakened to a tropical storm after leaving the island but was still bringing heavy rain and windy conditions to Shanghai and nearby parts of China’s east coast on Friday. Kong-rey, which is a Cambodian name, was heading northeast along the coast with winds of 83 kilometers (52 miles) per hour and could make landfall in Zhejiang province before veering back out to sea, the National Meteorological Center said. Zhejiang authorities evacuated about 280,000 people and opened more than 10,000 emergency shelters ahead of the storm, the official Xinhua News Agency said. Both Zhejiang and neighboring Fujian province also suspended multiple ferry routes. In Taiwan, a Czech couple who had gone missing while hiking in the mountains were found and airlifted out of Taroko National Park by helicopter on Friday. They told Taiwanese TV network EBC that they hadn't been aware of the approaching typhoon but were able to call for help with their mobile phones and mostly stayed in their tent until rescuers arrived. The two fatalities in Taiwan were a man hit by a utility pole that fell over when a tree dragged down nearby power lines in Taipei and a Thai woman who was in a small truck that was hit by a tree. Workers cut and cleared up fallen trees in Taipei on Friday, while schools and offices largely reopened and public services were gradually restored across Taiwan. The typhoon passed north of the Philippines earlier in the week, prompting fresh evacuations just days after devastating Tropical Storm Trami killed at least 145 people. Intense rainfall and flooding caused in part by Trami also killed seven people in China and eight people in Vietnam this week, Xinhua reported. The deaths in China were in Hainan province, a southern island known for its beach resorts. ___ Moritsugu reported from Beijing.

Pets join Mexico's Day of the Dead celebrations, as Fido and Tiger get their own altars	MEXICO CITY (AP) — Pets are not forgotten during Mexico's famed Day of the Dead celebrations, when even Fido and Tiger get a place at the altars Mexican families set up to honor their deceased loved ones, complete with flowers, candles and photographs. Though the human dead usually get their favorite food or drink placed on altars, the nature of pet food can make things a little different. The holiday has roots in Mexican pre-Hispanic customs, as does the reverence for animals. The small, hairless dogs that Mexicans kept before the Spanish conquest were believed to help guide their owners to the afterlife, and were sometimes given special burials. But the inclusion of pets on family altars has grown in recent years. Day of the Dead begins Oct. 31, to remember those humans who died in accidents; it continues Nov. 1 to mark those who died in childhood and then Nov. 2 to those who died as adults. Observances include entire families cleaning and decorating graves, which are covered with orange marigolds. At both cemeteries and at home altars, relatives light candles, put out offerings of the favorite foods and beverages of their deceased relatives. The presence of pets has gained such momentum that now Oct. 27 is considered Day of the Dead for pets and the National Anthropology and History Institute includes tips on its social platforms for how to include them in altars. Mexico City graphic designer Meztli Lizaola makes sure every year that her beloved tawny-coated Chihuahua, Taco — who died two years ago — has a place at the altar on a table in the corner of her living room. Taco's ashes are there in an urn, and so is his lively-eyed photo, next to a photo of Lizaola's deceased father. The orange-flowered cempasúchil — a type of marigold — is placed around the photos, as well as candles and figurines of skulls. Taco was an omnivorous eater and — as his name suggests — enjoyed tacos (especially roast pork) and other traditional Mexican human foods like quesadillas and concha pastries. But because she has four other dogs, she can't leave Taco's favorite foods on the altar; some sneaky pup is likely to snatch it. For years now, elements of Halloween have been mixing into the seasonal festivities, and for pets it's no different. For those who still have living dogs and cats, it is not uncommon to find a wide variety of pet Halloween costumes at pet shops, including inmate-style 'bad dog' costumes. Ethnohistorian Juan Pablo García Urióstegui says the inclusion of pets and Halloween influences are part of changes in the traditional holiday that have accelerated, particularly in the last three years, 'We are experiencing changes in the traditions. It is happening very fast,' said García Urióstegui, of Mexico's National Anthropology Museum. Now it's not unusual to find pets on airplanes, in bars and restaurants or even at their owners' medical appointments. For one thing, especially in big cities, the large family of numerous children is often a thing of the past, and couples having only pets — dubbed 'perrihijos' or 'dog kids' — are now not uncommon. 'That's where you see these practices concerning death starting to take hold,' he said. 'They are no longer just another companion ... they are living beings who hold memories, and whose memory must be commemorated.' But the admiration for dogs goes way back in Mexico, where hairless dogs known as xoloitzcuintles were common before the Spanish brought their larger, furrier hounds to Mexico during the 1519-1521 conquest. The pre-Hispanic dogs were often sacrificed or buried near their owners — or represented as carefully crafted ceramic figurines — because the owner would need the dogs' keen senses to find the path to the underworld after death. Lizaola still feels Taco's absence. His face is tattooed on her right arm. The dog changed her life and that of her partner. 'There's like a before and after in my life,' she said, noting that Taco inspired them to get more involved in supporting abandoned animals and rescuing dogs from the street. Initially, there was some resistance within her family to including Taco on the altar, a place long reserved for departed family members. But as relatives' pets died they came around and 'now it's more dogs than humans,' she said.	https://apnews.com/article/mexico-day-of-dead-pets-dogs-cats-altars-57c8f08990fc12f454ce14bb995fd160	2024-10-31T20:52:44-07:00	
North Korea boasts of its new long-range missile targeting the US	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korea on Friday bragged of its recently tested new intercontinental ballistic missile, calling it 'the world’s strongest,' a claim viewed by outside experts as propaganda though the test showed an advancement in the North's quest to build a more reliable weapons arsenal. A missile launched by North Korea on Thursday flew higher and stayed in the air for a longer duration than any other weapon the country had so far fired. It signaled that the North has achieved progress in acquiring a nuclear-armed ICBM that can hit the U.S. mainland. But foreign experts assess that the country has still a few remaining technological issues to master before acquiring such a functioning ICBM. On Friday, the North’s Korean Central News Agency identified the missile as 'Hwasong-19' ICBM and called it 'the world’s strongest strategic missile' and 'the perfected weapon system.' KCNA said leader Kim Jong Un observed the launch, describing it as 'an appropriate military action' to express North Korea’s resolve to respond to its enemies’ moves that escalated tensions and threats to North Korea’s national security. It said Kim thanked weapons scientists for demonstrating North Korea’s 'matchless strategic nuclear attack capability.' South Korea’s military earlier said that North Korea could have tested a solid-fueled missile but Friday’s KCNA dispatch didn’t say what propellant the Hwasong-19 ICBM uses. Observers say the color of exhaust flames seen in North Korean media photos on the launch still suggest the new ICBM uses solid fuels. Before Thursday’s test, North Korea’s most advanced ICBM was known as the 'Hwasong-18' missile which uses solid fuels. Pre-loaded solid propellants make it easier to move missiles and require much less launch preparation times than liquid propellants that must be fueled before liftoffs. So it’s more difficult for opponents to detect launches by solid-fuel missiles. In recent years, North Korea has reported steady advancement in its efforts to obtain nuclear-tipped missiles. Many foreign experts believe North Korea likely has missiles that can deliver nuclear strikes on all of South Korea, but it has yet to possess nuclear missiles that can travel to the mainland U.S. There are questions on whether North Korea has acquired the technology to shield warheads from the high-temperature, high-stress environment of atmospheric reentry. Many foreign analysts say North Korea also must have improved altitude control and guidance systems for missiles. They say North Korea needs an ability to place multiple warheads on a single missile to defeat its rivals’ missile defenses. All of North Korea’s known ICBM tests, including Thursday’s, have been performed on steep angles to avoid neighboring countries. South Korean military spokesperson Lee Sung Joon said Thursday that a high-angel trajectory launch cannot verify a missile’s re-entry vehicle technology, though North Korea has previously claimed to have acquired that technology. Observers say that Thursday's launch, the North's first ICBM test in almost a year, was largely meant to grab American attention days before the U.S. presidential election and respond to international condemnation over North Korea's reported dispatch of troops to Russia to support its war against Ukraine. North Korea's reported troop dispatch highlights the expanding military cooperation between North Korea and Russia. South Korea. the U.S. and others worry North Korea might seek high-tech, sensitive Russian technology to perfect its nuclear and missile programs in return for joining the Russian-Ukraine war. __ Associated Press writer Kim Tong-hyung contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/north-korea-missile-launch-united-states-4173ce128b8336b2cb315a3bf62c6980	2024-10-31T16:26:35-07:00	
US calls on a silent China to use its sway over Russia and North Korea	WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. and South Korea have called on China to use its influence over Russia and North Korea to prevent escalation after Pyongyang sent thousands of troops to Russia to aid Moscow's war against Ukraine. Beijing has so far stayed quiet. In a rare meeting earlier this week, three top U.S. diplomats met with China’s ambassador to the United States to emphasize U.S. concerns and urge China to use its sway with North Korea to try to curtail the cooperation, according to a State Department official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Thursday that the sides had 'a robust conversation just this week' and that China knows U.S. expectations are that 'they’ll use the influence that they have to work to curb these activities.' 'But I think this is a demand signal that’s coming not just from us, but from countries around the world,' he said at a news conference in Washington with Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and their South Korean counterparts. Liu Pengyu, spokesman for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, said in a statement that China's position on the Ukraine crisis is 'consistent and clear.' China strives 'for peace talks and political settlement of the Ukraine crisis. This position remains unchanged. China will continue to play a constructive role to this end,' Liu said. The U.S. says 8,000 North Korean soldiers are in Russia near Ukraine’s border and are preparing to help the Kremlin fight against Ukrainian troops in the coming days. China has yet to publicly comment on the move. Beijing has forged a 'no limits' partnership with Moscow, and while it has also been a major ally for Pyongyang, experts say Beijing might not approve of the closer military partnership between Russia and North Korea because it sees it as destabilizing in the region. The Russia-North Korea partnership runs contrary to Beijing’s goal for a peaceful Korean Peninsula, said Shi Yinhong, an international relations expert at China’s Renmin University. Beijing is 'aware of the complexity and danger of the situation,' Shi said, noting that the 'fact that China hasn’t said anything yet on the military alliance agreement between North Korea and Russia indicates that China strongly disagrees with it.' Dennis Wilder, senior fellow for the Initiative for U.S.-China Dialogue on global issues at Georgetown University, called Beijing’s 'radio silence' on North Korea’s move 'staggering.' He said Beijing must find a balance between supporting Moscow and not angering the West, and that Chinese President Xi Jinping might 'for his own sake ignore the whole thing.' Xi has built a personal relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin, and 'he cannot see Putin fail,' Wilder said this week at a panel discussion hosted by the Washington-based think tank Center for Strategic and International Studies. At the same time, Xi cannot anger the Europeans and Americans when his country's economy is struggling, Wilder said. 'So he’s not going to say anything publicly about this,' Wilder said. Victor Cha, Korean chair at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said at the same panel discussion that for China, 'there’s probably a combination of a little bit of exasperation, a little bit of panic and a little bit of they don’t know what to do with regard to the current situation.' It’s unclear if Beijing was informed of Pyongyang's move in advance, Cha said. Beijing also could fret over Russia gaining more influence than China over North Korea, Cha said. Austin said Thursday that China 'should be asking Russia some hard questions at this point and whether it intends to broaden this conflict by this kind of behavior.' Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell, Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs Dan Kritenbrink and Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs James O’Brien met with Chinese envoy Xie Feng in Washington on Tuesday, according to the State Department official, who would not detail the Chinese response. Lu Chao, director of the Institute of American and East Asian Studies at Liaoning University in China's northeastern province of Liaoning, said the U.S. should not expect China to manage North Korea. 'It is not the case that China is responsible to manage North Korea and the U.S. is responsible for managing South Korea,' Lu said. 'I hope the U.S. government could understand China’s stance.' Lu also said the troop deployment is 'a matter between Russia and North Korea,' while China’s attitude remains unchanged that the conflict should not be escalated. — AP researcher Yu Bing in Beijing contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/china-north-korea-russia-ukraine-united-states-0d28afb21d3afbdbb3cb9c29a945c3f5	2024-10-31T13:53:53-07:00	
Brazil judge gives 2 former cops long sentences for the 2018 murder of leftist icon Marielle Franco	RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) — A judge on Thursday handed down long sentences to two former police officers for the 2018 murder of Rio de Janeiro city councilwoman Marielle Franco, an icon of Brazil’ s political left whose killing sparked outrage. Ronnie Lessa and Élcio de Queiroz were sentenced to almost 79 years and almost 60 years, respectively, for the March 14, 2018 drive-by shooting that killed Franco and her driver, Anderson Gomes. Jurors found that Lessa fired the gun and de Queiroz was the wheelman on the night of the crime. Lessa and de Queiroz, arrested in 2019, previously signed plea bargains confessing their roles, but the jury had final word on their guilt on homicide and other charges. The verdict, although expected, comes as a measure of solace to the many who saw the martyrdom of the Black, bisexual woman as an attack on democracy, and worried that the crime would go unpunished. The prosecutors had argued each man should be sentenced to the maximum possible 84 years for the three counts — double homicide, attempted homicide and driving a cloned vehicle. As Judge Lucia Glioche finished reading the sentence, applause erupted in the room as victims’ families began to cry. Marielle’s sister, Anielle Franco, Brazil’s minister for racial equality, held a long, tearful embrace with her parents and Marielle’s daughter, Luyara Franco. Her father rested his head on the chest of former congressman Marcelo Freixo, who was her political mentor. Brazilian law does not allow for life imprisonment, and each man will serve no more than 30 years of their sentences. Due to their sealed plea bargains, local media has reported that Queiroz and Lessa may serve 12 and 18 years in prison, respectively, including time already served. Prosecutors have denied their sentenced would be reduced. Either way, Thursday’s sentencing is seen as only a step toward justice being done, with another trial yet to come for the men accused of ordering her killing. They will also have to pay 706,000 reais ($122,000) in moral damages to several of the victims’ family members and provide an allowance to the young son of Gomes until he turns 24, according to a statement on the court's website. Known universally by her first name, Marielle, she was raised in one of Rio’s poor communities known as favelas. She became known for her efforts to improve the lives of ordinary residents. Following her election in 2016, she fought against violence targeting women while defending human rights and social programs. Testimony Wednesday during the first day of the trial offered details about the moments preceding and following the shooting. Franco’s assistant and friend who was also in the car, Fernanda Chaves, was among those giving testimony, as was Franco’s mother and her partner Mônica Benício. Choked up and often unable to talk, Benício said the last thing Marielle ever said to her was 'I love you.' 'We had plans to get married with a wedding party. When Marielle died, what I felt was that they had taken away our promise of the future,' she said, later adding that the right to a just city was one of Marielle’s causes. 'Marielle also defended the right to decent housing from the perspective of the favela, the periphery, this was the theme of the city’s rights agenda.' Both defendants participated in the trial by videoconference from prison. Lessa is in Sao Paulo while de Queiroz is in Brazil’s capital, Brasilia. Federal authorities started investigating the case in earnest once leftist President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva took office in 2023. With Lessa and de Queiroz sentenced, attention will now turn to the men accused of ordering the hit: two brothers with purported ties to criminal groups known as militias, which illegally charge residents for various services, including protection. Guilhermo Catramby, a Federal Police detective, told the court Wednesday that the assassination was 'undoubtedly' motivated by Marielle’s work regarding land rights, especially in the west side of Rio de Janeiro. Her work there was 'a thorn in the side of militia interests,' Catramby said. In March, Federal Police detained the two brothers, federal lawmaker Chiquinho Brazão and his brother Domingos Brazão, a member of Rio state’s accounts watchdog. They have denied any involvement in the killing or with militias and have yet to go on trial. In his plea bargain, Lessa told police that the politician brothers hired him and informed him that the then-chief of the state’s civil police, Rivaldo Barbosa, had signed off beforehand. Barbosa, who also denies any involvement, was arrested in March. Marielle’s family and Ágatha Arnaus, widow of Gomes, spoke to journalists after the trial. Holding hands, they said that while the conviction offered some reparation after years of struggle and pain, it was just the first step in a long journey toward justice. 'I wanted my mother here, but today will certainly go down in this country’s democratic history,' said Luyara, the councilwoman’s daughter, holding back tears. 'If the justice system had not convicted these two cruel murderers, we wouldn’t have a moment of peace. But this doesn’t end here,' said Antonio Francisco da Silva, Marielle’s father. 'There are those who ordered the crime. Now the question is: when will those who ordered it be convicted?' ___ Sá Pessoa reported from Sao Paulo.	https://apnews.com/article/brazil-marielle-franco-police-sentence-aa9871158cdbed497ce11c8e7e004513	2024-10-31T13:43:19-07:00

Greek anti-terror squad investigates big blast that killed a man in an Athens apartment	ATHENS, Greece (AP) — Greece's anti-terrorist squad is investigating a strong explosion on Thursday that wrecked an Athens apartment, killing a man and severely injuring a woman, police said. Police spokeswoman Constantina Dimoglidou said the identity of the victim was unknown, while the injured woman was not in a position to help authorities due to the gravity of her condition. She said explosives experts were investigating the scene of the explosion in an apartment block in the Greek capital's central district of Ambelokipi. A team of 23 firefighters who responded to the incident freed the injured woman from the wreckage. They used sniffer dogs to search the apartment for other survivors, later locating the man's body, the fire service said. Initial suspicions that the blast was caused by a gas leak were not confirmed. Authorities are now examining the possibility that an explosive device was inadvertently detonated in the flat. State-run ERT television reported that at least one handgun was found in the apartment. The explosion demolished internal and external walls in the third-floor apartment, blew away its balcony railings and damaged neighboring properties. Greece has a decades-old history of far-left extremism involving small urban groups. The major groups that carried out a string of assassinations from the mid 1970s to the early 2000s have been eradicated and their members jailed. They were succeeded by smaller and less efficient groups which mostly staged bomb attacks on symbols of state authority and wealth but had been largely dormant in recent years.	https://apnews.com/article/greece-athens-explosion-apartment-death-terrorism-police-71cb55f41c62aaeac0b854f61e546159	2024-10-31T11:22:31-07:00

Iraq's Parliament elects a new speaker to end a nearly yearlong vacuum	BAGHDAD (AP) — After a nearly yearlong vacuum, Iraq’s Parliament elected a new speaker Thursday, selecting a prominent Sunni lawmaker who has a close relationship with Iran. Mahmoud al-Mashhadani, who served a previous stint as speaker from 2006 to 2009, was elected by a vote of 182 of the 269 legislators who attended the session, a surprise move after months of deadlock between political factions. Former Speaker Mohammed al-Halbousi was dismissed by a Federal Supreme Court last November against the backdrop of a lawsuit filed by then-lawmaker Laith al-Dulaimi. Dulaimi claimed that the speaker had forged Dulaimi’s signature on a resignation letter, an allegation that Halbousi denied. The court ruled to terminate both Halbousi and al-Dulaimi from their parliamentary posts. It did not elaborate on why it was issuing the decision. The position of speaker of Parliament is assigned to a Sunni according to convention in Iraq’s power-sharing system, while the prime minister is always Shiite and the president is a Kurd. The speaker plays an important role in serving as an intermediary between the various political blocs and will be key to the government’s efforts to achieve economic reforms and reduce internal tensions. The election of a new parliament speaker comes at a time when Iraq is facing major challenges - chief among them, attempting to navigate the repercussions of the wars in the Middle East and to balance its relationship with Iran and the United States, which are backing opposing parties in the regional conflict. Iran-aligned political blocs and militias have significant power in Iraq. The militias have regularly launched drone attacks on bases housing U.S. troops in Iraq and Syria in retaliation for Washington’s support for Israel in its wars against Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon. In recent months they have also targeted sites in Israel directly. At the same time, Iraq’s government has sought to avoid alienating the U.S., upon which it has relied for economic and military support, including in the fight against the Islamic State militant group. The country also faces rampant corruption and internal divisions. Legislators from the pro-Iranian Shiite political bloc and from the Sunni bloc close to former Speaker Halbousi reached a compromise on al-Mashhadani, apparently in hopes that he will be able to build a consensus across political blocs. The new speaker will have to deal with some controversial legislation, notable a proposed amendment to Iraq’s personal status law governing family matters, which critics say would effectively legalize child marriage.	https://apnews.com/article/iraq-parliament-speaker-mashhadani-halbousi-d2f914397971c244a8421914c85fcedd	2024-10-31T11:18:42-07:00	
Climate change is making extreme downpours in Spain heavier and more likely, scientists say	Human-caused climate change made Spain’s rainfall about 12% heavier and doubled the likelihood of a storm as intense as this week’s deluge of Valencia, according to a rapid but partial analysis Thursday by World Weather Attribution, a group of international scientists who study global warming’s role in extreme weather. Monstrous flash floods in Spain claimed at least 158 lives, with 155 deaths confirmed in the eastern Valencia region alone. An unknown number of people are still missing and more victims could be found. Crews searched for bodies in stranded cars and sodden buildings Thursday. World Weather Attribution said climate change is the most likely explanation for extreme downpours in southern Spain, as a warmer atmosphere can hold more moisture, leading to heavier downpours. The group noted its analysis is not a full, detailed attribution study, as the scientists did not use climate models to simulate the event in a world without human-caused warming. Scientists looked at historical observations of rainfall, which they say indicate that one-day bursts of rain in this region are increasing as emissions from the burning of fossil fuels warms the planet. 'We haven’t had time yet to do a full attribution study about the flooding that’s just taken place in Spain. But what we have been able to do is to look at observations of rainfall in the area,' said WWA expert Clair Barnes. 'And based on the recorded rainfall, we’ve estimated that similar events have become about 12% more intense, and probably about twice as likely as they would have been in a pre-industrial climate, about 1.3 degrees (Celsius) cooler, without human-caused climate change.' 'I’ve heard people saying that this is the new normal,' added Barnes, a statistician who researches extreme weather events and climate change at the Imperial College London. 'Given that we are currently on track for 2.6 degrees of warming, or thereabouts, within this century, we are only halfway to the new normal.' Since the mid-1800s, the world has already heated up by 1.3 degrees Celsius (2.3 degrees Fahrenheit), up from previous estimates of 1.1 or 1.2 degrees because it includes the record heat last year, according to the United Nations Environment Programme’s annual Emissions Gap Report released last week. The world is on pace to hit 3.1 degrees Celsius (5.6 degrees Fahrenheit) since pre-industrial times. But if nations somehow do all of what they promised in targets they submitted to the U.N., that warming could be limited to 2.6 degrees Celsius (4.7 degrees Fahrenheit), the report said. Ben Clarke, a researcher at the Centre for Environmental Policy, Imperial College London, pointed out that a powerful typhoon made landfall in Taiwan on Thursday, just after the flooding in Spain. 'These back-to-back events show how dangerous climate change already is with just 1.3 degrees Celsius of warming,' Clarke said in a statement. ___ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Flood survivors say regional Spanish officials waited too long to warn them of the danger	BARRIO DE LA TORRE, Spain (AP) — Moments after rushing waters burst through the door to her home, Mari Carmen Pérez received a text message alert from regional Spanish authorities warning her of the possibility of flash floods. By the time Pérez's phone buzzed, the water has already gushed into her kitchen, living room and bathroom, forcing her and her family to flee upstairs. 'They didn’t have any idea of what was going on,' Pérez, a 56-year-old cleaner, said Thursday by phone from Barrio de la Torre in Valencia. 'Everything is ruined. The people here, we have never seen anything like this.' She was one of the lucky ones. More than 150 people died, many trapped in cars or the ground floor of their homes, when storm-fed riverbeds burst their banks and swept through dozens of localities on the southern outskirts of Valencia city. The massive number of dead — easily making the floods the worst natural disaster in Spain in living memory — has raised questions about how this could happen in a European Union country that excels in public safety. As rescuers continued to pull bodies from the mud and debris Thursday, anger also began to grow among the families and friends mourning lost loved ones and many more thousands whose livelihoods have been shattered by the deluge. The streets were full of people walking to procure basic supplies with their cars ruined and the streets undrivable because of the mud and debris. The Valencian regional government is being criticized for not sending out flood warnings to mobile phones until 8 p.m. on Tuesday, when the flooding had already started in some places and well after the national weather agency issued a red alert indicating heavy rains. Valencia regional President Carlos Mazón, of the conservative Popular Party, defended his administration’s management of the crisis, saying 'all our supervisors followed the standard protocol' that was coordinated by Spain’s central government. Spain’s Interior Ministry said in a statement that regional administrations are responsible for sending alerts to warn the population of possible flooding and other natural disasters. Mazón is also under fire for his announcement at 1:00 p.m. on Tuesday that the storm front would 'lose strength' by 6:00 p.m. The opposite occurred. The size and violence of the extreme weather event was shocking and extremely difficult for any administration to prepare for and predict. But Valencia, on Spain’s Mediterranean coast, has a history of autumn storms that produce floods, albeit at a smaller magnitude than this monster of a storm. Spain’s national weather agency had alerted officials and the public via its website and social media on Sunday, two days before the tragedy struck, that there was a 70% chance of torrential rain ahead. The agency then issued a red alert, the highest level of warning, for bad weather as early as 7:30 a.m. on Tuesday morning as the disaster loomed. Andreu Salom, mayor of the Valencian village of L’Alcudia, told national broadcaster RTVE that his town lost at least two residents, a daughter and her elderly mother who lived together, and that police were still searching for a missing truck driver. He complained that he and his townsfolk had no warning of the disaster that struck when the Magro River overflowed. 'I myself was on my way to check the river level because I had no information,' Salom said. 'I went with the local police but we had to turn back because a tsunami of water, mud, reeds and dirt was already entering the town.' ___ Wilson reported from Barcelona, Spain.	https://apnews.com/article/spain-floods-what-went-wrong-33e385a9328f4040cb550441ffc85902	2024-10-31T09:59:02-07:00	
What to know about the unprecedented floods that killed at least 158 in Spain	MADRID (AP) — In a matter of minutes, flash floods caused by heavy downpours in eastern Spain on Tuesday swept away everything in their path. With no time to react, people were trapped in vehicles, homes and businesses. Many died and thousands saw livelihoods shattered. Two days later, authorities have recovered 158 bodies — 155 in the eastern Valencia region alone, two in Castilla La Mancha and one in Andalusia — and continue to search for an unknown number of missing people. People have begun to clean up the thick layers of mud that covered houses and streets full of debris, all while facing power and water cuts and shortages of some basic goods. Inside some of the vehicles that the water washed into piles or crashed into buildings, there were still bodies waiting to be identified. Here are a few things to know about Spain’s deadliest storm in living memory: What happened? The storms concentrated over the Magro and Turia river basins and, in the Poyo riverbed, produced walls of water that overflowed riverbanks, catching people unaware as they went on with their daily lives, with many coming home from work on Tuesday evening. In the blink of an eye, the muddy water covered roads, railways and entered houses and businesses in villages on the southern outskirts of Valencia city. Drivers, with their vehicles converted into boats, had to take shelter on car roofs, while residents tried to take refuge on higher ground. The downpour was stunning. Spain’s national weather service said that in the hard-hit locality of Chiva it rained more in eight hours than it had in the preceding 20 months, calling the deluge 'extraordinary.' When the authorities sent the alert to mobile phones warning of the seriousness of the phenomenon and asked them to stay at home, many were on the road, working or covered in water in low-lying areas or garages, which became death traps. Why did these massive flash floods happen? Scientists trying to explain what happened see two likely connections to human-caused climate change. One is that warmer air holds and then dumps more rain. The other is possible changes in the jet stream — the river of air above land that moves weather systems across the globe — that spawn extreme weather. Climate scientists and meteorologists said the immediate cause of the flooding is called a cut-off lower pressure storm system that migrated from an unusually wavy and stalled jet stream. That system simply parked over the region and poured rain. This happens often enough that in Spain they call them DANAs, the Spanish acronym for the system, meteorologists said. And then there is the unusually high temperature of the Mediterranean Sea. It had its warmest surface temperature on record in mid-August, at 28.47 degrees Celsius (83.25 degrees Fahrenheit), said Carola Koenig of the Centre for Flood Risk and Resilience at Brunel University of London. The extreme weather event came after Spain battled with prolonged droughts in 2022 and 2023. Experts say that drought and flood cycles are increasing with climate change. Has this happened before? Spain’s Mediterranean coast is used to autumn storms that can cause flooding, but this episode was the most powerful flash flood event in recent memory. Older people in Paiporta, ground zero of the tragedy, claim that Tuesday’s floods were three times as bad as those of 1957, which caused at least 81 deaths and were the worst in the history of the tourist eastern region. That episode led to the diversion of the Turia watercourse, which meant that a large part of the city was spared of these floods. Valencia suffered two other major DANAs in the 1980s, one in 1982, with around 30 deaths, and another one five years later, which broke rainfall records. This week's flash floods are also Spain's deadliest natural tragedy in living memory, surpassing the flood that swept away a campsite along the Gallego river in Biescas, in the northwest, killing 87 people in August 1996. ___ Seth Borenstein in Washington, D.C., contributed.	https://apnews.com/article/flash-floods-spain-valencia-climate-change-what-to-know-f942142b82de24f5b4a18867bc32ae00	2024-10-31T09:30:17-07:00	
Lebanon's detained former central bank governor faces new corruption charge	BEIRUT (AP) — Lebanon charged the country’s former central bank governor with illicit enrichment and issued an arrest warrant against the detained banker, the second in less than two months, judicial officials said Thursday. Riad Salameh, 74, was charged by the first examining magistrate of Mount Lebanon Nicola Mansour over an apartment that was rented in France to be a substitute office for the central bank if needed, the four official said on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media. The officials said Salameh had rented the apartment from his 'former partner' Anna Kosakova for about $500,000 annually. They added that the apartment was small and almost empty apartment except for a few computers. After questioning Salameh, Nicola issued an arrest warrant for him. Salameh had been held by Lebanese authorities since early September. Salameh has for years denied allegations of corruption, embezzlement and illicit enrichment. He insists that his wealth comes from inherited properties, investments and his previous job as an investment banker at Merrill Lynch. In early September, Lebanon charged Salameh with the embezzlement of $42 million a day after he was detained. Salameh ended his 30-year term as central bank governor a year ago under a cloud, with several European countries probing allegations of financial crimes. Many in Lebanon blame him for the crippling financial crisis that has gripped the country since late 2019. He was appointed in 1993 and initially celebrated for his role in steering Lebanon’s economic recovery after a 15-year civil war, and for keeping the economy on an even keel during long spells of political gridlock and turmoil. The embattled Salameh is also in the midst of several other cases against him, both locally and internationally. France, Germany, and Luxembourg are also investigating Salameh and close associates over alleged illicit enrichment and the laundering of $330 million. Salameh has criticized the European investigation and said it was part of a media and political campaign make him a scapegoat. Meanwhile, the U.S., the U.K, and Canada have sanctioned Salameh and his close associates, and France issued an international arrest warrant for him, though Lebanon does not hand over its own citizens for extradition.	https://apnews.com/article/lebanon-corruption-riad-salameh-charged-paris-apartment-anna-kosakova-5454165e33bc9cfac0500d898765f018	2024-10-31T07:36:05-07:00	
Rocket fire from Lebanon kills 7 in Israel as US officials try to push for cease-fires	TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Rocket barrages from Lebanon into northern Israel killed four foreign workers and three Israelis on Thursday, Israeli medics said, the deadliest cross-border strikes in Israel since it invaded Lebanon. Israel kept up airstrikes it says targeted Hezbollah militants across Lebanon, where health authorities on Thursday reported 24 people killed. U.S. diplomats were in the region pushing for cease-fires in both Lebanon and Gaza, hoping to wind down the wars in the Middle East as the Biden administration enters its final months. Pressure has been building ahead of the U.S. election next week. In northern Gaza, Israeli forces struck one of the last functioning hospitals, according to the World Heath Organization said, destroying much-needed supplies that the U.N. agency had delivered to the facility. The strikes set off a fire that affected the dialysis unit, destroyed water tanks, damaged the surgery building and injured four medics trying to extinguish the blaze, said the hospital's director, Dr. Hussam Abu Safiya. The Israeli military did not respond to a request for comment about a strike on the hospital, which it stormed last week after alleging it was harboring Hamas militants. Gaza's Health Ministry on Thursday condemned Israeli attacks on the hospital and called on the international community to safeguard medical facilities in Gaza. Back-to-back deadly rocket attacks hit Israel Projectiles from Lebanon crashed into an agricultural area in Metula, Israel’s northernmost town, killing four foreign workers and an Israeli farmer, local officials said Thursday. Hours later, the Israeli military reported another volley of some 25 rockets from Lebanon, striking an olive grove in a suburb of the northern Israeli port city of Haifa. That strike killed a 30-year-old man and 60-year-old woman while wounding two others, said Magen David Adom, Israel’s main emergency medical organization. Both Hezbollah and Hamas are backed by Iran, Israel’s regional adversary. Hezbollah did not immediately claim responsibility for Thursday’s rocket fire. Israel’s military said 90 projectiles were fired from Lebanon on Thursday. Hezbollah has been firing thousands of rockets, drones and missiles into Israel —and drawing fierce Israeli retaliatory strikes — over the past year since Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack out of the Gaza Strip triggered Israel’s devastating war in the Palestinian enclave. The residents of Metula evacuated in October 2023, and only security officials and agricultural workers remain. The Hotline for Refugees and Migrants, an Israeli organization that advocates for foreign workers, said authorities had put them in danger by allowing them to work along the border without proper protection. Agricultural areas near Israel’s border are closed military zones that can only be entered with official permission. For the few remaining residents, the thump of interceptions by Israel’s Iron Dome missile defense system and wailing air raid sirens punctuate daily life. Nonetheless, local officials largely support continuing a ground operation in southern Lebanon. 'If the Israeli government accedes to an agreement brought by (the Biden administration) ... we will not have it because for us this is rehabilitating Hezbollah again on our borders,' said Eitan Davidi, the mayor of the northern town of Margaliot. Israeli bombs across Lebanon after evacuation warnings Israeli strikes killed 24 people in Lebanon on Thursday, among them 13 people in the country’s eastern Bekaa Valley, according to Lebanon’s state-run National News agency, a day after the Israel’s military warned residents there to evacuate. The warnings sent thousands of people fleeing and spread panic across the city, known for its colossal Roman ruins. The Lebanese Health Ministry reported that over the last 24 hours, Israeli bombardments killed 45 people and wounded 110 in various parts of the country. Jean Fakhry, a local official in the Deir al-Ahmar region in the Bekaa Valley, said Israeli airstrikes pummeling the area turned the main highway 'a parking lot' of fleeing cars stuck in traffic. Around 12,000 displaced people are staying in the area, he said, with most taking refuge in private homes. At one of the shelters in Deir al-Ahmar, families with luggage were still arriving Thursday. 'Our homes were destroyed,' said Zahraa Younis, from the village near Baalbek. 'We came with nothing — no clothes or anything else.' US officials are in the region seeking a cease-fire Senior White House aides Brett McGurk and Amos Hochstein were in Israel Thursday for talks with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and senior officials about the conflicts with Hamas and Hezbollah. The meetings focused on efforts to secure a cease-fire deal in Lebanon and to assess new proposals floated by mediators to free Israeli hostages being held in Gaza, according to a U.S. official familiar with planning for the talks who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment publicly. The meetings were attended by Netanyahu as well as Yoav Gallant, the Israeli defense minister; David Barnea, the director of the Mossad, Israel’s foreign intelligence agency; and other officials. But with the U.S. election on Tuesday, hopes for immediate progress appeared remote — particularly in Gaza where Israel has come under criticism for not letting more humanitarian aid into the besieged north. The death toll from more than a year of war in Gaza passed 43,000 earlier this week, Palestinian health officials reported. The Awda Hospital in central Gaza said late Thursday it had received 16 bodies of people killed by Israeli bombardment of two houses in Nuseirat refugee camp. The hospital said more than 30 others, including a medic and two journalists, were wounded. Over the past year, the broadening Israeli campaign in Lebanon against Hezbollah has killed 2,865 people there, wounded over 13,000 and devastated Lebanese towns near the border. Some 1.2 million people in Lebanon have been displaced since Israel escalated the conflict into a full-blown war last month, when it launched a wave of heavy airstrikes that killed Hezbollah’s top leader, Hassan Nasrallah, and most of his deputies. A year of Hezbollah rocket attacks have also forced 60,000 Israelis to evacuate from near the border. ___ Frankel reported from Jerusalem and Tawil from Deir al-Ahmar, Lebanon.

UN report warns of famine, aggravated by conflicts and climate shocks	ROME (AP) — Severe food crises threaten hundreds of thousands of people in vulnerable areas, including the Palestinian territories, Sudan, South Sudan, Haiti, and Mali, where populations face or near famine, says a report by the United Nations' food agencies released on Thursday. Conflicts, economic instability, and climate shocks -- combined with reduced funding for emergency food and agriculture assistance -- are driving alarming levels of acute food insecurity, the report warned. 'Immediate, scaled-up intervention is needed to prevent further deterioration in these already vulnerable regions,' it added. The UN Food and Agriculture Organization and the World Food Programme said acute food insecurity is projected to worsen across 16 'hunger hotspots' during the next six months in 14 countries and two regions. Sudan, South Sudan, Haiti, Mali and the Palestinian territories remain at the 'highest concern level,' the report said. Chad, Lebanon, Myanmar, Mozambique, Nigeria, the Syrian Arab Republic and Yemen are classified as 'hotspots of very high concern,' where large numbers of people are facing or are projected to face critical levels of acute food insecurity. 'Conflict and armed violence continue to be the primary drivers of hunger in numerous hotspots, disrupting food systems, displacing populations, and obstructing humanitarian access,' the report warned. FAO and WFP experts believe that the conflict in Sudan is likely to expand, 'driving mass displacement, resulting in famine levels likely to persist and the number of people in catastrophic conditions to increase.' That will further aggravate the regional humanitarian crisis, resulting in increased cross-border movements to neighbouring countries, primarily Chad, South Sudan, Egypt, Libya, Ethiopia and the Central African Republic. The UN agencies also stressed that the ongoing conflict in the Palestinian territories has driven 'unprecedented needs, with near-total displacement of the population and an increased risk of regional spillover.' The Israeli parliament has recently passed two laws that could prevent the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA), a key provider of aid to Gaza, from being able to continue its work. According to Maxwell Sibhensana, deputy director at FAO office for emergencies and resilience, in Gaza 'the restriction in terms of movement for humanitarian actors into the areas where the affected population is, makes it difficult to get the assistance that is required. And without this assistance the risk of famine remains very high.' In Lebanon, the ongoing escalation of conflict is significantly increasing the number of people requiring humanitarian assistance and is severely impacting levels of acute food insecurity, the report added. Since the last report in May 2024, Kenya, Lesotho, Namibia and the Niger have been added to the hunger hotspots list, partly due to the impact of climate extremes. Beyond conflict, weather extremes and increased climate variability are exacerbating acute food insecurity in many regions, the report said. La Niña -- a natural climate pattern that influences global weather marked by cooler ocean temperatures in the equatorial Pacific – is expected to persist through March 2025, with a significant impact on rainfall patterns and temperatures. 'While La Niña may enhance agricultural prospects in some areas, it also increases the risk of flooding in parts of Nigeria, Malawi, Mozambique, South Sudan, Zambia and Zimbabwe,' the report said. The UN agencies warned that without 'immediate humanitarian efforts and concerted international action' to address severe constraints and advocate for the de-escalation of conflicts, further starvation and loss of life are likely in the Palestinian territories, the Sudan, South Sudan, Haiti and Mali. 'Addressing and preventing famine in these regions will require greater investment in integrated solutions that cut across traditional mandates, targeting the root causes of food insecurity and reducing dependency on emergency aid,' they said. — Associated Press producer Paolo Santalucia contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/un-fao-wfp-food-crises-conflicts-weather-sudan-palestine-haiti-mali-5f41d3cb7500dd0eb151de52ebe287a7	2024-10-31T03:17:34-07:00	
Britain has banned protests outside abortion clinics, but silent prayer is a gray area	LONDON (AP) — A British ban on protesting outside abortion clinics went into effect on Thursday, though it left a question mark over whether anti-abortion demonstrators who pray silently will be breaking the law. The law, which applies to England and Wales, bars protests within 150 meters (164 yards) of clinics. Scotland and Northern Ireland, which make their own health policies, recently enacted similar bans. The new rules make it an offense to obstruct someone using abortion services, 'intentionally or recklessly' influence their decision, or cause 'harassment, alarm or distress.' Offenders face a fine, with no upper limit. The buffer zone rule was passed 18 months ago as part of the previous Conservative government’s Public Order Act, but wrangling over whether it would apply to silent prayer protests, and a change in government in July, have delayed it taking effect. The Crown Prosecution Service says silent prayer near an abortion clinic 'will not necessarily commit a criminal offense,' and police say they will assess each case individually. Anti-abortion campaigners and religious groups argue that banning silent-prayer protests would be an affront to freedom of religion. But pro-choice campaigners say silent anti-abortion demonstrators are often intimidating to women entering clinics. 'It’s difficult to see how anyone choosing to perform their prayers right outside an abortion clinic could argue they aren’t attempting to influence people — and there are countless testimonies from women who say this makes them feel distressed,' said Louise McCudden, U.K. head of external affairs at MSI Reproductive Choices, one of Britain’s biggest abortion providers. In March 2023, lawmakers rejected a change to the legislation proposed by some conservative legislators that would have explicitly allowed silent prayer within the buffer zones. The final rules are a potentially messy compromise that is likely to be tested in court. Crime and Policing Minister Diana Johnson said she was 'confident that the safeguards we have put in place today will have a genuine impact in helping women feel safer and empowered to access the vital services they need.' But Bishop John Sherrington of the Catholic Bishops’ Conference of England and Wales, said the government had 'taken an unnecessary and disproportionate step backwards' on religious freedom. 'Religious freedom includes the right to manifest one’s private beliefs in public through witness, prayer and charitable outreach, including outside abortion facilities,' he said. Abortion is not as divisive an issue in the U.K. as in the U.S., where women’s access to terminations has been rolled back, and banned in some states, since the Supreme Court overturned the landmark Roe v. Wade ruling in 2022. Abortion was partly legalized in Britain by the 1967 Abortion Act, which allows abortions up to 24 weeks of pregnancy if two doctors approve. Later abortions are allowed in some circumstances, including danger to the mother’s life. But women who have abortions after 24 weeks in England and Wales can be prosecuted under the 1861 Offenses Against the Person Act. Last year a 45-year-old woman in England was sentenced to 28 months in prison for ordering abortion pills online to induce a miscarriage when she was 32 to 34 weeks pregnant. After an outcry, her sentence was reduced.	https://apnews.com/article/uk-abortion-clinic-protest-ban-5909e44c8305aefaad1569896b61f51b	2024-10-31T03:01:03-07:00	
A judge will decide if the owners of a New Zealand volcano where 22 died were unjustly convicted	WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — A New Zealand judge will decide whether the owners of an island volcano suffered a miscarriage of justice when their company was convicted of failing to keep visitors safe following an eruption that killed 22 tourists and local guides in 2019. A three-day appeal by the owners' company ended Thursday. Justice Simon Moore told the High Court in the city of Auckland that he would reach a decision before the end of the year. The company, Whakaari Management — run by three brothers who own the active volcano Whakaari, also known as White Island — was ordered in March to pay millions of dollars in fines and restitutions to the victims of the eruption, who were mostly U.S. and Australian cruise ship passengers on a walking tour. Lawyers for the company filed an appeal against the criminal conviction the same month. A battle over land owners’ responsibilities The case hinges on whether Whakaari Management — which granted access to the volcano to tourists and scientific groups, collecting fees for permits — should have been in charge of safety at the volcano site under New Zealand’s workplace health and safety laws. Anyone in charge of a workplace must ensure management of hazards and the safety of all there, including at entry and exit points. A lawyer for New Zealand’s workplace regulator, which brought the charges in a 2023 trial, told the court on Thursday that Whakaari Management’s entire business involved granting access to an uncontrollable natural hazard, and and that it should have commissioned its own risk assessments on whether tourists should be permitted there at all. Prosecutor Kirsty McDonald agreed with the trial judge, saying the company 'had a duty to ensure, as far as reasonably practicable, that the workplace it was granting access to was without risks to the health and safety of any person.' However, lawyers for the company told the court this week that it had acted as a landlord, not a manager of operations on the site. Rachael Reed said the company did not run, direct or supervise the tours, and the operators were responsible for safety on the site. A case with far-reaching consequences The case has far-reaching implications and has already changed the laws governing New Zealand’s adventure tourism industry, which is often based around outdoor thrills on or around the country’s many natural hazards. Operators must now take all reasonable steps to inform customers of any serious risks. The lawyers for the company said that if the conviction was allowed to stand, it would make other land owners reluctant to allow such activities to take place on their property — a suggestion rejected by the regulator. Horror at a popular tourist spot White Island, the tip of an undersea volcano also known by its Māori name Whakaari, was a popular tourist destination before the eruption and was reached by boat or helicopter from the North Island’s Bay of Plenty. There were 47 tourists and tour guides on the island in December 2019 when superheated steam blew, killing some instantly and leaving others with agonizing burns. Survivors told the trial in emotional testimony that they had not been told the active volcano was dangerous when they paid to visit it. They were not supplied with protective equipment, and many were wearing clothing that made their horrific burns more damaging. In his ruling, Judge Evangelos Thomas said Whakaari Management had failed to undertake a risk assessment despite knowing of an eruption three years earlier. He said the company should have sought expert advice about the dangers and either stopped the tours entirely or put controls in place. More than a dozen parties charged Charges were brought by New Zealand’s workplace safety regulator against 13 organizations and people, including Whakaari Management. Some pleaded guilty, including three companies that operated helicopter tours, one that operated boat tours, a scenic flight operator and the New Zealand scientific agency GNS Science. Charges against others were dropped. Moore, the high court judge, was not required to release his findings immediately following Thursday’s end of hearings and did not set a definite date for his decision.	https://apnews.com/article/zealand-whakaari-volcano-white-island-eruption-f11da4777cc25aaff0aa392ecc029f04	2024-10-31T03:00:43-07:00	
About 8,000 North Korean troops now at Ukraine's border are expected in combat soon, US says	WASHINGTON (AP) — Some 8,000 North Korean soldiers are now in Russia near Ukraine’s border and are preparing to help the Kremlin fight against Ukrainian troops in the coming days, the Biden administration said Thursday. The new figure is a dramatic increase from a day earlier, when Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin would only say 'some' of the troops had moved toward Ukraine’s border in the Kursk region, where Moscow's forces have struggled to push back a Ukrainian incursion. That also would mean most of the North Korean troops that the U.S. and its allies say have been sent to Russia are now on the Russia-Ukraine border. The U.S. has estimated a total of about 10,000 North Korean troops are in Russia. Seoul and its allies assessed that the number has increased to 11,000, while Ukraine has put the figure higher, at up to 12,000. Of the 8,000 in Kursk, 'we’ve not yet seen these troops deploy into combat against Ukrainian forces but we would expect that to happen in the coming days,' Secretary of State Antony Blinken said at a news conference with Austin and their South Korean counterparts. He said Russia has been training North Korean soldiers in artillery, drones and 'basic infantry operations, including trench clearing, indicating that they fully intend to use these forces in front line operations.' North Korea’s move to tighten its relationship with Russia has raised concerns around the world about how that may expand the war and what Russian military aid will be delivered in exchange. It’s become a key topic as U.S. and South Korean leaders met this week in Washington, fueling concerns that the presence of those soldiers will further destabilize the Asia-Pacific and broaden Moscow’s war on Ukraine. South Korean Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul condemned the deployment 'in the strongest possible terms' and called for an immediate withdrawal of the troops. North Korea’s belligerent actions not only places the European continent but also the Korean peninsula under threat and that Seoul agrees 'to take necessary measures accordingly,' he said. Austin reiterated that Moscow has provided the North Korean troops with Russian uniforms and equipment, another indication they are likely to be used on the front lines. 'Make no mistake, if these North Korean troops engage in combat or combat support operations against Ukraine they would make themselves legitimate military targets,' Austin said. However he said the injection of North Korean troops was unlikely to cause Ukraine to lose ground in Kursk. 'This 10,000 won’t come close to replacing the numbers that the Russians have lost' in their fighting to date, Austin said. The U.S. estimates that more than 500,000 Russian forces have been killed or wounded in the more than two-year long conflict. The U.S. has provided more than $59 billion in military aid to help Ukraine fend off Russia, and Austin pledged Thursday that another aid package would be announced soon. The U.S. and South Korean leaders called out China to engage, saying Beijing should be deeply concerned by the movements and the possibility it will further destabilize the region. 'If China is serious about its desire for de-escalation, it should be asking Russia some hard questions at this point and whether it intends to broaden this conflict by this kind of behavior,' Austin said. There are questions about what new military technologies North Korea might get from Russia in exchange for the deployment and whether it might lead other nations to send their own forces to fight in the war. North Korea test-fired an intercontinental ballistic missile Thursday for the first time in almost a year, demonstrating a potential advancement in its ability to launch long-range nuclear attacks on the American mainland. Some experts speculated that Russia may have provided technological assistance to North Korea over the launch. As the meeting in Washington was underway, the U.S., South Korea and Japan released a joint statement condemning the missile launch as a 'flagrant violation' of numerous U.N. Security Council resolutions and criticizing the deepening military cooperation between North Korea and Russia, particularly the deployment of the North Korean troops. 'We strongly urge (North Korea) to immediately cease its series of provocative and destabilizing actions that threaten peace and security on the Korean Peninsula and beyond,' they said. In a dramatic moment during a U.N. Security Council meeting earlier Thursday, the deputy U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Robert Wood, first noted the number of North Korean troops near Ukraine. 'And I have a very respectful question for my Russian colleague: does Russia still maintain that there are no DPRK troops in Russia? That’s my only question and final point,' he said. Russia's deputy ambassador to the U.N., Anna Evstigneeva, did not respond to the comment at the meeting called by Moscow to discuss international peace and security. The session was then adjourned. Besides troops, North Korea also has provided munitions to Russia, and earlier this month, the White House released images it said were of North Korea shipping 1,000 containers of military equipment there by rail. ___ Lederer reported from the United Nations.

At least 10 people are killed by police in Mozambique post-election protests, medical groups say	MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) — At least 10 people were fatally shot by police and dozens of others were injured when authorities cracked down on unrest following Mozambique's presidential election, two medical groups said, as the country braced Thursday for more protests against a vote criticized as fraudulent by opposition parties and questioned by international observers. Daniel Chapo of the ruling Front for the Liberation of Mozambique was announced as the winner of the election on Oct. 24, extending the Frelimo party's 49 years in power since independence from Portugal in 1975. Chapo is to succeed President Filipe Nyusi, who is stepping down after serving the two terms allowed under the constitution. Frelimo has regularly been accused of rigging elections and Mozambique's security forces have previously been criticized for suppressing protests with deadly force. Opposition parties claimed fraud on the day of the election, while observers from the European Union said in a later report that there were irregularities in the vote counting and some results had been altered. Tensions were high in the southern African country in the buildup and immediate aftermath of the Oct. 9 vote, but more unrest was stoked when two senior officials of an opposition party were killed in their car in the capital, Maputo, on Oct. 18 after being ambushed by unidentified gunmen late at night. The opposition says the attackers fired 25 bullets at the car. The killings were widely seen in Mozambique as being politically motivated. One of the victims was the lawyer and adviser to Venancio Mondlane, the main opposition candidate for president who was second in the election. Ten people died of gunshot wounds and another 63 were wounded by gunfire in protests between Oct. 18 and Oct. 26, the Medical Association of Mozambique and the Mozambique Order of Doctors said in a joint statement Wednesday. 'In most of the shootings, especially those that resulted in death, the intention of the police was to shoot to kill,' Gilberto Manhiça, the head of the Order of Doctors, was quoted as saying by local media. In a separate statement, Human Rights Watch put the death toll at 11. It said more than 50 people sustained serious gunshot wounds in the protests and called for an investigation into the 'apparently excessive use of force.' Protesters burned tires and blocked roads in some cities and authorities characterized some of the unrest as violent that had to be quelled. Police spokesperson Orlando Mudumane told state-run Radio Mozambique that the situation was now 'relatively calm and controlled.' Opposition leader Mondlane has called for a week of new protests to begin on Thursday. ___ AP Africa news: https://apnews.com/hub/africa	https://apnews.com/article/mozambique-election-protests-deaths-154ac940bae942ea3dd992262348e50a	2024-10-31T01:50:40-07:00	
Russian bomb hits residential building in Ukraine's 2nd largest city, killing 12-year-old boy	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Russian forces struck a residential building in Ukraine's second-largest city of Kharkiv early Thursday, killing a 12-year-old boy and injuring scores of others. Regional head Oleh Syniehubov said the boy was fatally injured when the building was hit by a Russian 500-kilogram (1,100-pound) glide bomb. 'He was freed from under the rubble with severe head injuries and fractures,' Syniehubov wrote on his messaging app channel. 'Doctors performed resuscitation measures for more than half an hour. Unfortunately, it was not possible to save the child.' Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko said that at least 35 people suffered injuries in the attack and others could be still trapped under the rubble, including a missing 15-year-old boy. Russia has increasingly used powerful glide bombs to pummel Ukrainian positions along the 1,000-kilometer (600-miles) line of contact and strike cities dozens of kilometers (miles) from the frontline. Kharkiv, a city of 1.1 million, is about 30 kilometers (less than 20 miles) from border. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has repeatedly urged the United States to allow Ukraine to use long-range American missiles to strike air bases deeper in Russia that are used by aicraft carrying glide bombs. Washington so far only has allowed some strikes close to the border. Zelenskyy repeated his demand Thursday, publishing a video showing the ravaged building, at least three of its floors destroyed and the rest of it seriously damaged. 'Partners see what is happening every day,' Zelenskyy wrote on Telegram. 'And under these conditions, each of their delayed decisions means at least dozens, if not hundreds of such Russian bombs against Ukraine. Their decisions are the lives of our people. Therefore, we must together stop Russia and do it with all possible force.' Early Thursday, Russia also fired 10 missiles of various types at the Dniester Estuary bridge that connects the northern and southern parts of Odesa region, Ukraine's air force said, adding that only two of them were intercepted. The air force didn't say whether the bridge was hit. Russian forces also fired 43 exploding drones over at least nine Ukrainian regions; 17 were shot down, 23 jammed and three flew back to Russian-controlled territories, the air force said. The head of the Kyiv city administration, Serhii Popko, said debris from some of the drones that were intercepted over the capital fell in the Podil district just north of the downtown, causing minor damage. According to Popko, there was only one day of October when Kyiv residents did not hear an air alert. So far in October, Kyiv heard two air alerts per day on average, repelling 20 actual aerial attacks targeting the city. Ukraine struck back Thursday with drone attacks. Authorities in the Russia-occupied city of Berdyansk on the Sea of Azov reported a drone attack on the port early Thursday, saying three people were injured. Russia’s Defense Ministry said air defenses on Thursday downed 21 Ukrainian drones over several regions and the Black Sea.	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-2194b3300c3d950229cf9151890732af	2024-10-31T01:41:22-07:00	
Singapore's affluent veneer hides repression and corruption, says son of its modern-day founder	LONDON (AP) — Singapore has become much more repressive, and corruption in the Asian financial hub has worsened in the decade since the death of former Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew, according to his youngest son who fled to Britain to seek asylum from what he described as a campaign of persecution to silence him. Lee Hsien Yang, who has been granted political refugee status in the U.K., told The Associated Press that Singaporean authorities have 'weaponized' the country's laws against critics and that he is just the most prominent example of a growing number of Singaporeans fleeing abroad to seek protection from their own government. Lee cited a tightening of laws on security and rights of assembly and a sharp increase in the number of asylum-seekers from the city-state over the past decade under the rule of his estranged brother, Lee Hsien Loong, who was prime minister until he stepped down earlier this year. 'Singapore has this veneer that purports to be a sort of affluent, democratic, free country. The veneer is quite thin,' he said in an interview in London on Monday. 'Beneath that there is a repressive nature to that regime and there are people fleeing from it.' The Singapore government reacted strongly Thursday, accusing Lee of turning a 'personal vendetta into an international smear campaign against his father, his family and his country.' It said Lee had alleged in his asylum application that he and his family were being persecuted by the Singapore government to prevent his son, Li Shengwu, from becoming prime minister. 'That he would go so far as to allege this — though his son has repeatedly said he has no such ambition — shows his campaign against Singapore is not based on principles,' it said. Lee announced last week that he was forced to seek asylum from what he called unfounded criminal proceedings, defamation and surveillance against him and his wife by Singaporean authorities led by his brother. Human Rights Watch says Singapore silenced dissenting voices in its recent elections and voiced concern over aggressive enforcement of a sweeping 'online falsehoods' law that it said allows officials to censor online content. Accusations of state persecution The Lee brothers have been at odds since they fell out over the will of their late father. Lee Kuan Yew, who died in 2015, was both feared for his authoritarian tactics and admired worldwide for turning the city-state into one of the world’s richest nations. He stepped aside from power in 1990 but remained influential behind the scenes for many years afterward. Officials have accused Lee Hsien Yang and his wife of lying under oath and providing false evidence regarding his father's will. Lee said his son was prosecuted for criticizing the judiciary in a Facebook post. Lee himself lost a defamation suit last year and was ordered to pay damages to two government ministers whom he indicated were corrupt over their rental of state-owned properties. He said last month he has paid the amount, so that the family home under his name will not be seized. Lee called the actions against him 'bogus, abusive and unwarranted,' and said the campaign of persecution escalated after he joined Singapore’s opposition party in 2020. Lee said he and his wife left hurriedly in June 2022 and decided to apply for political asylum in the U.K. because they believed they needed protection. 'Many people claim this is a family feud. Well, the actions taken against me were taken by the organs of the state,' he said. 'In a tightly controlled country like Singapore, where my brother was the prime minister and holds the levers of power, there’s no way these things happen without his knowledge, his consent and his agreement,' he added. Financial scandals with international connections Lee further alleged that Singapore's banks and companies have been linked to growing numbers of international money laundering and corruption scandals in recent years. Last year Singaporean authorities seized $1.75 billion in assets including gold bars, bottles of alcohol, luxury cars and properties and arrested nine Chinese nationals in a massive money laundering case involving funds raised by illegal means abroad. Lee cited other examples including the involvement of Singaporean banks in the Malaysian state development fund 1MDB corruption scandal, and two Singapore government-linked companies operating in Brazil's oil and gas industry that were allegedly implicated in Brazil's sweeping 'Operation Car Wash' anti-corruption investigation. Lee said the cases and growing repression showed that his city has deteriorated — though he also acknowledged the lack of political freedoms was a holdover from his father's decadeslong leadership, during which the resource-poor former British colony transformed into a prosperous financial hub with low crime and almost zero corruption. 'Singapore has retained legislation and punishments which come from a different day and age,' he said. 'My father was a product of that day and age, but I think if he were alive today some of those things could well have changed.' Human Rights Watch said last year that Singapore carried out the highest number of executions for drug-related offenses in over a decade. The Singapore government said all of the examples of alleged corruption cited by Lee have been thoroughly addressed, either through the courts or in Parliament. It said Singapore hasn't wavered in its anti-corruption stance, pointing to the country’s high standing in international perceptions of corruption and its recent indictment of a former Cabinet minister on graft charges and robust controls to detect, deter and prosecute financial crimes. It called Lee 'a major beneficiary of the Singapore system' and noted he had freely participated in politics by joining an opposition party during the 2020 elections. Lee 'is not a victim of persecution. He and his wife remain citizens. They are and have always been free to return to Singapore,' the government said. Lee declined comment on whether he saw a role for himself as an opposition leader. But he said he intended to continue to 'speak his mind' on Singaporean politics despite his concerns over further attempts to silence him. 'I have no doubt that every time I do so, I risk further attacks from the Singaporean authorities,' he said. 'I think the day will come when things will change. I hope it will come in my lifetime and that one day I’ll be able to return to my home.' ___ Associated Press writer Eileen Ng in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/singapore-uk-lee-hsien-yang-asylum-d9ff237aa1aad60a0246a7dfb1a026b4	2024-10-31T00:44:55-07:00	
Spain searches for bodies after flood of the century claims at least 95 lives	BARRIO DE LA TORRE, Spain (AP) — Survivors of the worst natural disaster to hit Spain this century awoke to scenes of devastation on Thursday after villages were wiped out by monstrous flash floods that claimed at least 95 lives. The death toll could rise as search efforts continue with an unknown number of people still missing. The aftermath looked eerily similar to the damage left by a strong hurricane or tsunami. Wrecked vehicles, tree branches, downed power lines and household items all mired in a layer of mud covered the streets of Barrio de la Torre, a suburb of Valencia, just one of dozens of damaged localities in the hard-hit region of Valencia, where 92 people died between late Tuesday and Wednesday morning. Walls of rushing water turned narrow streets into death traps and spawned rivers that ripped into the ground floors of homes and swept away cars, people and anything else in its path. 'The neighborhood is destroyed, all the cars are on top of each other, it’s literally smashed up,' said Christian Viena, a bar owner in Barrio de la Torre. Regional authorities said late Wednesday it appeared there was no one left stranded on rooftops or in cars in need of rescue after helicopters had saved some 70 people. But ground crews and citizens continued to inspect vehicles and homes that were damaged by the onslaught of water. Over a thousand soldiers from Spain’s emergency rescue units joined regional and local emergency workers in the search for bodies and survivors. The defense minister said that soldiers alone had recovered 22 bodies and rescued 110 people by Wednesday night. 'We are searching house by house,' Ángel Martínez, official of a military emergency unit, told Spain’s national radio broadcaster RNE on Thursday from the town of Utiel, where at least six people died. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez is heading to the region to witness the destruction firsthand as the nation starts a three-day period of official mourning. Thousands of people were left without water and electricity and hundreds were stranded after their cars were wrecked or roads were blocked. The region remained partly isolated with several roads cut off and train lines interrupted, including the high-speed service to Madrid, which officials say won’t be repaired for several days. While Valencia took the brunt of the storm, another two casualties were reported in the neighboring Castilla La Mancha region. Southern Andalusia reported one death. The relative calm of the day after has also given time to reflect and question if authorities could have done more to save lives. The regional government is being criticized for not sending out flood warnings to people’s mobile phones until 8:00 p.m. on Tuesday, when the flooding had already started in some parts. Spain’s Mediterranean coast is used to autumn storms that can cause flooding. But this was the most powerful flash flood event in recent memory. Scientists link it to climate change, which is also behind increasingly high temperatures and droughts in Spain and the heating up of the Mediterranean Sea. ___ Wilson reported from Barcelona, Spain.	https://apnews.com/article/flash-floods-spain-valencia-climate-change-30c6ef59ddf27598c691c89d0ba41442	2024-10-31T00:18:41-07:00	
Middle East latest: Officials in West Bank say Israeli raid has killed 3	Palestinian officials said Thursday that an Israeli military raid in the occupied West Bank killed at least three people. The Palestinian Health Ministry said Thursday that two Palestinians were killed in an Israeli strike and third by Israeli gunfire. The Israeli military said its forces were targeting militants in the area of the Nur Shams refugee camp, which has seen repeated battles in recent months. The military said it eliminated a Hamas militant in the area who was involved in planning attacks on Israelis. Also Thursday, Israeli police said they have arrested a couple accused of spying on Israeli intelligence sites and collecting information on an Israeli academic on behalf of Iran. Meanwhile, mediators are ramping up efforts to halt the wars in Lebanon and the Gaza Strip, circulating new proposals to wind down the regional conflict. Hezbollah’s newly named leader, Naim Kassem, said the militant group will keep fighting in its war with Israel until it is offered cease-fire terms it deems acceptable. Some 1.2 million people have been displaced by the conflict in Lebanon, according to government estimates. Lebanon’s Heath Ministry said more than 2,800 people have been killed and 12,900 wounded since Oct. 8, 2023, when Hezbollah began firing rockets into Israel, drawing retaliation. Israeli ground forces invaded southern Lebanon at the beginning of October. The death toll from more than a year of the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza has passed 43,000, Palestinian officials reported Monday, without distinguishing between civilians and combatants. The war began after Hamas-led militants stormed into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people — mostly civilians — and abducting 250 others. ___ Here’s the latest: Israeli airstrikes kill 8 people in eastern and southern Lebanon BEIRUT — The Israeli military has warned people to evacuate from more areas of southern Lebanon, including a built-up Palestinian refugee camp. Israeli airstrikes, meanwhile, killed at least eight people in different parts of the country on Thursday. The Rashidiyeh refugee camp near the port city of Tyre is one of several dating back to the 1948 Mideast war, when hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were driven out of what is now Israel. Israel invaded Lebanon at the start of October, after nearly a year of trading fire with Hezbollah. The militant group began firing rockets, missiles and drones on northern Israel after Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023 attack triggered the war in Gaza. Iran backs both groups. Israel has warned people to evacuate from large areas of the country, including major cities in the south and east. Over a million people have already fled their homes. Israeli strikes killed seven people in eastern Lebanon, according to Lebanon’s state-run National News agency. Another strike killed a man on a motorcycle on the coastal highway between Tyre and Sidon. The news agency also reported a strike on a car on a main highway running through the mountains outside the capital, Beirut. It said the strike closed the highway, diverting traffic through nearby villages. There was no immediate word on casualties. Israeli police arrest a couple accused of spying for Iran JERUSALEM — Israeli police said Thursday they have arrested a couple accused of spying on Israeli intelligence sites and collecting information on an Israeli academic on behalf of Iran. Israeli security services say they have uncovered several Iranian spy networks in recent months. The two archenemies have waged a long-running shadow war that has burst into the open since the outbreak of the war in Gaza. They exchanged fire directly for the first time in April and then again this month. In a statement released Thursday, the police and the Shin Bet internal security agency said that the man arrested, Rafael Guliev, from the central city of Lod, had surveilled Israel’s Mossad spy headquarters for the Iranians and collected information on an academic working at the Institute for National Security Studies, a prominent Israeli think tank. It did not identify the scholar. The statement said Guliev was also entrusted with finding an assassin, though the statement did not make clear if he had actually done so. Guliev’s wife, Lala, assisted in the activities, the statement said. Officials in West Bank say 3 people were killed in Israeli raid RAMALLAH, West Bank — Palestinian officials said an Israeli military raid in the occupied West Bank killed at least three people. The military said its forces were targeting militants in the area of the Nur Shams refugee camp, which has seen repeated battles in recent months. The military said it eliminated a Hamas militant in the area who was involved in planning attacks on Israelis. The Palestinian Health Ministry said Thursday that two Palestinians were killed in an Israeli strike and third by Israeli gunfire. Israel said its forces were still in the area. At least 763 Palestinians, including over 165 children, have been killed by Israeli fire in the West Bank since Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023 attack out of the Gaza Strip triggered the war there, according to the Health Ministry. Most appear to have been militants killed during army operations, but the dead also include civilian bystanders and people killed during violent protests. Palestinians have carried out dozens of stabbing, shooting and car-ramming attacks against Israelis since the start of the war. Israel captured the West Bank in the 1967 Mideast war and the Palestinians want it to form the main part of their future state. Israel has built scores of settlements there that are now home to over 500,000 Israeli settlers. The 3 million Palestinians in the territory live under seemingly open-ended Israeli military rule, with the Western-backed Palestinian Authority exercising limited self-rule in population centers.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-hezbollah-mideast-latest-31-october-2024-f5910a533abaf7e78e445d24169d73cf	2024-10-30T23:55:18-07:00	
AP PHOTOS: Ayodhya in northern India celebrates the night before Diwali with pomp and pageantry	AYODHYA, India (AP) — A priest stands with folded hands praying toward the rising sun on the banks of the Saryu River in Ayodhya in the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh. Nearby, a group of women takes a dip in the river dressed in their saris while a barber trims the mustache of a shirtless man on the bank. Similar scenes have played out at this spot for hundreds of years. Ayodhya is an ancient city that Hindus believe was the birthplace of their beloved deity Lord Rama. It’s early morning on Wednesday, Oct. 30, the day before Diwali, the biggest of the Hindu festivals. According to the Hindu epic Ramayana, when Rama retuned home to Ayodhya after 14 years in exile with his wife Sita and brother Laxmana, its citizens lit lamps to welcome them. Diwali, which means an array of lights, celebrates Rama’s homecoming. It also symbolizes the victory of good over evil. Millions of Hindus across the country light their homes with oil lamps or festive electric lights on the new-moon day. They distribute sweets, burst firecrackers and shop for gold and household appliances during the five-day festivities, with Diwali on the third day. What was once a private celebration with family and friends is increasingly public, and it is nowhere more evident than in Ayodhya. Since 2017, the Uttar Pradesh state government has organized Deepotsav, a celebration that includes drones and laser lights, on the eve of Diwali in Ayodhya. Last year, 2.2 million oil lamps were lit on the banks of the Saryu River, setting a Guinness World Record. This year, the state broke its own record by lighting 2.51 million lamps. Actors playing Rama, Sita and Laxmana were brought in by helicopter. They stood on a carpeted open area while the state’s Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and other senior officials offered prayers. During the ceremony, another helicopter showered flower petals on them. People watched a laser show as they stood among the rows of burning oil lamps, recording the experience on their phones.	https://apnews.com/article/ayodhya-diwali-festival-photo-gallery-india-201b3c2a33e2f7b5eedfc703eebabd9f	2024-10-30T22:27:21-07:00	
Locked in Mideast wars and battered by sanctions, Iran is wary over US presidential election	TEHRAN, Iran (AP) — America's presidential election next week comes just after Iran marks the 45th anniversary of the 1979 U.S. Embassy hostage crisis — and for many, tensions between Tehran and Washington feel just as high as they did then. Iran remains locked in the Mideast wars roiling the region, with its allies — militant groups and fighters of its self-described 'Axis of Resistance' — battered as Israel presses its war in the Gaza Strip targeting Hamas and its invasion of Lebanon amid devastating attacks against Hezbollah. At the same time, Iran still appears to be assessing damage from Israel's strikes on the Islamic Republic last Saturday in response to two Iranian ballistic missile attacks. Iran's currency, the rial, hovers near record lows against the dollar, battered by international sanctions over Tehran's nuclear program of enriching uranium closer than ever to weapons-grade levels. In public spaces, women still openly defy Iran's mandatory law on the headscarf, or hijab, a result of the mass demonstrations over the 2022 death of Mahsa Amini that still haunts the country. That has left a feel of fatalism among some on the streets of the capital, Tehran, as Americans cast ballots for either Vice President Kamala Harris or former President Donald Trump. Many are split on which candidate would be better for their country — if at all. 'All U.S presidents elected after the (1979) revolution had the same views about Iran and I think that’s unlikely to change,' said Sadegh Rabbani, 65. Harris and Trump have offered hard-line views on Iran, making Iranians wary Both candidates have either undertaken or expressed tough stances on Iran. In 2018, Trump unilaterally pulled America out of Tehran's nuclear deal with world powers, setting off years of attacks across the Middle East even before Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel. Trump has been briefed on Iranian plots to retaliate against him, as well over his decision to launch a 2020 drone strike that killed Iran's top general, Qassem Soleimani, in Baghdad. Harris, meanwhile, vowed at the September presidential debate that she would always 'give Israel the ability to defend itself, in particular as it relates to Iran and any threat that Iran and its proxies pose to Israel.' For its part, the Biden administration did try indirect negotiations with Iran over its nuclear program that produced no tangible results, though it did reach one prisoner swap deal that saw five Americans detained for years in Iran walk free in September 2023. In an outdoor coffeeshop in downtown Tehran, popular among the youth, 22-year-old Zahra Rezaei said she preferred a Harris win. 'We saw Trump in the past and he just ran an anti-Iran policy,' Rezaei told The Associated Press. 'It is time for a woman ... I think she (Harris) will better since she is not after war.' Ebrahim Shiri, a 28-year-old postgraduate political sciences student, agreed. 'I think Harris knows the world better,' he said. 'She and (Joe) Biden convinced Israel not to attack Iran’s nuclear facilities. This mean moving toward peace.' Others believe Trump, with his promises of dealmaking, might be a better fit. 'I do not know what the American people think, but Trump is able to get a quick deal with Iran,' said Mohammad Ali Raoufi, 43, who runs a double-glazed window workshop. 'The Biden administration including Harris failed to reach any (deal) with Iran over the past years when they were in power.' Reza Ghaemi, a 31-year-old taxi driver, also suggested Trump may lessen tensions in the region since he pushed to withdraw U.S. troops from the Mideast during his term in office. Iran's government wants sanctions gone and hopes for another nuclear deal Many declined to speak to the AP on camera — Iran has only state-run television and radio stations, so people are suspicious of reporters with video cameras working openly on the street. A woman walking by immediately tightened her previously loose headscarf after seeing the camera. However, one woman spoke on camera as her hijab fell off and another didn't wear it all — a sign of how much Iran has changed since Amini's death. Those who did speak to the AP mostly expressed worries about a direct United States-Iran war — especially if Trump wins. While saying he wants Trump to win 'for my own reasons,' 53-year-old Ahmad Moradi claimed that would make a U.S.-Iran war '100%' sure to happen. A woman who only gave her name as Mahnaz, fearing repercussions for speaking openly, suggested that Harris, as a woman, couldn’t reach any deals with Iran because 'men can talk to men.' 'I think if Trump is elected, it will be much harder for our kids. Of course it doesn’t matter which one is elected, it’s already tough for us,' said Fariba Oodi. 'We the Iranian people are trapped in some political game. And our kids are paying a price for that,' she added. 'But I still think if it’s Trump, it will be more difficult, especially for my son who is a student and plans to apply' to study in America. Iran's reformist President Masoud Pezeshkian, elected after a helicopter crash killed hard-line President Ebrahim Raisi in May, came to power on a promise to reach a deal to ease Western sanctions. Iranian officials maintain that separating nuclear negotiations from Mideast wars is possible, even as the U.S. has accused Iran of meddling in the November election, which Tehran denies. Fatemeh Mohajerani, a spokeswoman for Pezeshkian's administration, said Tehran wants to see a change in U.S. policies and a respect for the 'national sovereignty of other countries.' It also wants Washington to 'avoid tension-making activities as we witnessed in recent years,' she said. Analysts, however, see a difficult road ahead for any possible U.S.-Iran talks, no matter who wins next Tuesday. 'The talks will be a war of attrition,' Ali Soufi told the pro-reform Shargh newspaper. Saeed Nourmohammadi, another analyst, suggested such talks 'are unlikely to be fruitful.' But ultimately, any decision rests with Iran's 85-year-old Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. 'You know, Khamenei has seen eight U.S. presidents' come and go, said Abbas Ghasemi, a 67-year-old retired teacher 'He knows how to deal with the next one.' ___ Associated Press writer Jon Gambrell in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/iran-us-election-mideast-wars-israel-nuclear-deal-2d749543470a5cd7df6c6ece863b4732	2024-10-30T21:03:48-07:00	
America's European allies face challenging times, whoever wins the presidential election	BERLIN (AP) — The United States' European allies are bracing for an America that's less interested in them no matter who wins the presidential election — and for old traumas and new problems if Donald Trump returns to the White House. The election comes more than 2 1/2 years into Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, in which Washington has made the single biggest contribution to Kyiv's defense. There are question marks over whether that would continue under Trump, and how committed he would be to NATO allies in general. A win by Vice President Kamala Harris could be expected to bring a continuation of current policy, though with Republican opposition and growing war fatigue among the U.S. public there are concerns in Europe that support would wane. Trump's appetite for imposing tariffs on U.S. partners also is causing worry in a Europe already struggling with sluggish economic growth. But it's not just the possibility of a second Trump presidency that has the continent anxious about tougher times ahead. European officials believe U.S. priorities lie elsewhere, no matter who wins. The Middle East is top of President Joe Biden’s list right now, but the long-term priority is China. 'The centrality of Europe to U.S. foreign policy is different than it was in Biden’s formative years,' said Rachel Tausendfreund, a senior research fellow at the German Council on Foreign Relations in Berlin. 'And in that way, it is true that Biden is the last trans-Atlantic president.' The U.S. will continue to pivot toward Asia, she said. 'That means Europe has to step up. Europe has to become a more capable partner and also become more capable of managing its own security area.' Germany’s defense minister, Boris Pistorius, remarked when he signed a new defense pact with NATO ally Britain that the U.S. will focus more on the Indo-Pacific region, 'so it is only a question of, will they do much less in Europe because of that or only a little bit less.' Ian Lesser, a distinguished fellow at the German Marshall Fund in Brussels, said that 'above all, Europe is looking for predictability from Washington,' and that's in short supply in a turbulent world in which any administration will face other demands on its attention. 'But the potential for disruption is clearly greater in the case of a potential Trump administration.' 'There is an assumption of essential continuity' under Harris that's probably well-founded, he said, with many people who have shaped policy under Biden likely to remain. 'It's very much the known world, even if the strategic environment produces uncertainties of its own.' While both the U.S. and Europe have been increasingly focused on competition with Asia, the ongoing war in Europe means 'the potential costs of a shift away from European security on the American side are very much higher today than they might have been a few years ago,' Lesser said. Europe's ability to deal with that depends on how quickly it happens, he said. Europe's lagging defense spending irked U.S. administrations of both parties for years, though NATO members including Germany raised their game after the 2022 invasion of Ukraine. NATO forecasts that 23 of the 32 allies will meet its target of spending 2% or more of gross domestic product on defense this year, compared to only three a decade ago. During his 2017-2021 term, Trump threatened to abandon ' delinquent ' countries if they weren’t paying their 'bills.' In campaigning this time, he suggested that Russia could do what it wants with them. His bluster has undermined trust and worried countries nearest to an increasingly unpredictable Russia, like Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland. Europeans see the war in Ukraine as an existential challenge in a way the United States eventually may not, even with some signs of war fatigue emerging in Europe itself. If Trump wins, 'there's every indication that he has no interest in continuing to support Ukraine in this war' and will push quickly for some kind of cease-fire or peace agreement deal that Kyiv may not like and Europe may not be ready for, Tausendfreund said. 'And there is also just no way that Europe can fill the military gap left if the U.S. were to withdraw support.' 'Even with a Harris administration there is a growing, changing debate — frankly, on both sides of the Atlantic — about what comes next in the war in Ukraine, what is the end game,' Lesser said. Biden emphasized the need to stay the course in Ukraine during a brief recent visit to Berlin when he conferred with German, French and British leaders. 'We cannot let up. We must sustain our support,' Biden said. 'In my view, we must keep going until Ukraine wins a just and durable peace.' The times he has lived through have taught him that 'we should never underestimate the power of democracy, never underestimate the value of alliances,' the 81-year-old Biden added. German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, who bestowed Germany's highest honor on Biden for his service to trans-Atlantic relations, hopes Biden's compatriots are listening. 'In the months to come, I hope that Europeans remember: America is indispensable for us,' he said. 'And I also hope that Americans remember: Your allies are indispensable for you. We are more than just ‘other countries’ in the world —we are partners, we are friends.' Whoever wins the White House, the coming years could be bumpy. 'Whatever the outcome next week, half of the country will go away angry,' Lesser said, noting there's 'every prospect' of divided government in Washington. 'Europe is going to face a very chaotic and sometimes dysfunctional America.' ___ Associated Press writer Lorne Cook in Brussels contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/europe-transatlantic-relations-election-trump-harris-ukraine-2e98d6bf7982e44faa53590b858c6746	2024-10-30T20:48:21-07:00	
At least 14 killed in long-running land dispute between rebel clans in southern Philippines	COTABATO, Philippines (AP) — At least 14 people were killed in a long-seething land dispute involving two Muslim guerrilla commanders and their followers in a southern Philippine town, military and civilian officials said Thursday. The fighting erupted Wednesday between the two commanders of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front in a village in Pagalungan town in Maguindanao del Sur province but a truce has since been forged by the military, police and leaders of the rebel front. The fighting was set off by a long-running land dispute between the clans of the two rebel commanders and was not directly related to the Muslim insurgency. The Moro Islamic Liberation Front was the largest Muslim separatist armed group in the southern Philippines, homeland of minority Muslims in the largely Roman Catholic nation, until it signed a peace deal with the government in 2014 when it dropped its separatist goal and agreed to a better-funded Muslim autonomous region called Bangsamoro in the volatile south. The six-province Muslim region is now governed by former rebel leaders in a transition arrangement prior to regular elections in May next year. Thousands of guerrillas belonging to the rebel front, however, were still holding on to their firearms while awaiting amnesty and livelihood packages from the government under the peace deal. Pagalungan town Vice Mayor Abdillah Mamasabulod said a long-running feud over a vast farmland involving two clans led by commanders of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front erupted anew into fierce fighting Wednesday afternoon in the village of Kilangan. 'They have been fighting over ownership of about 290 hectares (716 acres) of agricultural land,' Mamasabulod told reporters and renewed a call for the warring clans to settle their dispute peacefully through government and rebel mediators. Mamasabulod cited witnesses as saying that up to 19 people were killed in the sporadic fighting and scores were wounded before a cease-fire was forged. Army Lt. Col. Roden Orbon, spokesperson of the 6th Infantry Division, however, said at least 14 people were killed in the intermittent clashes in the village, where government forces were deployed to secure civilian villagers. Troops recovered five assault rifles at the scene of the fighting. 'The military and police are continuously conducting monitoring in all nearby hospitals and coordinating with the leadership of both warring groups to identify the still unidentified bodies,' Orbon said. Dozens of villagers who fled at the height of the fighting were returning to their communities, he said. The fighting is the latest reminder of the complex security problems that have long hounded the southern Philippines, which has bountiful resources and potential but has long been hamstrung by stark poverty, weak law enforcement, a large number of unlicensed firearms and an array of insurgents and outlaws.	https://apnews.com/article/southern-philippines-land-dispute-moro-islamic-liberation-front-a9d2d4e185409279a21f19c2deaae368	2024-10-30T20:29:41-07:00	
8 of 11 members of Mexico's Supreme Court to resign in protest of controversial judicial overhaul	MEXICO CITY (AP) — Eight justices of Mexico’s Supreme Court have said they will leave the court rather than stand for election as required by a controversial judicial overhaul passed last month. Supreme Court President Norma Piña and seven others submitted letters Tuesday and Wednesday stating they would leave their posts rather than compete in judicial elections scheduled for next June. The court’s three other justices have indicated they will compete in the elections. Previously, the Supreme Court’s justices were selected by the Senate. Last month, Mexico’s Congress passed — and a majority of states ratified — then-President Andrés Manuel López Obrador’s initiative to make all of the country’s judges subject to election. López Obrador and his allies, including his successor Claudia Sheinbaum, have said the radical change will help rid the judicial system of corruption. However, critics say the courts will become less independent and more subject to political forces. The resignations came before the Congress’ lower chamber later Wednesday passed yet another constitutional change that would protect constitutional amendments like the judicial overhaul from legal challenges. The Supreme Court is scheduled to take up such a challenge in the coming the days. The amendment passed with 343 votes in favor and 129 against. The Senate had previously passed the legislation. Business sectors in particular had voiced concerns that the change would weaken the rule of law. The Mexican Employers’ Association, Coparmex, had said in a statement before the vote that the initiative 'puts at risk the fundamental guarantees that have protected citizens for decades.' López Obrador clashed throughout his six-year term with the courts as they repeatedly knocked down some of his initiatives. He railed against judges in his daily morning press briefings and Sheinbaum, his protégé, has continued in a similar vein. Sheinbaum had quipped Tuesday that if the Supreme Court justices didn’t resign now before the close of judicial candidate registration in November they could lose their pensions. 'It’s a lot of money,' she said.	https://apnews.com/article/mexico-supreme-court-judges-resign-judicial-elections-9d7c8b8586c3729c0d23a0b90e2ea7bc	2024-10-30T20:29:34-07:00	
Here's why Argentina's public universities are paralyzed by protests	BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) — After 11 months in office, Argentina's right-wing President Javier Milei has fulfilled his flagship pledge to eliminate the country's monumental deficits by shrinking the public payroll, slashing subsidies and suppressing already low wages of state workers. The austerity has spawned misery. But with the country’s left-wing opposition in disarray after delivering the economic disaster that Milei inherited, Argentina hasn’t seen the kind of widespread social unrest that has characterized past economic crises. That could change. The country's teachers are fed up. Milei’s recent veto of a bill boosting spending on university budgets struck a collective nerve in a nation that long has considered free education a critical engine of social progress, drawing the broadest demonstrations since the libertarian leader took office. Last week's open-air classes held in Plaza de Mayo, the main square home to government headquarters, marked the latest in a new wave of protests supporting public universities that has gripped Argentina over the past month. Students are taking over college campuses in the coming days ahead of another mass protest. Here’s a look at what students are protesting and what it means for Milei's effort to transform crisis-prone Argentina into an economic success story. What do protesters want? Professors and non-teaching staff at public universities across Argentina are demanding a pay raise to compensate for sky-high inflation that they say has shrunk their purchasing power by 60% this year. After a student-led march mobilized a half-million protesters in April, Milei's government compensated universities for operational costs but not for teachers’ salaries. The average salary of an associate professor is now $320 per month. For teaching assistants, it’s just $120 a month. The university funding bill that Milei vetoed would have increased staff salaries to make up for 2024 annual inflation — which now tops 200% — and adjusted them for inflation going forward. Even if Milei’s drastic measures have recently dragged month-on-month inflation below 5%, the number of Argentines in poverty has swelled to more than 50%. The public university system hasn't seen this kind of budget shortfall since 2004, according to the Civil Association for Equality and Justice, an Argentine nonprofit. 'Our living conditions have visibly worsened,' said Nicolas Jose Lavagnino, a researcher in the philosophy of biology at Conicet, Argentina's leading research body that reported losing 250 scientists this year due to budget cuts. Unions reject the government's 6.8% pay raise offer as inadequate. The University of Buenos Aires — one of Latin America's biggest and most prestigious — has warned of mass resignations over depreciating salaries. At least 30 teachers have quit at UBA's Faculty of Agriculture alone. Milei has vowed to block any measure that jeopardizes the budget balance. In September, he vetoed a bill raising pensions — which would have cost his government over 1% of Argentina's gross domestic product — for the same reason. But the education bill would have cost only 0.14% of GDP, stirring doubts over the economic significance of Milei’s battle. 'We see this as a direct attack on the philosophy of public education in our country,' said Matias Busi, a 25-year-old student at Argentina's University of La Plata. What does Milei say? The irascible president has lambasted universities as leftist indoctrination camps. 'What productivity do scientists have?' he said in 2023 on the campaign trail, advocating for the defunding of research institute Conicet. While promising not to get rid of free public education, Milei demands that universities undergo a government audit and do more to clean up corruption. 'If they don’t want to be audited, it must be because they are dirty,' he said. Milei’s party in recent weeks has also revived an unpopular attempt to charge tuition for foreign non-residents, who make up nearly 4% of total enrollment. The public education system in Argentina is rare in that there are no bars to entry — foreigners who can’t afford a bachelor’s degree in their own countries can enroll free of charge at first-rate public universities like UBA, where all five of the country's Nobel Prize winners studied. Half of Milei's Cabinet even graduated from public universities. Some say Milei is justified in requesting more financial transparency, pointing to the alleged misuse of funds and creeping politicization of what was once a universally respected institution. 'There were contracts with public sector figures where absurd things were funded,' said Argentine political consultant Sergio Berensztein, referring to scandals that erupted during the tenure of former leftist President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner over big-budget research projects that audits later revealed had never existed. 'They were simply mechanisms to divert funds for political interests,' What is the political context? After Milei's government mustered just enough votes to prevent the opposition from overriding his veto of the university funding bill on Oct. 10, over 250,000 Argentines — spanning the far-left to center-right — flooded the streets. The student-led movement drew a range of Argentine protesters stung by austerity that has deepened the recession and pushed poverty to its highest level in 20 years — retirees desperate for better pensions, doctors furious over meager pay, artists against closure of the national film institute, scientists angry over gutted funds, pilots worried about Milei's plans to privatize Argentina's flagship airline. Santiago Gándara, a social sciences professor at both UBA and the University of La Pampa, said he believed Milei miscalculated in going after Argentina's proud symbol of publicly financed education for the masses. 'It is like someone coming and saying, ‘We are going to get rid of the Plaza de Mayo,’' he said, referring to the historic Buenos Aires square that filled with protesters last week. 'Milei understood this too late. … You can’t decide the fate of Plaza de Mayo. It belongs to all of us.' The question of whether the demonstrations morph into a real threat for Milei remains open. 'I think these protests are not at the point of being life-threatening to Milei, but it's obviously damaging,' said Ana Iparraguirre, an Argentine analyst and partner at Washington-based strategy firm GBAO. 'When students mobilize, you really never know where that movement is going to end.' ___ Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america	https://apnews.com/article/argentina-milei-protests-universities-farright-explained-e442fecf9f66da7508b8686b756847d3	2024-10-30T20:27:22-07:00	
Japan celebrates as Shohei Ohtani, Yoshinobu Yamamoto win World Series with Dodgers	TOKYO (AP) — The World Series trophy is headed to Los Angeles, but there's a hearty celebration going on across the Pacific Ocean in Japan, too. People milled around the edge of the Ginza shopping area in central Tokyo on Thursday afternoon as single-sheet, special newspaper editions rolled off the presses, proclaiming Japanese stars Shohei Ohtani and Yoshinobu Yamamoto as world champions along with their Dodgers teammates after a stirring Game 5 victory over the New York Yankees. The headline in Japanese in the Sports Nippon newspaper, set in yellow and blue type — with red highlights — read: 'No. 1 in The World. Ohtani beats the Yankees.' 'I want to thank my Japanese fans for coming all the way to cheer me this season,' Ohtani said on Japanese television. 'That cheering gave me some energy so I’m glad I could return the gratitude my winning.' The newspaper handouts are a Tokyo tradition when Japan celebrates a big event. And it was a scramble, as usual, with men and women — young and old —sprinting up and down the sidewalk to get their free collector's items. The Yomiuri Shimbun headline read: 'Dodgers No. 1; Ohtani, Yamamoto in first season.' Yasuko Shibata, an 80-year-old woman who said she faithfully watches Ohtani's games, said she admired 'Ohtani's personality.' Not to mention his great play. 'His presence is huge,' she said. 'He is a source of my energy. When he doesn’t do well, I also feel blue' Another fan echoed her thoughts, standing near the Ginza underground entrance. 'He is the pride of Japan,' said Hideki Shinohara, who called himself a hardcore fan. 'You cannot describe him with just ‘amazing.’ You need to invent a new word.' Shinohara added: 'He went through many things this year, and I didn’t expect him to come all this way. I am very pleased with what he has achieved. ' The Japanese pride in Ohtani is a huge one for a country whose players were once considered too small, or only good pitchers. Now, there is strong pride in the fact that their players are among the best in the game. Japan defeated the United States in the World Baseball Classic final last year in Miami, another sign of the country's prowess in the American pastime. It was also a victory for Ohtani's hometown in northern Japan — Oshu City — where fans have been gathering all week and anticipating their superstar hero would help deliver the title. About 38,000 special edition newspapers were also published in Iwate Prefecture, the northern area where Oshu City is located. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB	https://apnews.com/article/ohtani-japan-world-series-7d921035c88de41024a0a62fd89afa92	2024-10-30T20:23:12-07:00	
Ukrainian front-line school system goes underground to protect against bombs and radiation	ZAPORIZHZHIA, Ukraine (AP) — To be a parent in the Ukrainian front-line city of Zaporizhzhia means weighing your child’s life against the Russian weapons within striking distance. Most rain death in an instant: the drones, the ballistic missiles, the glide bombs, the artillery shells. But Russian soldiers control another weapon they have never deployed, with the potential to be just as deadly: The nearby Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. The NPP, as it’s known, once produced more electricity than any other nuclear power plant in Europe. It fell to Russian forces in the first weeks of the full-scale invasion, and Russia has held its six reactors ever since. The plant has come under repeated attacks that both sides blame on the other. These twin dangers — bombs and radiation — shadow families in Zaporizhzhia. Most of the youngest residents of the city have never seen the inside of a classroom. Schools that had suspended in-person classes during the COVID-19 pandemic more than four years ago continued online classes after the war started in February 2022. So with missiles and bombs still striking daily, Zaporizhzhia is going on a building binge for its future, creating an underground school system. Construction has begun on a dozen subterranean schools designed to be radiation- and bomb-proof and capable of educating 12,000 students. Then, officials say, they will start on the hospital system. The daily bombs are a more tangible fear than radiation, said Kateryna Ryzhko, a mother whose children are the third generation in her family to attend School No. 88. The main building, dating to the Soviet era of the children’s grandmother, is immaculate but the classrooms are empty. The underground version is nearly complete, and Ryzhko said she wouldn’t hesitate to send her kids to class there. Nearly four years of online learning have taken their toll on kids and parents alike. 'Even classmates don’t recognize each other,' she said. 'It’s the only safe way to have an education and not be on screens.' Nuclear shadow Within days of Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022, Zaporizhzhia’s 300,000 residents found themselves on the front lines. Unlike larger Ukrainian cities, like Kyiv or Kharkiv, there is no subway system that could do double-duty as a bomb shelter and few schools had basements where students could more safely attend classes. Many residents left — though some have returned. But the single-family homes and Soviet-style apartment blocks of Zaporizhzhia, the capital of the region that shares its name, filled nearly as quickly with Ukrainians fleeing areas seized by Russian forces, like the cities of Mariupol, Melitopol and Berdyansk. By the start of the school year in September 2022, which was supposed to mark the post-pandemic return to classrooms, schools were empty. Windows were boarded up to protect against bomb shockwaves, the lawns left unkempt. Fifty kilometers (31 miles) away, the nuclear reactor went into cold shutdown after intense negotiations between the International Atomic Energy Agency and the Russian government. The IAEA has rotated a handful of staff on site ever since. There are risks even in cold shutdown, when the reactor is operating but not generating power. The main danger is that its external electrical supply, which comes from Ukrainian-controlled territory under constant Russian bombardment, will be cut off for a longer period than generators can handle. The nuclear plant needs electricity to keep crucial backups functioning, including water pumps that prevent meltdowns, radiation monitors and other essential safety systems. During a recent Associated Press trip to the Ukrainian-controlled zone closest to the nuclear plant, two airborne bombs struck electrical infrastructure in a matter of minutes as night fell. Russia has repeatedly struck at Ukraine’s grid, attacks that have intensified this year. Highlighting the constant danger, electricity to the NPP was cut yet again for three days as emergency workers struggled to put out the fire. It was at least the seventh time this year that the plant was down to either a single electrical line or generator power, according to the global Nuclear Energy Agency. 'Nuclear power plants are not meant to be disconnected from the grid. It’s not designed for that. It’s also not designed to be operating in cold shutdown for that long,' said Darya Dolzikova, a researcher on nuclear policy at the Royal United Services Institute in London. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy accuses Russia of targeting nuclear plants deliberately. The 1986 meltdown in Ukraine’s Chornobyl, on the northern border nearly 900 kilometers (550 miles) from Zaporizhzhia, increased the country’s rates of thyroid disease among Ukrainian children far from the accident site and radiation contaminated the immediate surroundings before drifting over much of the Northern Hemisphere. To this day, the area around the plant, known in Russian as Chernobyl, is an 'exclusion zone' off-limits except to the technical staff needed to keep the decommissioned site safe. Russian forces seized control of Chornobyl in the first days of the invasion, only to be driven back by Ukrainian forces. The Zaporizhzhia plant has a safer, more modern design than Chornobyl and there’s not the same danger of a large-scale meltdown, experts say. But that doesn’t reduce the risk to zero, and Russia will remain a threatening neighbor even after the war ends. An investment that might seem extreme elsewhere is more understandable in Ukraine, said Sam Lair, a researcher at the Center for Nonproliferation Studies. 'They are there under a conventional air and missile attack from the Russians, and they have experience with the fact that those attacks aren’t being targeted only at military targets,' Lair said. 'If I were in their position, I would be building them too.' In addition, the Zaporizhzhia region received a European Union donation of 5.5 million iodine pills, which help block the thyroid’s absorption of some radiation. Since the start of the war, Russia has repeatedly alluded to its nuclear weapons stockpile without leveling direct threats. In September, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that Russia would consider any attack by a country supported by a nuclear-armed nation to be a joint attack and stressed that Russia could respond with nuclear weapons to any attack that posed a 'critical threat to our sovereignty.' Ukrainian officials fear that the Russian attacks on Chornobyl and the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plants may be just a start. During his speech in late September to the U.N. General Assembly, Zelenskyy warned that Russia was preparing strikes on more nuclear plants, which generate a large portion of Ukraine’s electricity. 'If, God forbid, Russia causes a nuclear disaster at one of our nuclear power plants, radiation won’t respect state borders,' Zelenskyy said. Underground for the future The cost to build a subterranean school system is enormous — the budget for the underground version of Gymnasium No. 71 alone stands at more than 112 million hryvnias ($2.7 million). International donors are covering most of it, and the national and local governments have made it a priority on par with funding the army. 'Everybody understands that fortification and aid for the army, it’s priority No. 1,' said Ivan Fedorov, head of the Zaporizhzhia region. 'But if we lose the new generation of our Ukrainians, for whom (do) we fight?' Daria Oncheva, a 15-year-old student at Gymnasium 71, looks forward to the underground classes, and not just because she’ll finally be in the same place as her schoolmates. 'It’s safer than sitting at home remotely,' she said. School No. 88, across town, is further along, with rooms carved out and fully lined with concrete thick enough to block an initial onslaught of radiation. The contractor leading the project is also digging trenches for Ukraine’s military. When done, it will also be the primary bomb shelter for the neighborhood, whose single-family homes tend to have small orchards and trellised gardens — but no basements. An optimistic timeline has the school ready for children by December. It has three layers of rebar totaling 400 tons of metal, plus 3,100 cubic meters of reinforced concrete. The building will be topped by nearly a meter (yard) of earth, concealed by a soccer field and playground. The school will have an air filtration system, two distinct electrical lines and the ability to operate autonomously for three days, including with extra food and water supplies. Michael Dillon, a scientist at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory who studies how people can survive nuclear fallout, said being underground improves survival by a factor of 10. But Alicia Sanders-Zakre at the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons said ultimately people can do more — 'which is eliminating these weapons instead of … building, really not even a Band-Aid, for the actual problem.' Lyudmila Zlatova, who has been the principal at School No. 88 for 30 years, hopes it will be a structure designed for the dangers Zaporizhzhia will face in the future. But she and the parents who gathered on a recent day were most concerned with the present, speaking at the edge of the construction pit as air raid sirens sounded. It takes 10 seconds for a bomb to reach the neighborhood from the front line, far too short a time to evacuate, and they land with unnerving frequency. The subterranean school’s sunless rooms and concrete corridors will only make children more comfortable, given what they’re already enduring, she said. 'They will feel better studying without windows,' Zlatova said, peering across at the construction site. Zlatova believes it will bring back at least some of the families who’ve left Zaporizhzhia for other cities in Ukraine or elsewhere in Europe. The city remains fully functional, with public transit operating and grocery stores, markets and restaurants operating, and repairs ongoing for structures damaged by shelling — albeit in limited fashion. Around 150 of the school’s 650 prewar students have left the city, but she said she’s in touch with absent families and many promise to return home once there is a safe place to study. Gymnasium No. 6, which runs from first grade through high school, already has one. Its main building sits on the city’s easternmost edge, closer than any other school to the front 40 kilometers (25 miles) away. Little wonder that its principal, Kostyantyn Lypskyi, seems a little frayed at the beginning of the academic year. But at least his students can attend because parents chipped in money last year to renovate the basement shelter about 50 meters from the main school building into a series of classrooms. His underground school, whose concrete walls and relatively thin metal doors are not radiation proof but protect against explosions, hold around 500 people — the same number as the new designs. The school has double that number, so students will alternate weeks. The youngest children study full-time just upstairs from the shelter, and the older ones are in the main building. 'Of course it will work,' he said. 'We prepared everything for the start of the new school year.' In the earliest days of the school year, an air raid alarm meant he could test that confidence. It took five minutes from the moment the sirens sounded until the last children took their seats and spread out their books, awaiting instruction. It was morning, and they were ready for the day ahead. ___ Associated Press reporter Martha Mendoza contributed from Santa Cruz, California.

Fourth mass coral bleaching prompts UN emergency session at Colombia biodiversity summit	CALI, Colombia (AP) — The United Nations, scientists and governments made an urgent call Wednesday for increased funding to protect coral reefs under threat of extinction. Research this year shows that 77% of the world’s reefs are affected by bleaching, mainly due to warming ocean waters amid human-caused climate change. It's the largest and fourth mass global bleaching on record and is impacting both hemispheres, United Nations Capital Development Fund said. The findings prompted a U.N. special emergency session — typically called to address escalating conflicts or natural disasters — on corals to be convened on sidelines of the U.N. biodiversity summit, known as COP16, nearing its end after two weeks in Cali, Colombia. Coral reefs are vital ecosystems that support over 25% of marine life and nearly a billion people, many relying on reefs for food security, coastal protection and livelihoods, the U.N. development fund said. After the emergency session, the governments of New Zealand, the United Kingdom, Germany and France made new pledges totaling around $30 million to the U.N. fund for coral reefs established in 2020. By 2030, the fund seeks to leverage up to $3 billion in public and private finance to support coral reef conservation efforts. Around $225 million has been raised to date. 'Protecting our ocean and its precious habitats is fundamental to life on earth,' said U.K. Minister for Nature Mary Creagh. 'But without urgent action, the world’s coral reefs face extinction from global heating, acidification, disease, and pollution; a vital ecosystem lost within our lifetime.' Next year, a U.N. ocean conference will take place in Nice, France, and countries are being urged beforehand to pledge more to the U.N. global fund for coral reefs with the aim of mobilizing an additional $150 million in donations by the conference. 'In 2024, climate change and other human impacts triggered the fourth mass coral reef bleaching event, the most extensive and devastating on record,' said Peter Thomson, the U.N. Secretary-General’s Special Envoy for the Ocean. 'With the window to protect these ecosystems closing rapidly, world leaders must act now.' 'We must secure a sustainable future for coral reefs and the countless lives that rely on them —before it’s too late,' Thomson said. A change in water temperature can cause coral to drive out algae that provides nutrition, lose its color and become stressed. Coral may bleach for other reasons, such as extremely low tides, pollution or too much sunlight. In the world’s largest coral reef ecosystem, Australia’s Great Barrier Reef, bleaching affected 90% of the coral assessed in 2022. The Florida Coral Reef, the third-largest, experienced significant bleaching last year. The first mass bleaching happened in 1998, the second between 2011-2013, the third in 2016, said Kenyan marine ecologist David Obura, who heads Coastal Oceans Research and Development in the Indian Ocean East Africa. 'They're lasting more than one year at a time, which is worrying,' Obura said at the U.N. emergency session at COP16. —- Follow Steven Grattan on X: @sjgrattan —- The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Argentina's president fires his foreign minister after vote in favor of ending US embargo on Cuba	BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) — Argentina’s President Javier Milei on Wednesday dismissed his foreign affairs minister hours after the country voted in favor of lifting the U.S. economic embargo of Cuba at the U.N. General Assembly. Argentine Foreign Minister Diana Mondino was replaced by Argentina's ambassador to the U.S., Gerardo Werthein, Milei's spokesman Manuel Adorni said on his X account. Adorni didn't elaborate on the reasons behind the replacement, but the announcement came hours after Argentina voted Wednesday in favor of ending the embargo of Cuba. The President’s office later confirmed in a press release that the dismissal was because of the vote at the U.N. 'Our country is categorically opposed to the Cuban dictatorship, and it will remain firm in promoting a foreign policy that condemns all regimes that perpetuate the violation of human rights and individual freedoms,' Milei’s office said. On Wednesday, 187 nations, including Argentina, voted in favor of a U.N. resolution condemning the U.S. embargo of Cuba, with only the United States and Israel voting against it. Since taking power in December 2023, libertarian Milei has veered his country's foreign policy to be more aligned toward the U.S. and Israel interests. Milei has expressed his total support of right-wing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government over its bombardment and invasion of Gaza. His stand differs from most of Latin America — where Bolivia and Colombia have even severed ties with Israel and at least five countries in the region, including Brazil, have pulled ambassadors from Tel Aviv. Argentina’s vote at the U.N. is the latest episode of a troubled period of Mondino as Foreign Relations minister. Last week, Modino’s office removed a press release after writing 'Falklands' instead of 'Malvinas,' as the Argentina calls the British-controlled archipelago in the South Atlantic. And in May, she traveled to China trying to improve the bilateral relations after some criticism from Milei of the Asian giant. But during her visit she was criticized because in a media interview she said that 'all Chinese look like the same,' referring to their physical features. Milei’s office also said that his government will do an internal audit at the Foreign Relations Ministry 'with the aim of identifying promoters of agendas opposed to freedom.' ____ Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america	https://apnews.com/article/argentina-milei-foreign-minister-cuba-un-4ab32cf005981cf2664a0614bccb7f3e	2024-10-30T14:44:02-07:00	
North Korea launches a suspected new long-range missile designed to strike US	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korea test-launched a suspected new long-range missile designed to strike the continental U.S. on Thursday, its neighbors said, as the United States warned that North Korean troops in Russian uniforms are heading toward Ukraine likely to augment Russian forces and join the war. The specific long-range missile capabilities North Korea was testing were not known, but the launch was likely meant to grab American attention ahead of the U.S. election Tuesday. South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said it detected a ballistic missile launch from North Korea’s capital region around 7:10 a.m. and that the weapon flew toward the waters between the Korean Peninsula and Japan. It said the weapon was launched on a high angle and it was suspected of being a long-range ballistic missile. Japanese Defense Minister Gen Nakatani told reporters that a preliminary examination shows the launch could involve a new missile, citing its flight duration of one hour and 26 minutes, which he said is the longest for a North Korean missile test. He said the missile landed in waters outside of the Japanese exclusive economic zone but condemned North Korea’s nuclear and missile development for threatening the safety of Japan and the international community. South Korea and Japan said they are closely coordinating with the U.S. about the North Korean launch. The United States described the weapon as an intercontinental ballistic missile and condemned North Korea for the launch, saying it violated U.N. Security Council resolutions and 'needlessly' risked raising tensions. 'It only demonstrates that the DPRK continues to prioritize its unlawful weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programs over the well-being of its people,' U.S. national security council spokesperson Sean Savett said in a statement. He added that the United States would work to ensure the security of the American homeland and its South Korea and Japanese allies. North Korea last test-fired an intercontinental ballistic missile in December 2023, when it launched the solid-fueled Hwasong-18. Missiles with built-in solid propellants are easier to move and hide and can be launched quicker than liquid-propellant weapons. South Korea’s military intelligence agency told lawmakers Wednesday that North Korea was close to test-firing a long-range missile capable of reaching the United States and has also likely completed preparations for its seventh nuclear test. North Korea has made strides in its missile technologies in recent years, but many foreign experts believe the country has yet to acquire functioning nuclear-armed missile that can strike the U.S. mainland. They say North Korea likely possesses short-range missiles that can deliver nuclear strikes across all of South Korea. One of the technological hurdles North Korea still faces is for its weapons to be capable of surviving the harsh conditions of atmospheric reentry. South Korean officials and experts earlier said North Korea may test-launch a ICBM on a normal angle to verify that capability. In September, North Korean state media published a photo of Kim inspecting what appeared to be a 12-axle missile launch vehicle, the largest mobile launch platform the country has disclosed so far. Observers cited the vehicle as evidence North Korea could be developing an ICBM that is bigger than its existing ones. In the past two years, Kim has used Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as a window to ramp up weapons tests and threats while also expanding military cooperation with Moscow. South Korea, the U.S. and others have recently accused North Korea of dispatching thousands of troops to support Russia’s warfighting against Ukraine. They've said North Korea has already shipped artillery, missiles and other convectional arms to Russia. North Korea's possible participation in the Ukraine war would mark a serious escalation. South Korea, the U.S. and their partners also worry about what North Korea could get from Russia in return for joining Russia’s war against Ukraine. Aside from his soldiers’ wages, experts say Kim Jong Un likely hopes to get high-tech Russian technology that can perfect his nuclear-capable missiles. On Wednesday, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said North Korean troops wearing Russian uniforms and carrying Russian equipment are moving toward Ukraine, in what he called a dangerous and destabilizing development. Austin spoke at a news conference in Washington with South Korean Defense Minister Kim Yong-hyun. South Korea said Wednesday that North Korea has sent more than 11,000 troops to Russia and that more than 3,000 of them have been moved close to battlefields in western Russia. ___ Associated Press journalists Mari Yamaguchi in Tokyo and Aamer Madhani in Washington contributed to this report. ___ Follow AP's Asia-Pacific coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/asia-pacific	https://apnews.com/article/north-korea-missile-launch-377c07eac46ad41bda0d4445df6f51d5	2024-10-30T14:29:19-07:00	
UN urges protection as another journalist is shot to death in Mexico	MEXICO CITY (AP) — The U.N. human rights office in Mexico said Wednesday journalists in Mexico need more protection, after gunmen killed a man whose Facebook news page covered the violent western Mexico state of Michoacan. Journalist Mauricio Solís of the news page Minuto por Minuto was shot to death late Tuesday just moments after he conducted a sidewalk interview with the mayor of the city of Uruapan (ooh-roo-WAH-pan). State prosecutors said a second person was wounded in the shooting. Solís had just finished an interview on the street outside city hall with Mayor Carlos Manzo. Manzo told local media he had walked away and 'two minutes later, I think, and just a matter of meters away, we heard gunshots, four or five gunshots.' 'We sought cover because we thought the attack was aimed at us,' Manzo said. 'After a few minutes we found out that Mauricio was the one they attacked.' Manzo said he could not rule out a connection between the interview and the killing. The U.N. rights office said Solís was at least the fifth journalist killed in Mexico this year. It said he had previously reported security problems related to his work. His Facebook page reported on community events and the drug cartel violence that has wracked the city. 'His killing is a wake-up call to defend the right to information and freedom of expression in Mexico,' the office wrote. An increasing number of the journalists killed in Mexico have been self-employed and reported for local Facebook and online news sites. Uruapan is the nearest large city to Michoacan's avocado-growing region, and it has been the scene of drug cartel extortions and turf battles between gangs. The cartels demand protection money from local avocado and lime orchards, cattle ranches and almost any other business. Solís was reporting on a suspicious fire at a local market just before the shooting. Gangs have sometimes burned businesses that refuse to pay extortion demands. ____ Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america	https://apnews.com/article/mexico-journalist-killed-cartels-michoacan-e631cb8ce572adc14a1d86e566df280f	2024-10-30T14:14:19-07:00	
UN General Assembly condemns the US economic embargo of Cuba for a 32nd year	UNITED NATIONS (AP) — The U.N. General Assembly voted overwhelmingly Wednesday to condemn the American economic embargo of Cuba for a 32nd year after its foreign minister strongly criticized the Biden administration and expressed hope a new president would end it. The vote in the 193-member world body was 187-2, with only the United States and Israel against the resolution, and one abstention. It tied the record for support for the Caribbean nation first reached in 2019 and again last year. Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez blamed the U.S. government’s 'maximum pressure policy' aimed at depriving Cuba of the imported fuel it relies on for a widespread blackout this month, including when Hurricane Oscar lashed the island. 'President Joseph Biden’s administration usually claims that its policy is intended to 'help and support the Cuban people,’' he said. 'Who would believe such an assertion?' General Assembly resolutions are not legally binding, but they reflect world opinion, and the vote has given Cuba an annual stage to demonstrate that the U.S. stands apart in its decades-old efforts to isolate the Caribbean nation. Cuba has struggled with one of the worst economic and energy crises in its history. Besides waves of blackouts, citizens are frustrated over food shortages and inflation. Hundreds of thousands have migrated, many headed to the United States. The embargo was imposed in 1960 following the revolution led by Fidel Castro and the nationalization of properties belonging to U.S. citizens and corporations. Two years later, it was strengthened. In July 2016, then-Cuban President Raul Castro and then-President Barack Obama officially restored relations, and that year the U.S. abstained on the resolution calling for an end to the embargo for the first time. But Obama’s successor, Donald Trump, sharply criticized Cuba’s human rights record, and in 2017 the U.S. again voted against the resolution, and it has ever since. U.S. deputy ambassador, Paul Folmsbee, told the assembly that the United States strongly supports the Cuban people’s pursuit of a future that respects human rights and fundamental freedoms. 'Sanctions are one element of our broader effort to advance democracy and promote respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in Cuba,' he said. He noted that about 1,000 political prisoners have been unjustly detained in Cuba, more than at any point in Cuba’s recent history. Folmsbee said U.S. sanctions exempt food, medicine and other basic goods and that the U.S. exported nearly $336 million in agricultural products and authorized additional humanitarian exports last year. In May, the U.S. lifted some financial restrictions against Cuba in an effort to boost private businesses on the island. That included allowing independent entrepreneurs to open and access U.S. bank accounts online to support their businesses as well as steps to open up more internet-based services and expand private companies’ ability to make certain financial transactions. Rodriguez said that under Biden’s presidency, Cuba has lost more than $16 billion and that measures announced in the last year 'as alleged palliatives' to the embargo are not effective. Noting next week's U.S. presidential election, the Cuban minister said the winner will have the opportunity to decide whether to continue 'the inhumane siege measures of the last six decades' or heed an increasing number of Americans and an overwhelming majority of nations 'and allow our country to develop its true potential and capabilities.' Rodriguez said Cuba will defend its 'right to build an independent, socialist future.' But he also said Cuba is willing 'to hold a serious and responsible dialogue and move on towards a constructive and civilized relationship' with the new U.S. administration.	https://apnews.com/article/cuba-us-economic-embargo-united-nations-7eaaac3318080a7640c64fd424a8e668	2024-10-30T11:44:23-07:00	
8 miners are dead and 1 is missing after a mine collapse in Zambia	LUSAKA, Zambia (AP) — Eight miners died after being buried under mounds of earth that collapsed on them in an open-pit copper mine in Zambia on Wednesday, police said. One miner was missing and another two survived, provincial police commissioner Peacewell Mweemba said. State media reported that six of the miners who died at the mine in Chingola, a city in Copperbelt Province, were from the same family. The victims were not employees of the mining company but part of a group who had been searching for copper at the mine without permission, a common phenomenon in Zambia. It's the latest in a series of tragedies involving informal miners in copper-rich Zambia. This month, 10 informal miners died in a collapse in Mumbwa in central Zambia. Nine men died at a quarry near the capital, Lusaka, in August when a huge pile of earth collapsed on them. Last December, more than 30 informal miners died at another open-pit mine in Chingola when heavy rain caused landslides that buried them in tunnels they were working in. Zambian President Hakainde Hichilema recently said the number of miners who had died in accidents was 'unacceptable.' ___ AP Africa news: https://apnews.com/hub/africa	https://apnews.com/article/zambia-miners-mine-deaths-collapse-copper-120270d1ffc318e12ee8f13d1a2f4046	2024-10-30T11:41:23-07:00	
Biden, Cyprus president discuss administration push to win cease-fires in Gaza and Lebanon	WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden and Cypriot President Nikos Christodoulides on Wednesday discussed a new effort by the U.S. administration and mediators in the Middle East to forge cease-fires to end fighting in Lebanon and Gaza. Christodoulides leads the European Union nation closest to Gaza. The small Mediterranean island nation has played a critical role in efforts to get humanitarian aid into Gaza since the war between Hamas and Israel began more than a year ago. He said that Biden and White House officials briefed him on the latest stepped-up efforts by the U.S. administration and other mediators but declined to offer further details about the discussion. 'The most important, the number one priority of the international community now is to have a cease-fire in the region,' Christodoulides told reporters after his Oval Office talks with Biden. He added that situation on the ground changes daily but that he was 'quite optimistic' that a Lebanon cease-fire deal could emerge in one to two weeks. Senior White House officials Brett McGurk and Amos Hochstein will visit Israel on Thursday for talks on possible cease-fires in both Lebanon and Gaza, and on the release of hostages held by Hamas, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said. She said CIA Director Bill Burns will head to Egypt on Thursday to discuss those efforts. A proposal to end the war between Israel and Hezbollah calls for a two-month cease-fire during which Israeli forces would withdraw from Lebanon, and Hezbollah would end its armed presence along the country’s southern border, according to two U.S. officials familiar with the talks said. The officials were not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity. Biden, meanwhile, thanked Cyprus for helping move badly needed humanitarian aid into Gaza and for the Mediterranean nation's cooperation in response to Russia's war in Ukraine. The meeting, the first Oval visit by a Cypriot president since 1996, comes days after U.S. and Cypriot officials announced the countries are launching a strategic dialogue aimed at bolstering security and stability in a crisis-wracked region through initiatives including counterterrorism training of personnel from Middle Eastern countries and fighting sanctions evasion. The new coordination is just the latest example of Cyprus tightening relations with the U.S. after decades of walking a tightrope between Washington and Moscow. Cyprus has moved closer to the U.S. since Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine. 'Today we stood against Russia’s vicious onslaught against Ukraine, we launched a strategic dialogue, we increased cooperation across a range of issues, from energy security to artificial intelligence, and we surged humanitarian aid, delivering 8000 metric tons to Gaza,' Biden said. The U.S. is also funding a center on the island nation under the acronym CYCLOPS that trains personnel from Cyprus and neighboring countries on maritime and cybersecurity as well as counterterrorism techniques. The Cyprus government has also stepped up coordination with local law enforcement, the U.S. Department of Justice and the FBI to help combat the evasion of sanctions against Russia and other countries. The FBI is helping train Cypriot police in identifying and prosecuting cases of illegal financing and attempts to evade U.S., European Union and U.N. sanctions imposed on any third country. Last month, Cyprus and the U.S. signed a defense cooperation framework agreement that outlines ways the two countries can enhance their response to regional humanitarian crises and security concerns. Christodoulides said Cyprus has proven to be a 'predictable and reliable partner of the United States in a region of great geopolitical importance.' Earlier this year, Cyprus helped the U.S. establish a Gaza maritime corridor for the shipborne delivery of humanitarian aid to the Palestinian territory. The $230 million temporary pier project was derided as a boondoggle by critics and was beset by turbulent weather, security threats and sweeping personnel restrictions. The Pentagon pulled the plug on the effort after about four months. The Biden administration had set a goal of the U.S. sea route and pier providing food to feed 1.5 million people for 90 days. It fell short, bringing in enough to feed about 450,000 people for a month before shutting down, according to a USAID inspector general’s report. ___ Hadjicostis reported from Nicosia, Cyprus.

Recent whale deaths highlight risks from Antarctica's booming krill fishery	MIAMI (AP) — Two humpback whales were found dead and another seriously injured this year in huge nets used to collect krill for fishmeal and omega-3 pills near Antarctica, The Associated Press has learned. The whale deaths, which have not been previously reported, were discussed during recent negotiations between the U.S., China, Russia and two dozen other countries in which officials failed to make progress on long-debated conservation goals and lifted some fishing limits in the Southern Ocean that have been in place since 2009. Taken together, the whale deaths and rollback of the catch limits represent a setback for the remote krill fishery, which has boomed in recent years and is set to expand even further following the acquisition of its biggest harvester, Norway’s Aker BioMarine, by a deep-pocketed American private equity firm. AP journalists last year spent more than two weeks in the frigid waters around Antarctica aboard a conservation vessel operated by Sea Shepherd Global to take a rare, up-close look at the world’s southernmost fishery. As part of that investigation, the AP followed the tiny crustacean on its journey from the fragile ecosystem, where it is the main nourishment for whales, to salmon farms in Europe, Canada and Australia, pet food manufacturers in China and a former ice cream factory in Houston that produces 80% of the world’s nutrient-rich krill oil. Delegates to the annual meeting in Australia of the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources, or CCAMLR, shared with the AP unpublished reports of the whale deaths on the condition of anonymity because the talks, which ended last week, are not open to the public. Officials at CCAMLR, which was established in 1982 to protect the international waters near Antarctica, didn’t comment. Under a conservation agreement developed almost two decades ago, the krill catch has soared: from 104,728 metric tons in 2007 to 424,203 metric tons in 2023 as larger, more sophisticated vessels have joined the chase. So far this year, the catch has jumped to 498,000 metric tons — the highest on record, according to the unpublished reports. Although fishing is still below a previously agreed limit and barely 1% of the estimated biomass of 63 million metric tons of krill found in the main Antarctic fishing grounds, direct competition between marine mammals has resulted in whale deaths before. But following the first ever recorded entanglements of four humpback whales in 2021 and 2022, Aker BioMarine redesigned its fishing nets, which regularly vacuum up to 500 metric tons of krill per day - the equivalent daily diet for about 150 humpback whales. First, it added a rope barrier to repel large mammals and then, last fall, it developed a second barrier to close a still sizable gap that can threaten whales swimming vertically. The new net had not yet been installed when a juvenile humpback was observed dead Jan. 27 on the Antarctic Endurance, the company’s most advanced supertrawler, according to a report presented by Norwegian negotiators at the CCAMLR meeting. The reasons behind the second death in May involving another Aker BioMarine ship remain unclear. But two days earlier the ship reported difficulty maneuvering its net and blubber was recovered on the ship's conveyor belt, suggesting the dead whale had been trapped by the net for some time, the report said. A third humpback was hauled alive in late January on a Chilean-flagged vessel, the Antarctic Endeavor, using traditional trawling gear. After the ship's crew struggled for 40 minutes to cut the net tightly wrapped around the 15-meter-long (15-yard-long) male, the whale, with blood on its tail, was dumped back into the ocean. 'Upon release it was lethargic and had some injuries from rubbing with the net,' according to a report by Chile's delegation to the CCAMLR talks that included graphic images of the capture. Although the whale was observed swimming, the capture was considered a mortality event by CCAMLR scientists because the released whale's injuries were likely to prove fatal. Attempts to contact the trawler's owner, Pesca Chile SA, were unsuccessful. A minke whale was also found dead after entangling itself in a buoy line belonging to a South Korean vessel targeting Patagonian toothfish, which is also managed by CCAMLR. It was the first ever whale death recorded in the fishery. Pressure on krill stocks is building as a result of surging demand for omega-3 pills taken as dietary supplements, advances in fishing and rising ocean temperatures due to climate change. This summer, New York-based American Industrial Partners acquired a majority stake in Aker BioMarine's feed business with the goal of positioning krill as a premium ingredient for the aquaculture industry, now the source for about half the world's seafood. Webjørn Barstad, CEO of the new company, Aker BioMarine Antarctic, said developing new technologies to mitigate risks of whale mortalities is a top priority. Starting next season, he said, its entire fleet will be equipped with special stretch sensors that will alert the crew when a whale has interacted with the mesh front of a trawler's net. Underwater cameras may also be used, he said. 'Our goal is always zero incidents,' Barstad said in an interview. 'Hopefully the net will do the job but we will try something else as well.' CCAMLR, whose mission is conservation, is tasked with refereeing the fishing industry. But in recent years, progress has stalled due to geopolitical wrangling, especially opposition from China and Russia. Coming into the latest meeting, hopes were high that delegates would approve a new management plan to further spread the krill catch and finally adopt a California-sized reserve along the Antarctic Peninsula, a highly sensitive ecosystem. Currently, less than 5% of the Southern Ocean is protected — well behind CCAMLR’s target and not nearly enough to meet a United Nations goal to preserve 30% of the world’s oceans by 2030. But a tentative deal fell apart over a last minute proposal by the UK and Australia for an even lower catch limit than the one agreed to during talks over the summer, according to one delegate who spoke to AP. China, objecting to the persistent Western demands, then withdrew its support for the marine reserve and refused to renew the existing management system. The result: a 620,000 metric ton catch limit that for 15 years has divvied fishing into four quota areas can now be concentrated into even smaller krill hotspots, some of them teeming with wildlife, including seals and penguins, some already showing signs of stress from competition with fishing, tourism and climate change. 'The meeting was a huge disappointment, even by the low standards that we've come to expect,' said Evan Bloom, who for 15 years, until his retirement from the State Department in 2020, led the U.S. delegation to the annual CCAMLR meeting. 'Krill is the base of the food chain in Antarctica and fishing for krill must be handled sustainably if the entire ecosystem is to thrive,' said Bloom, adding that in the absence of further action by CCAMLR and given the advances in fishing the 'prospects for harming the ecosystem have now increased.' Barstad said the krill industry will consider putting its own voluntary limits in place in the absence of an updated CCAMLR framework. 'Whether it’s a big setback, I’m not so sure,' he said. 'Once you go beyond the emotion and come to terms with the fact that a regulation that had been standing for quite some years now suddenly disappeared, a little bit out of the blue, I think it could create a better atmosphere for discussing how to progress sustainably based on science.' ___ This story was supported by funding from the Walton Family Foundation.

North Korean troops in Russian uniforms are heading toward Ukraine, US says	WASHINGTON (AP) — Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said Wednesday that North Korean troops wearing Russian uniforms and carrying Russian equipment are moving to the Kursk region near Ukraine, in what he called a dangerous and destabilizing development. Austin was speaking at a press conference in Washington with South Korean Defense Minister Kim Yong-hyun, as concerns grow about Pyongyang’s deployment of as many as 11,000 troops to Russia. The U.S. and South Korea say some of the North Korean troops are heading to Russia’s Kursk region on the border with Ukraine, where the Kremlin’s forces have struggled to push back a Ukrainian incursion. One senior Korean official said more than 3,000 of them are believed to have moved toward combat zones in western Russia, without specifying the locations. Some North Korean advance units have already arrived in the Kursk region. Austin said 'the likelihood is pretty high' that Russia will use the North Korean troops in combat. He said officials are discussing what to do about the deployment, which he said has the potential to broaden or lengthen the conflict in Ukraine. Asked if it could prompt other nations to get more directly involved in the conflict, he acknowledged that it could 'encourage others to take action' but he provided no details. Kim said he doesn't necessarily believe the deployment will trigger war on the Korean Peninsula, but could increase security threats between the two nations. There is a 'high possibly' that Pyongyang would ask for higher technologies in exchange for its troop deployment, such as receiving tactical nuclear and ballistic missile capabilities, he said, speaking through an interpreter. Both Kim and Austin called on North Korea to withdraw its troops. North Korea’s move to tighten its relationship with Russia have triggered alarms across the globe, as leaders worry about how it may expand the war in Ukraine and what Russian military aid will be delivered to Pyongyang in exchange. 'They're doing this because (Russian President Vladimir) Putin has lost a lot of troops,' Austin said, adding that Moscow has a choice between mobilizing more of its own forces or turning to others for help. Already, he noted, Russia has sought military weapons from other nations. Those include North Korea and Iran. The U.S. has estimated there are about 10,000 North Korean troops now in Russia. Seoul and its allies, however, assess that the number dispatched to Russia has increased to 11,000, according to a senior South Korean presidential official, who spoke on condition of anonymity during a background briefing. A Ukrainian official told The Associated Press that North Korean troops are currently stationed 50 kilometers (30 miles) away from the Ukrainian border with Russia. The official was not authorized to disclose the information publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. The official did not provide any additional detail. Russia has had to shift some resources to the Kursk border region to respond to Ukraine's offensive there. U.S. leaders have suggested that the use of North Korean forces to augment Russia's defenses indicates that Moscow’s losses during the more than two-year war have significantly degraded its military strength. North Korea has also provided munitions to Russia and earlier this month the White House released images it said were of North Korea shipping 1,000 containers of military equipment there by rail. A key worrisome question is what North Korea will get in return for providing the troops. But officials have yet to say specifically what Pyongyang may have requested or Moscow has offered. In their meeting at the Pentagon Kim and Austin agreed to continue conducting large-scale military exercises, increase nuclear deterrence cooperation and upgrade both countries' abilities to deter and respond to North Korean missile launches by improving early launch warning systems, according to a fact sheet released by the Pentagon Wednesday. Austin and Kim are scheduled to meet with Secretary of State Antony Blinken and South Korean Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul at the State Department on Thursday. —- AP reporter Kim Tong-hyung contributed from Seoul, South Korea.	https://apnews.com/article/united-states-north-korea-russia-ukraine-war-faeabb0b2c2ea162bbc6c4691df4d6c8	2024-10-30T09:31:24-07:00	
Haiti sees a rise in killings and police executions with children targeted, UN says	PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) — More than 1,740 people were reported killed or injured in Haiti from July to September, a nearly 30% increase over the previous trimester, according to the latest numbers released Wednesday by U.N. officials. The surge in violence comes as gangs seize control of 85% of the capital of Port-au-Prince — up from 80% — while a U.N.-backed mission led by Kenyan police to quell gang violence struggles with a lack of funding and personnel, prompting calls for a U.N. peacekeeping mission. 'In the absence of state representatives, gangs increasingly claim roles typically assigned to the police and the judiciary while imposing their own rules,' warned the United Nations Integrated Office in Haiti, known as BINUH. The 1,223 killings reported in the third trimester are largely blamed on gang violence, although law enforcement officials carried out at least 106 extrajudicial killings, with victims including six children as young as 10 years old who were accused of passing information to gang members, BINUH said. Of the 106 extrajudicial killings, 96 were carried out by police officers and 10 others by Jean Ernest Muscadin, public prosecutor for the southern coastal city of Miragoâne. Overall, Muscadin is accused of killing at least 36 people since 2022 who were suspected of being gang members or of committing 'common crimes,' BINUH said. A spokesperson for Haiti’s National Police did not respond to requests for comment, while Muscadin declined comment and hung up when reached by phone. Extreme brutality Gangs now have an estimated 5,500 members after recruiting mainly children who work as scouts, carry weapons and ammunition and even participate in combat, according to a U.N. Security Council report released Monday. It noted that children may represent up to 50% of all gang members. 'The dire situation in Haiti makes children more vulnerable to recruitment by gangs,' the report stated. 'A lack of access to education, employment and basic necessities creates a situation where joining gangs is seen as the only viable means of survival.' Among those killed this trimester are at least 669 people during police operations against gangs, with three-fourths of the victims suspected gang members and one-fourth of them civilians, the BINUH report stated. 'Information gathered … points to a possible disproportionate use of lethal force and a lack of precautionary measures to protect the population during police operations,' BINUH said. The number of people killed or injured from July to September increased by 27% compared with the second trimester, although there was a 32% drop compared with the first trimester. The majority of killings and injuries – 234 – occurred in La Saline slum of Port-au-Prince, most of them inside residents’ makeshift homes as gangs vie for control of Haiti’s main port and its container terminal, according to the report. Gangs also recently occupied the communities of Carrefour and Gressier in the Port-au-Prince metropolitan area, using 'extreme brutality to bring residents under their control,' BINUH said. In one case, a plainclothes policeman was stopped by gang members in mid-August: 'He was mutilated, then forced to eat parts of his body, before being burned alive.' At least 122 killings were blamed on self-defense groups that formed last year and have targeted suspected gang members or people accused of crimes including stealing animals or cell phones. 'Victims were mutilated with machetes, stoned, decapitated, burned alive or buried alive,' the report said. 'Children were not spared.' Overall, at least 59 children were killed or injured in the third trimester. The U.N. noted that the number of self-defense groups doubled to around 60 from January to July. ‘I think it's the end of my life' Most of the violence remains centered in the capital of Port-au-Prince and the central region of Artibonite, where dozens of people were killed in a massacre earlier this month. In one bright spot, the number of kidnappings plummeted to 170 during the third trimester compared with earlier this year, with more than 60% of cases occurring in Artibonite, according to the report. In the second trimester, at least 428 people were kidnapped. Sexual violence remains pervasive, with at least 55 victims reporting gang rape, including girls and women ages 10 to 70, according to the report, which noted that such cases are largely under-reported. Women and girls are attacked inside their homes or while walking on streets or using public transportation, with some sexually exploited for months by gang members, BINUH said. Gang violence has left more than 700,000 people homeless in recent years, and it has surged this month, with gunmen trying to take over Solino, one of the last communities in Port-au-Prince that is not under their control. 'There’s a complete destruction of people’s lives,' said Jean Renel Volma, a 55-year-old unemployed security guard who recently fled Solino with his wife and two children after living there for more than two decades. 'It was dark, there was tremendous shooting, everybody was yelling. It’s the worst I’ve ever seen in Solino,' he said as he recalled how they were only able to flee with the clothes they had on. Originally from the southern coastal town of Les Cayes, Volma said he can't take refuge there because gangs control the main roads leading out of Port-au-Prince: 'I don’t know what I’m going to do. There is no exit.' Volma is one of hundreds of people who crowded into a church in nearby Nazon after being left homeless as gunfire echoed nearby on Wednesday. The U.N. report noted that gangs are targeting Solino and Delmas 24 to gain access to middle-class neighborhoods, including Nazon. 'The aim is to bring in more income from kidnappings and extortion of businesses in this wealthy area,' it stated. Among those temporarily living at the church is Alicia Joseph, a 60-year-old mother of three children. While her children live with a friend who took them in, there was no space for her. 'I think it’s the end of my life. I lost everything,' she said. Her losses include her 85-year-old mother, who wasn't able to flee with the rest of the family when the gang attacked. 'I thought they would spare her life,' Joseph said, adding that her mother died inside their home when gangs set it on fire. ___ Coto reported from San Juan, Puerto Rico	https://apnews.com/article/haiti-police-gang-violence-un-mission-63fbb5f85019668f793e80069b8f0558	2024-10-30T07:53:29-07:00	
US airstrikes target multiple sites in Syria, killing up to 35 Islamic State militants	WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. military has struck a number of Islamic State group camps in Syria this week, killing as many as 35 militants, U.S. Central Command said Wednesday. The airstrikes in the desert of central Syria were done Monday evening and targeted multiple locations and senior leaders of the group. The attacks came on the heels of a number of joint operations with Iraqi forces that targeted IS militants in Iraq. Pentagon officials have said that the Islamic State group remains a threat in the region, but it is no longer as powerful as it was 10 years ago when the militants swept across Iraq and Syria, taking control of large swaths of the two countries. U.S. Central Command said the latest strikes in Syria will disrupt the group's ability to plan, organize and conduct attacks against civilians and U.S. and allied forces in the region. It said there were no indications of civilian casualties in the strikes.	https://apnews.com/article/islamic-state-group-us-airstrikes-syria-pentagon-4a997c6b994185aec8d57660aef06a24	2024-10-30T07:03:32-07:00	
3 Pakistani soldiers and 8 militants killed during a raid on insurgents' hideout	PESHAWAR, Pakistan (AP) — Three soldiers and eight militants were killed after Pakistani security forces backed by military helicopters raided a hideout in a former stronghold of insurgents in a restive province bordering Afghanistan on Wednesday, police said. A local militant commander was believed to be among those killed in the operation in Bannu, a district in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, local police official Zahid Ullah said. The military said a major was among the soldiers 'martyred' during the intelligence-based operation, adding that its forces were going after other militants in the area 'to wipe out the menace of terrorism.' Authorities often carry out such operations against the Pakistani Taliban, who are known as Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan, or TTP. The TTP — an ally of the Afghan Taliban despite being a separate group — has stepped up its assaults in the region since the Taliban seized power in Afghanistan in 2021. Government forces have also intensified their operations against separatist groups based in the restive southwestern Balochistan province.	https://apnews.com/article/pakistan-security-forces-raid-militant-hideout-859c0173e886dcbc321e72a82fc4443f	2024-10-30T06:47:10-07:00	
US sanctions 398 firms in more than a dozen countries, accusing them of helping Russia's war effort	WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. on Wednesday imposed sanctions on 398 firms across Russia, India, China and more than a dozen other nations, accusing them of providing products and services that enable Russia’s war effort and aid its ability to evade sanctions. The effort spearheaded by the Treasury and State departments is aimed at punishing 'third party countries' that are accused of providing material assistance to the Kremlin or assisting Russia in evading the thousands of sanctions that have been imposed on the country since its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Among those sanctioned by the Treasury Department are 274 companies accused of supplying Russia with advanced technology, as well as Russia-based defense and manufacturing firms that produce or finish military products that maintain the weaponry used against Ukraine. Additionally, the State Department imposed diplomatic sanctions on several senior Russian Ministry of Defense officials and defense companies, a group of China-based companies that export dual-use goods that fill critical gaps in Russia’s military-industrial base and entities and individuals in Belarus related to the Lukashenko regime’s support for Russia’s defense industry. Treasury's Deputy Secretary Wally Adeyemo said the U.S. and its allies 'are unyielding in our resolve to diminish and degrade Russia’s ability to equip its war machine and stop those seeking to aid their efforts through circumvention or evasion of our sanctions and export controls.' Wednesday’s action is the latest in a series of thousands of U.S. sanctions that have been imposed on Russian firms and their suppliers in other nations since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The effectiveness of the sanctions has been questioned, especially as Russia has continued to support its economy by selling oil and gas on international markets. The Biden administration acknowledges that sanctions alone cannot stop Russia’s war on Ukraine. And many policy experts say the sanctions are not strong enough — as evidenced by the growth of the Russian economy. A senior Treasury official told reporters on a call to preview the Wednesday sanctions that deepening ties between Russia and North Korea are a sign of Russia's desperation to find support during the war. North Korea said Tuesday its top diplomat is visiting Russia, as rival South Korea and Western nations say the North has sent thousands of troops to support Russia’s war effort. Earlier this year, the U.S. passed an aid package for Ukraine that allows the administration to seize Russian state assets located in the U.S. and use them for the benefit of Kyiv. Shortly thereafter, the leaders of the Group of Seven wealthy democracies agreed to engineer a $50 billion loan to help Ukraine in its fight for survival. Interest earned on profits from Russia’s $300 billion in frozen central bank assets mostly in Europe would be used as collateral.	https://apnews.com/article/treasury-sanctions-finance-russia-ukraine-92d32f9041d24d371d8afb89d4df603e	2024-10-30T06:35:40-07:00	
A new push to wind down the Middle East wars faces familiar challenges	BEIRUT (AP) — The United States and other mediators are ramping up efforts to halt the wars in Lebanon and the Gaza Strip, circulating new proposals to wind down the regional conflict during the Biden administration’s final months. Negotiations on both fronts have been stalled for months and none of the warring parties have shown any sign of backing down from their demands. Senior White House officials Brett McGurk and Amos Hochstein are scheduled to visit Israel on Thursday for talks on possible cease-fires in both Lebanon and Gaza, and the release of hostages held by Hamas. CIA Director Bill Burns will go to Egypt to discuss those efforts. A proposal to end the war between Israel and Hezbollah calls for a two-month cease-fire during which Israeli forces would withdraw from Lebanon, and Hezbollah would end its armed presence along the country's southern border, two other officials familiar with the talks said. But Israel is unlikely to trust U.N. peacekeepers and Lebanese troops to keep Hezbollah out of a reestablished buffer zone in Lebanon. It wants the freedom to strike the militants if needed. Lebanese officials want a complete withdrawal. Separately, the U.S., Egypt and Qatar have proposed a four-week cease-fire in Gaza during which Hamas would release up to 10 hostages, according to an Egyptian official and a Western diplomat. But Hamas still appears unwilling to release scores of hostages without securing a lasting cease-fire and a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, even after the killing of its top leader, Yahya Sinwar. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has insisted on lasting Israeli control over parts of the territory. In Lebanon, a push to revive the UN resolution that ended the last war During his visit to Beirut last week, Hochstein met with Lebanon’s Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri. They agreed on a roadmap on how to implement U.N. Security Council resolution 1701, which ended the 34-day Israel-Hezbollah war in 2006, according to a Lebanese official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the closed-door talks. The resolution stipulates a cease-fire between Israel and Hezbollah, withdrawal of Israeli forces from all Lebanese territory, and withdrawal of all armed forces except for U.N. peacekeepers and the Lebanese army from the area south of the Litani River, some 30 kilometers (20 miles) north of the border. On Wednesday, Hezbollah's newly chosen leader, Naim Kassem, said the group will not 'beg' for a cease-fire. 'If the Israelis decide to stop the aggression, we say that we accept, but according to the conditions that we see as suitable,' he said during a televised address. Israel has not publicly commented on the proposal to end the fighting in Lebanon, which started more than a year ago and dramatically intensified in mid-September. U.S. officials say there are competing proposals being discussed for a cease-fire in Lebanon, including one idea calling for an immediate truce followed by two months to fully implement the resolution. The Lebanese official said that once a cease-fire is reached, a 60-day period will start in which the Lebanese army and the peacekeeping force known as UNIFIL would deploy in the border area as Israeli forces and Hezbollah fighters withdraw. The Lebanese official said the roadmap includes increasing the number of U.N. peacekeepers from 10,000 to 15,000 and boosting the number of Lebanese troops south of the Litani from 4,000 to 15,000. Resolution 1701 also called for 'the disarmament of all armed groups in Lebanon,' including Hezbollah, but that is not part of the initial implementation phase under the current proposal. Another official familiar with the talks said Israel has requested that any deal include measures to prevent Hezbollah from rearming and guarantees that Israel would be able to act in the buffer zone to combat threats from the militant group. It is unclear if Lebanon would agree to a deal that allows Israel to continue military operations on Lebanese territory. Lebanese officials have insisted there should be no alteration to Resolution 1701, which stipulates a full Israeli withdrawal. Hezbollah has said it will not halt its rocket fire on Israel unless there is a cease-fire in Gaza. It is not clear whether that stance has changed after the killing of Hezbollah's longtime leader, Hassan Nasrallah, and several other top commanders in Israeli airstrikes last month. The U.S. hopes the cease-fire initiatives can prevent the war in Lebanon from becoming as destructive as the war in Gaza, even as it supports Israel's efforts to clear out Hezbollah infrastructure along the country's southern border, said U.S. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller. Mediators propose a limited cease-fire in Gaza The U.S., Egypt and Qatar have proposed a four-week cease-fire in Gaza in which eight to 10 hostages would be released, according to a senior Egyptian official. Under the plan, humanitarian aid to Gaza would be scaled up, but there would be no guarantees of future talks on a permanent cease-fire, the official said. Hamas-led militants killed some 1,200 people and abducted around 250 in the Oct. 7 attack that triggered the war. Israel’s retaliatory offensive has killed over 43,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities, who do not say how many were combatants but say more than half were women and children. Around 100 hostages are still being held in Gaza, about a third of whom are believed to be dead. The latest proposal is based on an initiative by Egypt's President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi, who proposed a two-day cease-fire in exchange for the release of four hostages last week. Netanyahu, who has always said he is open to temporary truces for the release of hostages, said in a statement that he had not received a formal proposal based on the Egyptian initiative but 'would have accepted it immediately.' Hamas has said it is open to discussing alternative proposals but has stood by its demands for a lasting cease-fire, an Israeli withdrawal and the release of Palestinian prisoners. The Egyptian official said the mediators were not optimistic. A Western diplomat in Cairo confirmed that their government had been briefed on the proposal, saying it was being pursued in parallel to the efforts for a cease-fire in Lebanon. Both officials in Egypt spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the talks. ___ Frankel reported from Jerusalem and Magdy from Cairo.

Election 2024 Latest: Trump and Harris lean into the campaign’s last leg with less than a week left	Donald Trump and Kamala Harris will crisscross several swing states on Wednesday, passing each other in Wisconsin, where the former president is scheduled to appear in Green Bay with a one-time local icon, retired NFL quarterback Brett Favre. Mumford &amp; Sons, Gracie Abrams, Remi Wolf and members of the band The National are expected to appear at Harris' rally Wednesday night in Madison. Harris on Tuesday sought to remind Americans what life was like under Trump and then offered voters a different path forward if they send her to the White House, in a speech billed as her campaign’s closing argument. Follow the AP’s Election 2024 coverage at: https://apnews.com/hub/election-2024. Here’s the latest: Nikki Haley chides Trump and Biden On Tuesday, Republican Nikki Haley said she was critical of 'this masculine bromance stuff' that Trump and his allies are promoting. A day later, during an appearance on SiriusXM, she condemned Biden for calling Trump supporters 'garbage.' Haley said, 'At what point does everybody not get — people are smart, they just want to know what you’re going to do to make their life better. They don’t want to be called a name. This isn’t a schoolyard. Like, stop.' Biden will attend the presidential inauguration in January WASHINGTON — 'Yes, he will,' said White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre, when asked if Biden will attend the inauguration regardless of whether Harris or Trump is elected. Jean-Pierre said the president believes in and is committed to the peaceful transfer of power and will be on hand for it. Then-President Donald Trump broke with historical precedent in January 2021 after he lost his bid for reelection to Biden and did not attend Biden’s swearing-in at the Capitol. Trump calls for ‘one-day voting’ ROCKY MOUNT, N.C. — 'We used to have one-day voting,' Trump told a packed hall in Rocky Mount, North Carolina, almost two weeks into the pivotal Southern state’s early voting period, and less than a week from election day. Standing in front of a blue banner emblazoned with 'Vote Early,' the Republican presidential nominee argued that a single day of balloting reduced the risk of mishandling ballots. Trump painted a scenario where election office workers might have to move boxes of early ballots, mockingly impersonating anonymous elections workers as saying, 'There were 14 boxes. Now there are six. What happened to the rest of them?' Trump’s campaign is promoting early voting, as the banner suggested, as the campaign has argued that Trump must compete within the current election structure to win. The suggestion that more than one day of voting could corrupt the results was in keeping with Trump’s continued and unfounded suggestion that the 2020 election, which he lost to Democratic President Joe Biden, was marred by widespread fraud. Pennsylvania’s top election official urges people to get their information from ‘trusted sources’ In just the past week, Pennsylvania has seen false and misleading videos surface online, including a video purporting to show an election worker in Bucks County destroying mail ballots cast for former President Donald Trump. County officials quickly debunked the video and federal officials have said Russian actors were behind it as part of an effort to undermine public confidence in the election. 'We know there is already a lot of mis- and disinformation about Pennsylvania’s elections, and it’s likely to continue in the coming days and weeks ahead,' Al Schmidt, Pennsylvania’s secretary of state, said Wednesday. 'It’s critical that, at this juncture in the election cycle, voters get their information from trusted sources. Spreading videos and other information that lack context, sharing social posts filled with half-truths or even outright lies is harmful to our representative democracy.' Officials in Northampton County say false claims around another video, in which a postal worker was filmed delivering ballots, were damaging lies that put routine election operations in a 'false light.' Pennsylvania postal worker filmed delivering ballots is targeted online with misinformation An interim postmaster filmed delivering ballots to a county courthouse in eastern Pennsylvania is being falsely accused of wrongdoing on social media, according to the county government. Northampton County Executive Lamont McClure told The Associated Press in a phone interview that online videos and screengrabs posted with accusations that the worker committed election fraud or was 'acting suspect' are damaging lies that put routine election operations in a 'false light.' 'This is a postal service servant doing his public duty,' McClure said. 'Folks should find out all the facts before they go sharing things online.' McClure said the courthouse is surrounded by security cameras and other safeguards to ensure the election runs smoothly. The video, which spread rapidly on the social platform X with users actively trying to identify the worker, is the latest example of groundless misinformation that has erupted this week in Pennsylvania, a key battleground in the presidential election. Trump responds to Biden’s comment by accusing him of treating Americans like ‘garbage’ 'Joe Biden finally said what he really thinks of our supporters. He called them ‘garbage.’ And they mean it. Even though, without question, my supporters are far higher-quality than crooked Joe’s,' Trump told an audience in Rocky Mount, North Carolina. 'My response is very simple: You can’t lead America if you don’t love Americans. You just can’t,' Trump said. He went on to suggest that the administration was mistreating Americans by returning to his familiar theme of immigrants who have entered the country illegally. 'We know what they believe,' he said. 'Because look at how they’ve treated you. They’ve treated you like garbage.' Harris is ‘trying to disassociate herself’ from Biden’s policies, Trump says ROCKY MOUNT, N.C. — But the GOP nominee added that his rival’s proposals to boost the U.S. economy 'are the plans of a simpleton. They’re not going to work.' After a man in the audience criticized Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump laughed. 'He screams, ‘she’s an idiot,’ but I didn’t say it,' Trump said, smiling. A new addition to Trump’s rally line-up is a video showing clips of all the times Harris in her Tuesday night speech in Washington mentioned his name, more than a dozen times. 'She suffers from a very serious disease known as Trump derangement syndrome,' he said after the video played. 'Many Democrats suffer from that disease, and it’s only because of one reason, because we’re winning.' Trump tells voters in North Carolina that ‘the fate of our nation is in your hands’ ROCKY MOUNT, N.C. — Donald Trump said Wednesday he has seen 'even more enthusiasm' in this White House run than in his presidential runs in the 2016 and 2020 cycles. Calling Vice President Kamala Harris 'a low IQ individual,' Trump said his Democratic rival is 'running a campaign of hate, anger and retribution.' He entered the arena in Rocky Mount, North Carolina, as the song 'God Bless the USA' played. His next stop is Green Bay, Wisconsin. Minnesota Rep. Tom Emmer refers to Walz as Harris’ ‘emotional support animal’ ROCKY MOUNT, N.C. — Emmer was one of the introductory speakers at Trump’s rally in Rocky Mount. The Republican congressman said the Harris’ campaign has been struggling ever since Walz faced off against Ohio Rep. JD Vance in the vice presidential debate at the beginning of the month. Polls have not indicated a significant change since then. But Emmer said of Walz, 'He was supposed to be Kamala’s emotional support animal. But guess what? JD Vance ended that.' Harris responds to a protester by slamming Trump RALEIGH, N.C. — When Vice President Kamala Harris’ speech in North Carolina on Wednesday was interrupted by a protester, the Democratic nominee used the moment to attack her opponent, former President Donald Trump. The man, who yelled that Harris was 'disrespecting the Palestinian community' and interrupted her speech, was drowned out by the crowd chanting Harris’ name. Harris has faced a series of pro-Palestinian protests in recent days. 'This is the thing, we know we’re actually fighting for a democracy,' Harris said. 'Unlike Donald Trump, I don’t believe that people who disagree with you are the enemy.' Trump has increasingly become fixated on Americans he believes have wronged or betrayed him, referring to them as 'the enemy from within.' Democrats have seized on the line, accusing Trump, should he win another term in office, of planning to use the power of a White House against Americans who disagree with him. Harris says Trump is angling to ‘ban abortion nationwide’ RALEIGH, N.C. — Harris, speaking at a rally in North Carolina on Wednesday, lamented that a third of women live in a state with 'a Trump abortion ban, including North Carolina and every state in the South except for Virginia.' Trump was central in remaking the Supreme Court, nominating three conservative justices who were key to overturning Roe v. Wade and federal abortion protections in 2022. Since that decision, abortion has invigorated the Democratic base and threatened Republicans. Trump has since said he wouldn’t sign a federal abortion ban. 'Understand, he’s not done,' Harris said. 'He would ban abortion nationwide.' ‘It is time for a new generation of leadership in America,’ Harris says RALEIGH, N.C. — Vice President Kamala Harris told an audience in North Carolina on Wednesday that this is a moment 'for a new generation of leadership in America,' offering herself as both a transition from former President Donald Trump, and, more subtly, President Joe Biden. Trump is 78 years old and this is his third run for the presidency. Biden, who stepped aside to allow Harris to be the Democratic nominee over the summer, is 81 years old. 'It is time for a new generation of leadership in America. I am ready to offer that leadership,' she said to an audience in Raleigh. 'Let us lock arms with each other knowing that we have so much more in common than what separates us.' 'We know we have an opportunity in this election to turn the page on a decade of Donald Trump who has been trying to keep us divided and afraid of each other,' Harris added. 'We know that is who he is, but North Carolina that is not who we are.' ‘I feel like I made an honest mistake when I voted for Trump in 2016’ RALEIGH, N.C. — Jennifer Bell, a North Carolina engineer who once voted for former President Donald Trump, introduced Vice President Kamala Harris at a rally in Raleigh on Wednesday, highlighting how flipping Trump voters and independents has become central to Harris’ closing message. Bell is the latest in a growing list of former Trump supporters who have introduced Harris or spoken at one of her rallies in the closing days of the campaign. 'I would invite them to, today, join me in putting country before party,' Bell said to one-time Trump voters. 'Let’s put our principles before partisanship and stand up to support a leader who has shown unwavering dedication to bring our country together.' 'As a fiscal conservative, I feel like I made an honest mistake when I voted for Trump in 2016,' Bell said to some boos from the audience. After saying that she thought a businessman would help streamline the government, she added, 'The flaw in the plan is he is a failed businessman.' She later said Trump’s 'extremism destroyed the Republican Party.' Nearly 850,000 people have already cast their ballots in Louisiana BATON ROUGE, La. — A new record has been set for early in-person voting in Louisiana, with 849,784 people casting their ballots ahead of the conclusion of the early voting window on Monday, Secretary of State Nancy Landry announced. The state saw a 3% increase from 2020 during the same time frame, when the former record was set. In total, between early voting and returned absentee ballots, nearly one-third of Louisiana’s registered voters have already cast their vote ahead of the Nov. 5 election. 'I’m pleased that so many Louisianans have already made their voices heard in this election,' Landry said. ‘I don’t consider Trump to be a real Republican’ RALEIGH, N.C. — Jennifer Phelan, 60, said ahead of Vice President Kamala Harris’ rally in Raleigh, North Carolina, that she feels nervous because the election seems so close. To her, it shouldn’t be. 'It just seems very much like a cartoon of good and evil,' Phelan said. She still feels fairly confident in North Carolina flipping blue from the conversations she’s had since she started volunteering in March, as well as the enthusiasm she sees among fellow volunteers. Phelan remembers discussing the race when Biden was atop the Democratic ticket, and she said more people seemed hesitant about supporting him. That hasn’t been the case as much with Harris leading the ticket, she said. She’s also had conversations with some conservatives who said they’d vote for Harris because they don’t like Trump — adding that those were 'real Republicans' in her eyes. 'I don’t consider Trump to be a real Republican,' she said. Sen. Rubio blasts Biden’s ‘garbage’ remark as reflective of every top Democrat U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, who first told Trump at a Tuesday rally in Pennsylvania that President Joe Biden had called the former president’s supporters 'garbage,' is blaming Democrats for these comments. 'Biden only said out loud what every top democrat actually believes about anyone who votes for Trump,' Rubio said on X. Biden was speaking on a campaign call organized by the Hispanic advocacy group Voto Latino about remarks made by comedian Tony Hinchcliffe during Trump’s rally in Madison Square Garden on Sunday where he referred to Puerto Rico as a 'floating island of garbage.' 'The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters. His demonization of Latinos is unconscionable, and it’s un-American,' Biden had said in the call. ‘We’re the closest we’ve been since Obama won in ’08’ RALEIGH, N.C. — Liz Kazal, a rallygoer at Vice President Kamala Harris’ rally in Raleigh, said she’s 'cautiously optimistic' about the election — a lesson she said she learned from 2016 when Hillary Clinton lost to Donald Trump. 'You hope for the best and plan for the worst,' she said on Wednesday. Kazal, 35, said she’s tried to do some form of volunteering every week — door-knocking with her 2-year-old daughter, phone banking and fundraising for Harris with friends and family. Over the next week, Kazal said she plans to go door-knocking more and hold a phone banking session at her home. 'We’re the closest we’ve been since Obama won in ’08,' Kazal said. Kazal has family members who are Trump supporters, but it’s been hard to talk to them about politics. To Kazal, it seems like Trump 'transcends politics for them.' 'I’m at a loss for how to talk to them,' Kazal said. 'But yeah, I’ve been able to talk about other issues.' Arnold Schwarzengger endorses Kamala Harris and Tim Walz LOS ANGELES — In a lengthy post on the social platform X, the former Republican governor of California said he 'hates' politics more than ever, is not happy with either political party and would prefer to 'tune out.' But, he said, he is endorsing Democrats Harris and Walz because 'I will always be an American before I am a Republican.' Schwarzenegger went on to harshly criticize Donald Trump for rejecting the results of the 2020 presidential vote. '(R)ejecting the results of an election is as un-American as it gets,' he said. 'To someone like me who talks to people all over the world and still knows America is the shining city on a hill, calling America ... a trash can for the world is so unpatriotic, it makes me furious. He ended by saying the country needs to 'close the door on this chapter of American history, and I know that former President Trump won’t do that. He will divide, he will insult, he will find new ways to be more un-American than he already has been, and we, the people, will get nothing but more anger.' Democrats are leaning on celebrity star power. Will it matter? WASHINGTON — Kamala Harris has Bruce Springsteen, Taylor Swift and Beyoncé. Donald Trump has Kid Rock, Waka Flocka Flame and Hulk Hogan. As the 2024 campaign whirls into its final week, Democrats are noticeably leaning on their star power advantage, calling on a diverse range of celebrities to endorse Harris, invigorate audiences and, they hope, spur people to the ballot box. Democrats have long enjoyed a celebrity advantage and used it to close out presidential campaigns when attention and energy are critical. That upper hand has grown during Trump’s rise, a period that saw scores of celebrities, even apolitical stars, break their silence and speak out against the Republican leader. The advantage often means raucous, fiery events in the closing days of a race, but history — namely Hillary Clinton’s 2016 campaign — highlights how the energy at those events can sometimes paper over broader issues with a candidate. ▶ Read more on the impact of celebrity involvement in campaigning ‘I will represent all Americans, including those who don’t vote for me’ WASHINGTON — Harris said she spoke with Biden Tuesday night after her speech, but his comments in the campaign call didn’t come up. She said: 'I will represent all Americans, including those who don’t vote for me.' The flap over the president’s comments allowed Harris to make her sharpest break yet with Biden during her three-month campaign for the White House. She’s come under fire for not differentiating herself enough from the unpopular Democratic incumbent. Harris says she disagrees ‘with any criticism of people based on who they vote for’ WASHINGTON — The vice president was responding on Wednesday to comments made by President Joe Biden on Tuesday night. Biden was on a campaign call Tuesday evening reacting to a comic who called Puerto Rico garbage during a Trump rally last weekend. The president said, 'The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters.' Biden’s remarks were quickly seized on by Republicans who said he was denigrating Trump supporters, a distraction for Harris when she is trying to reach out to GOP voters. He quickly sent a social media post seeking to clarify his remarks. 'His demonization of Latinos is unconscionable,' Biden said of Trump. 'That’s all I meant to say.' Harris noted that Biden later clarified his comments. Walz says Biden calling Trump supporters ‘garbage’ doesn’t undermine Harris’ unity message. Democratic vice-presidential candidate Tim Walz says Kamala Harris’s unity message wasn’t undermined by President Joe Biden calling Donald Trump’s supporters 'garbage.' Walz said Wednesday on 'CBS Mornings' that Biden 'was very clear that he’s speaking about the rhetoric we heard, so it doesn’t undermine it.' Harris argued the case for her candidacy in a speech Tuesday night in Washington in which she promised to be an inclusive president. During a call Tuesday organized by a Hispanic advocacy group, Biden said the 'only garbage' he sees floating out there are Trump supporters. He was responding to a comic at Trump’s Madison Square Garden rally on Sunday who said Puerto Rico is a 'floating island of garbage.' Biden later clarified his remarks, saying in a post on the social platform X that he was referring to 'hateful rhetoric about Puerto Rico spewed by Trump’s supporter' at the rally. Walz was also asked about Biden’s comments when he appeared on ABC’s 'Good Morning America' and said the president had issued a clarification. 'Let’s be very clear, the vice president and I have made it absolutely clear that we want everyone as a part of this. Donald Trump’s divisive rhetoric is what needs to end,' Walz said. Trump to campaign with former NFL quarterback Donald Trump will be campaigning with former Green Bay Packers quarterback Brett Favre in Wisconsin on Wednesday night at the same time that popular musicians will be rallying with Vice President Kamala Harris about two hours away in the swing state’s capital city. Mumford &amp; Sons, Gracie Abrams, Remi Wolf and members of the band The National were slated to appear at the Harris rally Wednesday night in Madison. At the same time, about 140 miles (225 kilometers) northeast of there, Trump was to hold a rally not far from Lambeau Field with Favre. Both Harris and Trump will again be in Wisconsin for dueling events on Friday. Trump is holding a rally Friday night in Milwaukee at the Fiserv Center, which was the site of the Republican National Convention. Harris is planning multiple stops in the state but has not said where yet. Wisconsin is one of seven battleground states that’s seen multiple visits from Trump, Harris, their running mates and other surrogates. Two closing arguments show the stark choice between Trump and Harris NEW YORK — In the shadow of the White House, seven days before the final votes of the 2024 election are cast, Kamala Harris vowed to put country over party and warned that Donald Trump is obsessed with revenge and his own personal interests. Less than 48 hours earlier inside Madison Square Garden, Trump called his Democratic opponent 'a trainwreck who has destroyed everything in her path.' His allies on stage labeled Puerto Rico a 'floating island of garbage' and made a baseless claim that Harris, a former prosecutor and senator who is trying to become the first woman to be elected president, had begun her career as a prostitute. Two nights and 200 miles apart, the dueling closing arguments outlined in stark terms the choice U.S. voters face on Nov. 5 when they will weigh two very different visions of leadership and America’s future.

Banning UNRWA will lead to a vacuum and more suffering for Palestinians, the agency's chief says	RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) — The head of the U.N. agency caring for Palestinian refugees said Wednesday that newly passed Israeli laws effectively banning its activities in Israel will leave a vacuum that will cost more lives and create further instability in Gaza and the West Bank. Philippe Lazzarini, the commissioner-general of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, or UNRWA, told The Associated Press in an exclusive interview — the first since the laws were passed — that the legislation is 'ultimately against the Palestinians themselves,' effectively denying them a functioning provider of lifesaving services, education and health care. UNRWA has been the main agency procuring and distributing aid in the Gaza Strip, where almost the entire population of around 2.3 million Palestinians relies on the agency for survival amid Israel's nearly 13-month-old war with the militant Hamas group. Tens of thousands of displaced Palestinians are sheltering in UNRWA-run schools. Other aid groups say the agency's strong, decades-old infrastructure across Gaza is irreplaceable. So far, Israel has put forward no plan for getting food, medicine and other supplies to Gaza's population in UNRWA's absence. Israel alleges that Hamas and other militants have infiltrated UNRWA, using its facilities and taking aid — claims for which it has provided little evidence. The laws, passed by parliament this week, sever all ties with UNRWA and ban its operations in Israel. And since the agency's operations in Gaza and the West Bank must go through Israeli authorities, the laws threaten to close its activities there as well. The laws are expected to come into effect in three months. If the Israeli decision is implemented 'this would be a total disaster, it is like throwing (out) the baby with the water,' Lazzarini told the AP, speaking in the Saudi capital, Riyadh, where he is attending a conference to discuss the Mideast conflict. 'This would create a vacuum. It would also feed more instability in the West Bank and Gaza,' he said. 'Having UNRWA ending its activities within the three months would also mean more people will die in Gaza.' He said the agency is looking for 'creative ways to keep our operation going.' He appealed for support from the U.N. General Assembly and donors to keep providing services and called on Israel to rescind the decision or extend the three-month grace period. He said Israel has not officially communicated with the agency following the adoption of the laws. For decades, UNRWA has operated networks of schools, medical facilities and other services around Gaza and the West Bank — as well as in neighboring Lebanon, Syria and Jordan. In Gaza especially, it plays a major role in maintaining social services and the economy, as the territory's largest single employer and the source of education and health care for much of the population. The laws threaten to shut down all those operations, impacting the education and welfare of hundreds of thousands of children well into the future, he said. 'We have today 1 in 2 persons in Gaza below the age of 18, among them 650,000 girls and boys living in the rubble, deeply traumatized at the age of primary and secondary school,' he said. 'Getting rid of UNRWA is also a way to tell these children that you will have no future. We are just sacrificing your education. Education is the only thing which has never, ever been taken away from the Palestinians.' UNRWA was established to help the estimated 700,000 Palestinians who fled or were driven out of what is now Israel during the 1948 war surrounding Israel’s creation. It now offers support to the refugees and their descendants, who number some 6 million around the region. Lazzarini said the Israeli laws are the 'culmination of years of attack against the agency.' He said 'the objective is to strip the Palestinian from refugee status.' International law gives Palestinian refugees and their descendants the right to return to their homes. Israel has refused to allow their return, saying it would end the Jewish majority in the country. Israel has said the refugees should be taken in by their host countries, and officials often argue that UNRWA's services keep Palestinians' hopes for return alive. In a letter to the U.N, Lazzarini said the Israeli laws and campaign against the agency 'will not terminate the refugee status of the Palestinians, which exists independently of UNRWA’s services, but will severely harm their lives and future.' Israel claims hundreds of Palestinian militants work for UNRWA, without providing evidence, and that more than a dozen employees took part in Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023 attack on Israel that ignited the latest war. The U.N. has fired nine staffers after internal investigations found they may have participated in the attack. UNRWA has nearly 30,000 staff around the region, including 13,000 in Gaza, most of them Palestinians. Israel also says Hamas fighters operate in UNRWA schools and other facilities in Gaza — and has hit many of them with airstrikes. UNRWA denies knowingly aiding armed groups and says it acts quickly to purge any suspected militants from its ranks. Lazzarini said Israel has not responded to inquiries from UNRWA for details about other allegations, including that the agency's premises are used by militant groups.. With the continued fighting, the agency has been unable to verify the claims, he said and called for an independent investigation. At least 237 UNRWA staff have been killed in the war in Gaza, a toll among U.N. staff not seen in any other conflict. Over 200 UNRWA facilities have been damaged or destroyed, killing more than 560 people sheltering there. Lazzarini spoke on the sidelines of the conference by the Global Alliance for a Two-State Solution, a Saudi government-created initiative attended by foreign ministers from Arab, Muslim, African and European countries. 'If we want to be successful in any future political transition, we need an agency like UNRWA taking care of education and the primary health of the Palestinian refugees' until there is a viable functioning state or administration to do so, he said. ___ El Deeb reported from Beirut.	https://apnews.com/article/gaza-unrwa-west-bank-israel-aid-1db00a3979b5b8759823e1a81da9c6fb	2024-10-30T04:38:38-07:00	
Georgia begins investigating its disputed election but the opposition calls the probe into question	TBILISI, Georgia (AP) — The Prosecutor’s Office in Georgia said Wednesday it has launched an investigation into alleged vote rigging in last weekend’s parliamentary election, which officials said was won by the ruling party and the opposition denounced as illegitimate. The opposition immediately raised objections that the Prosecutor’s Office would not conduct an independent investigation because its head was appointed by parliament, which is dominated by the Georgian Dream ruling party. Georgian Dream, which has deepened the South Caucasus nation’s ties with Russia, was declared the winner of Saturday’s election with about 54% of the vote. The balloting was seen by many Georgians as a choice between continuing to support the ruling party or seeking closer integration with the European Union. European observers said the election took place in a 'divisive' environment marked by intimidation and instances of vote-buying, double voting and physical violence. Georgian observers also reported multiple violations and said the results do not reflect 'the will of the Georgian people.' The United States and the EU have called for a full and transparent investigation of the alleged violations. Thousands of people rallied outside the parliament building Monday night to hear opposition speakers, including President Salome Zourabichvili, denounce what they called a stolen election. The nation of 3.7 million people, which borders Russia, was granted the status of an EU candidate in 2022, but Brussels halted the process indefinitely after the parliament, dominated by Georgian Dream, adopted a 'foreign influence law,' similar to ones enacted in Russia to crack down on dissent. The party was set up by Bidzina Ivanishvili, a shadowy billionaire who made his fortune in Russia and served briefly as Georgia’s prime minister but has stayed out of public view since 2013. The investigation was requested by the Central Election Commission, and Zourabichvili was summoned for questioning Thursday about the allegations; others 'who may possess information related to the alleged criminal act' also would be questioned, the Prosecutor’s Office said. But Salome Samadashvili of the opposition Strong Georgia coalition, questioned whether the Prosecutor's office was independent of Ivanishvili's influence. 'If somebody thinks that they can fool the Georgian people or our international partners into believing that Bidzina will investigate his own election fraud, they are mistaken. Nobody can be fooled,' Samadashvili said. 'That is why we are saying that the investigation should be conducted by an international mission with the adequate mandate and qualifications. Until this is done, this election cannot and will not have legitimacy or trust,' she added. Zourabichvili, who has a mostly ceremonial role as president, suggested that 'Russian elections' were held in the country, and said 'technology was used to whitewash counterfeiting. Such a thing has never happened before.'	https://apnews.com/article/georgia-election-rigging-investigation-eu-70bf4ba10b156b5222414b1a0fe45d46	2024-10-30T04:34:12-07:00	
Trial begins in the assassination of Rio de Janeiro councilwoman Marielle Franco	RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) — A trial opened Wednesday against two former policemen accused in the 2018 killing of Rio de Janeiro councilwoman Marielle Franco, who was Black, bisexual and from humble roots and who has become a major icon of Brazil's political left. Franco, 38, and her driver, Anderson Gomes, were killed in a drive-by shooting on March 14, 2018. Ronnie Lessa is accused of firing the gun, while Élcio Queiroz is accused of being the driver. Two brothers with purported ties to criminal groups — one of them a sitting federal lawmaker — have been accused of ordering the killing, allegedly because the councilwoman's work went against the interests of those gangs, known as militias. They have yet to go on trial. Lessa and Queiroz, arrested in 2019, have signed plea bargains confessing their roles, but the jury has final word on their guilt. Jurors could technically overrule the plea bargains, but analysts say that is unlikely. Hundreds of demonstrators gathered Wednesday in front of the trial venue in Rio de Janeiro, many carrying sunflowers and shouting 'Justice!' 'Today we have a chance to change the face of justice in Rio de Janeiro and in Brazil,' Antônio Francisco da Silva Neto, Marielle’s father, told journalists before the trial began. Her mother, sister and daughter were also on site, as was Anderson’s wife, Agatha Arnaus. 'These individuals, confessed defendants, need to be condemned in an exemplary way so that the message gets across that they are not God, they cannot take the life of any human being and go unpunished,' he added. Known universally by her first name, Marielle, the killing was seen in Brazil as an attack on democracy. Raised in one of Rio’s poor communities known as favelas, she became known for her efforts to improve the lives of ordinary Rio residents. Following her election in 2016, she fought against violence targeting women while defending human rights and social programs. Outrage over her killing sparked mass protests. Her silhouette can be found printed on T-shirts and painted on walls nationwide. The accused faced questions over the double deaths and also the attempted killing of Fernanda Chaves, Franco’s assistant and friend, who was injured but survived. Chaves recounted Marielle’s final moments before the court on Wednesday. 'We were talking about things about life, work, domestic things. At one point she was doubting whether to stop or not to buy bread at the bakery ... It was when the car was going very slowly that I heard a rush... As an immediate reflex, I got down,' Chaves said. 'I noticed (Anderson’s) right arm was off the steering wheel, Marielle was immobile. I felt her arm on top of me, the weight of her body against me.' Lessa told the court that he fired the shots to Marielle's head, and that Anderson was killed accidentally. 'I took the risk, knowing that the ammunition wasn’t appropriate. It was a 9mm ammunition... if it had been a revolver, for example, only the councilwoman would have died, not Anderson,' he said. Prosecutors are seeking the maximum prison sentence for the double killings, which could reach 84 years each, according to Rio’s public prosecutors’ office. In September, Edilson Barbosa dos Santos was convicted of dismantling the car used in the drive-by shooting. But many see Wednesday's trial as the first time some of the main people allegedly responsible for her death are held to account. Both defendants participated in the trial by videoconference from prison. Lessa is in Sao Paulo while Queiroz is in Brazil’s capital, Brasilia. The jury heard eight witnesses, six called by the state public prosecutors’ office and two others by Lessa’s defense. Queiroz’s defense opted not to call any. Federal authorities started investigating the case in earnest once leftist President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva took office in 2023. In March, Federal Police detained federal lawmaker Chiquinho Brazão and his brother Domingos Brazão, a member of Rio state’s accounts watchdog, on suspicion of ordering Franco’s killing. Both are allegedly connected to the militias, which illegally charge residents for various services, including protection. They have denied any involvement in the killing or with militias. In his plea bargain, Lessa told police that the two politician brothers hired him and informed him that the then-chief of the state’s civil police, Rivaldo Barbosa, had signed off beforehand. Barbosa was also arrested in March. Police accuse the politicians of ordering her killing because she was an obstacle to militias’ interests. Guilhermo Catramby, a delegate of the Federal Police, joined the case at the request of the then Minister of Justice, Flávio Dino, early 2023. He said the motivation of the crime was 'undoubtedly' Marielle’s work regarding land rights, even though it wasn’t central to her mandate. 'Marielle’s mandate … (was) a thorn in the side of militia interests, especially in the West Zone of Rio de Janeiro,' he added. Before the trial started, Anielle Franco, Marielle’s sister and Lula’s minister for racial equality, said the day bought a 'mixture of feelings.' 'It’s a certainty that we fought hard and we’re going to keep fighting. Not just for Mari, for Anderson, but for everyone who will come. For my daughters, for my granddaughters and for all the generations to come. So that we have a safer place.'	https://apnews.com/article/brazil-marielle-franco-trial-police-c20b31ebb5f152bfaddf2a0c44722d0b	2024-10-30T04:01:56-07:00	
Afghan women cannot pray loudly or recite in front of other women, says Taliban minister	ISLAMABAD (AP) — Afghan women are forbidden from praying loudly or reciting the Quran in front of other women, according to a Taliban government minister. It’s the latest restriction on women following morality laws that ban them from raising their voice and baring their faces outside the home. They are already excluded from education after sixth grade, many public spaces and most jobs. Nobody from the Vice and Virtue Ministry was immediately available Wednesday to clarify the official’s remarks or confirm if the prohibition would also become part of the morality laws. During an event in eastern Logar province on Sunday, Vice and Virtue Minister Khalid Hanafi said: 'It is prohibited for a grown woman to recite Quranic verses or perform recitations in front of another grown woman. Even chants of takbir (Allahu Akbar) are not permitted.' He said that uttering similar expressions like 'subhanallah,' another word central to the Islamic faith, was also not allowed. A woman was not permitted to perform the call to prayer, he told the gathering. 'So, there is certainly no permission for singing.' Audio of Hanafi’s remarks was shared on the ministry’s social media platforms but was later deleted. The ministry said Tuesday that a nationwide awareness program about the laws is underway involving ministry officials at provincial and district levels. 'Organising such programs will contribute to shaping public perception and increasing awareness of divine rulings,' the ministry added. Afghan provinces are already barring the media from showing images of living things, another controversial and widely criticized feature of the morality laws. The Taliban set up the ministry for the ' propagation of virtue and the prevention of vice' after seizing power in 2021. Since then, the ministry has enforced decrees issued by the Taliban leadership that have a disproportionate impact on women and girls, like dress codes, segregated education and employment, and having a male guardian when they travel.	https://apnews.com/article/afghanistan-women-taliban-morality-laws-1b52f8effabc3058accd59dd07789829	2024-10-30T03:29:18-07:00

Russia and Ukraine exchange drone strikes as North Korea's top diplomat visits Moscow	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Russia and Ukraine exchanged scores of drone strikes Wednesday as North Korea's top diplomat arrived in Russia for talks after his country reportedly deployed thousands of soldiers to help Moscow's war efforts. Ukraine's air force said that Russia launched 62 drones and one missile overnight, adding that 33 of them were intercepted and 25 were jammed. The drones struck a residential building and a kindergarten in Kyiv, injuring nine people, including a child, according to the city administration. 'Russian drones did not change their constant tactics — they approached the capital from different directions, at different heights,' it said. Russian attacks also targeted other regions of Ukraine, killing at least four and injuring about 30 others over the past 24 hours, authorities said. At the same time, Russian forces have pressed their slow-moving offensive in eastern Ukraine. In Moscow, the Defense Ministry announced the capture of the village of Kruhlyakivka in the Kharkiv region. The ministry said that air defenses downed 25 Ukrainian drones over several regions in the country's west and southwest. The new attacks come as North Korea's Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui arrived in Moscow for talks that South Korea's spy agency said could involve discussions on sending additional troops to Russia and what the North would get in return. The Pentagon said North Korea has sent about 10,000 troops to Russia, and that they will likely fight against Ukraine 'over the next several weeks.' Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder, the Pentagon press secretary, said Tuesday that a 'relatively small number' of North Korean troops are now in the Kursk region, where Russia has struggled to push back a Ukrainian incursion. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-north-korea-39eb411523195516dce893ce47c0faf6	2024-10-30T02:46:10-07:00	
Middle East latest: Israel issues evacuation warning for the entire Baalbek city in eastern Lebanon	The Israeli army issued an evacuation warning for residents in the entire eastern Lebanese city of Baalbeck, along with surrounding areas and key routes in the Bekaa Valley. The area marked for evacuation includes the ancient Roman temple complex, inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage site. Lebanon’s Heath Ministry said more than 2,790 people have been killed and 12,700 wounded since Oct. 8, 2023, when Hezbollah began firing rockets into Israel, drawing retaliation. Israeli ground forces invaded southern Lebanon at the beginning of October. Multiple United Nations agencies rallied Tuesday around their fellow organization, UNRWA, that provides aid to Palestinian refugees, after Israel’s parliament took steps to ban it in the coming months. The foreign ministers of Cyprus and Luxembourg say the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees is 'indispensable' to providing food, education and health care to Palestinians. Turkey’s Foreign Ministry called Israel’s decision a 'clear violation of international law.' United States President Joe Biden’s administration says it is seeking an explanation from Israel about its attack Tuesday on a town in northern Gaza that Palestinians say killed at least 88 people, including dozens of women and children. The death toll from more than a year of the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza has passed 43,000, Palestinian officials reported Monday, without distinguishing between civilians and combatants. The Israel-Hamas war began after Hamas-led militants stormed into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people — mostly civilians — and abducting 250 others. ___ Here’s the latest: Israeli military says Tuesday’s strike on Gaza building was targeted JERUSALEM — An Israeli military official says the target of Tuesday’s attack on a five-story building that Gaza health officials reported resulted in scores of deaths was a spotter with binoculars in the building, and that the intent was not to destroy the structure. The military official agreed to provide details only on condition of anonymity, citing military protocol and the ongoing investigation into the incident. The official said Wednesday the building was not known to be a shelter for civilians, and that it collapsed as a result of the strike on the spotter. The Gaza Health Ministry said Tuesday that at least 70 people were killed in the first of two strikes on the northern Gaza town of Beit Lahiya, and that more than half of the victims were women and children. The Israeli military had earlier said it was investigating the strike. The Gaza Health Ministry’s casualty tolls do not differentiate between civilians and militant fighters. The official said there were discrepancies between the numbers of victims reported by authorities in Gaza and what Israeli intelligence indicates, and that the victims included known militants. The official did not provide detailed evidence to support that assertion. The Israeli military has repeatedly struck shelters for displaced people in recent months. It says it carries out precise strikes targeting Palestinian militants and tries to avoid harming civilians, but the strikes often kill women and children. —By Adam Schreck Israeli hospital officials say rocket from Lebanon wounded 2 JERUSALEM — Hospital officials in Israel say a rocket fired from Lebanon has wounded two men, one seriously. The men were wounded by rocket shrapnel on Wednesday in Metula, an Israeli town just across the border from Lebanon, said a spokesperson for the Rambam Hospital, where they were airlifted. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military. Hezbollah has fired thousands of rockets into Israel since Oct. 8, 2023, when it opened fire in solidarity with Hamas a day after its cross-border attack from the Gaza Strip. All-out war erupted last month, when Israel carried out large waves of airstrikes and killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and most of his senior commanders. Israel launched a ground invasion at the start of October. Israel issues an evacuation warning for the entire Baalbek city in eastern Lebanon BEIRUT — For the first time in the ongoing Israel-Hezbollah war, the Israeli army has issued an evacuation warning for residents in the entire eastern city of Baalbek, along with surrounding areas and key routes in the Bekaa Valley. Earlier Wednesday, a drone strike targeted a van on Lebanon's Aaraya highway, a major road linking Beirut to the Bekaa, about 10 kilometers (6 miles) from the Lebanese capital, resulting in flames, according to Lebanese state media. Another vehicle in Bchamoun, roughly 10 kilometers (6 miles) southeast of Beirut, was also targeted, as reported by the state-run National News Agency. This is the first time in the conflict that the area is targeted. The number of casualties and the intended targets were not yet known. The area marked in Wednesday’s evacuation order includes the ancient Roman temple complex, inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage site. On Oct. 6, an Israeli strike hit some 700 meters (750 yards) away from the ancient citadel, which houses two of the largest Roman temples in the world. Norway wants clarity on Israel's obligation to Palestinians under international law OSLO, Norway — Norway is asking for a clarification on Israel’s responsibility under international law when preventing the United Nations, international humanitarian organizations and states from helping Palestinians. 'The international community cannot accept that the U.N., international humanitarian organizations and states face systematic obstacles to being able to work in Palestine and provide humanitarian aid to the Palestinians under occupation,' Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre said Wednesday. 'It undermines the Palestinians’ right to vital aid. Then we have to react.' The U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, also known as UNRWA, provides essential services to millions of Palestinians across the Middle East and has underpinned aid efforts in Gaza throughout the Israel-Hamas war. Legislation barring it from operating in Israel passed with an overwhelming majority Monday. Israel says UNRWA has allowed itself to be infiltrated by Hamas, with the militants siphoning off aid and using the agency’s facilities as shields. UNRWA denies the allegations, saying it is committed to neutrality and acts quickly to address any wrongdoing by its staff. Norway has called for a resolution in the U.N. General Assembly that asks the International Court of Justice 'to give an advisory opinion on the duties of Israel as an occupying power to facilitate aid to the population of Palestine.' Gahr Støre added that a number of countries have expressed support for the initiative, in addition to UNRWA. Under international law, Israel has an obligation to help the Palestinian population under occupation, Norwegian Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide said. 'With this initiative, Norway wants to establish that no country can rise above its obligations under international law,' Barth Eide said. 'We see similar trends in other countries — that leaders try to undermine humanitarian law and aid work in situations of crisis and conflict. We must stop this development.'	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-hezbollah-mideast-latest-30-october-2024-32c614e64e8959768ac3f50aa67548ea	2024-10-30T02:25:10-07:00	
A New Zealand city waves goodbye to its 'disturbing' giant hand sculpture that many came to love	WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — Perched on two fingers on the roof of an art gallery in Wellington, New Zealand, the giant sculpture of a hand has loomed over the city for five years. Named Quasi, the 16 feet — almost 5 meters — creation of Australia-based sculptor Ronnie van Hout bears an unsmiling human face — because why not? Some found it disturbing, and now, after five years of provoking controversy and myriad emotions — from horror and revulsion to delight — among residents of New Zealand’s capital, Quasi will be removed from the roof of City Gallery this week. It will be taken to a new home, the gallery said Wednesday. 'This is either a great day for Wellington or a terrible day for Wellington and there’s not much view in between,' said Ben McNulty, a Wellington city council member. Personally, McNulty told The Associated Press he felt 'devastated' by the sculpture’s departure. Quasi is made of steel, polystyrene and resin, and was based on scans of van Hout’s hand and face. It was named in part for Quasimodo, the bellringer in Victor Hugo’s 1831 novel 'The Hunchback of Notre-Dame.' Hence the male gender some have attributed to Quasi. Quasi first graced — or haunted — an art gallery in Christchurch, New Zealand, in 2016 but proved polarizing. It was the subject of an op ed in the local newspaper listing reasons the sculpture 'must go,' including claims that one of its outstretched fingers 'appears to be inappropriately and belligerently pointing at pedestrians and office workers.' 'Perhaps the monster just wants to be loved?' van Hout responded at the time. In 2019, Quasi was installed in Wellington, where he grew over time on its residents. 'He arrived and I won’t say the city unanimously hated him but I reckon 80% were like, ‘What is this monster? What have we done?’' McNulty said. 'But I think that over time there’s been a bit of a softening, there’s sort of a pro-Quasi group, which I consider myself part of,' he added. On Wednesday, many at Wellington’s Civic Square, where the gallery with Quasi is located, said they had warmed to him too. 'It’s really disturbing but it’s a staple of Wellington now,' said Anja Porthouse, who had brought friends and family to see Quasi and was 'gutted' it was leaving. Quasi is to be lifted from the roof by helicopter on Saturday, when the giant hand will travel to an undisclosed location in Australia, the gallery said. 'Everything comes to an end eventually,' van Hout told the AP. 'I am sure it will be missed, but even Lovecraftian nightmares have to return to where they came from, and now you only have an absence to reflect on.' Dozens responded to the news on social media with dismay, glee and jokes about the curse that local lore has attributed to Quasi being lifted. The sculpture has adorned the Wellington skyline during 'some of its most difficult times,' McNulty said. The city has struggled with earthquake-prone buildings, widespread plumbing problems and political division in recent years. Other comments took guesses about where Quasi might end up. 'He’s going to The Hague,' wrote one New Zealander on X. 'He will be missed,' said Jane Black, who heads the Wellington Sculpture Trust. 'I’ll personally be pleased to see it head somewhere else for a change,' the city's mayor, Tory Whanau, told the AP. 'I think there’s a strong feeling of relief.'	https://apnews.com/article/quasi-giant-hand-wellington-sculpture-zealand-art-cfcd3599eda341b78741dcfcf519edbd	2024-10-30T01:34:20-07:00	
More spending and tax hikes expected in Britain in the Labour government's first budget	LONDON (AP) — British Treasury chief Rachel Reeves will deliver her first budget in Parliament on Wednesday, a tightrope act that aims to find billions for investment through borrowing and tax hikes without roiling businesses or raising taxes on working people. It’s the first budget by a Labour Party government in almost 15 years, and the first ever delivered by a female finance minister. It could set the tone for the length of the current parliament, which runs until 2029, and the party's ability to win a second term at the next election. Reeves, who left her offices at No. 11 Downing Street with the famous red briefcase that contains the budget in hand, has a tough balancing act. She has pledged to put 'more pounds in people’s pockets,' give a much-needed financial boost to public services, such as schools and hospitals, and get the economy growing. All this has to be done within the confines of stretched public finances, which the government has said are in a much worse state than thought when it was elected in July. Prime Minister Keir Starmer has warned that the budget will reflect 'the harsh light of fiscal reality' but that there will no return to the austerity that marked the early years of the previous Conservative government after it was first elected in 2010. The center-left Labour Party was elected July 4 after promising to banish years of turmoil and scandal under Conservative governments, get Britain’s economy growing and restore frayed public services, especially the state-funded National Health Service. The center-left government argues that higher taxes and limited public spending increases are needed to 'fix the foundations' of an economy that it argues has been undermined by 14 years of Conservative government. The Conservatives say they left an economy that was growing, albeit modestly, with lower levels of debt and a smaller deficit than many other Group of Seven wealthy nations. Pumping money into health, education and housing is a priority of the new government, made harder by a sluggish economy, hobbled by rising public debt and low growth. The government also says there is a 22 billion pound ($29 billion) 'black hole' in the public finances left by the Conservative government. That means the budget is certain to include tax increases — though Labour has pledged not to raise the tax burden on 'working people,' a term whose definition has been hotly debated in the media for weeks. The Treasury has announced that about 3 million of the lowest-paid workers will get a 6.7% pay increase next year, with he minimum wage rising to 12.21 pounds ($15.90) an hour. Reeves — Britain’s first female chancellor of the exchequer, a position that has existed for some 800 years — is widely expected to tweak the government’s debt rules so that she can borrow billions more for investment in the health system, schools, railways and other big infrastructure projects, and to raise money by hiking tax paid by employers, though not employees. 'The U.K. is at a critical juncture: after years of sluggish growth and deteriorating public infrastructure, a sustained rise in government investment is vital to promote long-term growth and boost living standards,' said Monica George Michail, an economist at the independent think tank The National Institute of Economic and Social Research. Though the budget is set to be one of the most consequential in years, Reeves will no doubt be careful not to cause concern in financial markets. Two years ago, the short-lived premiership of Liz Truss foundered after a series of unfunded tax cuts roiled financial markets and sent borrowing costs surging. Her successor Rishi Sunak sought to get a grip on the public finances but was unable to dislodge the notion that the Conservative Party had lost control of the economy, arguably the biggest reason why it suffered its worst election defeat in 200 years. In the run-up to the budget statement, the U.K.'s borrowing costs in the markets have edged higher, suggesting there is some unease about the path ahead.	https://apnews.com/article/britain-budget-reeves-labour-tax-spending-11443e4186797dcc91446dc50dcad6c5	2024-10-30T01:28:02-07:00	
At least 63 people die in devastating flash floods in eastern Spain	BARCELONA, Spain (AP) — At least 63 people have died in eastern Spain after flash floods swept away cars, turned village streets into rivers and disrupted rail lines and highways in the worst natural disaster to hit the European nation in recent memory. Emergency services in the eastern region of Valencia confirmed a death toll of 62 people on Wednesday. The central government office for Castilla La Mancha region added that an 88-year-old woman was found dead in the city of Cuenca. Rainstorms on Tuesday caused flooding in a wide swath of southern and eastern Spain, stretching from Malaga to Valencia. Floods of mud-colored water tumbled vehicles down streets at high speeds, while pieces of wood swirled in the water with household items. Police and rescue services used helicopters to lift people from their homes and rubber boats to reach drivers trapped on the roofs of cars. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez said dozens of towns had been flooded and warned that the danger is not over. 'For those who are looking for their loved ones, all of Spain feels your pain,' Sánchez said in a televised address. 'Our priority is to help you. We are putting all the resources necessary so that we can recover from this tragedy.' Authorities reported several missing people late Tuesday, but the following morning brought the shocking announcement of dozens found dead. 'Yesterday was the worst day of my life,' Ricardo Gabaldón, the mayor of Utiel, a town in Valencia, told national broadcaster RTVE. He said several people were still missing in his town. 'We were trapped like rats. Cars and trash containers were flowing down the streets. The water was rising to three meters,' he said. Over 1,000 soldiers from Spain’s emergency response units were deployed to the devastated areas. Rescue services were also rushing eastwards from other parts of Spain. Spain’s central government set up a crisis committee to help coordinate rescue efforts. One elderly couple was rescued from the upper story of their house by a military unit using a bulldozer, with three soldiers accompanying them in the huge shovel. Television reports showed videos shot by panicked residents documenting waters flooding the ground floors of apartments, streams bursting their banks and bridges giving way. Spain has experienced similar autumn storms in recent years. Nothing, however, compared to the devastation over the last two days, which recalls floods in Germany and Belgium in 2021 that saw 230 people killed. The death toll will likely rise with other regions yet to report victims and search efforts continuing in areas with difficult access. In the village of Letur in the neighboring Castilla La Mancha region, Mayor Sergio Marín Sánchez said six people were missing. Spain is still recovering from a severe drought and continues to register record high temperatures in recent years. Scientists say increased episodes of extreme weather are likely linked to climate change. The storms unleashed a freak hailstorm which punched holes in car windows and greenhouses as well as a rarely seen tornado. Transport was also impacted. A high-speed train with nearly 300 people on board derailed near Malaga, although rail authorities said no one was hurt. High-speed train service between Valencia city and Madrid was interrupted, as were commuter lines. Valencian regional President Carlos Mazón urged people to stay at home, with travel by road already difficult due to fallen trees and wrecked vehicles. As the waters fell, thick layers of mud mixed with refuse made streets unrecognizable. 'The neighborhood is destroyed, all the cars are on top of each other, it’s literally smashed up,' Christian Viena, a bar owner in the Valencian village of Barrio de la Torre, said by phone. 'Everything is a total wreck, everything is ready to be thrown away. The mud is almost 30 centimeters deep.' Outside Viena's bar, people were venturing out to see what they could salvage. Cars were piled up and the streets were filled with clumps of water-logged branches. Relatives of the missing filled social media and local television and radio outlets with appeals to find their loved ones. Leonardo Enrique told RTVE that his family had been searching for hours for his son, Leonardo Enrique Rivera, 40, who was driving a delivery van when it began to rain. His son had sent a message saying his van was flooding and that he had been hit by another vehicle when he was near Ribarroja, an industrial town which is one of the worst affected, Enrique said. Located south of Barcelona down the Mediterranean coast, Valencia is a tourist destination known for its beaches, citrus orchards, and as the home of Spain’s paella rice dish. Like some other areas of Spain, Valencia has gorges and small riverbeds that spend much of the year completely dry but quickly fill with water when it rains. Many of them pass through populated areas. The rain had subsided in Valencia by late Wednesday morning as the storm headed north, prompting authorities in the Barcelona region to issue weather alerts. ___ Associated Press journalist Teresa Medrano in Madrid contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/spain-floods-valencia-weather-ef0dffabe1a106a05c239dca4dfec1ae	2024-10-30T00:03:44-07:00	
North Korean troops sent to Russia may be pleased to be there, even as they face ferocious fighting	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — The thousands of young soldiers North Korea has sent to Russia, reportedly to help fight against Ukraine, include many elite special forces, but that hasn't stopped speculation they'll be slaughtered because they have no combat experience, no familiarity with the terrain and will likely be dropped onto the most ferocious battlefields. That may be true, and soon. Observers say some of the troops have already arrived at the front. From the North Korean perspective, however, these soldiers might not be as miserable as outsiders think. They may, in fact, view their Russian tour with pride and as a rare chance to make good money, see a foreign country for the first time and win preferred treatment for their families back home, according to former North Korean soldiers. 'They are too young and won't understand exactly what it means. They'll just consider it an honor to be selected as the ones to go to Russia among the many North Korean soldiers,' said Lee Woong-gil, a former member of the same special forces unit, the Storm Corps. He came to South Korea in 2007. 'But I think most of them won’t likely come back home alive.' Troop deployment is Kim's ‘big gamble’ Worries about North Korea’s likely participation in the Russian-Ukraine war were highlighted this week when the Pentagon said North Korea has sent about 10,000 troops to Russia, and that they will likely fight against Ukraine 'over the next several weeks.' South Korea’s presidential office said Wednesday that more than 3,000 North Korean soldiers have been moved close to battlefronts in western Russia. North Korea's troop deployment could mark a serious escalation of the almost three-year war. It caught many outside observers by surprise because North Korea has its own security headache, a festering standoff with the United States and South Korea over its nuclear program. Large North Korean troop casualties would be a major political blow for the country’s 40-year-old ruler, Kim Jong Un, whose government hasn't formally confirmed the deployment. But experts say Kim may see this as a way to get much needed foreign currency and security support from Russia in return for joining Russia's war against Ukraine. 'Kim Jong Un is taking a big gamble. If there are no large casualty numbers, he will get what he wants to some extent. But things will change a lot if many of his soldiers die in battle,' said Ahn Chan-il, a former North Korean army first lieutenant who is now head of the World Institute for North Korean Studies think tank in Seoul. Ordinary soldier's wage is less than $1, defectors say The Storm Corps, also known as the 11th Corps, is one of Kim’s top units. Its main missions would be infiltrating agents into South Korea, blowing up important facilities in the South and assassinating key figures in the event of war on the Korean Peninsula. Lee, who served in the Storm Corps in 1998-2003, recalled that his unit received better food and supplies than other units, but many members still suffered from malnutrition and tuberculosis. Despite a gradual economic recovery in North Korea over the past 30 years, defectors say the average monthly wage for ordinary North Korean workers and soldiers is less than $1. They say many people engage in capitalist market activities to make a living because the country's state rationing system remains largely broken. Russia is expected to pay all the costs related to the deployment of North Korean troops, including their wages, which observers estimate will be at least $2,000 per month for each person. About 90% to 95% of their stipends will likely go to Kim’s coffers, and the rest to the soldiers. This means one year of service in Russia would earn a North Korean soldier $1,200 to $2,400. That's big enough to prompt many young soldiers to volunteer for risky Russian tours, former soldiers say. Ahn said North Korea will likely offer other incentives meant to elevate the social standings of soldiers, such as membership in the ruling Workers’ Party and the right to move to Pyongyang, the country’s showcase capital. Kang Mi-Jin, a defector who runs a company analyzing North Korea’s economy, said even family members of soldiers sent to Russia could be given benefits such as good houses or entrance to good universities. Choi Jung-hoon, a former first lieutenant in North Korea’s army, said serving on foreign soil will attract many soldiers who are eager to see other countries for the first time. North Koreans are barred from accessing foreign news and need state approval to move from one province to another within the country. North Korean construction, logging and other workers sent abroad to bring in foreign currency have often been called 'slaves' by international human rights groups. But defectors testify that such overseas jobs are often better than staying in North Korea, and many used bribery and family connections to get them. 'North Korean soldiers would see going to Russia as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,' Ahn said. Ahn and other observers say such views could change if the soldiers see colleagues dying in large numbers. They say many North Korean soldiers could surrender to Ukraine forces and ask for resettlement in South Korea. North Korean soldiers lack familiarity of the terrain North Korean soldiers have been trained on the Korean Peninsula's mountainous terrain and are not familiar with the largely flat plain battlefields in the Russian-Ukraine war. They also don't understand modern warfare, including drone use, because North Korea hasn’t fought a big battle since the end of the 1950-53 Korean War, experts say. 'My heart ached,' said Choi, now leader of an activist group in Seoul, when he saw a Ukraine-released video purportedly showing undersized North Korean soldiers believed to be in their late teens or early 20s. 'None would think they are going to Russia to die,' Choi said. 'But I think they're cannon fodder because they will be sent to the most dangerous sites and will surely be killed.' Leader Kim Jong Un may also be hoping that his troop offer will push Russia to share sophisticated and highly sensitive technology that he needs to perfect his nuclear-capable missiles. That transfer could depend on how long the war continues and how many more troops Kim will send. Nam Sung-wook, a former director of a think tank run by South Korea’s spy agency, said North Korea will likely get hundreds of millions of dollars because of the soldiers' wages. The soldiers will get direct experience of modern warfare but will likely die in large numbers, and Russia will be reluctant to hand over its high-tech missile technology, he said. 'North Korea will continue to hide its troop dispatches from its own people because the public will be agitated if they know their soldiers are being sent abroad to be killed,' said Nam, who is now a professor at Korea University in South Korea.	https://apnews.com/article/north-korea-soldiers-russia-ukraine-war-651ac7615c3124fde657043a9193d6b1	2024-10-29T23:46:30-07:00	
In Lebanon, a family's memories are detonated along with their village	ARAMOUN, Lebanon (AP) — Ayman Jaber’s memories are rooted in every corner of Mhaibib, the village in southern Lebanon he refers to as his 'habibti,' the Arabic word for 'beloved.' The root of the village’s name means 'the lover' or 'the beloved.' Reminiscing about his childhood sweetheart, the 45-year-old avionics technician talks about how the young pair would meet in a courtyard near his uncle's house. 'I used to wait for her there to see her,' Jaber recalls with a smile. 'Half of the village knew about us.' The fond memory contrasts sharply with recent images of his hometown. Mhaibib, perched on a hill close to the Israeli border, was leveled by a series of explosions on Oct. 16. The Israeli army released a video showing blasts ripping through the village in the Marjayoun province, razing dozens of homes to dust. The scene has been repeated in villages across southern Lebanon since Israel launched its invasion a month ago with the stated goal of pushing Hezbollah militants back from the border. On Oct. 26, massive explosions in and around Odaisseh sparked an earthquake alert in northern Israel. Israel says it wants to destroy a massive network of Hezbollah tunnels in the border area. But for the people who have been displaced, the attacks are also destroying a lifetime of memories. Mhaibib had endured sporadic targeting since Hezbollah and Israeli forces began exchanging fire on Oct. 8 last year. Jaber was living in Aramoun, just south of Beirut, before the war, and the rest of his family evacuated from Mhaibib after the border skirmishes ignited. Some of them left their possessions behind and sought refuge in Syria. Jaber's father and two sisters, Zeinab and Fatima, moved in with him. In the living room of their temporary home, the siblings sip Arabic coffee while their father chain-smokes. 'My father breaks my heart. He is 70 years old, frail and has been waiting for over a year to return to Mhaibib,' Zeinab said. 'He left his five cows there. He keeps asking, ‘Do you think they’re still alive?’' Mhaibib was a close-knit rural village, with about 70 historic stone homes lining its narrow streets. Families grew tobacco, wheat, mulukhiyah (jute mallow) and olives, planting them each spring and waking before dawn in the summer to harvest the crops. The village was also known for an ancient shrine dedicated to Benjamin, the son of Jacob, an important figure in Judaism. In Islam, he is known as the prophet Benjamin Bin Yaacoub, believed to be the 12th son of prophet Yaacoub and the brother of prophet Yousef. The shrine was damaged in the 2006 war between Israel and Hezbollah, then renovated. Pictures show the shrine enclosed in a golden cage adorned with intricate Arabic inscriptions beside an old stone mosque crowned by a minaret that overlooked the village. The mosque and the shrine are now gone. Hisham Younes, who runs the environmental organization Green Southerners, says generations of southerners admired Mhaibib for its one-or two-story stone homes, some built by Jaber’s grandfather and his friends. 'Detonating an entire village is a form of collective punishment and war crime. What do they gain from destroying shrines, churches and old homes?' Younes asks. Abdelmoe’m Shucair, the mayor of neighboring Mays el Jabal, told the Associated Press that the last few dozen families living in Mhaibib fled before the Israeli destruction began, as had residents of surrounding villages. Jaber's sisters attended school in Mays al-Jabal. That school was also destroyed in a series of massive explosions. After finishing her studies in Beirut, Zeinab worked in a pharmacy in the neighboring village of Blida. That pharmacy, too, is gone after the Israeli military detonated part of that village. Israeli forces even bulldozed their village cemetery where generations of family members are buried. 'I don’t belong to any political group,' Zeinab says. 'Why did my home, my life, have to be taken from me?' She says she can't bring herself to watch the video of her village’s destruction. 'When my brother played it, I ran from the room.' To process what’s happening, Fatima says she closes her eyes and takes herself back to Mhaibib. She sees the sun setting, vividly painting the sky stretching over their family gatherings on the upstairs patio, framed by their mother’s flowers. The family painstakingly expanded their home over a decade. 'It took us 10 years to add just one room,' Fatima said. 'First, my dad laid the flooring, then the walls, the roof and the glass windows. My mom sold a year’s worth of homemade preserves to furnish it.' She paused. 'And it was gone in an instant.' In the midst of war, Zeinab married quietly. Now she’s six months pregnant. She had hoped to be back in Mhaibib in time for the delivery. Her brother was born when Mhaibib and other villages in southern Lebanon were under Israeli occupation. Jaber remembers traveling from Beirut to Mhaibib, passing through Israeli checkpoints and a final crossing before entering the village. 'There were security checks and interrogations. The process used to take a full or half a day,' he says. And inside the village, they always felt like they were 'under surveillance.' His family also fled the village during the war with Israel in 2006, and when they returned they found their homes vandalized but still standing. An uncle and a grandmother were among those killed in the 34-day conflict, but a loquat tree the matriarch had planted next to their home endured. This time, there is no home to return to and even the loquat tree is gone. Jaber worries Israel will again set up a permanent presence in southern Lebanon and that he won't be able to reconstruct the home he built over the last six years for himself, his wife and their two sons. 'When this war ends, we’ll go back,' Ayman says quietly. 'We’ll pitch tents if we have to and stay until we rebuild our houses.'	https://apnews.com/article/lebanon-israel-hezbollah-village-detonated-mhaibib-0d1220d7f23ca2ca66e9030b36fefa9c	2024-10-29T21:35:27-07:00	
Botswana's election decides if a party that's been in power for 58 years gets another term	GABORONE, Botswana (AP) — Polls opened in an election in Botswana on Wednesday and a country was set to decide if one of Africa's longest-ruling parties stays in power for another five-year term. The Botswana Democratic Party has been in power in the southern African nation for 58 years since independence from Britain in 1966. The one-day election will decide the makeup of Parliament and lawmakers will later elect the president. President Mokgweetsi Masisi, a 63-year-old former high school teacher and United Nations employee, is seeking a second and final term. Botswana has been held up as one of Africa's success stories as a peaceful and stable democracy with one of the best standards of living in the region, but it is facing new economic challenges that have pushed the BDP to concede that policy change is needed. That's largely because of a global downturn in demand for diamonds, which Botswana's economy relies on. Unemployment in the nation of some 2.5 million people has risen to 27% this year, and it's significantly higher for young people. The BDP says it has listened to the concerns of voters and is open to policy changes that could diversify an economy where diamonds account for more than 80% of Botswana's exports and a quarter of the GDP, according to the World Bank. Three men have registered to challenge Masisi for president: Duma Boko of the main opposition Umbrella for Democratic Change party, Dumelang Saleshando of the Botswana Congress Party and Mephato Reatile from the Botswana Patriotic Front. Counting is expected to start straight after polls close Wednesday evening and the results could be announced within days. While the BDP has dominated Botswanan politics since independence, recent economic uncertainty has closed the gap between it and the opposition, analysts say. Botswana is the second biggest producer of diamonds behind Russia and has been responsible for all the biggest rough gems found in the past decade. But sales of rough diamonds at Debswana, the company the Botswana government jointly owns with the De Beers Group and a critical source of state revenue, were down nearly 50% in the first half of 2024, according to authorities. That has put a dent in the public purse and raised criticism of Masisi and the BDP for not taking steps to diversify the economy. Government employees have received their salaries late as a result of the tight financial position, taking the shine off of Botswana’s reputation for efficient government. Ahead of the election, the BDP said it would now put emphasis on processing mineral resources for new revenue streams, while also building the agriculture and tourism sectors. Just over a million people have registered to vote, according to the Independent Electoral Commission. Botswana is larger than France but has a small population, with the Kalahari Desert covering large portions of the landlocked country that borders South Africa. Drought and desertification threaten Botswana’s development and the livelihoods of many of its people. The election could also revive Masisi’s feud with former President Ian Khama, the man he succeeded as Botswana’s leader and then fell out with. Khama, the son of Botswana’s founding president, quit the BDP and went into exile in South Africa in 2021, accusing Masisi of taking an authoritarian approach to criticism. Khama was charged with illegal possession of a firearm and receiving stolen property in a criminal case he said was politically motivated to silence him. Khama returned to Botswana in September to attend a court hearing and has campaigned for the Botswana Patriotic Front in an attempt to oust Masisi. ___ AP Africa news: https://apnews.com/hub/africa	https://apnews.com/article/botswana-election-bdp-masisi-7ae583e904f30e4fe3df3e6de2ecefb6	2024-10-29T20:54:16-07:00	
Japan's Nikkei rises over 1% after Big Tech stocks push Nasdaq to record high	HONG KONG (AP) — Asian markets were mixed on Wednesday with Japan's benchmark index gaining more than 1% after a rally in technology stocks propelled the Nasdaq composite to a record high. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng was down 1.3% to 20,438.54 and the Shanghai Composite index dropped 0.6% to 3,267.42. In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 index was up 1.3% at 39,390.49, as the Bank of Japan began a two-day policy meeting on Wednesday. Australia’s S&amp;P/ASX 200 dipped 0.9% to 8,177.90 after its inflation rate in the third quarter came in at 2.8%, the lowest level in more than three years, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics. Elsewhere, South Korea’s Kospi was down 0.8% to 2,596.61 and Taiwan’s Taiex gained 0.1%. U.S. futures and oil prices rose. The S&amp;P 500 rose 0.2% to 5,832.92 on Tuesday. Gains for influential Big Tech stocks helped mask weakness elsewhere, and they pushed the Nasdaq composite up 0.8% to 18,712.75. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, meanwhile, fell 0.4% to 42,233.05. Mortgage rates have been climbing recently because the 10-year Treasury yield has been charging higher. Yields have rallied as report after report has shown the U.S. economy remains stronger than expected. On Tuesday, reports said confidence among U.S. consumers jumped more than economists expected, while the number of job openings edged lower in September, but the number of hires remained relatively steady. Such numbers have forced traders to ratchet back expectations for how much the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates, now that it’s just as focused on keeping the economy humming as getting inflation down. Traders are even betting on a slim chance the Fed will keep its main interest rate steady at its meeting next week, according to data from CME Group. That’s after the Fed kicked off its rate-cutting campaign in September with a larger-than-usual reduction. Just a month ago, many traders were thinking the Fed would follow up in November with another bigger-than-usual cut. Yields have also climbed as investors have seen former President Donald Trump’s chances of re-election improving. Economists say a Trump win could help push inflation higher in the long term, and worsening inflation could lead to higher interest rates. Trump Media &amp; Technology Group, the company that tends to move more with Trump’s re-election odds than on its own profit prospects, climbed another 8.8% to $51.51 Tuesday. It moved so sharply during the day that trading of its stock was briefly halted several times. The parent company of Trump’s Truth Social platform has been rallying since hitting a bottom of roughly $12 in late September. Treasury yields, like stocks, have historically tended to be shaky heading into an Election Day, only to calm afterward regardless of which party wins. In other dealings early Thursday, U.S. benchmark crude oil gained 36 cents to $67.57 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude, the international standard, surged 36 cents to $71.09 per barrel. The dollar slipped to 153.31 Japanese yen from 153.36 yen.

A man is arrested on suspicion of killing a woman in a Hong Kong park	HONG KONG (AP) — A foreign man living in Hong Kong has been arrested on suspicion of killing a Southeast Asian woman at a waterfall inside a park in the Chinese territory. The woman, who was about 25 years old, was a domestic worker in Hong Kong but did not work for the suspect, police superintendent Sin Kwok-ming told reporters Tuesday night. The woman went to the waterfall inside a park in Pok Fu Lam on Hong Kong Island on Sunday night with the suspect, but he rushed off alone in a taxi after staying there for about half an hour, police said. On Monday morning, residents spotted the woman's body floating in the pond below the waterfall, Sin said. An initial autopsy showed the woman drowned after being hit in the head with an unspecified hard object. Sin said the woman had injuries to her head and limbs. The suspect and his wife, a Hong Konger, had gone to mainland China before officers arrested them when they returned to the city on Tuesday, Sin said. The man was detained on suspicion of murder and his wife was held on suspicion of assisting offenders. The man holds a Hong Kong identity card, but police did not specify which country he or the victim was from. 'We found so many unreasonable things related to the arrested man. He didn't report to the police and immediately left Hong Kong after the incident. Some evidence related to him had disappeared too,' Sin said. The investigation was continuing. The man and his wife were still in detention and have not been charged as of Wednesday morning, police said. 'This case involves a person’s life, and we take that very seriously. We will carefully unravel every detail to uncover the truth and to bring justice to the deceased,' Sin said.	https://apnews.com/article/hong-kong-woman-killed-e38e424a0cc5b972e605dd89eeeb3899	2024-10-29T20:35:48-07:00	
How Putin views the choice between Harris and Trump, and what the election means for Russia	The question posed to Vladimir Putin in September about the U.S. election drew a wry smile and an arched eyebrow from the Russian president. Asked whether he preferred Donald Trump or Kamala Harris, Putin caught listeners up short with his teasing reply that also included a gentle jab at President Joe Biden. 'Our ‘favorite,’ if you can call it that, was the current president, Mr. Biden,' he told the audience at an economic forum in the Far East port of Vladivostok. 'But he was removed from the race, and he recommended all his supporters to support Ms. Harris. Well, we will do so — we will support her,' he said sardonically, citing her 'expressive and infectious laugh' that shows 'she’s doing well.' The election Tuesday carries significant stakes for the Kremlin, and despite Putin's noncommittal and somewhat teasing answer, it appeared to encapsulate Russia's view as a choice between two unappealing possibilities. Analysts say neither offers much promise of improving relations that have hit their lowest point since the Cold War. Harris, the current vice president, has taken a hard line against Russia, while Trump, the former president, is known for his admiration of Putin. Still, at the September gathering, Putin complained that when Trump was in office, there were 'so many restrictions and sanctions against Russia like no other president has ever introduced before him.' Timothy Colton of the Harvard Academy for International and Area Studies said that the Kremlin leadership is 'by and large convinced nothing good is going to come in the election from Russia’s point of view.' But he added that on the whole, Trump 'is probably their preference; he’s more of a known quantity.' Key issues for Russia as the U.S. election looms: What will happen to aid for Ukraine? Harris is seen as likely to continue the Biden administration's massive military and economic support for Ukraine as Russia's invasion stretches toward a third year. Trump has bragged that his rapport with Putin and respect from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy are so strong that he could negotiate an end to the war 'in 24 hours.' He declines to detail his strategy, but recent remarks criticizing sanctions in general suggest he could lift those against Russia as an inducement to help settle the conflict. During their debate, Trump twice refused to directly answer whether he wanted Ukraine to win the war, while Harris praised Western support for Kyiv and urged it to continue. 'Otherwise, Putin would be sitting in Kyiv with his eyes on the rest of Europe. Starting with Poland,' she said. Trump's running-mate Sen. JD Vance has mentioned proposals that could suggest Trump's thinking: having Ukraine demilitarize territory occupied by Russia and agree to permanent neutrality. Those terms would be anathema to Kyiv, but Trump has shown little sympathy for Ukraine, saying Zelenskyy 'should never have let that war start.' Harris has not specified how her position would differ from Biden's. The U.S. has provided Ukraine more than $59.5 billion in weapons and assistance since Russia invaded in 2022. She has said previously it would be foolish to risk global alliances the U.S. has established and decried Putin’s 'brutality.' A Harris win 'likely promises continued U.S. support as long at the administration can maintain congressional backing,' the International Crisis Group said in a commentary, though it said she could seek an end to the fighting more actively than Biden did. Growing congressional animosity to vast outlays of aid for Ukraine could hobble or reshape her strategy. How will the U.S. approach Russia on human rights? Harris has confronted Russia directly on such matters, particularly in the case of the death in prison of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny. She was among the first foreign leaders to comment on his death, calling it 'a further sign of Putin’s brutality.' Trump put off comment for days, then did not connect Putin to the matter. He likened Navalny’s punishment to his own fraud prosecution, calling his case 'a form of Navalny.' Trump has called for a bill declaring there to be only two genders and pledged to keep transgender women out of women’s sports — positions that parallel how Russia under Putin has rolled back LGBTQ+ rights and lauded 'traditional values.' His characterization of Democrats and his rivals as 'the enemy within' is little different in spirit than Russia's accelerating suppression of opposition. How will NATO be affected? Trump has wrestled with other members of the NATO alliance, demanding that they meet the agreed spending levels for their militaries in their national budgets. He said that as president, he warned leaders that he would not only refuse to defend nations that don’t meet those targets, but that Russia could 'do whatever the hell they want' to such countries. Trump also has questioned the NATO charter's mutual-defense clause, asking in an interview why the United States should be obliged to defend the 'very aggressive people' of NATO member Montenegro. Harris says the United States' commitment to NATO is 'ironclad.' She has not weighed in on whether she supports Ukraine becoming an alliance member. What about arms control deals with Russia? Putin has repeatedly brandished the nuclear sword as he seeks to deter the West from supporting Ukraine. The last remaining nuclear arms control treaty between Moscow and Washington, New START, is to expire in 2026. a year after the new administration takes office, and its prospects are troubled. Biden renewed the treaty quickly upon taking office, and Harris could be expected to follow that support for the pact that limits the number of intercontinental nuclear missile launchers. Russia suspended participation in 2023 — although it did not withdraw — and the U.S. retaliated with measures including halting the sharing of information on missiles' location and status. Trump, although he has warned of the threat of 'nuclear warming,' took steps while in office to dismantle the arms control regime, including pulling out of the INF Treaty on intermediate-range nuclear weapons — which banned ground-based nuclear and conventional missiles with a range of 500-5,500 kilometers (310-3,410 miles), While in office, Trump called for a new nuclear pact that would include both Russia and China.	https://apnews.com/article/russia-putin-election-trump-harris-biden-a94e45dfb0912bf44d5f83532b977b3b	2024-10-29T20:26:05-07:00	
How Mexican cartels manage the flow of migrants on their way to the US border	CIUDAD HIDALGO, Mexico (AP) — The first place where many migrants sleep after entering Mexico from Guatemala is inside a large structure, a roof above and fenced-in sides on a rural ranch. They call it the 'chicken coop' and they don’t get to leave until they pay the cartel that runs it. Migrant encounters at the U.S.-Mexico border have reached a four-year low, but days before the U.S. election, in which immigration is a key issue, migrants continue pouring into Mexico. While U.S. authorities give much of the credit to their Mexican counterparts for stemming the flow to their shared border, organized crime maintains stricter control of who moves here than the handful of federal agents and National Guardsmen standing by the river. Kidnapped migrants who pay the $100 ransom for their release are stamped to signal that they have paid. From January to August, just in this southernmost corner of Mexico, more than 150,000 migrants were intercepted by immigration agents, considered a fraction of the flow. Six migrant families interviewed by The Associated Press, who had passed through an initial abduction and were held until paying, explained how it works. A Mexican federal official corroborated much of it. They all requested anonymity for fear of reprisals. Mexican immigration agents encountered 925,000 undocumented migrants through August of this year, well above last year’s annual total and triple the 2021 total. Yet, they’ve only deported 16,500, a fraction of previous years. Rev. Heyman Vázquez, a priest in Ciudad Hidalgo along the Suchiate river that divides Mexico and Guatemala, sees it daily. 'It’s them (the cartel) that says who passes and who doesn’t,' Vázquez said. 'The numbers of migrants that they take every day are big and they do it in front of the authorities.' Pay to continue north On Monday morning, Luis Alonso Valle, a 43-year-old Honduran traveling with his wife and two children, climbed off a raft lashed together with truck inner tubes and boards that had carried them across the Suchiate to Mexico. They hadn’t made it 50 yards toward Ciudad Hidalgo before three men approached on a motorcycle to tell them they couldn’t keep walking. Then seeing journalists they left. The family looked scared. In Ciudad Hidalgo’s central plaza, Valle asked for a van that could take them the 23 miles (37 kilometers) to Tapachula, considered the main entry point for southern Mexico. Climbing aboard, the driver asked in a whisper that journalists stop recording. 'They (organized crime) are going to stop me,' he said. This is often how migrants arrive at the ranch. Taxi or van drivers working for the cartel take them there and hand them over. They’re forced to sleep on the ground. 'There were more than 500 people there, some had been there 10, 15 days,' said a Venezuelan woman who was released Sunday with her husband and two children. 'Whoever doesn’t have money stays and whoever decides to pay leaves,' she said. A 28-year-old baker from Ecuador was escorted to a bank to withdraw money to free himself, his wife, daughter and four other relatives. His family was held as insurance until he returned. Once the payment is made, migrants' photos are taken and their skin stamped. Gunmen stop vans and taxis headed to Tapachula and check for the stamps. Those without them are sent back. Migrants said that once they got to Tapachula they were told to wash them off to avoid trouble with other gangs. According to the nongovernmental organization Fray Matias de Cordova in Tapachula, at least one-third of the hundreds of migrants they have attended to this year arrived stamped. Director Enrique Vidal Olascoaga said those who cannot pay are often sexually assaulted. None of the families interviewed by AP said they had been harmed. The official with knowledge of migrants' statements to investigators said that more than 100 migrants freed by security forces in Ciudad Hidalgo in September, as well as a group of several dozen migrants who were shot at by soldiers on Oct. 1, had passed through similar kidnapping and extortion scenarios. Cartel-controlled border Organized crime’s strict control at Mexico’s southern border tracks with the growing violence generated by the struggle between the Sinaloa and Jalisco New Generation cartels. The state of Chiapas is only one of their battlegrounds, but it is key to controlling smuggling routes for people, drugs and weapons from Central America. Migrants have become the most lucrative commodity, according to experts. The cartels’ increasingly aggressive presence is becoming an obstacle to the organizations trying to help migrants. Earlier this month, gunmen killed an outspoken Catholic priest in Chiapas. And Vidal said that sometimes the groups prevent the migrants from receiving humanitarian aid. President Claudia Sheinbaum has said the government is dealing with the violence, but refuses to confront the cartels. She appears to maintain tactics that began under the administration of former President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, to cycle migrants from the north back down to the south exhausting their resources and keeping them far from the U.S. border — exposing them to more kidnappings and extortion. Ciudad Hidalgo Mayor Elmer Vázquez claimed to not know anything about migrant safe houses operating in the area and said his town always looks after migrants. But Rev. Vázquez (no relation to the mayor), who has spent two decades defending migrants, said the prosecutor’s office, National Guard, special prosecutor for crimes against migrants do nothing even when crimes are reported. 'They are colluding with organized crime and, of course, they make it look like they’re doing their jobs,' he said. Race against time In August, the U.S. government expanded access to CBP One, an online portal used to schedule appointments to request asylum at the border, south to Chiapas. Mexico requested the move to relieve pressure migrants felt to travel north to get an appointment. The Mexican government followed by opening 'mobility corridors' to help migrants with CBP One appointments to travel safely from southern Mexico to the U.S. border. The appointments are just a first step, but most applicants are allowed to wait out the lengthy process from inside the U.S. But from Sept. 9 to Oct. 11, Mexico’s National Immigration Institute said it had transported only 846 migrants from Tapachula to the northern border. Others traveling on their own have told of being extorted by Mexican authorities and kidnapped – again – by cartels near the northern border, forcing them to miss their appointments. Donald Trump has said he would do away with CBP One and close other legal routes to enter the U.S. In Tapachula on Tuesday, hundreds of migrants with confirmed CBP One appointments waited outside Mexican immigration agency offices for permits that would allow them to travel north. Jeyson Uqueli, a 28-year-old Honduran, had slept outside the office to make sure he was the first in line when it opened. He was traveling alone, but planned to reunite with his sister in New Orleans. To have any chance at doing so, he would have to make it to the border between Brownsville, Texas and Matamoros, Mexico by Nov. 6 for his CBP One appointment. He planned to fly from Tapachula to the northern city of Monterrey and then take a bus to Matamoros. He was nervous about making it in time, but relieved to have the appointment, 'because Donald Trump is going to come in and get rid of (them),' he said. ___ AP journalists Matías Delacroix in Tecun Uman, Guatemala, and Edgar Clemente in Tapachula, Mexico, contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/mexico-migrants-cartels-smuggling-chiapas-us-border-67d4851eefa60981bceb772bf26d7204	2024-10-29T20:23:41-07:00	
AP-NORC poll finds Democrats and Republicans split on Israel's responsibility for war's escalation	WASHINGTON (AP) — Many American voters are concerned that the ongoing Middle East conflict will escalate into an all-out regional war, a new poll finds. About half of voters are 'extremely' or 'very' worried about the possibility of a broader war in the region. Though there is concern about the conflict growing, according to the survey from the AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, fewer voters — around 4 in 10 — are concerned that the United States will be drawn into a war in the Middle East. This poll was conducted prior to Israel's strike on military bases in Iran on Friday. The conflict in the Middle East has become a major campaign issue as former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris attempt to win over Muslim and Jewish voters in battleground states like Michigan and Pennsylvania. And although Democrats and Republicans are similarly worried about the potential for the war to expand, they disagree about who is to blame for its recent escalation and how the U.S. should be involved going forward. Partisan divide on Israeli government’s level of responsibility About 6 in 10 voters say the Palestinian militant group Hamas, the Iranian government and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah have 'a lot' of responsibility for the escalation of the war in the Middle East. Roughly 4 in 10 voters think the Israeli government has 'a lot' of responsibility, and only about 2 in 10 say the U.S. government has 'a lot' of responsibility. But there's a big partisan split on whether the Israeli government bears 'a lot' of responsibility for the war's escalation. About 6 in 10 Democrats say they do — similar to the share of Democrats who say Hamas bears 'a lot' of responsibility — while only about one-quarter of Republicans say the Israeli government bears 'a lot' of responsibility. Voters support Iran sanctions, but not sending US troops Voters broadly support economic sanctions on Iran, which could hinder support to its proxy groups Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza. A majority, 55%, are in favor of imposing sanctions. They are about evenly divided on whether the U.S. should be providing weapons to Israel’s military, and voters are more likely to oppose sending government funds to aid Israel’s military than to support it. Deploying U.S. troops to aid Israel’s military garners little support among voters, regardless of their partisan affiliation. About half of voters oppose deploying U.S. troops to aid Israel’s military. Only about 2 in 10 voters favor deploying U.S. troops to assist Israel, and a similar share have a neutral view. Many think the US is doing what it can on cease-fire efforts The U.S. is still pressing for any movement on short-term cease-fire proposals, despite letdowns in the past and little expectation of immediate breakthroughs ahead of the election. About half of voters think the U.S. is doing 'about as much as it can' to push for a cease-fire agreement between Israel and Hamas and Hezbollah, while 3 in 10 say it could be doing more. Roughly 2 in 10 voters say the U.S. should be doing less. Republicans are more likely than Democrats to want less U.S. involvement in cease-fire efforts. About 3 in 10 Republicans say the U.S. should do less, compared to about 1 in 10 Democrats. About 6 in 10 Democrats say the U.S. is doing what it can, compared to about 4 in 10 Republicans. Democrats, Republicans and independents are about equally likely to say the U.S. could be doing more. ___ The poll of 1,072 adults was conducted Oct. 11-14, 2024, using a sample drawn from NORC’s probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population. The margin of sampling error for registered voters is plus or minus 4.2 percentage points.	https://apnews.com/article/poll-israel-gaza-hezbollah-hamas-middle-east-e1cfd92c19d57842f2ec2f5f3f489856	2024-10-29T20:03:38-07:00	
Canada alleges Indian Home Minister Amit Shah ordered campaign targeting Sikh separatists	OTTAWA, Ontario (AP) — A Canadian official alleged Tuesday that Indian Home Minister Amit Shah ordered a campaign of violence, intimidation and intelligence-gathering targeting Sikh separatists inside Canada. Deputy Foreign Affairs Minister David Morrison told Parliament members of the national security committee that he had confirmed Shah’s name to The Washington Post, which first reported the allegations. 'The journalist called me and asked if it was that person. I confirmed it was that person,' Morrison told the committee. Morrison did not say how Canada knew of Shah's alleged involvement. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said a year ago that Canada had credible evidence agents of the Indian government were involved in the murder of Canadian Sikh activist Hardeep Singh Nijjar in British Columbia in June 2023. Canadian authorities have repeatedly said they have shared evidence of that with Indian authorities. Indian government officials have repeatedly denied Canada has provided evidence and have called the allegations absurd. India's embassy in Ottawa didn't immediately respond to messages for a request for comment on the allegation against Shah. On Oct. 14, Canada expelled the Indian high commissioner and five other diplomats, alleging they were persons of interest in multiple cases of coercion, intimidation and violence aimed at quieting a campaign for an independent Sikh state known as Khalistan. Canada is not the only country that has accused Indian officials of plotting an assassination on foreign soil. The United States Justice Department announced criminal charges in mid-October against an Indian government employee in connection with an alleged foiled plot to kill a Sikh separatist leader living in New York City. In the case announced by the Justice Department, Vikash Yadav, who authorities say directed the New York plot from India, faces murder-for-hire charges in a planned killing that prosecutors have previously said was meant to precede a string of other politically motivated murders in the United States and Canada. Nathalie Drouin, Trudeau's national security adviser, told the committee Tuesday that Canada has evidence the Indian government first gathered information on Indian nationals and Canadian citizens in Canada through diplomatic channels and proxies. She said the information was then passed to the government in New Delhi, which allegedly works with a criminal network affiliated with Lawrence Bishnoi. Bishnoi is currently in prison in India, but Drouin said his vast criminal network has been linked to homicides, assassination plots, coercion and other violent crimes in Canada. Before the Royal Canadian Mounted Police went public with allegations that Indian diplomats were persons of interest in criminal investigations, Drouin said there was an effort to work with the Indian government to ensure accountability. Drouin said a meeting was held with Modi’s national security adviser, Ajit Doval, in Singapore two days earlier. She said the decision was made to go public when it became evident the Indian government would not cooperate with Canada on proposed accountability measures. That included asking India to waive diplomatic immunity for the persons of interest, including the high commissioner in Ottawa. Drouin said this was not seen as likely. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police said it took the extraordinary step of talking publicly about ongoing investigations because of threats to public safety. The Indian government denies the allegations and has expelled six Canadian diplomats in return. Nijjar, 45, was fatally shot in his pickup truck after he left the Sikh temple he led in Surrey, British Columbia. An Indian-born citizen of Canada, he owned a plumbing business and was a leader in what remains of a once-strong movement to create an independent Sikh homeland. Four Indian nationals living in Canada were charged with Niijar’s murder and are awaiting trial. Drouin and Morrison were called as witnesses at the committee alongside Royal Canadian Mounted Police Commissioner Mike Duheme, as well as the director of Canada's spy service.	https://apnews.com/article/canada-india-amit-shah-sikh-c86c66930302357e3159688bede3e4e6	2024-10-29T14:21:12-07:00

Flash floods in Spain sweep away cars, disrupt trains and leave several missing	BARCELONA, Spain (AP) — Several people were reported missing by Spanish authorities after flash floods swept cars through village streets and disrupted rail service in large areas of eastern and southern Spain on Tuesday. Rushing mud-colored waters caused havoc in a huge arc of the European country, running from the provinces of Malaga in the south to Valencia in the east. Images shot by people with smartphones reproduced on Spain’s national broadcaster RTVE showed frighteningly swift waters carrying away cars and rising several feet into the lower level of homes. A high-speed train with nearly 300 people on board derailed near Malaga, although rail authorities said no one was hurt. The high-speed train service between Valencia city and Madrid was interrupted as were several commuter lines. The national government office for the Castilla La Mancha region told radio channel Cadena Ser that six people in the region were missing. Spanish news agency EFE said that one truck driver was missing in L’Alcudia, a town in Valencia. Also in Valencia, the mayor of Utiel, Ricardo Gabaldón, told RTVE that several people were trapped in their homes. Police and rescue services used helicopters to lift people from homes and cars which were in danger of drowning. An emergency rescue brigade of Spain’s army deployed to help rescue efforts. Storms were forecast to continue through Thursday, according to Spain’s national weather service. Spain has experienced similar autumn storms in recent years. The country has recovered somewhat from a severe drought this year thanks to rainfall. Scientists say that increased episodes of extreme weather are likely linked to climate change.	https://apnews.com/article/spain-floods-storms-weather-e9fac3b8b7f135f99fca421bd6895bc4	2024-10-29T11:48:17-07:00	
Pro Women's Hockey League announces it could add as many as 2 teams for 2025-26 season	The six-team Professional Women’s Hockey League is launching its expansion process with plans to add as many as two franchises for the start of the 2025-26 season, a league executive announced Tuesday. Speaking at the ESPNW Summit in New York, senior vice president of business operations Amy Scheer said the league will begin sending requests for proposals to several markets starting as early as next week, while also accepting applications. '(We’re) looking for the right market size, right fan base, right facilities, right economic opportunity — so a lot of research to be done over the next couple months,' Scheer said, without specifying which markets the league might be targeting. 'But yeah, looking to continue to build the league and grow the number of teams.' Among the U.S. expansion candidates are Detroit and Pittsburgh, where the PWHL hosted neutral site games during its inaugural season last year. Washington, D.C., and Philadelphia would also be regarded as candidates after both were considered before the league established teams in Boston, New York and Minnesota. Denver and Seattle are also considered potential candidates. In Canada, where the league has teams in Toronto, Ottawa and Montreal, Quebec City has already announced its intention of being a candidate for an expansion franchise. Calgary would be a potential option with the city previously being home to the Inferno from 2011 to 2019, before the Canadian Women's Hocky League folded. Scheer also announced the league plans to hold neutral site games in nine markets across North America, and is considering holding an outdoor game. Scheer added the league is also working on holding games in Europe, without specifying when that might happen. The PWHL’s second season opens on Nov. 30, and features an expanded schedule with each team playing 30 games — up from 24 last year. The league has yet to announce where it’s neutral site games will be played. Quebec City councilor Jackie Smith announced earlier on Tuesday that the PWHL has agreed to play a neutral site game at the city’s Videotron Centre on Jan. 19. The PWHL’s schedule has Ottawa playing Montreal on that day, with the site yet to be determined. Smith called the development the first step in Quebec City landing an expansion team. ___ AP Women’s Hockey: https://apnews.com/hub/womens-hockey	https://apnews.com/article/womens-hockey-pwhl-expansion-20e84fec388fd3b29a0c54ee0c5c7a33	2024-10-29T09:43:55-07:00	
Albania's opposition blocks roads in a protest to demand a caretaker Cabinet	TIRANA, Albania (AP) — Albanian opposition activists blocked major roads for several hours Tuesday in a nationwide rally demanding that the government be replaced by a technocratic caretaker Cabinet before the 2025 parliamentary election. Lawmakers led hundreds of opposition supporters in rallies that blocked traffic at a main highway into the capital, Tirana, and at five other major roads around the country. 'Civil blockade, today or never!' was the motto of the protest on the website of the main opposition Democratic Party. In Tirana, opposition lawmakers parked their cars to block traffic for three hours. In other places, opposition supporters staged sit-ins at the roadside or burned tires. The conservative Democrats led by former Prime Minister Sali Berisha have long accused Prime Minister Edi Rama’s Socialists of corruption, manipulating earlier elections and usurping the powers of the judiciary. Thousands of police were deployed to protect government buildings, traffic and the rule of law, and there were sporadic clashes between officers and activists before the rallies ended in the late evening. The opposition activists lifted their blockades when their leaders pledged to take unspecified anti-government action later. Democrats and their supporters in an opposition coalition have been holding protests over the arrests of Berisha and former President Ilir Meta in separate corruption cases, saying the charges are politically motivated. Another Democratic lawmaker, Ervin Salianji, has also been convicted of slander and imprisoned. The Democrats have staged violent protests against the government since 2013, when they left power. Albania holds parliamentary elections next spring, which Rama's Socialists are poised to win, partly because the opposition is divided. The United States and the European Union have urged the opposition to resume dialogue with the government, saying violence won’t help the country integrate into the 27-nation EU bloc. In 2020, the EU decided to launch full membership negotiations with Albania. Earlier in October, Tirana started discussions with the bloc on how the country aligns with EU stances on the rule of law, the functioning of democratic institutions and the fight against corruption. ___ Follow Llazar Semini at https://x.com/lsemini	https://apnews.com/article/albania-opposition-protest-corruption-election-cabinet-tirana-76e08889c6cc00aeb552a5cda65a04fd	2024-10-29T09:31:20-07:00	
Judge tosses GOP congressmen's lawsuit over Pennsylvania's overseas and military votes	HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — A federal judge on Tuesday threw out a lawsuit by six Republican members of Congress seeking to make Pennsylvania election officials institute new checks confirming the identity of soldiers, sailors, and others who vote from overseas and to make sure they're eligible. U.S. District Judge Christopher Conner said he agreed with the defendants — Secretary of State Al Schmidt and one of his top deputies — who argued there were no grounds to sue and that the case was launched too late and too close to Election Day. The Pennsylvania congressmen 'provide no good excuse for waiting until barely a month before the election to bring this lawsuit,' Conner wrote. More than 25,000 overseas ballots had already been sent out when the case was filed in late September, the judge noted. The lawsuit was filed by six of the state’s eight Republican members of the U.S. House: Reps. Guy Reschenthaler, Dan Meuser, G.T. Thompson, Lloyd Smucker, Mike Kelly and Scott Perry. The other plaintiff is PA Fair Elections, a group led by Heather Honey, an election researcher whose work has fueled right-wing attacks on voting procedures. Messages seeking comment were left Tuesday with their lawyers. During a streamed update on election matters Tuesday, Schmidt said his agency 'is pleased that this frivolous lawsuit was dismissed.' Conner said the plaintiffs were asking 'to impose new verification procedures the contours of which plaintiffs themselves have been unable to fully flesh out three weeks into this litigation.' He said an injunction now 'would upend the commonwealth's carefully laid election administration procedures to the detriment of untold thousands of voters.' During oral arguments on Oct. 18, Conner asked why the plaintiffs had not sued earlier over procedures that have been in place for years. He also pressed their lawyers to show how their clients were directly harmed by the current policies, as required for such claims. The order issued Tuesday said the Republican congressmen had only 'hypothetical concerns' about the impact overseas votes might have on their own reelection contests. 'Their status as candidates, without more, gets them nowhere,' the judge wrote. The case could have affected thousands of ballots in Pennsylvania, a pivotal swing state in the presidential contest between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump. The plaintiffs had asked the judge to declare current practices illegal under federal law and to order that the secretary of state's office confer with the congressmen and PA Fair Elections about how to verify the identity and eligibility of people casting votes under the U.S. Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act. They also asked to have overseas and military ballots segregated during the current election season pending the additional verification. Lawyers for Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro's administration, representing Schmidt and his deputy, had argued that the plaintiffs were saying valid votes could be diluted by improper ones, which they said would not be sufficient grounds for the judge to act. They said federal laws exempt overseas voters 'from identification requirements imposed on other voters who register to vote by mail.' Military voters are more likely to be Republican, while other overseas voters tend to lean Democratic. The Democratic Party is spending money this year in an effort to boost their turnout.	https://apnews.com/article/pennsylvania-military-overseas-ballots-1cb8e5b1b4e564482125e1633642c06b	2024-10-29T09:17:47-07:00	
The EU will impose duties on electric vehicle imports from China by Thursday	BRUSSELS (AP) — The European Union is set to impose duties on imports of electric vehicles from China by Thursday after talks between Brussels and Beijing failed to find an amicable solution to their trade dispute. Electric vehicles have become a major flashpoint in a broader trade dispute over the influence of Chinese government subsidies on European markets and Beijing’s burgeoning exports of green technology to the bloc. 'By adopting these proportionate and targeted measures after a rigorous investigation, we’re standing up for fair market practices and for the European industrial base,' European Commission Executive Vice-President Valdis Dombrovskis said on Tuesday. 'In parallel, we remain open to a possible alternative solution that would be effective in addressing the problems identified and (World Trade Organization)-compatible,' he added. The duties would stay in force for five years, unless an amicable solution is found. According to the commission, which manages trade disputes on behalf of the 27 EU member countries, sales of Chinese-built electric cars jumped from 3.9% of the EV market in 2020 to 25% by September 2023, in part by unfairly undercutting EU industry prices. The duties on Chinese manufacturers will be 17% on cars made by BYD, 18.8% on those from Geely and 35.3% for vehicles exported by China’s state-owned SAIC. Geely has brands including Polestar and Sweden’s Volvo, while SAIC owns Britain’s MG, one of Europe’s bestselling EV brands. Other EV manufacturers in China, including Western companies such as Volkswagen and BMW, would be subject to duties of 20.7%. The commission has an 'individually calculated' rate for Tesla of 7.8%. The EU’s retaliatory duties have run into opposition in Germany, which has Europe’s biggest economy and is home to major automakers. The head of Germany’s auto industry association, VDA, said the imposition of the tariffs is 'a setback for free global trade and so for prosperity, the preservation of jobs and Europe’s growth.' Hildegard Müller said the move increases the risk of a far-reaching trade conflict. 'The industry is not naive in dealing with China, but the challenges must be resolved in dialogue' Müller said in a statement. The commission says China boosted its EU market share with the help of subsidies across the production chain. These ranged from cheap land for factories provided by local governments, to cut-price supplies of lithium and batteries from state-owned enterprises, to tax breaks and easy financing from state-controlled banks. The rapid growth in China's market share has sparked concern in the EU that Chinese cars will eventually threaten the EU’s ability to produce its own green technology to combat climate change. Business groups and unions also fear that the jobs of 2.5 million auto industry workers could be put in jeopardy, as well those of 10.3 million more people whose employment depends indirectly on EV production. ——— Associated Press correspondent Geir Moulson contributed from Berlin.	https://apnews.com/article/eu-china-trade-electric-vehicles-duties-ev-9c720558b83316fdb6e1a0f9c2b55a15	2024-10-29T08:11:52-07:00	
An electric hydrofoil ferry offers cleaner journeys among Stockholm's 14 islands	STOCKHOLM (AP) — A high-tech electric ferry service began operating in Stockholm Tuesday, offering commuters a low-carbon way to zip through the waterways of the Swedish capital, which is built on 14 islands. In what Stockholm claimed as a world first, 25 commuters in the suburb of Ekero boarded the Nova, a hydrofoil ferry powered by electric motors. The ferry skimmed about 1 meter (3 feet) above the water and covered 15 kilometers (9 miles) to reach Stockholm’s City Hall in just 30 minutes. The morning commute on the regular diesel-powered ferry line takes 45 minutes without stops. 'We are doing this to show the way in the green transition at sea,' said Gustav Hemming, the city councilor in charge of climate and infrastructure. The aim of the nine-month pilot project was to 'make more people park their cars and buy a (public transportation) card instead.' Gustav Hasselskog, chief executive of the electric boat manufacturer Candela, called it 'a paradigm shift for urban transport and a revival of our waterways.' He said the Nova was the first of Candela’s new P-12 model to enter service. Its computer-controlled hydrofoil wings lift the hull above water, reducing energy consumption by 80% compared to conventional vessels by cutting water friction. 'Conventional ships haven’t evolved much in 100 years and are among the least energy-efficient transport modes, only rivaled by a battle tank,' Hasselskog said in a statement. As of Tuesday, the Nova becomes part of the ferry fleet operated by Stockholm’s public transport provider SL. The vessel is designed to carry 25 passengers, including one wheelchair space. There are speed limits on part of the route but on open water there is no restriction. The hydrofoil has a cruising speed of around 25 knots (46 kph or 29 mph) and can reach a maximum speed of 30 knots (56 kph or 35 mph) — considerably faster than other electric passenger ferries. It achieves this with carbon fiber hydrofoil wings that lift the boat out of the water, reducing drag. An added benefit is that the vessel is exempt from the 12-knot speed limit in Stockholm because it leaves no wake — waves made by a boat’s displacement through water that increase with speed and could swamp other vessels or erode the shoreline. Candela says its technology reduces the energy per passenger-kilometer by 95% compared with the diesel ferries in the picturesque Stockholm archipelago. The vessel can operate in waves of up 2 meters (6.5 feet). Candela hopes that as well as Stockholm, cities like San Francisco, New York and Venice will lead the electrification of waterborne public transport. Stockholm has approximately 70 public transport vessels which use fossil fuels. There were around 6.2 million public transport boat journeys in the Stockholm region in 2022, and while boat traffic remains a small part of the entire public transit system, it is the fastest-growing mode of public transport after the COVID-19 pandemic.	https://apnews.com/article/stockholm-electric-ferry-archipelago-sweden-clean-energy-e2b39de682f97e657538c61999c8291a	2024-10-29T08:04:14-07:00	
Election 2024 Latest: With 1 week to go, Harris heads to Washington and Trump stumps in Pennsylvania	Vice President Kamala Harris will deliver her campaign’s 'closing argument' Tuesday from the same spot in Washington where former President Donald Trump helped incite a mob that attacked the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. One week out from Election Day, Harris’ address from the grassy Ellipse near the White House is designed to encourage Americans to visualize their alternate futures if she or Trump takes over the Oval Office in less than three months. Trump opened his remarks to reporters at Mar-a-Lago Tuesday morning by saying Harris is running on a 'campaign of destruction' and 'of absolute hate,' accusing her team of 'perhaps even trying to destroy our country.' He will head to Pennsylvania later in the day for a Building America's Future event in Drexel and a rally Tuesday night in Allentown. Follow the AP’s Election 2024 coverage at: https://apnews.com/hub/election-2024. Here’s the latest: What is The Ellipse? The Ellipse, where Vice President Kamala Harris will deliver her closing message against former President Donald Trump, is a grassy park between the White House and the Washington Monument in Washington, D.C. The area, which is administered by the National Park Service, has long played host to a range of political events and national traditions. Most recently, it was where then-President Trump delivered a lie-filled speech on Jan. 6, 2021, shortly before hundreds stormed the U.S. Capitol as Congress met to certify to 2020 election. While the White House is often the backdrop for events on the Ellipse, expressly political events are allowed in the park, unlike at the White House. The park was first developed in the 1850s and was part of landscape architect Pierre Charles L’Enfant’s plans for the nation’s capital. However, its development was cut short by a lack of funds and the Civil War, according to the National Park Service. During the conflict, soldiers were housed on the site, and the area had also been used as horse pens, a slaughterhouse and a trash dump, according to the Park Service. Harris’ closing argument against Trump is far from her final event Vice President Kamala Harris will deliver what her campaign is touting as her closing argument against former President Donald Trump on Tuesday in Washington, D.C. But the event, a large gathering on the Ellipse park just south of the White House, will be far from her last rally. Harris is slated to crisscross the country in the final days of the campaign, hitting all key battleground states as she makes her last pitch to voters. Harris’ campaign has crafted the Tuesday event as both a physical and rhetorical counter to Trump. She will urge voters to 'turn the page' toward a new era and away from Trump, lambasting both the kind of rhetoric Trump has used and what it would mean to give him four more years as president. Physically, Harris will be standing in the same park where Trump delivered a lie-filled speech on Jan. 6, 2021, shortly before hundreds stormed the Capitol as Congress met to certify to 2020 election. ‘We are on track to win a very close election,’ Harris campaign chair says Harris’ campaign chair says early voting returns in key states suggest the vice president’s supporters are turning out in numbers she needs to win. In an online video running nearly three and a half minutes, Jen O’Malley Dillon says a lot of Republican-leaning voters were voting early in strong numbers as well — but those tended to be folks who would have otherwise voted on Election Day. By contrast, she said, the Harris campaign believes low-propensity voters are breaking for the vice president. O’Malley Dillion said the campaign’s polling shows that late-breaking undecided voters 'are more open to supporting' Harris if they find out 'more information' about her in the campaign’s closing days. 'It’s OK to be worried,' before Election Day, she said, but added, 'We are on track to win a very close election.' ‘This truly is a margin of error race’ Harris campaign chair Jen O’Malley Dillon has released a video telling supporters, 'Why you don’t have to feel anxious and you can feel good' about next week’s election. As the campaign has been arguing for months, O’Malley Dillon says Harris has 'multiple pathways' to get to the 270 electoral votes needed to clinch the White House. She said seven states remain in play — the 'blue wall' of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, as well as Georgia, North Carolina, Arizona and Nevada. O’Malley Dillon said that, rather than conceding any of those, as sometimes happens late in races, Harris is still campaigning hard in all of them because 'this truly is a margin of error race.' Hundreds of Miami-Dade County ballots were found on the side of the road The elections department in Florida’s largest county confirmed Tuesday that a sealed bin and a sealed bag had been found by a driver and the ballots inside had already been scanned and tabulated at an early voting site on Monday, according to reporting by the Miami Herald. A county employee forgot to lock the back of a truck and the containers fell out when they drove off, according to county elections supervisor Christina White, who said election workers confirmed nothing was damaged or tampered with. A video posted by the popular South Florida social media account Only in Dade shows a passing driver apparently stopping to pick up the containers labeled with county barcodes and drive them to a police station. The employee driving the truck has since been fired. Harris campaign takes over Las Vegas’ Sphere to help get out the vote The vice president’s team says her campaign is the first to advertise on the entertainment venue, which opened in 2023. The exterior of the Sphere features a rotating series of messages encouraging people to vote for Harris and running mate Tim Walz by Election Day, Nov. 5. The messages include her slogan, 'When we fight, we win,' and other phrases. Nevada is among the handful of battleground states that the Democrat and Republican rival Donald Trump are trying hard to win. Harris’ team says the Sphere advertising is a 'critical piece' of their efforts in Nevada, which also include taking over the homepages of top newspapers and mobile billboards in Reno, Carson City and Las Vegas. Harris is scheduled to campaign in Reno and Las Vegas on Thursday. Trump on his Madison Square Garden rally: ‘There’s never been an event so beautiful’ While he didn’t mention a comedian’s controversial remarks about Puerto Rico, Trump expounded at length about his Madison Square Garden rally, which he called a 'lovefest,' a term he has also used to reference the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol. At Mar-a-Lago on Tuesday, Trump noted 'there’s never been an event so beautiful' as the Sunday night rally in his hometown of New York City. Trump called it 'terrible to say,' as some of his critics have pointed out, that the same arena was host to a gathering of Nazis in 1939. More than 20,000 people attended a Feb. 20, 1939 rally at the Garden organized by the German American Bund, a pro-Nazi group that hung swastikas alongside a huge portrait of George Washington. Several of the speakers on Sunday referenced that event, including former professional wrestler Hulk Hogan, who said, 'I don’t see no stinkin’ Nazis in here.' 'Nobody’s ever had love like that,' Trump said of the hourslong Sunday event that featured speakers including some of his children, wife Melania and high-level surrogates and supporters including TV psychologist Dr. Phil McGraw and former Fox News host Tucker Carlson. 'It was really love for our country.' Trump wraps his remarks without referencing comments of a comedian at his New York rally Trump has yet to address the controversy, also not mentioning it during his appearances in Georgia on Monday. On Tuesday, he did reference the event overall, calling it 'an absolute lovefest' in his hometown. Comedian Tony Hinchcliffe called Puerto Rico a 'floating island of garbage' during the Sunday event at Madison Square Garden. His remark has drawn wide condemnation and highlighted the rising power of a key Latino group in the swing state of Pennsylvania. He also made demeaning jokes about Black people, other Latinos, Palestinians and Jews during his routine before Trump’s appearance. The Harris campaign has released an ad that will run online in battleground states targeting Puerto Rican voters and highlighting the comedian’s remarks. The comments landed Harris a show of support from Puerto Rican music star Bad Bunny and prompted reactions from Republicans in Florida and Puerto Rico. Head of Puerto Rico’s Republican Party calls Hinchcliffe remarks ‘totally reprehensible’ The president of Puerto Rico’s Republican Party, Ángel Cintrón, rejected the comments of a comedian at a Trump rally in New York where he called the U.S. territory 'a floating island of garbage.' Cintrón said the 'poor attempt at comedy' by Tony Hinchcliffe on Sunday was 'disgraceful, ignorant and totally reprehensible.' 'There is no room for absurd and racist comments like that. They do not represent the conservative values of republicanism anywhere in our nation,' Cintrón said in a statement. He noted that there are 3 million U.S. citizens in Puerto Rico and nearly 6 million in the U.S. mainland. 'Whether we are Republicans or Democrats, we are American and Puerto Rican citizens proud of our roots and incalculable contributions to American democracy for more than one hundred years,' Cintrón said. Harris will have to ‘get herself a job someplace,’ Trump says A week away from the end of voting in the general election, Trump is reflecting on his presidential run, saying, 'We’ve had a great campaign' and predicting that Harris will have to go home and 'get herself a job someplace, who knows.' Trump is featuring speakers who say they were harmed by policies under Harris’ time in office Tammy Nobles talked about the death of her daughter, saying the perpetrator was an MS-13 gang member in the country illegally. Michael Koppy, owner of Go Green Dry Cleaners, talked about how he has had to help other small businesses unable to keep up with inflation and rising costs. Christy Shamblin, whose daughter-in-law Marine Sgt. Nicole Gee was killed during the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan, said Donald Trump 'demonstrates peace through strength.' Trump: Anything positive about the economy during Harris’ time in office was ‘fake’ Saying that the economy under Harris’ time in office has caused destruction, Trump said that any boon was 'fake.' He then cited 'one of the most respected people on Wall Street' as saying that 'the economy is only good' because 'people think Trump is going to get elected.' Trump says he would create ‘compensation fund’ for the ‘victims of migrant crime’ As he has many times along the campaign trail, Trump is decrying federal authorities for dropping plane-loads of migrants 'all over the Midwest,' mentioning Aurora, Colorado, and Springfield, Ohio. Saying he was announcing the intent 'for the first time,' Trump said that as president he would be 'seizing the assets of the criminal gangs and drug cartels,' and using those assets 'to create a compensation fund to provide restitution for the victims of migrant crime.' Trump calls immigration reform ‘the single biggest issue’ for his campaign Immigration reform — and blaming Democrats for issues caused by an influx of immigrants across the U.S.-Mexico border — has long been Trump’s signature campaign issue, and a week out from Election Day, he is sticking to that. Saying that 'we talk about inflation and the economy,' Trump added, 'To me, there’s nothing more important than the fabric of our country being destroyed,' calling the border 'the single biggest issue.' Trump plays video featuring mother of 12-year-old found dead in Texas Trump is playing a video featuring comments from the mother of Jocelyn Nungaray, a 12-year-old Texas girl who was found dead in a creek not far from her home. Police charged two Venezuelan men who had entered the U.S. illegally with the girl’s murder. Alexis Nungaray said that her daughter is 'six feet in the ground based off of' Harris’ decisions and called for Trump’s reelection. Trump alleges Harris ‘keeps talking about Hitler and Nazis because her record is horrible’ Trump accused Harris of not caring about the impact of her actions in what he called her 'campaign of absolute hate,' saying that she intends to 'keep this misery going, and she’s going to keep it going for as long as she can.' Trump alleged that Harris 'keeps talking about Hitler and Nazis because her record is horrible.' Trump said that the 'three great people' on stage with him would share their own stories about 'how their lives have been shattered' by Harris’ policies. Trump says he is ‘running on a plan to save America’ The GOP nominee said his Democratic rival, now Harris, is running on a 'campaign of destruction' and 'of absolute hate,' accusing her team of 'perhaps even trying to destroy our country.' Trump again said Democrats 'stole the presidency of the United States' by ousting Biden from their ticket this year. As he spoke, Trump was flanked on stage by three people, none of whom he has identified thus far. Trump has arrived at his Mar-a-Lago event Supporters cheered his name and raised cellphones in the air as he walked into the room, exactly one week before Election Day. Two days ahead of Halloween, the former president walked out just after the playing of Michael Jackson’s 'Thriller,' which has become a staple at many of his campaign rallies. Trump began his remarks by saying that things are 'going very well' but noted some 'bad spots in Pennsylvania where some serious things have been caught or are in the process of being caught.' Reading from paper on the podium in front of him, Trump began by criticizing Kamala Harris, saying she 'has obliterated our borders' and has 'caused so much destruction and death at home and abroad.' Musk’s pro-Trump super PAC uses vulgarity demeaning women to describe Harris as a ‘communist’ Elon Musk’s super political action committee created an ad attacking Vice President Kamala Harris that includes multiple references to a vulgarity often used to demean women before calling her a 'communist.' The 35-second video from America PAC begins with a warning that it 'contains multiple instances of the C-word.' Calling Harris 'a big ole C-word,' a narrator describes the Democratic nominee as a 'tax-hiking, regulation-loving, gun-grabbing communist,' over images of her, as well as an illustration of a cat in a Soviet-style military uniform. Musk endorsed Trump earlier this year and has appeared both at his rallies and at his own pro-Trump events throughout the battleground state of Pennsylvania. Both Musk and Trump have repeatedly referenced Harris as 'Comrade Kamala,' implying that as president she would seek to implement socialist policies in the U.S. The post is getting attention as Trump and his allies use increasingly inflammatory language in the final stretch of the campaign. Trump has repeatedly ridiculed Harris, at one point calling her 'mentally impaired.' He has referred to CNN’s Anderson Cooper with a woman’s name, evoking the trope of gay men as effeminate. A Trump rally at Madison Square Garden on Sunday featured multiple crude and racist jokes, including one from comedian Tony Hinchcliffe who called Puerto Rico a 'floating island of garbage.' A spokesperson for the PAC declined to comment on the video. Puerto Rico’s archbishop calls on Trump to disavow comedian’s rally comments SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico — The archbishop of Puerto Rico, Roberto O. González Nieves, has joined a long list of Puerto Ricans decrying the comments a comedian made at a Donald Trump rally on Sunday that disparaged the island. González said in a letter that he was 'dismayed and appalled' after hearing Tony Hinchcliffe say, 'I don’t know if you guys know this, but there’s literally a floating island of garbage in the middle of the ocean right now. I think it’s called Puerto Rico.' González called on Trump to disavow the comments, saying it was insufficient that his campaign issued a brief apology. 'It is important that you, personally, apologize for these comments,' González wrote. The archbishop said that while he enjoys a good joke, humor has its limits. 'It should not insult or denigrate the dignity and sacredness of people,' he wrote. 'These kinds of remarks should not be a part of the political discourse of a civilized society.' Trump’s event at Mar-a-Lago has gotten underway with operatic and Broadway musical selections Dozens of supporters, many clad in pro-Trump gear, stood near their seats and craned their necks to see if the GOP nominee and former president were about to enter an ornate Mar-a-Lago room set up for his remarks. Several American flags and a screen with the words, 'TRUMP WILL FIX IT!' were set up along the platform from which Trump was expected to speak. ‘We have to forgive and let it go,’ Trump supporter says Madison Square Garden rally remarks A supporter of Trump who attended his event at Mar-a-Lago and heads the Republican Latino Club of Palm Beach said in Spanish it was important to clarify that the former president was not the one who made the crude comments about Puerto Rico. 'He is a comedian. He tries to be funny and says a lot of nonsense. The man is dumb. He has no clue about Puerto Rico and doesn’t know our culture. He screwed up. We have to forgive and let it go,' said Lydia Maldonado, who is Puerto Rican. 'Our economy needs a change. Enough of this.' The Allentown School District is closed ahead of Trump’s Pennsylvania visit The district said in a statement that schools will be closed 'out of an abundance of caution' since the rally is 'expected to bring large crowds, heavy traffic and potential disruptions that may impact the safety and security of our students and staff.' Trump is due to speak at the PPL Center in downtown Allentown at 7 p.m. ET. Podcast host Joe Rogan polls listeners on a potential interview with Harris In a post on the social platform X, Rogan says the Democrat’s campaign offered a date for Tuesday for an hourlong conversation, but that he would have had to meet her on the road. Rogan said he feels strongly that the conversation is best when done in his studio in Austin, Texas. He headlined the post: '!! Austin TX podcast or let her walk. Thoughts?' Asked for comment, a Harris campaign official said they were willing to sit down with Rogan when Harris was in Texas last week, but Rogan couldn’t accommodate. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the campaign’s internal deliberations, said Rogan was offered the option of joining Harris on the road but that Rogan has insisted that the conversation be taped in Austin. Trump sat down with Rogan for three hours last Friday in Texas. Harris aide says Washington speech will focus on the ‘clear choice voters are facing this election’ Vice President Kamala Harris, who spent years working as a prosecutor, has spent her campaign for president laying out the case to voters for why she should be elected, a top aide said Tuesday. Cedric Richmond says over the past three months Harris has given her opening statement and laid out evidence and the facts for voters. On Tuesday, she’ll deliver a speech meant to sum it all up. 'She’ll make her closing argument directly to the American people — or the jury — and that’s who’s going to decide the outcome of this election,' he said. 'And that’s how it should be.' Richmond says the speech will be about the 'clear choice voters are facing this election between Trump and his obsession with himself versus her new generation of leadership that is focused on the American people.' Harris to focus on what her generation of leadership ‘really means’ in Washington speech Vice President Kamala Harris chose the area near the White House and Washington Monument to speak on Tuesday because 'it’s a reminder of the gravity of the job,' her campaign chairwoman says. Campaign leader Jen O’Malley Dillon says the location, where Donald Trump helped incite a violent mob on Jan. 6, 2021, is a visual reminder of how much a president can do for good — or for ill. It’s a 'stark visualization of probably the most infamous example of Donald Trump and how he’s used his power for bad,' she said. But Harris won’t spend a lot of time rehashing the violence of that day or recounting Trump’s continued efforts to lie about the election and sow doubt over voting. O’Malley Dillon says Harris will focus on talking about what her generation of leadership 'really means,' and how much she will work to shape the country and impact people’s lives for the better. Harris to sit for interviews in Detroit, Milwaukee, Philadelphia and elsewhere on Tuesday Vice President Kamala Harris is doing five interviews Tuesday, including one with a Spanish-language radio in Pennsylvania aimed at Latino voters, in particular Puerto Ricans. The interviews come after a comic at Donald Trump’s rally on Sunday made racist and vile jokes that singled out Puerto Ricans among other groups. Trump did not denounce the racist jokes. But he claimed he didn’t know the comic who gave a live performance at the venue before the Republican nominee took the stage. Harris is also doing interviews in Detroit, Milwaukee, Philadelphia and Pittsburgh. That’s before she gives a speech in Washington later Tuesday where she’ll lay out her closing arguments. ‘I don’t know him,’ Trump says of comedian from New York rally without denouncing his remarks Donald Trump said he doesn’t know the comic who made racist and vile jokes at his big Madison Square Garden rally. But he’s not denouncing the comments either. 'I don’t know him, someone put him up there. I don’t know who he is,' Trump told ABC News in an interview Tuesday ahead of his remarks at Mar-a-Lago, according to the network. The comedian, Tony Hinchcliffe, had told a series of raunchy and crude jokes, including calling Puerto Rico an 'island of floating garbage.' The comments have drawn outrage from Puerto Rican leaders with just a week to go before the election. In the interview, Trump also insisted he hadn’t heard Hinchcliffe’s comments, according to ABC. But, 'When asked what he made of them, he did not take the opportunity to denounce them, repeating that he didn’t hear the comments.' Trump supporters are gathering near the entrance of Mar-a-Lago’s main ballroom The former president has arrived at his private club and residence in Palm Beach, Florida. He is set to meet with reporters at 10 a.m. ET. It is unclear whether the Republican will take questions. Harris calls Los Angeles Times and Washington Post decisions not to endorse in the presidential race ‘disappointing’ The Democratic presidential nominee commented during an interview with Charlamagne tha God, DJ Envy, and Loren LoRosa for 'The Breakfast Club' that aired Tuesday morning. Both newspapers announced last week that they will not make endorsements in the presidential contest between Harris and Republican Donald Trump. Harris sought to tie the decisions to billionaires in 'Donald Trump’s club.' Both publications are owned by wealthy executives, Jeff Bezos at the Post and Patrick Soon-Shiong at the Times. Arab American voters make their choice — Harris, Trump or neither — in the election’s final days DEARBORN, Mich. — Bowls of labneh and platters of za’atar bread covered the tables in a Lebanese restaurant near Detroit, yet no one seemed to have much of an appetite. On one side were Kamala Harris ’ top emissaries to the Arab American community. On the other were local leaders who were explaining — once again — why many in the community couldn’t vote for the vice president because of the war in Gaza. 'I love this country, but I’ll tell you, we have never been so disappointed in this country as we are now,' said Nabih H. Ayad, chairman of the Arab American Civil Rights League. 'We wanted to give the Democratic Party the opportunity to do something, and they haven’t.' 'The one line we can’t cross,' Ayad said, 'is genocide.' ▶ Read more on what Arab Americans are saying about the election GOP works to turn out pro-Trump Jewish voters in swing states to trim Democrats’ edge WEST BLOOMFIELD, Mich. — Rachel Weinberg calls herself a religious Jew first, then a proud American. She said she has only one choice for president: Donald Trump. 'I don’t like everything he says,' the 72-year-old retired preschool teacher from Michigan said after volunteer canvassers for the Republican Jewish Coalition knocked on her door Sunday. 'But I vote for Israel. It is our life. I support Israel. Trump supports Israel with his mouth and his actions.' Weinberg’s home in West Bloomfield, in vote-rich Oakland County, was among more than 20 that the Republican Jewish Coalition was visiting that morning. She has voted for Trump in previous elections as well. The door-to-door outreach to Jewish voters with a history of backing Republicans is part of a new effort the group is undertaking this year in five presidential battleground states in hopes of boosting Trump over Democrat Kamala Harris in the Nov. 5 election. ▶ Read more about Republicans' outreach to Jewish voters	https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-kamala-harris-election-2024-4d54837e83d91f1d200f56a6948a96b8	2024-10-29T05:12:01-07:00	
Care for a sweet treat during Mexico's Day of the Dead? Have a bite of 'pan de muerto'	MEXICO CITY (AP) — The first bite is an assault to the senses. A sugary, citric, fluffy delight. 'Pan de muerto' or 'bread of the dead' is baked in Mexico every year, from early October to mid-November, amid Day of the Dead celebrations. Shaped like a bun, decorated with bone-like bread pieces and sugar on top, pan de muerto can be seen at coffee shops, dinner tables or home-made altars, which Mexicans build to remember their deceased loved ones and welcome them back for a night on Nov. 2. Its date of origin can’t be specified, but pan de muerto can be thought of as a fusion of Mesoamerican and Spanish traditions, said Andrés Medina, a researcher at the Anthropological Research Institute of the National Autonomous University of Mexico. Mexicans have remembered the dead with festivities and food for centuries Since pre-Hispanic times, festivities for the dead have existed and skull-shaped products have been made. But in the 1500s, when the Spaniards arrived, new elements such as sugar and bread were incorporated into Indigenous offerings. Those early celebrations, Medina said, coincided with the crop season, which provides pan de muerto a spiritual, symbolic meaning. If its decorations resemble bones, it’s because Mesoamerican worldviews regarded them as the origin of life. According to an ancient myth, Quetzalcóatl created humankind out of bones. Details vary from one source to another, but soon after the god apparently stole them from the underworld, he fell. And from his blood, the seed of life was born. 'Under this worldview, the human body’s bones, just like the fruit’s insides, are seeds,' Medina said. 'So, in a way, altars are offerings to fertility. And Day of the Dead is a celebration of the life contained in each seed.' Pan de muerto’s shape, ingredients and preparations differ from one Mexican state to another, but is enjoyed all over the country. 100 and counting: One man’s quest to try every variation of 'pan de muerto' In Mexico City, hundreds of bakeries make their own version. Rodrigo Delgado has spent years trying to taste them all. For fun, he challenges himself to try as many as possible and review them on his Instagram account. On his first quest, a decade ago, he tried 15. In 2023, he had a bite of 100. This year, he expects to taste at least 110. 'I like pan de muerto because of what it means during Day of the Dead season,' said Delgado, who also reviews local restaurants on his blog, Godínez Gourmet. 'The mix of flavors of the bread, as much as its texture, are very comforting.' He can’t remember the first time he tried pan de muerto, but he treasures the memories of his mother baking it at home. He and his brother used to knead the dough, he said, and shape the bone-like decorations of its top. Baking pan de muerto is not an easy task. At Panadería Dos Veinte, in Mexico City's San Rafael neighborhood, owner Manu Tovar said that having these sweet buns ready for sale takes three days of work: one to extract the infusions that will provide the bread with its flavor, another to incorporate them into the dough and one more day to knead and shape the buns. There’s no secret in his recipe, Tovar said. The ingredients — although seasonal — are simple: orange blossom, tangerine zest, anise and butter. His special touch, what makes his bread unique, is the sourdough. 'It’s an ancestral process,' Tovar said. 'A millenary way to make bread.' The sourdough that he and four assistants use is 20 years old. He incorporates water and flour daily, to keep it alive, and mixes part of it with new dough. This gives the bread a better taste, he said, and makes it easier to digest. Pan de muertos' seasonal flavors help make it special For years, said Tovar, he resisted the temptation of baking pan de muerto in early October. The quality of the ingredients improves as November gets closer, but customers kept asking when the buns would be ready, so he caved. This season, aside from baking 90 pan de muertos per day, he came up with two new creations: a croissant roll filled with marigold cream and a bun — locally known as 'concha' — shaped like a marigold flower and prepared with tangerine instead of vanilla or chocolate. 'If you bake it in a traditional way, you can only have pan de muerto now, because that’s when the fruit is available,' Tovar said. 'That’s what I think makes it so special.' The ambience of the Day of the Dead season, he added, also plays a role. Nightfall comes earlier during this time of year and there’s certain mysticism, a particular feeling in the air. 'It probably has to do with the melancholy of what this festivity means,' he said. 'For one day a year, you can feel closer to those who are no longer with you.' ____ Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

Duterte’s jarring testimony into drug killings in Philippines relives a nightmare for many	MANILA, Philippines (AP) — The cockiness, expletives and threats unleashed by former President Rodrigo Duterte in a Senate inquiry brought back the nightmare of the bloody 'war on drugs' for many families of the thousands of victims who were gunned down under his rule. Speaking under oath in Monday's televised hearing into the killings, a defiantly combative Duterte returned to the national spotlight for the first time since leaving office in 2022 with little show of remorse. He got away with it again, critics say. 'If I’m given another chance, I’ll wipe all of you,' Duterte, 79, who is seeking a new term as mayor of his southern home city of Davao next year, said of drug dealers and criminals. Duterte again denied that he authorized extrajudicial killings of drug suspects, saying there were no 'state-sponsored killings.' But he acknowledged that as mayor of Davao, before becoming president, he kept a small ' death squad ' of gangsters whom he had ordered to eliminate other criminals. Duterte's profanity-laced outbursts scared Randy delos Santos, who was invited by the Senate to speak about the killing of his nephew, Kian, by police under Duterte’s 'war on drugs.' It felt, he said, like a nightmare had returned. 'I had this frightening feeling that thousands of innocent people may be gunned down again,' delos Santos told The Associated Press on Tuesday. 'I was wondering why he was allowed to speak with disrespect and given a stage to vent his past excuses.' Duterte has upended politics in Philippines The thousands of killings — which human rights groups estimate could exceed 20,000 — under Duterte's administration 2016-2022 were unprecedented in recent Philippine history and triggered an International Criminal Court investigation as a possible crime against humanity. They have also become a delicate fault line in the increasingly hostile rivalry between Duterte and his children, including Vice President Sara Duterte, and President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. They had a bitter political fallout over key issues. While Duterte had nurtured cozy ties with Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian leader Vladimir Putin, Marcos has broadened defense and military relations with the United States and its Western allies. 'It’s unfortunate that drug-related crimes are on the rise again. Everyday you can read about children being raped, people getting killed and robbed and just recently a drug den was raided within the Malacanang complex,' Duterte said, referring to the presidential palace in Manila. 'Purveyors of this menace are back in business.' Duterte has previously accused Marcos of being a drug addict and weak leader. Marcos had retorted that Duterte was a user of fentanyl, a painkiller and powerful opioid. Looking frail and misstating his age as 73 at one point, the daylong Senate hearing also served as the latest reality check on the political restraints that Duterte and his family face after he relinquished his grip on power. Duterte was one of Asia’s most unorthodox leaders and carved a controversial political name for his deadly campaign against criminality, expletives-laced outbursts and disdain for human rights and the West. He once called the pope a 'son of a bitch' for setting off a monstrous traffic jam during a Manila visit and told then-President Barack Obama to 'go to hell' for criticizing his brutal anti-drugs crackdown. Duterte’s profanities became a trademark of his political persona and some regarded him as Asia’s Trump. During a heated exchange on Monday, Duterte raised his voice at Sen. Risa Hontiveros, a staunch human rights activist, who said that his campaign had killed 122 children, including a baby. Hontiveros asked the chairman overseeing the hearing to restrain the increasingly volatile Duterte, who rambled on as she spoke. He later stopped and apologized. 'You’re trying to pin me down on semantics,' Duterte blurted out at Hontiveros, who shot back: 'You’re pinned by your own words.' 'You were never a mayor, prosecutor … I was a prosecutor, mayor, president and I know my job. You should talk like, `Son of a bitch, you stop, or I will kill you,’' Duterte told the senators. The killings left deep scars A Roman Catholic priest, the Rev. Flavie Villanueva, showed during the hearing a list of more than 300 victims, many of them breadwinners of poor families, who were killed under Duterte’s crackdown. A roll of white paper with the victims’ names that the priest unfurled was so long it touched the carpeted floor. Former Sen. Leila de Lima, one of the most vocal critics of Duterte who was arrested and detained for years during his presidency, confronted him during the hearing. The drug charges against her, she said, were fabricated by Duterte and his officials to stop her investigation of the drug killings. She was cleared of the charges and freed last year. 'This man … for so long has evaded justice and accountability,' de Lima said of Duterte, who sat near her. Sen. Jinggoy Estrada asked why de Lima failed to file any criminal complaint against Duterte for so long. Witnesses against Duterte, she said, were afraid to come out during his presidency when larges-cale killings were unfolding. 'There was an atmosphere of fear, a culture of fear and impunity,' she said. 'I hope many more will come out now.'	https://apnews.com/article/philippines-duterte-drug-killings-testimony-448d440e057506e5a9cbe615372ccd45	2024-10-29T02:18:09-07:00	
Germany recalls ambassador from Iran as it protests the execution of an Iranian German prisoner	BERLIN (AP) — Germany protested to Iran on Tuesday over the execution of Iranian German prisoner Jamshid Sharmahd, who lived in the U.S. and was kidnapped in Dubai in 2020 by Iranian security forces, and recalled its ambassador to Berlin for consultations. The Foreign Ministry wrote on the social network X that Iran's charge d'affaires in Berlin was summoned to hear 'our sharp protest' against Tehran's action and added that it reserves the right to take 'further measures.' It didn't elaborate. At the same time, German Ambassador Markus Potzel 'protested in the strongest terms against the murder of Jamshid Sharmahd' to the Iranian foreign minister, it said. German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock then recalled him to Berlin for consultations. Sharmahd, 69, was put to death in Iran on Monday on terrorism charges, the country’s judiciary said. That followed a 2023 trial that Germany, the U.S. and international rights groups dismissed as a sham. He was one of several Iranian dissidents abroad in recent years either tricked or kidnapped back to Iran as Tehran began lashing out after the collapse of its 2015 nuclear deal with world powers including Germany. Iran accused Sharmahd, who lived in Glendora, California, of planning a 2008 attack on a mosque that killed 14 people — including five women and a child — and wounded over 200 others, as well as plotting other assaults through the little-known Kingdom Assembly of Iran and its Tondar militant wing. Iran also accused Sharmahd of 'disclosing classified information' on missile sites of Iran’s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard during a television program in 2017. His family disputed the allegations and had worked for years to see him freed. Sharmahd had been in Dubai in 2020, trying to travel to India for a business deal involving his software company. He hoped to get a connecting flight despite the coronavirus pandemic disrupting global travel. Sharmahd’s family received their last message from him on July 28, 2020. It’s unclear how the abduction happened. But tracking data showed that Sharmahd’s mobile phone traveled south from Dubai to the city of Al Ain on July 29, crossing the border into Oman. On July 30, tracking data showed the mobile phone traveled to the Omani port city of Sohar, where the signal stopped. Two days later, Iran announced it had captured Sharmahd in a 'complex operation.' The Intelligence Ministry published a photograph of him blindfolded. Germany expelled two Iranian diplomats in 2023 over Sharmahd’s death sentence.	https://apnews.com/article/germany-iran-sharmahd-execution-protest-ambassador-ac9afe1d2b1a5949f0b578c69763a6b8	2024-10-29T01:53:46-07:00	
Russia's embassy in Pakistan says it is verifying reports that one of its citizens was abducted	ISLAMABAD (AP) — Russia's embassy in Pakistan said Tuesday it is attempting to verify reports that one of its citizens was abducted in the South Asian nation's troubled northwest. The embassy provided no further details in a post on the social media platform X. The announcement by the embassy came days after a small militant group headed by commander Gul Bahadur said it captured a Russian national in Dera Ismail Khan, a district in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. The group released a photo showing a man sitting with two bearded men. Local police said they have not been approached by the Russian Embassy about the reported abduction. Insurgents often attack Pakistani security forces and foreigners, especially Chinese working on Chinese-funded projects across the country, but Russians have not previously been targeted. Most Russians who travel to Pakistan are climbers who scale mountains in the scenic north.	https://apnews.com/article/pakistan-russia-abduction-northwest-f5900ab5b0bdca5889af0af5d88b89c2	2024-10-29T01:31:57-07:00	
Russia strikes Ukraine's 2 biggest cities in its latest barrage, officials say	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Russian drones, missiles and bombs smashed into Kyiv and Kharkiv, Ukraine’s biggest cities, in nighttime attacks, killing four people and wounding 15 in a continuing aerial onslaught, authorities said Tuesday. Russia has bombarded civilian areas of Ukraine almost daily since its full-scale invasion of its neighbor almost three years ago, causing thousands of casualties. The Russian army is also pushing hard against front-line defenses in the eastern Donetsk region of Ukraine. In another worrying development for Kyiv officials, Western countries say North Korea has sent some 10,000 soldiers to help Russia’s military campaign. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was expected to speak about that new threat at a meeting Tuesday in Reykjavik with the leaders of Denmark, Iceland, Finland, Norway and Sweden. A Russian aerial attack struck Kharkiv, in Ukraine’s northeast, at around 3 a.m., hitting a house and killing four people, regional Gov. Oleh Syniehubov said. Nearly 20 houses were damaged in the attack, he said. Several hours earlier, Russia dropped a glide bomb on the landmark Derzhprom building in Kharkiv city center, injuring seven people, Mayor Ihor Terekhov said. Derzhprom, also known as the Palace of Industry, is included in UNESCO’s World Heritage List as an example of modernist architecture. Terekhov said that Russia has concentrated attacks on Kharkiv in recent days. He urged people not to ignore air raid warnings. Authorities in Kyiv said debris from intercepted Russian drones fell on two city districts, injuring six people. Ukraine has also used long-range drones to disrupt Russia’s war machine and embarrass the Kremlin by striking targets on Russian soil. A special forces academy in the Russian province of Chechnya was hit by drones, causing a fire that was quickly extinguished, according to Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov, who is close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin. It was the first drone attack of the war on Chechnya, which lies about 800 kilometers (500 miles) east of Ukraine.	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-attacks-zelenskyy-north-korea-1b327a2d85d4ce9faf321dd27992f568	2024-10-29T01:27:18-07:00	
AP PHOTOS: River and air pollution in India's capital pose a severe health threat to residents	NEW DELHI (AP) — One of India’s most sacred rivers, the Yamuna in New Delhi, is covered with white toxic foam, with vast sections frothing as a result of pollutants discharged from industries around the city. The pollution poses a severe health threat to residents since the river provides more than half of the Indian capital's water. New Delhi also has some of the world’s most polluted air every year, and the current festival season is exacerbating the situation. On Tuesday, the air-quality index deteriorated to 'a very poor' reading of 273, 18 times more than the World Health Organization’s quality guidelines. The tiny PM 2.5 particulate matter can enter deep into the lungs and cause diseases. Still, Hindu devotees have not given up their religious practices at the Yamuna. On Tuesday morning, a young couple was among a group that visited the river bank, had a dip, and then left. Jasraj, a 70-year-old retired government clerk, said he has been visiting the river for a bathing ritual since 1980. 'I worship the river as a mother, and there is no question of its being clean or dirty. It's dirty on the surface but clean below the top,' said Jasraj, who uses one name. Imran Khan, a student, said one can't breathe properly in Delhi's polluted air. 'People are here for jogging, and they are facing problems, too. Our environment should be cleaner,' he said. Shishupal Kumar, a contract worker, said people visit the river from far-off places to perform religious rituals. 'The river has become completely dirty. It is full of chemicals. It looks like snowfall has happened here, like it happens on mountains,' Kumar said. The 1,376-kilometer (855-mile) Yamuna is one of the holiest rivers for Hindus. It is also among the most polluted in the world. Dangerously unhealthy waterways are a concern for many, especially with pollution expected to worsen during the upcoming Chhath Puja, a Hindu festival. The river has become dirtier over the years as sewage, farm pesticides and industrial effluents flow into the waterway despite laws against polluting and authorities setting up dozens of sewage treatment plants. The New Delhi government said officials were using defoamers to tackle the problem. Authorities have deployed dozens of motorboats to disperse the toxic foam and erected bamboo barricades to keep people away from the river banks. The officials worry that thousands of Hindu devotees next month will stand knee-deep in its frothy, toxic waters, sometimes even immersing themselves in a holy dip to mark Chhath Puja. Winters, in particular, have become a time of health woes in India’s capital, which is home to more than 20 million people. The city during winter is covered with a toxic haze that obscures the sky. Pollution levels soar as millions of Hindus celebrate 'Diwali,' the festival of light, amid emissions from massive firecrackers. Diwali will be celebrated on Thursday. Farmers in neighboring agricultural regions also set fire to their land after harvests to clear it for the next crop season. India's Supreme Court earlier this month slammed northern Indian states for not taking stricter action against people burning crop residues ahead of the winter season and aggravating the region's air pollution. Authorities each year shut construction sites, restrict diesel-run vehicles and deploy water sprinklers and anti-smog guns to control the haze and smog enveloping the skyline of the capital region. ___ Videojournalist Piyush Nagpal contributed to this report from New Delhi.	https://apnews.com/article/india-river-air-pollution-6c0a891de6fd1ce35c5689831b9220bc	2024-10-29T00:56:25-07:00	
Middle East latest: Hezbollah chooses new leader and vows to continue 'until victory'	Lebanon’s Hezbollah has chosen Sheikh Naim Kassem to succeed longtime leader Hassan Nasrallah, who was killed in an Israeli airstrike last month, as the militant group vowed Tuesday to continue 'until victory is achieved.' Kassem, 71, who had been Nasrallah’s deputy leader for over three decades, was elected the new secretary-general of Hezbollah by its decision-making Shura Council, the group said in a statement. Lebanon’s Health Ministry reported that more than 2,700 people had been killed and nearly 12,600 wounded since Oct. 8, 2023, when Hezbollah began firing rockets into Israel, drawing retaliation. Israeli ground forces invaded southern Lebanon at the beginning of October. The death toll from more than a year of the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza has passed 43,000, Palestinian officials reported Monday, without distinguishing between civilians and combatants. The Israel-Hamas war began after Hamas-led militants stormed into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people — mostly civilians — and abducting 250 others. ___ Here’s the latest: Israeli strikes in the Lebanese city of Sidon kill at least one person, state media says BEIRUT — At least one person was killed by two Israeli strikes in Sidon in south Lebanon, marking the second such attack on the historic coastal city since the recent escalation between Hezbollah and Israel, Lebanese state media reported. According to the National News Agency, the strikes hit an area housing displaced people that was adjacent to a Hezbollah complex called Sayyed Shohada, located a few hundred meters from a Lebanese army barracks. Four other people were wounded in the strike. The intended target of the strikes remains unclear and the number of casualties is expected to rise. Earlier Tuesday, the Israeli military had issued evacuation orders for 16 villages in South Lebanon, instructing residents to move north of the Awali River; however there was no warning issued prior to the strikes in Sidon. Rights group criticizes Israeli law to restrict UN agency's aid efforts to Palestinians JERUSALEM – Rights group Amnesty International slammed the Israeli parliament’s decision to restrict operations of the U.N. agency helping Palestinian refugees. 'This unconscionable law is an outright attack on the rights of Palestinian refugees. It is clearly designed to make it impossible for the agency to operate in the occupied Palestinian territory,' Amnesty's secretary-general, Agnès Callamard, said. 'It amounts to the criminalization of humanitarian aid and will worsen an already catastrophic humanitarian crisis.' Callamard said UNRWA plays an indispensable role in providing food, water, medical services, shelter and education in Gaza. She urged the international community to condemn the legislation and press for its repeal. 'This appalling, inhumane law will only exacerbate the suffering of Palestinians, who have endured unimaginable hardship since the horrific attacks by Hamas and other armed groups in southern Israel one year ago, and whose need for global support is greater than ever,' she said. UN agencies warn that Israel's ban on UNRWA would leave big gaps in support for Palestinians GENEVA — Multiple United Nations agencies rallied Tuesday around their fellow organization that provides aid to Palestinian refugees after Israel’s parliament took steps to ban it in the coming months. The World Food Program is deeply concerned about the restrictions, spokeswoman Abeer Etefa said Tuesday when asked whether the WFP might take up the work of UNRWA. 'The World Food Program’s mandate is to deliver food assistance to people in need,' she said. 'WFP cannot replace the equally important critical functions of UNRWA in Gaza, including the running of shelters and health clinics.' Spokesman Tarik Jasarevic of the World Health Organization said 3,000 of UNRWA’s roughly 13,000 staff are health workers. Those health staff have provided more than 6 million medical consultations from its centers over the last year. Activities include immunizations, disease surveillance, and screening for malnutrition, and UNRWA’s work 'couldn’t be matched by any agency — including WHO.' Spokespeople from U.N. agencies for children, health and migration were among those who stressed that UNRWA is the 'backbone' of the world body’s operations in Gaza, Jeremy Laurence, spokesman for the U.N. human rights office, said that 'without UNRWA, the delivery of food, shelter, health care, education, amongst other things, to most of Gaza’s population would grind to a halt.' 'Civilians have already paid the heaviest price of this conflict over the past year,' he said. 'Cruelly, this decision will only make matters worse for them' Hezbollah-Israel conflict threatens Lebanon's fragile economy, report says BEIRUT — Analysis from a humanitarian group working in Lebanon forecasts two scenarios in its report on the Hezbollah-Israel conflict, both predicting a severe economic contraction in Lebanon by early 2025. Mercy Corps’ Lebanon Crisis Analysis Team says Israel’s continued strikes on suspected Hezbollah targets in Lebanon, without blocking key infrastructure, will still bring severe economic and humanitarian risks. Lebanon’s economy could contract by 12.81% , or $2.305 billion by January 2025, with impacts hitting agriculture, manufacturing, and services hard in the South and Bekaa Valley. Agriculture in South Lebanon, which drives 80% of its economy, may come to a halt, while factories face shutdowns, the report says. 'The Bekaa Valley, responsible for 2% of national GDP, will see similar disruptions, with 70% of farmland under threat and many Syrian laborers fleeing,' it adds. The service sector, particularly tourism, stands to lose $1.256 billion, potentially crippling a vital part of the economy. If Israel imposes a stricter blockade and expands bombings to key infrastructure, Lebanon’s economic loss could rise to 21.9% of GDP, or $3.938 billion, according to the report. Over 1.5 million people could be displaced, with political and intercommunal tensions intensifying as Shia Muslims flee to diverse religious regions that are majority Christian, Druze or Sunni Muslim, the report adds. Already, 1.2 million people have been displaced from villages in southern and eastern Lebanon as well as Beirut’s southern suburbs. Lebanon, already enduring a five-year economic crisis marked by a severe currency collapse, had just begun showing signs of recovery before the war erupted. France says Israel's UNRWA ban will have serious consequences for Gaza PARIS — France 'deeply deplores' the adoption by the Israeli Parliament of two bills aimed at banning the activities of the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees on Israeli soil, the French foreign ministry said. 'The implementation of these bills would have very serious consequences on the humanitarian situation in Gaza, which is already catastrophic, but also throughout the occupied Palestinian territories, depriving hundreds of thousands of civilians of essential aid in terms of shelter, care, education and food,' the statement said. France 'reaffirms its support to UNRWA' and will continue to 'ensure that the reforms needed' to ensure its neutrality are implemented, the French foreign ministry said. Austrian soldiers in UN Lebanon force are lightly injured by missile strike VIENNA — Eight Austrian soldiers serving in the U.N. force in Lebanon were lightly injured in a missile strike at the Naqoura camp on Tuesday, Austrian authorities said. Defense Ministry spokesperson Michael Bauer wrote on social network X that the incident happened Tuesday lunchtime. He said it wasn’t immediately clear who was responsible for the strike. The injuries were 'light and superficial scrapes,' Bauer said. UNIFIL said in a statement that the rocket that hit its headquarters in Naqoura this afternoon was fired from the north, 'likely by Hezbollah or an affiliated group.' 'Peacekeepers were not in bunkers at the time. While some peacekeepers suffered minor injuries, fortunately, no one was seriously injured,' the statement added. UNIFIL spokesperson Dany Ghafary confirmed to the Associated Press that it was the same episode that injured eight Austrian U.N. peacekeepers. 'We have opened an investigation into the incident. We remind Hezbollah and all actors of their obligations to ensure the safety and security of UN personnel and property,' the statement said. 4 Israeli soldiers killed in northern Gaza, military says TEL AVIV, Israel — The Israeli military said that four soldiers were killed Tuesday in battle in the northern Gaza Strip. The military did not disclose the exact circumstances behind the deaths. Israel has refocused its offensive in Gaza on the territory’s hard-hit north, which was an early target of the war. Soldiers have been conducting raids and strikes to target what the military says are pockets of militancy. More than 360 soldiers have been killed since Israel launched its ground invasion in Gaza last year in response to Hamas’s Oct. 7, 2023 attacks on southern Israel. Foreign ministers of Cyprus and Luxembourg say UNRWA is ‘indispensable’ NICOSIA, Cyprus — The foreign ministers of Cyprus and Luxembourg say the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees is 'indispensable' to providing food, education and health care to Palestinians and that the international community must do whatever it can to enable the agency to continue its work. Cyprus’ top diplomat Constantinos Kombos said after talks with his Luxembourgian counterpart Xavier Bettel on Tuesday that the work of UNRWA is 'extremely valuable' throughout the Middle East, calling its delivery of humanitarian aid to Gaza 'imperative.' Bettel said 'there is no alternative' to UNWRA’s work to help people in Palestine because without the agency, 'there is no education, there is no health, there is no food.' The diplomats made the remarks after the Israeli parliament on Monday passed two laws that could prevent UNRWA from being able to continue its work. The laws ban the agency from operating and cut all ties between it and the Israeli government. Bettel said his country would continue to support UNWRA and would raise the issue in his meetings with his Israeli counterpart and the president of the Israeli parliament when he visits Israel later Tuesday. He will also meet with the Palestinian prime minister and UNWRA officials. UNICEF spokesman sharply criticizes Israeli parliament's move to ban UNRWA GENEVA — A UNICEF spokesman says the move by Israeli’s parliament to ban the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees 'means that a new way has been found to kill children.' James Elder says an inability for the refugee agency, UNRWA, to operate 'would likely see the collapse of the humanitarian system in Gaza' and the U.N. children’s agency 'would become effectively unable to distribute lifesaving supplies.' He said that would impede deliveries of vaccines, winter clothes, hygiene kits, health kits, water, and ready-to-use therapeutic food to combat malnutrition. Elder said a decision like the one by the Israeli parliament, or Knesset, 'suddenly means that a new way has been found to kill children.' IOM head says the migration agency unable to fill a gap left by UNRWA GENEVA — The director-general of the International Organization for Migration, Amy Pope, said that the United Nations body is not capable of fully filling a gap left by UNRWA, which she described as 'absolutely essential.' 'They provide, education. They provide health care. They provide some of the most basic needs, for people who have been living there for decades,' Pope said of UNRWA. 'That’s not something that IOM does what IOM does well.' She said IOM is able to assist with ongoing humanitarian support, such as offering help to displaced people and providing shelter and hygiene kits. 'There’s no way for IOM to step in to do what UNRWA has done. UNRWA is absolutely essential to the people of Gaza, and I don’t want to leave anyone with the misimpression that IOM can play that role, because we cannot,' she said. Projectile launched from Lebanon kills 1 in northern Israel TEL AVIV, Israel — Israeli authorities said Tuesday one person was killed after a projectile launched from Lebanon slammed into a northern city. The Israeli military said about 50 projectiles were launched from Lebanon into Israel. It said some of the launches were intercepted by Israel’s aerial defense system and others fell in the area. Israeli police said they received a number of reports of fallen projectiles, which caused damage to property, in the city of Maalot-Tarshiha. The Israeli rescue service Magen David Adom said a man was killed in the strike. The Lebanese militant group Hezbollah said it fired rockets toward the area. Hezbollah has fired thousands of rockets into Israel since Oct. 8, 2023, when it began attacking Israel in solidarity with Hamas a day after its cross-border attack. Fighting between Israel and Hezbollah has intensified in recent weeks after Israel launched a ground invasion into Lebanon. Turkey slams Israeli decision to ban UNRWA activity violates international law ISTANBUL — Turkey’s Foreign Ministry called Israel’s decision to ban the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East a 'clear violation of international law.' In a statement Tuesday, the Turkish Foreign Ministry said the move undermines efforts toward a two-state solution and obstructs the right of return for Palestinian refugees. 'By targeting UNRWA, Israel aims to eliminate the two-state solution and prevent the return of Palestinian refugees to their homeland,' the statement read. Israel accuses the agency of turning a blind eye to staff members it says belong to Hamas, divert aid and use UNRWA facilities for military purposes. Israel says around a dozen of the agency's 13,000 employees in Gaza participated in the Oct. 7, 2023, attack on southern Israel. The agency denies it knowingly aids armed groups and says it acts quickly to purge any suspected militants among its staff. The agency is the major distributor of aid in Gaza and provides education, health and other basic services to millions of Palestinian refugees across the region, including in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. 'It is the legal and moral obligation of the international community to take a strong stance against attempts to ban the activities of UNRWA,' the ministry added, noting that the agency was created by a U.N. General Assembly resolution. Turkey, which currently chairs the UNRWA’s Working Group on Financing, pledged to continue its support for the agency. British charity Christian Aid criticizes Israeli parliament's move to restrict UNRWA's work JERUSALEM — Christian Aid, a British charity, criticized the Israeli parliamentary decision to restrict the work of UNRWA. 'Severing this lifeline in Gaza as winter threatens to exacerbate an already desperate situation is cruel and dangerous,' the group’s Middle East head, William Bell, said in a statement Tuesday. Israeli lawmakers passed two laws Monday that could threaten the work of the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees. UNRWA is the largest aid provider in Gaza, but the laws would sever Israel’s ties with the agency and bar it from operating on Israeli soil, raising concerns about whether it could continue to provide basic services in both Gaza and the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Bell alleged that the move is part of Israel’s 'ongoing challenge to the eligibility of Palestinian refugees to claim the right of return' in Israel and occupied Palestinian territories. 'Once again international leaders have either been unable or unwilling to protect the most basic rights of Palestinians, including their existence as a sovereign people,' he said. Lebanon’s Hezbollah says it has chosen Naim Kassem to replace slain leader Hassan Nasrallah BEIRUT — Lebanon’s Hezbollah militant group says it has chosen Naim Kassem to replace its slain leader Hassan Nasrallah, who was killed in September in an Israeli airstrike. Kassem, a longtime deputy to Nasrallah, has served as the militant group’s acting leader since Nasrallah’s death. His appointment to replace Nasrallah was announced Tuesday. Dozens are killed or wounded in an Israeli strike on a building housing displaced Palestinians in Gaza DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — An Israeli strike on a five-story building where displaced Palestinians were sheltering in the northern Gaza Strip killed at least 60 people early Tuesday, according to health officials. Dr. Marwan al-Hams, director of the field hospitals’ department at the Gaza Health Ministry, announced the toll from Tuesday’s strike in the northern town of Beit Lahiya at a news conference. He says another 17 people are missing. The ministry’s emergency service says the dead include at least 12 women and 20 children, including babies. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military, which has been waging a large-scale operation in northern Gaza for more than three weeks, targeting what it says are pockets of Hamas militants who have regrouped there. Dr. Hossam Abu Safiya, the director of the nearby Kamal Adwan Hospital, said it was overwhelmed by the wave of wounded people from the strike. Israeli forces raided the medical facility over the weekend, detaining dozens of medics. Israel says it detained scores of Hamas militants in the raid. The Israeli military has repeatedly struck shelters for displaced people in recent months, saying it carried out precise strikes targeting Palestinian militants and tried to avoid harming civilians. The strikes have often killed women and children. United Nations chief warns Israel against barring UNRWA from its work UNITED NATIONS — The United Nations chief is warning that if two laws adopted by Israel’s parliament are implemented, the U.N. agency providing essential services to Palestinian refugees in Gaza and the West Bank would likely be prevented from continuing work that is mandated by the U.N. General Assembly. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called the work of the agency known as UNRWA 'indispensable,' and said implementing the laws 'could have devastating consequences for Palestinian refugees in the occupied Palestinian territories, which is unacceptable.' 'There is no alternative to UNRWA,' he said in a statement issued Monday night. UNRWA was established by the General Assembly in 1949 to provide relief for Palestinians who fled or were expelled from their homes before and during the 1948 war that followed Israel’s establishment, as well as their descendants. The laws adopted Monday by Israel’s parliament, which do not immediately go into effect, will sever ties with the agency and bar UNRWA from operating on Israeli soil. They were approved amid an escalating humanitarian crisis in Gaza, now in the second year of Israel’s military retaliation following Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attacks in southern Israel. Guterres called on Israel 'to act consistently with its obligations' under the U.N. Charter and international law, as well as the privileges and immunities of the United Nations. 'National legislation cannot alter those obligations,' Guterres stressed. He said implementing the laws would be detrimental to resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and more broadly for peace and security in the region.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-hezbollah-mideast-latest-29-october-2024-18bf8e25ae51c6e608346b0ef8b125c4	2024-10-29T00:47:35-07:00	
Hungary's Orbán boosts Georgia's ruling party over election despite an outcry the vote was rigged	TBILISI, Georgia (AP) — Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán gave a boost Tuesday to Georgia’s ruling party, saying its victory in a parliamentary election in the South Caucasus nation was free and democratic despite a massive opposition protest that denounced the vote as rigged and illegitimate. Orbán, Russian President Vladimir Putin’s closest partner in the European Union, is the first foreign leader to visit Georgia following Saturday's vote that the country's electoral commission said was won by the ruling Georgian Dream party. Georgia's president and opposition said the election was 'stolen' with the help of Russia, claiming there was widespread ballot fraud and violence, with the EU and the U.S. calling for a full investigation. But Orbán gave a different assessment after meeting with his counterpart, Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze, and congratulating him on the victory by his Georgian Dream party. 'I look at the debate that has erupted around the election, I read the evaluations of international organizations, and I see that no one dares to question that this election was a free and democratic choice,' Orbán said. People rallied outside parliament Monday night, demanding a new election under international supervision and an investigation into the alleged vote rigging. The protest underlined tensions in the country which lies between Russia and Turkey and where the Georgian Dream party has become increasingly authoritarian and tilted toward Moscow. Orbán was booed after arriving at his hotel in Tbilisi on Monday evening. Protesters called him a 'political prostitute' and 'puppet' in Russian and Hungarian, using expletives to tell him to leave the country. Kobakhidze said Orbán's visit had 'particular significance' as it takes place during Hungary’s presidency of the Council of the European Union although the bloc said he doesn't have any mandate for the visit. Georgian Dream told voters it is committed to joining the EU despite the fact Brussels suspended Georgia’s membership process after the party adopted a Russian-style 'foreign influence law' in June that critics say curbs press freedom. Pursuit of EU membership and NATO is written into Georgia's constitution and many in the country of 3.7 million viewed Saturday’s vote as a pivotal referendum on the opportunity to join the bloc. Georgian Dream, established by Bidzina Ivanishvili, a shadowy billionaire who made his fortune in Russia, has adopted laws similar to those used by the Kremlin to crack down on freedom of speech and LGBTQ+ rights. The party campaigned on joining Europe with 'dignity' — a principle Kobakhidze referenced Tuesday when he suggested Georgia and Hungary shared 'Christian values,' possibly alluding to similar laws passed in Hungary. Orbán said it was clear 'the opposition and the ruling party are committed to European integration,' rejecting opposition claims that Georgian Dream opposes it. 'While you are pursuing a pro-European policy, you have not allowed your country to become a second Ukraine,' Orbán said, urging Kobakhidze to ignore any criticism about the election. Orbán’s comments appeared to echo some of Georgian Dream’s campaign rhetoric that accused the opposition of trying to destabilize the country and hinted that Ukraine's fate could befall Georgia. President Salome Zourabichvili, who has rejected the election results, told The Associated Press on Monday that Georgia has fallen victim to Russian pressure against joining the EU. She said she hopes the West backs the opposition and protesters who are disputing the result of the election. 'We’ve seen that Russian propaganda was directly used,' said Zourabichvili, whose duties are mostly ceremonial president. A fierce critic of Georgian Dream, she said the government has been 'working hand-in-hand with Russia,' and 'probably' received help from Moscow’s security services. The Kremlin rejected accusations of interference. Zourabichvili said 'technology' was used to manipulate the vote and suggested some voter IDs were confiscated before the election from prisoners or people on welfare and used to vote 'up to 17 times.' Monday night's protest ended peacefully, with no clear plans for further actions from the president or opposition, and it was unclear who would investigate the alleged voting irregularities. 'There is no trust for the state to investigate these cases,' said Natia Seskuria, executive director of the Regional Institute for Security Studies in Tbilisi. 'The most immediate task that they have is to prove the elections were rigged,' she said, adding it will be difficult in a system which is 'largely run by the ruling party.' Civil society and opposition groups claim to have widespread evidence of violence, fraud and other voting irregularities but it is unclear how they will demonstrate it, Seskuria said. The Central Election Commission said Tuesday it was asked by opposition parties to provide a list of people who cast ballots. It declined, said CEC spokeswoman Natia Ioseliani, citing the risk of disclosing 'personal data,' which is 'one of the recognized fundamental principles of elections.' Accepting the election result would mean 'Georgia is lost for its people and Georgia is lost for Europe for the foreseeable future,' said Zaza Bibilashvili, founder of the Chavchavadze Center, a civil society organization. 'The stakes,' he said, 'are very high.' Zourabichvili urged the West not to abandon Georgia in the election's aftermath. Asked if she wants sanctions imposed on Georgian officials, Zourabichvili told AP that it’s up to Western leaders but that 'certainly time has not come to renew relations with authorities that are not legitimate.' EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell urged Georgian authorities to hold a 'transparent inquiry' and said the 'democratic backsliding in the country needs to be reversed.' In Washington, State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said Georgia's election environment was 'shaped by the ruling party’s policies, including misuse of public resources, vote-buying and voter intimidation.' 'We encourage Georgia’s governing officials to consider the relationship they want with the Euro-Atlantic community, rather than strengthening policies that are praised by authoritarians,' he said. The U.S. has consistently urged the Georgian government to 'walk back' its anti-democratic actions, he said, adding that 'we do not rule out further consequences,' although he did not elaborate. ___ Associated Press writer Sophiko Megrelidze in Tbilisi contributed.	https://apnews.com/article/georgia-election-russia-eu-protests-923b9523fb45d31d3fff655127a28c60	2024-10-29T00:15:37-07:00	
Boat carrying Egyptian migrants to Europe capsizes off Libyan coast, killing 12	CAIRO (AP) — A boat carrying 13 Egyptian migrants to Europe has capsized off Libya's coast, killing all on board except for one person, local authorities and a Libyan group said Tuesday. Al-Abreen, a group that provides humanitarian assistance to migrants in Libya, said on Facebook that the boat capsized 60 kilometers (37 miles) east of the city of Tobruk on Monday evening. One migrant survived, according to the group, which said the bodies were recovered and brought to shore. The Directorate for Combating Illegal Migration in Tobruk also confirmed the incident. In recent years, the North African nation has become the dominant transit point for migrants fleeing war and poverty in Africa and the Middle East. Last month, a migrant boat carrying 32 people capsized off the Libyan coast due to engine failure, leaving one person dead and 22 others missing, according to Libyan authorities. The coast guard in Tobruk said nine people were rescued. Al-Abreen said the boat was bound for Europe and was carrying migrants from Egypt and Syria. Human traffickers have long taken advantage of instability in Libya that escalated after a NATO-backed uprising overthrew and killed longtime leader Moammar Gadhafi in 2011. Traffickers smuggle migrants on crammed, poorly equipped vessels on risky sea trips across the North African nation’s borders, which are shared with six countries. Last year, 962 migrants died and 1,563 went missing off Libya, the International Organization for Migration said. About 17,200 migrants were intercepted and sent back to Libya in 2023, the organization said.	https://apnews.com/article/libya-egyptian-migrants-boat-capsize-65a8574344deafdba6880e5461d165af	2024-10-28T23:53:20-07:00	
Israeli strike in northern Gaza kills at least 60, officials say, as Hezbollah announces new leader	DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — An Israeli strike on a five-story building where displaced Palestinians were sheltering in the northern Gaza Strip killed at least 60 people early Tuesday, more than half of them women and children, Gaza’s Health Ministry said. In a separate development, Lebanon's militant group Hezbollah said it has chosen Sheikh Naim Kassem as its new top leader following the killing of Hassan Nasrallah in an Israeli airstrike last month. Israel also faced backlash from aid groups after its parliament passed legislation that could severely restrict the ability of the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees to operate in the Palestinian territories. The agency, known as UNRWA, is the largest aid provider in Gaza. Hezbollah said in a statement that its decision-making Shura Council elected Kassem, who had been Nasrallah's deputy leader for over three decades, as the new secretary-general. Hezbollah vowed to continue with Nasrallah’s policies 'until victory is achieved.' Kassem, 71, a founding member of the militant group established following Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon, had been serving as acting leader after Nasrallah was killed on Sept. 27. He has given several televised speeches vowing that Hezbollah will fight on despite a string of setbacks. Hezbollah began firing rockets into Israel, drawing retaliation, after Hamas’ surprise attack out of Gaza on Oct. 7, 2023, triggered the war there. Iran, which backs both groups, has also traded fire with Israel on two occasions. The tensions with Hezbollah boiled over last month, as Israel unleashed a wave of heavy airstrikes and killed Nasrallah and most of his senior commanders. Israel launched a ground invasion into Lebanon at the start of October. Strike in northern Gaza comes as Israel wages a major operation there Even as attention has shifted to Lebanon and Iran in recent weeks, Israel has continued to wage a large operation in northern Gaza and to carry out airstrikes across the territory. Dr. Marwan al-Hams, director of the field hospitals’ department at the Gaza Health Ministry, announced the toll from Tuesday’s strike in the northern town of Beit Lahiya at a news conference. He said another 17 people are missing. The ministry's emergency service said at least 12 women and 20 children were among the dead, including babies. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military, which has been waging the operation in northern Gaza for more than three weeks, targeting what it says are pockets of Hamas militants who have regrouped there. The dead included a mother and her five children, some of them adults, and a second mother with her six children, according to an initial casualty list provided by the emergency service. Dr. Hossam Abu Safiya, the director of the nearby Kamal Adwan Hospital, said it was overwhelmed by the wave of wounded people from the strike. Israeli forces raided the medical facility over the weekend, detaining dozens of medics. The army said it detained scores of Hamas militants. 'The healthcare system has completely collapsed,' Abu Safiya said in a voice message to journalists on Tuesday. He said people who arrive wounded are dying because there is no care for them. The Israeli military has repeatedly struck shelters for displaced people in recent months, saying it carried out precise strikes targeting Palestinian militants and tried to avoid harming civilians. The strikes have often killed women and children. The military said it detained scores of Hamas militants in the raid on Kamal Adwan, the latest in a series of raids on hospitals since the start of the war. Israel's latest major operation in northern Gaza, focused on the Jabaliya refugee camp, has killed hundreds of people and driven tens of thousands from their homes in another wave of mass displacement more than a year into the war in the tiny coastal territory. Israeli laws targeting UN agency could further restrict aid Israel has also sharply restricted aid to the north this month, prompting a warning from the United States that failure to facilitate greater aid efforts could lead to a reduction in military aid. Palestinians fear Israel is enacting a plan proposed by a group of former generals, who suggested the civilian population of the north should be ordered to evacuate, aid supplies should be cut off, and anyone remaining there should be considered a militant. The military has denied carrying out such a plan while the government has not said clearly whether it is carrying out all or part of it. On Monday, Israel's parliament passed two laws that ban UNRWA from operating on Israeli soil and cut all ties between the agency and the Israeli government. Israel controls access to both Gaza and the occupied West Bank, and it was unclear how the agency would continue to operate there. Israel says UNRWA has been infiltrated by Hamas and that the militant group siphons off aid and uses U.N. facilities to shield its activities, allegations denied by the U.N. agency. Aid groups have warned that there is no immediate replacement for UNRWA, which provides education, health care and emergency aid to millions of Palestinian refugees from the 1948 war surrounding Israel's creation and their descendants. Refugee families make up the majority of Gaza's population. 'Severing this lifeline in Gaza as winter threatens to exacerbate an already desperate situation is cruel and dangerous,' said William Bell, the Middle East head of Christian Aid, a British charity. The war in Gaza began when Hamas-led militants stormed into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250. Some 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, a third of whom are believed to be dead. Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed over 43,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities. Around 90% of the population of 2.3 million have been displaced from their homes, often multiple times. ___ Magdy reported from Cairo and Mroue from Beirut. ___ Follow AP’s war coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war	https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-lebanon-hezbollah-iran-news-10-29-2024-befe1b42ef25599539198fa04e089f04	2024-10-28T23:01:11-07:00	
Congo wants UN peacekeepers gone. But endless war around minerals is complicating that	GOMA, Congo (AP) — The end of one of the world's deadliest and yet most shadowy wars is as difficult to predict as the end of the large peacekeeping force meant to contain it. Congo desperately wants stability in its mineral-rich east, of intense interest to the global economy. But political friction means the government wants the longtime United Nations peacekeeping force there to get out. That would leave the vast region, overrun with dozens of armed groups including one affiliated with the Islamic State organization, with even less defense for millions of displaced civilians. But frustration has become so high with the peacekeepers that many Congolese want them gone, too. The Associated Press witnessed the dilemma on a rare visit and night patrol with the U.N. force now known as MONUSCO, which entered Congo more than two decades ago and has 14,000 peacekeepers on the ground. It patrols a landscape that feels far from the authority of Congo's government, with its dirt roads churned into slippery mud in pounding rains and residents long accustomed to feeling that, security-wise, they are on their own. Some of the region's armed groups are self-defense collectives. During a visit to one frontline town, Sake, about 14 miles (24 kilometers) from the regional hub of Goma, the AP spoke with militia members trying to defend the population from a resurgent group, the M23, and its sniper fire from surrounding hills. The M23 is backed by neighboring Rwanda, whose government denies it. The involvement of better-equipped Rwandan forces, with U.N. experts estimating up to 4,000 of them in Congo, has led to talk of war by Congo's government. A July truce brokered by the United States and Angola has reduced the fighting between Rwandan and Congolese forces, but clashes between M23 and other militias continue. 'We are fighting the enemy who is a foreigner in our country. They are not Congolese, but they want to take Congo,' said one fighter, Amini Bauma. Sake is one of the last main routes into Goma under government control, but fierce fighting this year forced most residents to flee, leaving boarded-up homes. About 160 civilians and soldiers came through Sake’s military hospital during the summer, most with gunshot wounds, said Omar Kalamo, a nurse. In August, a bomb exploded behind the building, he said. Some who fled are now returning, finding little safety elsewhere. Bitakuya Buhesha found his house destroyed. But he said he’d rather brave the gunfire than live in displacement camps, which have been infiltrated by fighters. 'We’ve waited a long time and we do don’t know whether our army will win this war or if it’ll be the M23 rebels,' he said. Many Congolese who once looked to the U.N. peacekeeping force with hope are now angry. Multiple protests, some of them violent, have targeted the force in recent years. Last year, at Congo’s request, the U.N. Security Council voted unanimously to draw down the peacekeeping force and gradually hand over its security responsibilities to Congo’s government by this December. But the soaring violence means that departure is now delayed. On a recent day, peacekeepers in armored vehicles pulled into a small base in the hazy hills outside Goma, its tents surrounded by looping razor wire and sandbags. Troops perched with a machine gun pointed in the rebels' direction. In recent months, clashes between Congo’s army and M23 came within a mile of the base. The U.N. force is trying to find new ways to repel the rebels. Last year, it established new bases between the frontlines and about 600,000 displaced people sheltering around Goma. It is training Congolese soldiers in the hope that they can fill the security void once it leaves. 'If the belligerent armed groups had come forward and attacked the civilians, the MONUSCO would have changed its stance purely from defensive to offensive operations,' said U.N’s center sector commander for North Kivu province, Brig. General Ranjan Mahajan. MONUSCO described the security challenges 'multiple and multifaceted' and said only one of its brigades is tasked to go on the offensive. That affects a single area, Beni, where deadly attacks have been especially frequent. The U.N. mission otherwise is defensive and works alongside Congolese forces and others. But some Congolese, who see the U.N. force as not aggressive enough, said any new efforts to protect them are futile. 'You can see that MONUSCO is there, but that’s in name only ... People are dying, but it does nothing,' said Maombie Aline, a displaced person in Goma. And yet, the international community has warned that the U.N. force's pullout would leave a security vacuum. More than 80% of Congo’s 7 million displaced people live in areas protected by the U.N., according to the Africa Center for Strategic Studies. Last month, the U.S. ambassador to the U.N., Linda Thomas-Greenfield, said the peacekeepers' pullout from South Kivu province in June left critical gaps, and the Security Council shouldn't authorize further withdrawals until there's a plan to mitigate them. The U.S. is the force's top financial supporter. Congo’s communication minister, Patrick Muyaya, said there would be a new timeline for MONUSCO’s departure, but didn't give details. He said a joint team of government and U.N. officials was evaluating the situation. Goma's streets are full of armed men, local and foreign. In addition to the U.N. force and an unknown number of Congolese forces, there are about 1,000 foreign mercenaries, a coalition of local militia and a Southern African regional force. A recently deployed East African force was kicked out amid criticism it was ineffective. 'It’s a military jungle,' said Onesphore Sematumba, a Congolese researcher for the International Crisis Group. 'There are many actors, but everyone has their own agenda ... they can’t make a difference because they are divided.' Global interest in eastern Congo's minerals is one reason the violence is so difficult to be contained, experts said. Congo is the world’s largest producer of cobalt, a mineral used to make lithium-ion batteries for electric vehicles and smartphones. It also has substantial gold, diamond, copper and cobalt reserves. In May, M23 fighters seized the town of Rubaya, which holds deposits of tantalum — used in electronics, including Apple devices —and extracted from coltan. The area is estimated to supply more than 15% of global production of tantalum and now generates about $300,000 a month for M23, said Bintou Keita, head of Congo's U.N. mission. U.N. experts in June said a portion of Rubaya minerals have been smuggled across the Rwandan border. Rwanda is selling minerals from eastern Congo and passing them off as conflict-free, said Darren Davids, an analyst with the Economist Intelligence Unit — allegations documented by both U.N experts and the U.S. Davids said the international community has hesitated to meaningfully call on Rwanda to stop the fighting because it has become a reliable trading partner for the West as competition grows for the minerals. Meanwhile, the Rwandan-backed rebels are accused of obstructing and threatening the U.N. mission so it can seize more territory, and are widely expected to benefit from its departure. Rwanda’s government and M23 didn’t respond to requests for comment. ___ The Associated Press receives financial support for global health and development coverage in Africa from the Gates Foundation.

As Israel strikes deeper into Lebanon, fear rises in communities where the displaced took refuge	AITO, Lebanon (AP) — Dany Alwan stood shaking as rescue workers pulled remains from piles of rubble where his brother’s building once stood. An Israeli airstrike destroyed the three-story residential building in the quiet Christian village of Aito a day before. His brother, Elie, had rented out its apartments to a friend who'd fled here with relatives from their hometown in southern Lebanon under Israeli bombardment. Things were fine for a few weeks. But that day, minutes after visitors arrived and entered the building, it was struck. Almost two dozen people were killed, half of them women and children. Israel said it targeted a Hezbollah official, as it has insisted in other strikes with high civilian death tolls. This strike — in northern Lebanon, deep in Christian heartland — was particularly unusual. Israel has concentrated its bombardment mostly in the country’s south and east and in Beirut's southern suburbs — Shiite-majority areas where the Hezbollah militant group has a strong presence. Strikes in the traditionally 'safe' areas where many displaced families have fled are raising fears among local residents. Many feel they have to choose between helping compatriots and protecting themselves. 'We can’t welcome people anymore,' Alwan said as rescue teams combed through the rubble in Aito. 'The situation is very critical in the village, and this is the first time something like this has happened to us.' The war brings out long-running tensions Aito is in the Zgharta province, which is split between Christian factions who are supporters and critics of Hezbollah. Some Christian legislators critical of Hezbollah have warned of the security risks that could come with hosting displaced people, mostly from the Shia Muslim community. They worry that many may have familial and social ties to Hezbollah, which in addition to its armed wing has civilian services across southern and eastern Lebanon. Some also worry that long-term displacement could create demographic changes and weaken the Christian share in Lebanon’s fragile sectarian power-sharing system. The tiny country has a troubled history of sectarian strife and violence, most notably in a 15-year civil war that ended in 1990. Lebanon for decades has struggled to navigate tensions and political gridlock within its sectarian power-sharing government system. Parliament is deeply divided among factions that back and oppose Hezbollah and has been without a president for almost two years. When Hezbollah fired rockets at northern Israel in solidarity with Palestinian ally Hamas in the war-torn Gaza Strip, the move was met with mixed feelings. Critics say it was a miscalculation that has brought the widespread devastation of Gaza here. Many have been moved to help After nearly a year of low-level fighting, the Israeli military escalated its attacks against Hezbollah a month ago, launching daily aerial bombardments and a ground invasion. Most of Lebanon’s estimated 1.2 million displaced people fled over the past month. In late September, traffic jams stretching for miles clogged streets leading to Beirut as people left, some with nothing but the clothes on their backs. For many, the violence has moved them to help their fellow residents, cutting across sectarian lines. Michella Sfeir, who was safe in the north, said she wanted to take action after seeing a picture of a driver pouring water from his bottle into a nearby driver’s empty one. 'The first thing you can think of is: How can I help immediately?' she said. She now helps prepare meals at a women’s art center that's become a community kitchen and donation dropoff center for blankets, clothes, and supplies in Aqaibe, a seaside town just north of Beirut. Displaced women who found shelter in surrounding neighborhoods regularly visit, while some people involved in other initiatives help deliver the hot meals to shelters around dinnertime. 'We get lots of questions like, ‘When you go to give the help, is there a member of Hezbollah waiting for you at the door?’' Sfeir said, citing blowback in the community from people who perceive the displaced as Hezbollah members, supporters and relatives. 'Some people ... would ask us ‘Why are you helping them? They don’t deserve it; this is because of them.'' Anxiety rises far from the border Though northern coastal cities such as Byblos and Batroun with pristine beaches and ancient ruins have not felt the direct pain of the conflict, anxiety is rising in surrounding areas. On one coastal road — the busy Jounieh highway — an Israeli drone struck a car earlier this month, killing a man and his wife. Such rare but increasing Israeli strikes have rattled residents in the north. Many feel torn: Should they risk their security by hosting displaced people, or compromise their morals and turn them away? Zeinab Rihan fled north with family and relatives from the southern Nabatiyeh province when they couldn’t bear the airstrikes approaching closer to their homes. But, Rihan said, they found many landlords quoting outlandish rent figures in an apparent attempt to turn them away. Some might have been acting out of personal prejudice, Rihan said, but it's likely most were simply afraid. 'They were scared that they might rent their place to someone who turns out to be targeted,' Rihan said. 'But this is our current reality, what can we do?' For some, helping is a sense of duty A resident of one northern town near the coast said the local government didn't want to welcome displaced people, but many residents pressured the municipality to change course. He cited the town’s common sympathy and sense of duty to help others, despite the security risks. He spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity for fear of stirring tension among residents. Elsewhere, in the hilly village of Ebrine, a stone’s throw away from Batroun, residents have been regularly visiting dozens of displaced families sheltering in two modest schools. This month, an Israeli strike hit a village a short drive away, but that hasn't stopped some residents from hiring the displaced — for some, to work in olive groves during the harvest season. Back in Aqaibe, some displaced women from nearby areas have joined Sfeir and others volunteering at the kitchen: chopping vegetables, cooking rice in vats, packaging meals in plastic containers, and having coffee together on the balcony. 'Just because we’re in an area that doesn’t have direct conflict or direct war doesn’t mean that we’re not worried about Beirut or the south,' said Flavia Bechara, who founded the center, as she took a break from chopping onions and potatoes. 'We all used to eat the olives and olive oil of the south, and we used to go there to get fruits and vegetables.' Bechara and several women finished packing dozens of meals for the day, and a group of women came to pick up winter clothes for their kids. Bechara said she isn’t phased by the criticism or questions she gets from some of her neighbors. 'There’s always anxiety,' said Bechara, who just recently could hear strikes a short drive away, in Maisra. 'There’s always (the fear) that what is happening there can happen here at any moment.'	https://apnews.com/article/lebanon-israel-war-displacement-hezbollah-395ccfd8ff7e230b474867b13e594b1b	2024-10-28T20:25:50-07:00	
Stock market today: Global shares mostly rise after Wall Street climbs on Big Tech gains	TOKYO (AP) — Global shares were mostly up Tuesday after U.S. stocks closed broadly higher with gains in Big Tech companies offsetting a skid in oil and gas stocks. France's CAC 40 gained 0.3% in early trading to 7,580.12, while Germany's DAX rose nearly 0.3% to 19,586.90. Britain's FTSE 100 was also up 0.3% to 8,308.83. U.S. shares were set to be little changed, with Dow futures down less than 0.1% at 42,576.00. S&amp;P 500 futures inched up less than 0.1% at 5,864.00. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 added 0.8% to finish at 38,903.68. Australia's S&amp;P/ASX 200 gained 0.3% to 8,249.20. South Korea's Kospi added 0.2% to 2,617.80. Hong Kong's Hang Seng edged up 0.5% to 20,701.14, while the Shanghai Composite slipped 1.1% to 3,286.41. In Japan, the government reported that unemployment stood at 2.4% last month, marking an improvement of 0.1 percentage point, and the second straight month of recovery. The continuing weak yen is helping hold up Japanese stocks. In currency trading, the U.S. dollar gained to 153.32 Japanese yen from 153.23 yen. The euro cost $1.0820, inching up from $1.0817. Recently, stocks in the oil-and-gas industry have been hurt by the sinking price of oil. In energy trading in Asia Tuesday, benchmark U.S. crude rose 15 cents to $67.53 a barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, added 18 cents to $71.60 a barrel. On Monday, a barrel of benchmark U.S. crude fell 6.1%, and Brent crude slid 6.1%. That was the first trading for them since Israel attacked Iranian military targets on Saturday, in retaliation for an earlier barrage of ballistic missiles. Israel’s attack was more restrained than some investors had feared it could be, and it raised hopes that a worst-case scenario may be avoided. Beyond the violence that is taking a human toll, the worry in financial markets is that an escalating war in the Middle East could cut off the flow of crude from Iran, which is a major oil producer. Such worries had sent the price of Brent crude up to nearly $81 per barrel in early October, despite signals that plenty of oil is available for the global economy. It’s since fallen back below $72. Financial markets are also dealing with the volatility that typically surrounds a U.S. presidential election, with Election Day one week away. Markets have historically been shaky heading into an election, only to calm afterward regardless of which party wins. Investors are eyeing the U.S. jobs report set for release Friday. They want to see more evidence of solid hiring to keep alive hopes for the economy. ___ Yuri Kageyama is on X: https://x.com/yurikageyama	https://apnews.com/article/financial-markets-oil-prices-tech-stocks-1f348c34204ce132997defdd9a15a31a	2024-10-28T19:45:25-07:00	
North Korea sends foreign minister to Russia as its troops train to fight in Ukraine	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korea said Tuesday its top diplomat is visiting Russia, in another sign of their deepening relations as rival South Korea and Western nations say the North has sent thousands of troops to support Russia’s war in Ukraine. North Korea’s official Korean Central News Agency said a delegation led by Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui departed for Russia on Monday, but didn’t specify the purpose of the visit. In a closed-door hearing at South Korea’s parliament, the South’s spy agency said Choe may be involved in high-level discussions on sending additional troops to Russia and negotiating what the North would get in return, according to Lee Seong-kweun, a lawmaker who attended the meeting. The announcement of Choe’s visit came hours after the Pentagon said North Korea has sent about 10,000 troops to Russia, who are expected to arrive in battlefields in Ukraine within 'the next several weeks.' South Korean and Western leaders have expressed concern that North Korean involvement could help prolong Russia’s aggression in Ukraine, and that Russia may offer technology in return that could advance the threat posed by North Korea’s nuclear weapons and missile program. Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh told reporters Monday that some of the North Korean soldiers have already moved closer to Ukraine and were believed to be heading for the Kursk border region, where Russia has been struggling to push back a Ukrainian incursion. South Korea’s National Intelligence Service told lawmakers it’s examining the possibility that some groups of North Korea’s military personnel in Russia, including generals or other high-ranking officials, may have already moved to frontline areas. The spy agency also said the two sides appear to be struggling to resolve communication issues although the Russian military is training North Korean troops on Russian military terminology, Lee said. The agency said space-based reconnaissance is an area where North Korea is likely receiving Russian help. It said North Korea may be acquiring advanced components from Russia as it prepares to launch another military reconnaissance satellite following a failed attempt in May, said Park Sun-won, another lawmaker who attended the hearing. North Korea first placed a spy satellite in orbit last November. Its leader Kim Jong Un has described those assets as crucial for monitoring South Korean and U.S. military activities and enhancing the threat of his nuclear-capable missiles. South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol in telephone calls with European Union Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte on Monday shared South Korean intelligence assessments that North Korean troops could be deployed to battlefronts 'more quickly than anticipated.' He called for closer coordination with European governments aimed at 'monitoring and blocking 'illegal exchanges between Pyongyang and Moscow, Yoon’s office said in a statement. After initially denying the claims about North Korean troop deployments, Pyongyang and Moscow have adopted a vaguer stance, asserting that their military cooperation conforms with international law without directly admitting the presence of North Korean forces in Russia. North Korea has also been accused of providing millions of artillery shells and other military equipment to Russia to fuel its war in Ukraine. The United States and its partners have described Russia’s procurement of North Korean personnel and supplies as a violation of U.N. Security Council resolutions, and raised suspicions that Moscow is helping Pyongyang to evade sanctions and unlawfully finance its weapons program. Russia, along with China, has blocked U.S.-led efforts at the Security Council to tighten sanctions on North Korea over its recent missile testing activities, which intensified after Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Russia also vetoed a U.N. resolution to extend the mandate of a panel of monitors in March in a move that effectively abolished oversight by U.N. experts of Security Council sanctions against North Korea. It prompted Western accusations that Moscow was acting to shield its arms purchases from Pyongyang. 'The illegal military collusion between Russia and North Korea poses a significant security threat to the international community and a serious matter that could potentially harm our security. We must thoroughly examine all possibilities and prepare countermeasures,' Yoon said in a Cabinet meeting in Seoul on Tuesday. Yoon last week raised the possibility of supplying Ukraine with weapons while saying Seoul is preparing countermeasures that could be rolled out in stages depending on the degree of military cooperation between Pyongyang and Moscow. South Korea, a growing arms exporter, has provided humanitarian aid and other non-lethal support to Ukraine and joined U.S.-led economic sanctions against Moscow. It has so far resisted calls by Kyiv and NATO to directly supply Ukraine with weapons, citing a longstanding policy of not providing arms to countries engaged in active conflict.	https://apnews.com/article/north-korea-russia-ukraine-war-choe-son-hui-foreign-minister-c67d98128d06e8959aa34f21428f5081	2024-10-28T19:35:32-07:00	
Guatemalan journalist released from prison fears for the future and being targeted for his work	GUATEMALA CITY (AP) — When Guatemalan journalist José Rubén Zamora returned to his home after more than two years in prison without a conviction, he found it empty. He said it smelled of abandonment after his family fled the country, fearing they would face his same fate. On Monday, one week after his release, Zamora discussed his own uncertain future in an interview with The Associated Press under the shadow of efforts to keep him behind bars and his concern for other journalists that do the kind of investigative work he did. Not only have Guatemalan journalists — including eight from the outlet El Periódico that he founded — been forced into exile under threat of prosecution, but those who remain wrestle with the fear that if they investigate 'they can end up in jail,' Zamora said. Thrust into the spotlight, the 68-year-old journalist is shy, not keen to be the target of news. He said he can still feel the aftermath of imprisonment in his bones, and also in his day-to-day life after funding his legal defense forced him to sell his belongings, only skating by through support from his children. 'Frankly, the feeling of not having any money, that is mine, is complicated and I don’t have the means to get around,' he said. The interview comes after a long journey for Zamora, who has spent the past three decades working as a journalist. Twenty-four of those years were as president of El Periódico, the news organization he founded to investigate corruption in Guatemala. It’s a dangerous topic to investigate in a country like Guatemala, where the Attorney General's Office raided electoral facilities, seized and opened ballot boxes and targeted the Seed Movement party of now-President Bernardo Arévalo in an effort to keep him from taking office. To this day, Zamora believes it was his paper's investigative work that led him to be targeted by prosecutors. In particular, it was his pointed criticism of former President Alejandro Giammattei and his ally, current Attorney General Consuelo Porras, who was sanctioned by the United States for allegedly obstructing corruption investigations. Porras' agents raided Zamora's house in July 2022 and arrested him, accusing him of money laundering after he asked a friend to deposit $38,000 that Zamora said was a donation to his news organization. Zamora said he did not put the money in the bank himself because the person who made the donation feared being retaliated against for supporting the media outlet. He was initially convicted and sentenced to six years, a ruling that was annulled due to procedural failures. He was later accused of falsifying documents and faced a second trial for allegedly lying in the first case against him. In late October, he was finally set free, after a judge cited that two years of pre-trial detention violated national and international human rights law. Upon his release, one of his first visitors was President Arévalo. 'I explained to him that in Guatemala, there have never been institutions dedicated to control or rigorous oversight,' Zamora said. 'That is why the press is so important: There is no prosecution or punishment for the corrupt, rather there are walls of impunity.' Zamora said he was happy to finally speak to his family, but it was clear he still lives with the fallout of his two years in jail and a deep sense of uncertainty over what comes next. Upon his arrest, his newspaper El Periódico disappeared. Eight of its journalists and columnists live in exile like his family for publishing articles on the abuse of power of judges and prosecutors — including about his case. Since Porras remains attorney general, Zamora worries that he could once again be thrown in jail. He said he’s been left without a job, and worries about friends, family and even people who he speaks to at the prosecutor's office when he goes for his required regular check-ins. 'I worry about people greeting me, because they may face some consequences,' he said. The only thing that remains of his old life are piles of old copies of his newspaper in his home's garage. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america	https://apnews.com/article/guatemala-journalist-zamora-interview-jailed-23dc6016a4b3e9b7dc104c390e603b8a	2024-10-28T18:25:43-07:00	
Fans in Shohei Ohtani's Japanese hometown pack in to watch Game 3 of the World Series	OSHU CITY, Japan (AP) — Hundreds of fans filed into a public viewing center in Shohei Ohtani's hometown in northern Japan on Tuesday morning — the country is 13 hours ahead of Yankee Stadium — to cheer the country's top celebrity in Game 3 of the World Series. Fans lined up outside the Oshu City Cultural Center, a 500-seat auditorium, on a perfect fall morning to watch their local hero in a live telecast. They were there an hour before the game started. Many came dressed in Dodger Blue — caps or jerseys — and were supplied with various noisemakers, including thunder sticks. The hall was adorned with posters announcing Ohtani as 'The Pride of Oshu City.' Ohtani, playing two days after dislocating his left shoulder in Game 2, drew a walk on his first at-bat. That drew wild cheers from the 250 fans attending, who chanted 'Go, Go. Shohei.' Then came even more cheers when the Dodgers took a 2-0 lead on Freddie Freeman's home run. 'He's more like a Japanese treasure than just a local (treasure),' said fan Hiromitsu Kikuchi. 'I think he has passed beyond the hometown and is more like world-class. We have never had a star player like this before from our hometown.' Among the mostly older fans were about 20 children from the kindergarten that Ohtani attended. They came equipped with small flags emblazoned with Ohtani's smiling face. Several fans said they were worried Ohtani might not play but set out from home when they got the good news. 'I came to see Ohtani because the television news reported that he would play,' said fan Tadashi Onodera. 'It's fantastic. We are proud to have such a player from out hometown.' This is the town where Ohtani played Little League, starred as a pitcher and hitter at Hanamaki Higashi High School, and became the favorite son of Iwate Prefecture, a mountainous region abutting the Pacific Ocean. His hometown is located about 300 miles (500 kilometers) north of Tokyo, a largely rural place far from the capital, its hundreds of skyscrapers and high-end prosperity. All eyes at the viewing were on the Dodgers superstar — and his left shoulder. His injury briefly cast a pall and flipped Japan's mood from magic to morose. Then came relief. The magic returned as Dodgers manager Dave Roberts started Ohtani as the designated hitter and leadoff hitter in Game 3, what local fans and all of baseball wanted to see. 'I was concerned (about the injury), but believed it would be okay,' said Masatoshi Honmyo, another local fan. 'I would say he is a hero.' ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB	https://apnews.com/article/world-series-shohei-ohtani-japan-03bac61f1ff62c6482cba84006c9e617	2024-10-28T16:40:37-07:00	
Thousands of soldiers fence off a Salvadoran neighborhood in pursuit of gang remnants	SAN SALVADOR (AP) — More than 2,000 soldiers and 500 police officers surrounded a populous neighborhood on the outskirts of El Salvador's capital on Monday in an effort to quash the remnants of gangs the president said were trying to set up shop in the area. 'There is a group of gang members in hiding. We have established a security fence throughout the neighborhood... to extract every last gang member in the area,' wrote Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele in a post on X. Police surrounded the San Marcos neighborhood with a military fence, setting up checkpoints to prevent gang members from escaping, said Defense Minister René Francis Merino Monroy. The fence was the third of its kind to be installed in parts of San Salvador intended to find and arrest gang members still operating in the country. In March, Bukele ordered similar barricades to be put up in a northern part of the country, which he said was to dismantle a faction of the Barrio 18 gang. The blockade is the latest in the populist leader's war on gangs, announced by Bukele following a surge of violence in March 2022. Bukele's government called for a 'state of emergency' and waived constitutional rights to arrest more than 1% of El Salvador's population with little evidence. The crackdown has fueled sharp criticism from human rights groups, raising alarm about prison conditions and saying many of those arrested were innocent or only had loose ties to gangs. Other measures he's taken, like seeking re-election despite a constitutional ban of presidents serving two consecutive terms, have raised other democratic alarms. But the war on gangs also dealt a strong blow to the Barrio 18 and MS-13 gangs that have long sowed terror in much of the country, extorting money, murdering those who didn't pay and trafficking drugs. The measures resulted in a sharp dip in homicides and spurred a populist fervor for Bukele. Despite effectively declaring victory in his war, the president has continued to extend the 'state of emergency' for over two years now, claiming that such measures are needed to take out the remains of El Salvador's gangs. ____ Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america	https://apnews.com/article/el-salvador-gangs-nayib-bukele-state-of-emergency-violence-1f6dcc2fad3b5fc45f724031806d2fc0	2024-10-28T14:01:45-07:00	
Treasury issues rule to block US investors from helping China develop advanced military technology	WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. Treasury Department, seeking to keep the Chinese military from gaining an edge in advanced technologies, issued a rule Monday to restrict and monitor American investments in China in artificial intelligence, computer chips and quantum computing. The finalized rule arises from an executive order issued in August 2023 by President Joe Biden. The order sought to limit the access that 'countries of concern'' — specifically China including Hong Kong and Macao — have to American dollars to fund technologies that could be used, for example, to break codes or develop next-generation fighter jets. It will take effect Jan. 2. 'U.S. investments ... must not be used to help countries of concern develop their military, intelligence and cyber capabilities''' said Paul Rosen, assistant Treasury secretary for investment security. He noted the investments can mean more than just money: they can deliver 'intangible benefits,'' including managerial help and assistance finding top talent and tapping other sources of financing. Blocking China's high-tech ambitions is one of the few issues that enjoys broad support in Washington from both Republicans and Democrats. Biden in May slapped a stiff tariff on electric vehicles from China. He also has imposed export controls to keep the Chinese from acquiring advanced computer chips and the equipment to produce them. Former President Donald Trump has vowed to dramatically increase taxes on all imports from China if voters send him back to the White House. A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson said Tuesday that the government had lodged a protest with the U.S. over the latest action. 'China strongly deplores and firmly opposes the U.S. rolling out restrictions on investment in China,' Lin Jian said at a daily briefing in Beijing. In Hong Kong, the city's leader said the move undermined normal investment and trade and would cause damage to the global supply chain. 'In pursuing their political agenda, American politicians are harming not only others but also the interests of their own country, their people and their businesses. They will have to face the consequences of their actions,' John Lee said, noting that the U.S. has enjoyed a trade surplus of $472 billion with Hong Kong in the past 10 years. The Biden administration sought comment from businesses and from U.S. allies before putting out the final version. In addition to blocking investments, the rule requires Americans and companies in the United States to notify the U.S. government of transactions that involve 'technologies and products that may contribute to a threat to the national security of the United States.'' Violators can be hit with fines of up to $368,136 or twice the value of the prohibited transaction, whichever is greater. Treasury is setting up an Office of Global Transactions to oversee the new rule. ____ Associated Press writers Ken Moritsugu in Beijing and Kanis Leung in Hong Kong contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/treasury-rule-china-artificial-intelligence-chips-investment-86bae5f144e544416e0bf9ca16e7d5af	2024-10-28T13:00:27-07:00	
Shohei Ohtani leads off for Dodgers in World Series Game 3, two days after dislocating shoulder	NEW YORK (AP) — Shohei Ohtani wasn't on the team bus from Dodger Stadium to Los Angeles International Airport because he was getting tests Saturday night after partially separating his left shoulder in Game 2 of the World Series. So the Japanese star reached out in a group chat with fellow Dodgers players to erase any doubts over his status. 'The text just like literally said: `I can play,'' infielder Max Muncy recalled Monday. 'I mean, there was more to it than that.' True to his word, Ohtani remained in the lineup in his regular leadoff slot as the designated hitter for Game 3 of the World Series with Los Angeles holding a 2-0 lead over the New York Yankees. Ohtani was the only Dodgers starter wearing a warmup jacket during pregame introductions and high-fived teammates with his right hand. A black wrapping was visible over his left shoulder. He didn't swing in his first plate appearance, taking four balls from Clarke Schmidt. Ohtani kept his left arm at an angle over his chest while at first base, hand holding his collar, and held it there while rounding the bases on Freddie Freeman's two-run homer. Ohtani had a swing and miss in the third, slighting grimacing, before grounding out. He held the hand to his chest as he jogged back to the dugout. Muncy said Ohtani wrote the text himself in English without assistance from interpreter Will Ireton. 'We all just put it to the side at that moment,' Muncy remembered. 'We all said: `All right, he’s got us. We'll be ready for him to be in the lineup.'' Dodgers manager Dave Roberts didn't get the text message — 'that group chat is for us — that’s for the players,' Muncy said — and wasn't aware of it until Monday. 'Would have been helpful if I was on that thread. I would have slept better Saturday night,' Roberts said with a smile. Ohtani got hurt sliding into second base when he was caught stealing to end the seventh inning of Saturday night’s 4-2 victory in Los Angeles. Roberts said Ohtani's shoulder was popped back into place by the athletic training staff at the ballpark and an MRI showed no structural damage. He wasn't sure whether the injury will heal on its own or any procedure would be needed after the Series. Asked whether Ohtani received medication, an injection or was being taped up, Roberts said 'it's all of the above on the treatment and stuff. The tape is just protecting and stabilizing, not really limiting.' Ohtani took swings off a tee in a Yankee Stadium batting cage Sunday night and was hitting balls 102 mph, which changed Roberts' mood to 'joy.' 'He was very adamant that he was going to play,' Roberts said. 'Obviously, there’s some discomfort.' A separated shoulder is subject to recurrence. Roberts said he doubted Ohtani will attempt any more stolen bases during the Series. 'If you keep the best player in the game in the lineup, that’s usually good for your team,' Muncy said. 'Obviously, it’s a big guy to have in there. It helps a lot. He’s had some big moments for us, and we’re obviously expecting a couple more big moments out of him.' With the Dodgers chasing their eighth championship and second in five years, Walker Buehler was scheduled to start Game 3 for Los Angeles in the best-of-seven Series. Ohtani was 0 for 3 with a walk in Game 2. The likely NL MVP was 1 for 8 in the first two games of the Fall Classic and batting .260 with three home runs and 10 RBIs in his first postseason in the majors. 'It was very tough in the moment to see him in pain like that,' Muncy said. 'We were two innings away from winning that ballgame. We knew we had to refocus. Obviously, it sucks seeing Sho in that kind of pain, but we still had a job to do in the moment. 'After the game we all checked on him to see how he was doing. It was like a buffet line going in there to see how he’s doing. Yeah, it was tough in the moment, but we refocused to win the game.' A two-time AL MVP with the Los Angeles Angels, Ohtani joined the Dodgers last December for a record $700 million, 10-year contract. The 30-year-old slugger hit .310 with 54 homers, 130 RBIs and 59 stolen bases, becoming the first player with at least 50 homers and 50 stolen bases in a season. The two-way star did not pitch this season while recovering from elbow surgery on Sept. 19, 2023, and has been limited to designated hitter. 'You see him walk off holding (his arm) like that, obviously that’s a concern. But hopefully he is OK,' Yankees manager Aaron Boone said before Game 3. 'We want to all be out here competing with and against the best, and obviously Shohei embodies that. So hopefully everything’s OK, and we’ll get to go compete against him.' ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb	https://apnews.com/article/world-series-ohtani-dodgers-311bc657971726bc04028326dcf1cf72	2024-10-28T12:05:18-07:00	
World Series averaging 15.15 million viewers in Japan, including 15.9 for Game 2	LOS ANGELES (AP) — The World Series is averaging 15.15 million viewers in Japan through two games. According to Major League Baseball, the Los Angeles Dodgers' 4-2 victory over the New York Yankees in Game 2 averaged 15.9 million, making it the most-watched MLB postseason game in the nation's history. Besides the allure of superstar and presumptive NL MVP Shohei Ohtani, the game had Yoshinobu Yamamoto as the Dodgers' starting pitcher. The Los Angeles Dodgers’ dramatic 6-3 victory over the New York Yankees in Game 1 — which ended on Freddie Freeman’s walk off grand slam in the 10th inning — averaged 14.4 million. Tokyo is 16 hours ahead of Los Angeles, meaning the games started around 9 a.m. on Saturday and Sunday morning in Japan. The games are being carried through Fuji TV, NHK BS and J Sports. Combined with the United States ratings, the first two games have a combined 29.7 million average in the two countries. The World Series is averaging 14.55 million viewers in the U.S. on Fox, Fox Deportes and streaming, putting it on track for its best performance since 2017. It is also the first time since the final two games of the 2021 series between the Atlanta Braves and Houston Astros that the World Series has drawn back-to-back games of at least 13.4 million viewers. According to Nielsen, the matchup between the Yankees and Dodgers has also meant a 93% increase in viewership within the 18-34-year-old demographic. According to MLB, social engagement is up 225% and views on social channels have increased 229%. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb	https://apnews.com/article/world-series-yankees-dodgers-japan-ratings-4a3732f1a500d49f5380ee4cb3929bd6	2024-10-28T11:17:03-07:00	
US presses ahead with modest Mideast plans despite election uncertainty	WASHINGTON (AP) — With the U.S. presidential election just a week away, the Biden administration is not giving up hope for short-term deals for cease-fires between Israel and Hamas in Gaza and Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon. But U.S. officials are mindful that political uncertainty in the United States has made the sides reluctant to commit to any significant agreements before it is clear who has won the White House. In the meantime, the Middle East is uneasy about what happens next after Israel struck Iranian military targets over the weekend in retaliation for Iran's barrage of ballistic missile attacks on Oct. 1. U.S. officials said they believe Israel’s attack — whose targets were coordinated with Washington — will not draw an escalatory reaction from Iran. But the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to share sensitive diplomatic discussions, caution that nothing is certain. The Biden administration was able to persuade Israel to keep its response limited — gaining assurances it wouldn’t hit nuclear or oil sites in Iran that would have escalated the conflict — despite limited U.S. influence as Biden's term wraps up. As Israel’s closest ally and a key mediator in the Middle East, the U.S. still is pressing for any movement on a truce despite letdowns in the past and little expectation of immediate breakthroughs. 'I don’t sense that the Israelis are feeling a huge amount of urgency,' said Jon Alterman, director of the Middle East Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. 'I feel like they are feeling much less urgency now than a few months ago.' U.S. efforts in Gaza As conditions, particularly in Gaza, continue to deteriorate, the administration is backing an Egyptian proposal for a two-day Gaza cease-fire that would see Hamas release a limited number of hostages and potentially open more routes for badly needed humanitarian assistance to reach the enclave, the U.S. officials say. President Joe Biden said Monday that he would join his staff in discussing the proposal. 'We need a cease-fire. We should end this war. It should end. It should end. It should end,' Biden said. One of the officials said the administration would support virtually any suggestion that leads to a reduction in suffering for Palestinian civilians and the release of hostages but stressed that 'we’re not holding our breath.' Secretary of State Antony Blinken ’s visit to Israel, Saudi Arabia and Qatar last week was aimed at gauging the region’s willingness for such a deal. Officials said Blinken came away from his meetings cautiously optimistic but acknowledged that previous similar hopes have been dashed. 'What we really have to determine is whether Hamas is prepared to engage,' Blinken said last week. He said the killing of Hamas military chief Yahya Sinwar helped open a window for new talks on a cease-fire proposal that has been languishing for months. To underscore U.S. support for a deal, CIA Director William Burns participated in weekend talks in Doha with senior Israeli and Qatari officials on a potential path forward. There was no immediate result, but lower-level talks are expected to continue this week. The prospects for the success of even such a modest proposal — which would fall well short of previous plans for three-phase cease-fire deal — are uncertain as Hamas, despite heavy losses on the ground, has rejected calls for anything less than a full-on truce and the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza. Hamas has yet to formally respond to the Egyptian plan, though Israel has signaled a willingness to consider the idea. Longer-term ideas for the post-conflict future of Gaza are a work in progress, according to the U.S. officials, who say that Israel’s battlefield assessments will play a major role in determining what Israel might agree to. Until now, Israel has adamantly rejected any governance or security role for the Palestinian Authority in Gaza, something that is a deal-breaker for both the authority and for Arab nations whose support will be critical for any plan to succeed. While the U.S. election may be a factor, even if there wasn’t the Nov. 5 vote, Israel is showing few signs it is motivated to pursue a cease-fire, said Alterman, the analyst. 'From what I know, it doesn’t feel like we are on a brink of a breakthrough,' Alterman said. U.S. push in Lebanon In Lebanon, where Israel has been intensifying military operations against Hezbollah for the past month, U.S. officials allow that a short-term fix is probably unrealistic. That’s because Lebanon’s fractured political leadership is distrusted by Israeli officials and because the Lebanese Armed Forces have yet to move convincingly to keep Hezbollah fighters from attacking Israel from southern Lebanon. Biden aide Amos Hochstein — who has been a point man on administration efforts to keep Israel and Hezbollah from entering a full-scale war — is expected in the region this week to get a sense from Israeli officials on what they would be willing to support. Depending on what he hears, he may then travel to Lebanon to explore what officials there would be willing to do to prevent further Hezbollah rocket strikes on northern and central Israel, officials said. Complicating matters in both Gaza and Lebanon is that neither Hamas nor Hezbollah have announced replacements after Israel killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and Sinwar of Hamas in recent weeks. ___ AP reporters Tara Copp in Washington, Aamer Madhani in New Castle, Delaware, and Abby Sewell in Beirut, Lebanon, contributed.	https://apnews.com/article/us-israel-gaza-lebanon-iran-hamas-hezbollah-a02b674e9a930313436a218da729795d	2024-10-28T10:54:34-07:00	
Brazil fines meatpacking companies, including giant JBS, for buying illegally raised cattle	BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) — Brazil's environmental agency has levied $64 million in fines against 23 meatpacking companies and their suppliers for buying and selling cattle raised illegally on deforested land in the Amazon. The operation, dubbed Cold Meat 2, launched last week. It tracked 18,000 head of cattle raised in 100 square miles (260 square kilometers) of pasture that has been banned for commercial use due to illegal deforestation. The agents also apprehended 8,854 head of cattle found inside the restricted areas. News of the fines began emerging over the weekend. Cattle raising is the main driver of deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon, with 90% of the area cleared between 1985 and 2023 converted to pasture. That represents 227,800 square miles (590,000 square kilometers), slightly larger than France. As a result, 14% of the Amazon is covered by grazing land, according to MapBiomas, a network of nongovernmental organizations that monitors land use. 'We are inspecting the production chain to hold offenders accountable for acquiring products from deforestation and to ensure that crime does not pay,' Jair Schmitt, chief of environmental protection at Brazil’s federal environmental agency, known as Ibama, told The Associated Press. Among those fined was JBS, the world's largest meat-packing company. JBS has applied to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange, a move that has faced opposition from some U.S. lawmakers and environmental nonprofits. It's not clear when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission may make a decision on JBS' bid. The JBS fine was $108,000 for purchasing 1,231 head of cattle, the fifth largest penalty among the fined companies. The operation followed three months of investigation by Ibama's intelligence unit and is the latest episode linking JBS to illegal deforestation. In December, AP revealed that it is facing lawsuits for allegedly purchasing cattle raised illegally in Jaci-Parana, a protected area in the Brazilian Amazon. In a statement, JBS denied buying cattle from embargoed areas and said it had already submitted documents to Ibama demonstrating their legal origin. However, the company declined to comment on the Jaci-Parana’s case despite repeated requests for clarification from AP since it published the story. 'JBS has maintained its Responsible Procurement Policy for 15 years and has a geospatial monitoring system in place to ensure that the company does not purchase animals from farms involved in illegal deforestation, encroachment on Indigenous lands or conservation areas that are under embargo by Ibama,' read the statement. Agropam, a meatpacker in Boca do Acre city, received the largest fine, $493,000, for buying 5,624 head of cattle from illegal areas. The company, which operates under the name of Frizam, sells beef only for Brazil's internal market. A message requesting comment was not returned. The other top companies targeted were Mafrico, Frigol and 163 Beef. Mafrico and Frigo did not respond to requests for comment left by phone and on their websites. Contact information for 163 Beef was not immediately available, as numbers on its Facebook page were disconnected. ___ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

South Africa submits its main legal claim to the top UN court which accuses Israel of genocide	THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — The South African legal team delivered a nearly 5,000-page document to the United Nations’ top court on Monday, the latest step in a case the country brought accusing Israel of committing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza. The document, which the International Court of Justice will not make public until a later stage in the proceedings, puts forth the 'main case' that Israel has a 'special intent to commit genocide,' according to a statement from South Africa’s President Cyril Ramaphosa. Israel has fiercely denied the allegations. The government called the case 'blood libel' when South Africa launched the complaint in Dec. 2023. On Monday a court official at the ICJ confirmed that they had received the document. The filing takes place as the Israeli military has called on Palestinians to evacuate northern Gaza, where it has been waging a large offensive for more than three weeks. The U.N. said earlier this month at least 400,000 people are still in northern Gaza and hunger is rampant as the amount of humanitarian aid reaching the north has plummeted over the past month. The Hague-based court has so far issued three rounds of emergency measures, ordering Israel to halt a military offensive in Rafah and open more land crossings for aid into Gaza. South Africa says Israel has refused to comply. 'Israel’s continued shredding of international law has imperiled the institutions of global governance that were established to hold all states accountable,' the president’s statement said. Palestine, Spain, Chile and seven other countries have petitioned the court to join the case. Israel now has until July 2025 to reply. Israel launched its military action in Gaza after Hamas-led militants on Oct. 7, 2023, attacked Israel, killing some 1,200 people — mostly civilians — and abducting 250 others.	https://apnews.com/article/icj-israel-south-africa-genocide-c16b0e8ad715ac41f489d3255964a373	2024-10-28T10:15:54-07:00	
US warns of visa restrictions for people who undermine Ghana's democracy	ACCRA, Ghana (AP) — The U.S. State Department warned Monday that it would restrict U.S. visas for people who undermine Ghana's democracy, ahead of the West African country’s general election in December. Ghana has held peaceful, free, fair and transparent elections for nearly two decades. The presidential and parliamentary elections will be held concurrently on Dec. 7. It will be the ninth consecutive general election since the country’s return to multi-party democracy in 1992. But allegations of voter roll irregularities this year have created concerns about a possible democratic backslide. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken was quoted as saying in a statement that the visa policy announced Monday would be directed only at people 'who undermine democracy' and not at the government or people of Ghana. Last month, Ghana’s biggest opposition party, the National Democratic Congress, or NDC, held nationwide protests demanding an audit of the voter roll, alleging it detected thousands of unauthorized transfers and erasures of voter names. Current President Akufo-Addo is stepping down this year after his second and final four-year term. Former President John Dramani Mahama of the NDC, who lost in the 2016 and 2020 elections, will face off with Vice President Mahamudu Bawumia of the New Patriotic Party in this year’s election. Last year, the U.S. State Department announced a similar policy of visa restrictions ahead of the Nigerian general election, restricting entry to people 'believed to be responsible for, or complicit in, undermining democracy in Nigeria.'	https://apnews.com/article/us-state-department-visas-general-election-ghana-74cbf5f1a608a1c39a0f2321741e8141	2024-10-28T09:56:12-07:00	
Fitness app Strava gives away location of Biden, Trump and other leaders, French newspaper says	PARIS (AP) — An investigation by French newspaper Le Monde found that the highly confidential movements of U.S. President Joe Biden, presidential rivals Donald Trump and Kamala Harris and other world leaders can be easily tracked online through a fitness app that their bodyguards use. But the U.S. Secret Service told the newspaper that it doesn’t believe the protection it provides was in any way compromised. Le Monde found that some U.S. Secret Service agents use the Strava fitness app, including in recent weeks after the two assassination attempts on Trump, in a video investigation released in French and in English. Strava is a fitness tracking app primarily used by runners and cyclists to record their activities and share their workouts with a community. Le Monde also found Strava users among the security staff for French President Emmanuel Macron and Russian President Vladimir Putin. In one example, Le Monde traced the Strava movements of Macron’s bodyguards to determine that the French leader spent a weekend in the Normandy seaside resort of Honfleur in 2021. The trip was meant to be private and wasn’t listed on the president’s official agenda. Le Monde said the whereabouts of Melania Trump and Jill Biden could also be pinpointed by tracking their bodyguards’ Strava profiles. In a statement to Le Monde, the U.S. Secret Service said its staff aren’t allowed to use personal electronic devices while on duty during protective assignments but 'we do not prohibit an employee’s personal use of social media off-duty.' 'Affected personnel has been notified,' it said. 'We will review this information to determine if any additional training or guidance is required.' 'We do not assess that there were any impacts to protective operations or threats to any protectees,' it added. Locations 'are regularly disclosed as part of public schedule releases.' In another example, Le Monde reported that a U.S. Secret Service agent’s Strava profile revealed the location of a hotel where Biden subsequently stayed in San Francisco for high-stakes talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2023. A few hours before Biden’s arrival, the agent went jogging from the hotel, using Strava which traced his route, the newspaper found. The newspaper’s journalists say they identified 26 U.S. agents, 12 members of the French GSPR, the Security Group of the Presidency of the Republic and 6 members of the Russian FSO, or Federal Protection Service, all of them in charge of presidential security, who had public accounts on Strava and were therefore communicating their movements online, including during professional trips. Le Monde did not identify the bodyguards by name for security reasons. It said movements trackable on Strava could lead to security breaches, especially when security agents travel in advance to places like hotels where leaders then stay and hold meetings. Macron's office said Monday the consequences of the issues reported by Le Monde 'are very slight and in no way affect the security of the President of the Republic.' Local authorities are aware of Macron's movements ahead of time and the places where Macron is staying are always fully secure, 'so the risk is non-existent,' the statement said. 'A reminder was nevertheless issued to agents by the chief of staff asking them not to use this app,' Macron's office added. Identifying the presidential bodyguards — some of them using their full name on Strava — could also help finding other details about their personal address, their family, their movements and photos they posted on various social media, all of which could possibly be used to put pressure on them for malicious purposes, the report stressed.	https://apnews.com/article/biden-trump-macron-bodyguards-security-strava-0a48afca09c7aa74d703e72833dcaf72	2024-10-28T09:50:16-07:00	
People opt out of organ donation programs after reports of a man mistakenly declared dead	WASHINGTON (AP) — Transplant experts are seeing a spike in people revoking organ donor registrations, their confidence shaken by reports that organs were nearly retrieved from a Kentucky man mistakenly declared dead. It happened in 2021 and while details are murky surgery was avoided and the man is still alive. But donor registries in the U.S. and even across the Atlantic are being impacted after the case was publicized recently. A drop in donations could cost the lives of people awaiting a transplant. 'Organ donation is based on public trust,' said Dorrie Dils, president of the Association of Organ Procurement Organizations, or OPOs. When eroded, 'it takes years to regain.' Only doctors caring for patients can determine if they're dead -- the law blocks anyone involved with organ donation or transplant. The allegations raise questions about how doctors make that determination and what’s supposed to happen if anyone sees a reason for doubt. Key is ensuring 'all doctors are doing the right tests and doing them well,' said Dr. Daniel Sulmasy, a Georgetown University bioethicist. An alleged near miss in Kentucky The 2021 case first came to light in a congressional hearing last month, with unconfirmed details in later media reports – allegations that a man who’d been declared dead days earlier woke up on the way to the operating room for organ-donation surgery and that there was initial reluctance to realize it. The federal agency that regulates the U.S. transplant system is investigating, and the Kentucky attorney general’s office said it is 'reviewing the facts to identify an appropriate response.' A coalition of OPOs and other donation groups is urging that findings be made public quickly and the public withhold judgment until then, saying any deviation from the industry's strict standards would be 'entirely unacceptable.' The number of people opting out of organ donation has spiked Donate Life America found an average of 170 people a day removed themselves from the national donor registry in the week following media coverage of the allegations – 10 times more than the same week in 2023. That doesn’t include emailed removal requests or state registries, another way people can volunteer to become a donor when they eventually die. Dils' own organ agency, Gift of Life Michigan, usually gets five to 10 calls a week from people asking how to remove themselves from that state’s list. In the last week, her staff handled 57 such calls, many mentioning the Kentucky case. The Kentucky allegations reverberated in France Unlike the voluntary U.S. donation system, French law presumes all citizens and residents will be organ and tissue donors upon death unless they clearly opt out. After the reports from Kentucky reached France, the number joining that nation’s donation refusal registry jumped from about 100 people a day to 1,000 a day in the past week, according to the French Biomedicine Agency. Dr. Régis Bronchard, an agency deputy director, said the spike 'reflects anxiety, incomprehension among the general public' that could have 'catastrophic consequences.' What’s supposed to happen after death and before organ donation Doctors can declare two types of death. What’s called cardiac death occurs when the heart stops beating and breathing stops, and they can’t be restored. Brain death is declared when the entire brain permanently ceases functioning, usually after a major traumatic injury or stroke. Ventilators and other machines keep the heart beating during special testing to tell. Only about 1% of deaths occur in a way that allows someone to become an organ donor – most people declared dead in a hospital will quickly be transferred to a funeral home or morgue. But most organ donations are from brain-dead donors. Only after that declaration does the donor agency assume responsibility for the deceased, looking for potential recipients and scheduling retrieval surgery — while typically nurses at the hospital where the person died continue care to ensure equipment properly maintains their organs until they're collected. What if something goes wrong? The donor agency and transplant surgeons arriving to retrieve organs must check records of how death was determined. Anyone – donor hospital employees, donor agency staff or surgeons – who sees anything concerning is supposed to speak up immediately. 'This is extremely rare,' Dr. Ginny Bumgardner, an Ohio State University transplant surgeon who also leads the American Society of Transplant Surgeons, said of the Kentucky case. In operating rooms 'the whole process stops' if someone sees a hint of trouble, and independent doctors are called to doublecheck the person really is dead, Bumgardner said. In her 30-year career, 'I’ve never had a case where the original declaration was wrong.' Georgetown’s Sulmasy agreed problems are infrequent. But he said there’s wide variation in what tests different hospitals perform to determine if someone’s brain-dead, whether they’re a potential organ donor or not. Doctors are debating whether to add additional test requirements. Stricter criteria could 'assure the public that we have done enormous due diligence before we determine that somebody’s dead,' he said. It could help 'to get people to stop ripping up their organ donor cards.' —- John Leicester, the AP's chief correspondent in Paris, contributed to this report. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.

Israel approves two bills that could halt UNRWA's aid delivery to Gaza. What does that mean?	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Israel's parliament has passed two laws that could prevent the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, a main provider of aid to Gaza, from being able to continue its work. The laws ban the agency, UNRWA, from operating in Israel, designate it a terror organization, and cut all ties between the agency and the Israeli government. It's the culmination of a long-running campaign against the agency, which Israel contends has been infiltrated by Hamas. But supporters say Israel's real aim is to sideline the issue of Palestinian refugees. The agency is the major distributor of aid in Gaza and provides education, health and other basic services to millions of Palestinian refugees across the region, including in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. The head of the agency, Commissioner General Philippe Lazzarini, called the move 'unprecedented' on X following the vote and said the bills 'will only deepen the suffering Palestinians, especially in Gaza where people have been going through more than a year of sheer hell.' Israel accuses the agency of turning a blind eye to staff members it says belong to Hamas, divert aid and use UNRWA facilities for military purposes. Israel says around a dozen of its 13,000 employees in Gaza participated in the Oct. 7, 2023 attack on southern Israel. The agency denies it knowingly aids armed groups and says it acts quickly to purge any suspected militants among its staff. The bills severely hamper UNRWA One of the bills passed Monday evening bans all UNRWA activities and services on Israeli soil and is set to take effect in three months. The second bill designates UNRWA a terrorist organization, severs all ties between government employees and UNRWA and strips its staff of their legal immunities. Together, the bills likely bar the agency from operating in Israel and the Palestinian territories, because Israel controls access to both Gaza and the West Bank. It could force the agency to relocate its headquarters from Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem. Lazzarini warned earlier this month that humanitarian operations in Gaza 'may disintegrate' if the legislation passes, disrupting the provision of food, shelter and health care as winter sets in. Gaza's population of some 2.3 million is almost entirely dependent on aid to survive. Around 90% of the population has been displaced. Hundreds of thousands live in tent camps and schools-turned-shelters, most run by UNRWA. Experts say hunger is rampant. Israel’s campaign in Gaza in retaliation for the Oct. 7 attack has killed over 43,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, whose count does not differentiate between civilians and militants. Israel is reportedly considering taking over aid distribution itself or subcontracting it, but it has yet to put forth a concrete plan. Any such effort would likely require a large number of troops and other resources at a time when Israel is at war on two fronts in Gaza and Lebanon. Other U.N. agencies and aid groups say there is no substitute for UNRWA, which also runs 96 schools hosting around 47,000 students, three vocational training centers and 43 health centers in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. A decades-old mission rooted in the conflict’s bitter history The U.N. Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees in the Near East was established to help the estimated 700,000 Palestinians who fled or were driven out of what is now Israel during the 1948 war surrounding Israel’s creation, UNRWA supporters say Israel hopes to erase the Palestinian refugee issue by dismantling the agency. Israel says the refugees should be permanently resettled in other countries, and Israeli opponents of the agency have suggested ending UNRWA services would force them to do so. Palestinians say refugees and their descendants, who now number nearly 6 million, should be allowed to exercise their right under international law to return home. Israel refuses, saying the result would be a Palestinian majority inside its borders. The issue was among the thorniest in the peace process, which ground to a halt in 2009. UNRWA operates schools, health clinics, infrastructure projects and aid programs in refugee camps that have grown into urban neighborhoods in Gaza, the West Bank, Lebanon, Syria and Jordan. A long-running dispute over UNRWA’s neutrality Israel says hundreds of Palestinian militants work for UNRWA, without providing evidence, and that more than a dozen employees took part in Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023 attack. UNRWA immediately fired the employees accused of taking part in the Oct. 7 attack, in which Hamas-led militants killed some 1,200 people and abducted around 250. An independent investigation earlier this year found that UNRWA had 'robust' mechanisms to ensure its neutrality but pointed to gaps in implementation, including staff publicly expressing political views and textbooks with 'problematic content' in UNRWA-run schools. UNRWA says it thoroughly investigates any allegations of wrongdoing and holds staff accountable, and that it provides lists of all of its staff to Israel and host countries. It says Israel has largely ignored its requests to provide evidence for its claims against staffers. Israel has repeatedly struck U.N. schools-turned-shelters, claiming Hamas fighters operate inside them. It also says it has uncovered tunnels running near or under UNRWA facilities. UNRWA has long been the biggest single employer in Gaza, where the population has been impoverished by years of Israeli and Egyptian blockade. Hamas has ruled the territory since 2007, and it has civilian political operations alongside its armed wing. The militant wings of Hamas and other groups are highly secretive, their members virtually unknown outside of intelligence agencies. That complicates efforts by civilian organizations to vet employees. Fatah Sharif, an UNRWA teacher in southern Lebanon, was killed last month along with his family in an Israeli airstrike. It then emerged that he was a senior Hamas commander, something he had kept secret. Lazzarini, UNRWA's head, said Sharif was suspended without pay in March after the agency learned he belonged to Hamas’ political party, and that an investigation had been launched. He said he didn’t know Sharif was a militant commander until after his death. UNRWA has strong international support Several Western countries suspended funding for UNRWA after the allegations related to the Oct. 7 attack. All except the United States, which had been its biggest donor, have since restored it. The Biden administration recently warned Israel that if it did not allow more aid into Gaza it could lose out on some of the crucial American military assistance it has relied on throughout the war. The letter sent by Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin to their Israeli counterparts said they shared Israeli concerns about 'the serious allegations' of UNRWA employees taking part in the Oct. 7 attack and of 'Hamas misusing UNRWA facilities.' But it said enacting the bills’ restrictions 'would devastate the Gaza humanitarian response at this critical moment ... which could have implications under relevant U.S. law and policy.' A joint statement from Canada, Australia, France, Germany, Japan, South Korea and Britain last week expressed 'grave concern' over the legislation. It said the agency provides 'essential and life-saving humanitarian aid,' the provision of which would be 'severely hampered, if not impossible' without it. ___ Frankel and Lidman reported from Jerusalem. ___ Follow AP’s war coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war	https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-un-aid-refugees-16bc0524adc947b95abe25d7d9eca038	2024-10-28T09:10:09-07:00	
Albania stops a ship suspected of harboring massive amounts of toxic waste from docking	TIRANA, Albania (AP) — Albania prevented Monday a ship suspected of transferring a huge amount of hazardous waste from docking at Tirana’s main port, officials said, after a watchdog group alerted authorities. The Turkish-flagged Moliva XA443A ship was kept about a mile away from the port of Durres, 33 kilometers (20 miles) west of the capital. Prosecutors ordered the containers to be seized and stored 'at an environmentally and physically safe place' to monitor. The Seattle-based Basel Action Network nongovernmental organization, or BAN, which focuses on environmental issues, said it flagged the ship to authorities in August following a whistleblower's note that its '102 containers' are suspected of carrying 'an estimated 2,100 total metric tonnes of ... waste pollution control filter dust from the steel industry.' BAN said the 'massive shipment' first left Durres on July 4th, 2024, on two Maersk chartered ships with the 'intended destination of Thailand.' The group said it also alerted several transit countries and collaborated with EARTH, a leading Thai environmental organization, and together raised the alarm about the shipment Thailand refused to accept the shipment, asking authorities in Singapore to stop it. The ships then docked at a Turkish port and the shipment was loaded on the Turkish-flagged ship, which briefly stopped at the Italian port of Gioia Tauro before going to Albania, BAN said. The customs documentation stated the containers harbored iron oxide, according to local reports. Albanian opposition accused the government in August of taking part in illegally trafficking hazardous material. Prime Minister Edi Rama said in Parliament in September that the shipment's documents were verified and that iron oxide is 'not considered as toxic waste in the European catalogs on which the environmental and customs procedure of our country is based.' Jim Puckett, BAN’s head, was in Durres when the ship arrived and called on authorities to have a public opening and sampling of the containers to ensure transparency. The group also wants to analyze the samples in 'different labs in parallel.' He told reporters they suspected the toxic steel furnace dust was collected from pollution control filters from an Albanian company and also illegally smuggled from Kosovo and Germany. 'It is up to the Albanian government to find a solution for their elimination,' Puckett said. Puckett told The Associated Press that government officials said the prosecutor’s office in Durres has taken control of the ship at the anchorage and that he can liaise with them to get the needed samples. 'We very much hope the wastes will be properly sampled and analyzed with third parties ... so that the public can trust in the result,' a BAN statement said. Albania is looking to integrate into the European Union and the government has been keen on aligning its hazardous waste policy with that of the 27-nation bloc, banning 'the export of hazardous wastes, household wastes, electronic wastes and plastic wastes to developing countries.' There has been no immediate comment from the Ministry of Tourism and Environment.	https://apnews.com/article/albania-toxic-waste-environment-organization-alarm-404112bd77ec535a33d486bbd6718c82	2024-10-28T07:35:23-07:00	
The Latest: Trump and Harris enter the final stretch of the 2024 campaign	Uncertainty reigns entering the final full week of the 2024 campaign with Democrat Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump locked in a fiercely competitive presidential contest. What happens in the coming days will be pivotal in deciding the winner of next week's election. Trump on Sunday held a rally at Madison Square Garden where several speakers made racist and crude remarks, including comedian Tony Hinchcliffe, who described Puerto Rico as 'a floating island of garbage.' Shortly after those remarks, Puerto Rican reggaeton artist Bad Bunny endorsed Harris. Trump plans to hold a rally in Atlanta Monday evening while Harris will make several campaign stops in Michigan, including a rally with singer-songwriter Maggie Rogers. Follow the AP’s Election 2024 coverage at: https://apnews.com/hub/election-2024. Here’s the latest: ‘We cannot rest on tradition’ Vice President Kamala Harris told an audience at a semiconductor facility in Saginaw County, Michigan, on Monday that their work represents 'the best of who we are as a country,' balancing the traditions of the nation and the desire to push technology forward. 'When we understand who we are as a nation, we take great pride in being a leader on so many things. And we have a tradition of that,' she said at the Hemlock Semiconductor facility in central Michigan. 'But I think that what we know as Americans is that we cannot rest on tradition.' Harris added: 'We have to constantly be on top of what is happening, what is current, and investing in the industries of the future, as well as honoring the traditions and the industries that have built up America’s economy.' Hemlock Semiconductor recently received a $325 million federal grant for a new factory. Trump will speak to reporters at Mar-A-Lago on Tuesday The Republican nominee for president will deliver what his campaign is calling 'remarks to the press' at 10 a.m. at his private club and residence in Palm Beach, Florida. It is unclear whether the former president will take questions. Americans in Puerto Rico can’t vote for US president. Their anger at Trump is shaping the race SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico — A comic calling Puerto Rico garbage before a packed Donald Trump rally in New York was the latest humiliation for an island territory that has long suffered from mistreatment, residents said Monday in expressions of fury that could affect the presidential election. Puerto Ricans cannot vote in general elections despite being U.S. citizens, but they can exert a powerful influence with relatives on the mainland. Phones across the island of 3.2 million people were ringing minutes after the speaker derided the U.S. territory Sunday night, and they still buzzed Monday. ▶ Read more about Puerto Ricans’ response to the remarks Biden criticizes Musk’s $1M giveaway as ‘inappropriate’ President Joe Biden said it was 'totally inappropriate' for Elon Musk to pledge to give away $1 million a day to voters for signing his political action committee’s petition. The billionaire and owner of the social platform X has gone all-in on Republican Donald Trump. The giveaway has raised questions and alarms among some election experts who say it is a violation of the law to link a cash handout to signing a petition that also requires a person to be registered to vote. 'I think it’s totally inappropriate,' he said in Delaware where he just voted. Since Labor Day, the campaigns have made more visits to Pennsylvania than to other states The Democratic and Republican presidential tickets are heading into the final week of campaigning with a familiar strategy: Rally supporters in the handful of states that will decide the race. Pennsylvania, Michigan, North Carolina and Wisconsin have received the most attention from Kamala Harris, Donald Trump and their running mates since the Labor Day weekend — the point when campaigning traditionally intensifies. The Democratic ticket has been more active over the past two weeks, according to Associated Press tracking of the campaigns’ public events. From Oct. 14 through this past weekend, Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, held 42 campaign events over the seven swing states while Trump and his running mate, Sen. JD Vance, held 25. There has been a stark contrast in Wisconsin: Harris and Walz visited the state eight times between Oct. 14 and Sunday, compared to just one visit by Trump and Vance during that span. The Republicans are headed back to Wisconsin this week, including a rally in Milwaukee. The AP tracker shows that from Labor Day through this past weekend both campaigns have made more visits to Pennsylvania (43) than to Georgia, Arizona and Nevada combined (40).

Biden calls Trump’s New York rally ‘simply embarrassing’ In response to Donald Trump’s New York rally where speakers made crude and racist insults, President Joe Biden said: 'It’s simply embarrassing. That’s why this election is so important.' Biden was speaking after he voted Monday in Delaware. 'Most of the presidential scholars I’ve spoken to talk about the single most consequential thing about a president is character. Character,' Biden said. 'And he puts that in question every time he opens his mouth.' Biden has voted in the 2024 election President Joe Biden waited in line for about 40 minutes Monday before he cast his ballot. He handed his identification to the election worker, who had him sign and then announced: 'Joseph Biden now voting.' As Biden voted behind a black drape, some first-time voters were announced and the room erupted in cheers for them. Alaska Sen. Murkowski says neither Trump nor Harris will get her vote U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, an Alaska Republican and outspoken critic of former President Donald Trump, says she won’t vote for him or Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee, in the general election. 'I want to vote for somebody and not against someone,' she told the Anchorage Daily News. She added she was disappointed with the choices from both major parties. Murkowski voted to impeach Trump after the Jan. 6 insurrection and also called for him to resign. She said she didn’t vote for him in 2016 or 2020. 'I am going to be voting for someone and hopefully I will feel good about that, even knowing that that individual probably is not going to be in the winner column,' Murkowski said. Murkowski declined to say who would get her vote. There are six other candidates on the Alaska ballot for president, including Robert F. Kennedy Jr. even though he dropped out of the race in August. Biden is waiting in line to cast his ballot When President Joe Biden arrived at the polling place at the Delaware Department of Elections on Monday, there was a long line of people lined up waiting to vote. He chatted with some and was pushing an older woman in a wheelchair who was ahead of him in line. They were all casting ballots early for the Nov. 5 election. Harris: Trump is ‘fixated on his grievances, on himself, and on dividing our country’ Kamala Harris said Donald Trump’s rally at Madison Square helped prove her point about the stakes of the election. Speaking to reporters on Monday, Harris said the Sunday event 'really highlighted the point that I’ve been making throughout this campaign,' which is that Trump is 'fixated on his grievances, on himself, and on dividing our country, and it is not in any way something that will strengthen the American family, the American worker.' Harris plans to deliver her closing argument on Tuesday in Washington. 'There’s a big difference between he and I,' she said.

US voters concerned about post-election violence and efforts to overturn the results: AP-NORC poll WASHINGTON — American voters are approaching the presidential election with deep unease about what could follow, including the potential for political violence, attempts to overturn the election results and its broader implications for democracy, according to a new poll. The findings of the survey, conducted by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, speak to persistent concerns about the fragility of the world’s oldest democracy, nearly four years after former President Donald Trump’s refusal to accept the 2020 election results inspired a mob of his supporters to storm the U.S. Capitol in a violent attempt to stop the peaceful transfer of power. About 4 in 10 registered voters say they are 'extremely' or 'very' concerned about violent attempts to overturn the results after the November election. A similar share is worried about legal efforts to do so. And about 1 in 3 voters say they are 'extremely' or 'very' concerned about attempts by local or state election officials to stop the results from being finalized. ▶ Read more about the latest AP-NORC poll Biden breakfasts in Wilmington with Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester President Joe Biden swung by a breakfast spot near his home outside Wilmington, Delaware, with a longtime ally who is vying to represent Delaware in the U.S. Senate. The president and Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester headed to The Legend Restaurant &amp; Bakery in New Castle. Blunt Rochester, who has served as Delaware’s lone House member since 2017, is trying to become the first Black woman elected to represent Delaware in the U.S. Senate. Biden formally endorsed Blunt Rochester in a video released on Sunday evening by the lawmaker’s campaign. He is set to cast his early-vote ballot later Monday before heading back to Washington. Harris says she’d take a cognitive test if asked to As former President Donald Trump continues to attack Vice President Kamala Harris with deeply personal insults, he has also suggested she should take a cognitive test. In an interview with CBS News, Harris said 'sure' when asked whether she’d take such a test. 'I would challenge him to take the same one,' Harris said. 'I think he actually is increasingly unstable and unhinged and has resorted to name-calling because he actually has no plan for the American people.' It’s the same line Trump used when President Joe Biden was still running for president as questions swirled about the 81-year-old’s age and mental acuity following his disastrous debate performance in June. Trump is 78 and is now the oldest candidate to run for office. Biden plans to cast an early ballot on Monday President Joe Biden plans to cast an early ballot on Monday near his home outside Wilmington, Delaware, according to the White House. For all but a few years since 1970, Biden has held office or has been running for one during election season. But this year, his hopes lie with a newer generation of Democrats, including three on the Delaware ballot looking to make history. Vice President Kamala Harris, who Biden endorsed after dropping out of the presidential race in July, is vying to become the first Black woman and first person of South Asian descent to serve as president. Meanwhile, state Sen. Sarah McBride is looking to become the first openly transgender candidate to be elected to the U.S. House. McBride is aiming to succeed Democrat Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester, who is looking to become Delaware’s first Black woman to win the U.S. Senate seat. She has served as Delaware’s lone representative in the House since 2017. Biden on Sunday evening formally endorsed Blunt Rochester, cutting a video for her campaign in which he called her 'Delaware through and through.' Harris highlights costs of living, abortion rights and border security as 3 immediate priorities Kamala Harris says she has three immediate legislative priorities when she takes office, should she be elected president. In an interview with CBS News, Harris said her first priority will be reducing costs for Americans with an expanded child tax credit and efforts to reduce the cost of groceries and make homes more affordable. The second is to work to restore abortion rights protections and the third will be to work on passage of a border security bill. Harris and Republican Donald Trump are in a tight race for the White House. Harris heads to Michigan Kamala Harris will focus on manufacturing jobs Monday as she heads back to Michigan. She’s set to visit Corning’s Hemlock Semiconductor Next Gen Facility. The Saginaw company received a $325 million investment from the CHIPS and Science Act, legislation passed by the Biden administration. She’s then touring a labor training facility in Macomb County. The election is in a week and one day, and Harris is hoping to appeal to many different voting blocs in the battleground states, in a dead-heat race with Donald Trump. On Tuesday she’ll give a closing speech in Washington.

Attack on a Chad military base kills 40 soldiers, presidency says	DAKAR, Senegal (AP) — Unidentified assailants killed at least 40 soldiers during an overnight attack on a military base in the country’s west, Chad’s presidency said Monday. President Mahamat Deby Itno visited the base in Barkaram, an island in Chad's Lake region, early morning and announced the launch of a military operation to track the assailants, according to a statement from the presidency. Chad has long battled with an insurgency in the country’s west, near the border with Nigeria. It was not immediately known who was behind the latest attack, but previous attacks in the region have been blamed by the government on the Boko Haram militant group. In March, an attack the government blamed on Boko Haram killed seven soldiers, reviving fears of violence in the Lake Chad area, after a period of peace following a successful operation launched in 2020 by the Chadian army to destroy the extremist group’s bases there. Schools, mosques and churches reopened and humanitarian organizations returned. Boko Haram, which launched an insurgency more than a decade ago against Western education, seeks to establish Islamic law in Nigeria’s northeast. The insurgency has spread to West African neighbors including Cameroon, Niger and Chad. Chad, a country of nearly 18 million people, has been reeling from political turmoil before and after a controversial presidential election that resulted in Deby Itno’s victory. He had led the country as interim president during the period of military rule that followed the death of his father in 2021.	https://apnews.com/article/chad-military-base-attack-50da737aa5f71456d19dbeaf9378d84f	2024-10-28T04:14:00-07:00

NATO confirms that North Korea has sent troops to join Russia's war in Ukraine	BRUSSELS (AP) — NATO on Monday confirmed that North Korean troops have been sent to help Russia in its almost three-year war against Ukraine and said some have already been deployed in Russia’s Kursk border region, where Russia has been struggling to push back a Ukrainian incursion. 'Today, I can confirm that North Korean troops have been sent to Russia, and that North Korean military units have been deployed to the Kursk region,' NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte told reporters. Rutte said that the move represents 'a significant escalation' in North Korea’s involvement in the conflict and marks 'a dangerous expansion of Russia’s war.' Adding thousands of North Korean soldiers to Europe’s biggest conflict since World War II will pile more pressure on Ukraine’s weary and overstretched army. It will also stoke geopolitical tensions in the Korean Peninsula and the wider Indo-Pacific region, including Japan and Australia, Western officials say. Russian President Vladimir Putin is keen to reshape global power dynamics. He sought to build a counterbalance to Western influence with a summit of BRICS countries, including the leaders of China and India, in Russia last week. He has sought direct help for the war from Iran, which has supplied drones, and North Korea, which has shipped large amounts of ammunition, according to Western governments. Ukraine, whose defenses are under severe Russian pressure in its eastern Donetsk region, could get more bleak news from next week’s U.S. presidential election. A Donald Trump victory could see key U.S. military help dwindle. In Moscow, the Defense Ministry announced Monday that Russian troops have captured the Donetsk village of Tsukuryne — the latest settlement to succumb to the slow-moving Russian onslaught. Rutte spoke in Brussels after a high-level South Korean delegation, including top intelligence and military officials as well as senior diplomats, briefed the alliance’s 32 national ambassadors at NATO headquarters. Rutte said NATO is 'actively consulting within the alliance, with Ukraine, and with our Indo-Pacific partners,' on developments. He said he was due to talk soon with South Korea’s president and Ukraine’s defense minister. 'We continue to monitor the situation closely,' he said. He did not take questions after the statement. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, citing intelligence reports, claimed last Friday that North Korean troops would be on the battlefield within days. He previously said his government has information that some 10,000 troops from North Korea were being readied to join Russian forces fighting against his country. Days before Zelenskyy spoke, American and South Korean officials said there was evidence North Korea had dispatched troops to Russia. The U.S. said around 3,000 North Korean troops had been deployed to Russia for training. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine	https://apnews.com/article/russia-north-korea-nato-ukraine-war-9b7357344d988ea32d8ca21f6e22dcc5	2024-10-28T03:27:36-07:00	
In wartime Ukraine, soccer fans bury rivalries and find a moment of calm at matches	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — At soccer games in Ukraine, crowd sizes are determined by the capacity of the nearest bomb shelter. For the first time since the full-scale war began in 2022, the Ukrainian Premier League is holding a full season with fans present, as martial-law bans on public gatherings have been eased. Despite the constant threat of airstrikes, Dynamo Kyiv supporters eagerly snap up the 1,700 tickets available for each home game at the 16,000-seat Valeriy Lobanovskyi Stadium. Many fans are keen to experience a rare moment of calm, free from the country’s traditionally intense sporting rivalries. While the war forced Dynamo to relocate its home matches in the Europa League to Hamburg, Germany, it uses its home stadium in Kyiv for domestic league matches. Vitalii Kozubra brought his 9-year-old son Makar to watch Dynamo, a title contender, face mid-table Zorya Luhansk, a club displaced by Russian attacks in eastern Ukraine. 'Even though there’s a war going on, this is something people can enjoy together,' Kozubra said, noting the friendly atmosphere at the stadium, where Zorya fans mingled with locals. Makar marveled at the difference between watching a game in person and on television. As the players took the field, all 22 of them draped in Ukrainian yellow-and-blue flags, the crowd, which included servicemen and families with children, erupted in applause. The stadium was alive with the sound of players’ exertion and the thud of the ball. Children rushed to the touchline for autographs, drawn by the few foreign players from Brazil, Senegal, Ivory Coast and Panama who have chosen to remain despite the war. Zorya wasn’t booed once. Sirens and shelters Ukraine’s 16-team top-flight league has managed to continue, despite increasing challenges. Matches are scheduled for early afternoon due to frequent power outages and the logistical challenges of travelling across Europe’s second-largest country during war. When air raid sirens interrupt play – sometimes for hours – players and fans alike head to shelters as alarms blare from loudspeakers and thousands of mobile phones. 'This season, we’ve been lucky in Kyiv, with no air alarms during our home games,' said Dynamo club spokesman Andrii Shakhov. 'But it’s a different story for away games... The longest one we had lasted 4½ hours because of four air alarms.' Ukrainian soccer players are subject to the draft at age 25 but clubs can apply for exemptions under business protection rules. Two teams currently play permanently outside their home field due to the war, amid broader disruption, while two others withdrew after fighting started due to stadium damage. The country's soccer tradition dates back to its Soviet past, when it was a soccer powerhouse, producing top-tier players and coaches. In the 1980s, fan movements often became expressions of Ukrainian identity, defying Soviet authority. After Ukraine declared independence in 1991, soccer continued to be a source of national pride through years of political and financial turmoil. Ukraine reached the quarterfinals of the 2006 World Cup and co-hosted the 2012 European Championships. Rivalries have been set aside At home, supporters’ groups have set aside violent rivalries for more than a decade, ever since they united to back protesters during the deadly 2013-14 uprisings against Russian influence. Later, they organized military recruitment drives to fight in the ensuing wars. 'Dexter,' a red-bearded Dynamo supporter and civilian contractor for the military, explained why the truce among rival fan groups still holds. 'It became necessary because we needed to unite against a common enemy. These internal conflicts lost their relevance when people from rival fan groups ended up fighting together in the same military units,' he said, while walking his dog along the banks of the Dnipro River. He added that fan organizations are involved in nearly every aspect of the war effort, from active combat duty to fundraising, veteran support, and providing technical skills like computer programming to the military. He and others serving in or working alongside the armed forces spoke on the condition that they be identified only by their call signs in keeping with Ukrainian military protocol. Dynamo officials estimate that more than 80% of their pre-2022 fanbase is now serving on the front lines in eastern Ukraine or performing other military duties. Soccer fans at the front Eight hours east of Kyiv, in the Kharkiv region bordering Russia, servicemen from the 3rd Assault Brigade played a match on a field near bombed-out buildings. Many of these fighters had been recruited through soccer-related channels and acquaintances. 'Organized fans play a huge role in this war because they’re highly motivated,' said a serviceman with the call sign 'Shtahet,' a Dynamo supporter currently on deployment. Combat medic 'Poltava' noted that soccer remains a vital morale booster. 'We get together whenever we can and rent spaces to play,' he said. 'There’s not much entertainment here, so football is our only joy.' Back in Kyiv, Dynamo fan 'Escobar' was grateful to catch a game while home on leave before heading back to the front. 'This is football, it’s a game,' the soldier said, in uniform and wearing a camouflage bucket hat, after Dynamo’s 2-0 win over Zorya. 'There are no bad feelings between the teams, and it’s great to see such a friendly atmosphere.' Vitaliy Buyalskyi and Maksym Braharu scored second-half goals for Dynamo, and even though Zorya players looked dejected as they walked off the field, they were still applauded by the fans. ___ Dmytro Zhyhinas and Evgeniy Maloletka in Kyiv contributed. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine	https://apnews.com/article/ukraine-war-soccer-football-russia-bd4904af397834c4d8fd2baa9b9f8b3a	2024-10-28T03:00:44-07:00	
Founder of far-right English Defense League gets 18 months in prison for court contempt	LONDON (AP) — The founder of the far-right English Defense League was sentenced Monday to a year and a half in prison for violating a court order barring him from repeating libelous allegations against a Syrian refugee. Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, better known as Tommy Robinson, admitted in Woolwich Crown Court that he was in contempt of court for violating a 2021 injunction by giving interviews in a podcast and shown on YouTube, and in a documentary he presented during a rally in London's Trafalgar Square in July that was also posted on his X account and widely viewed. Justice Jeremy Johnson said Robinson’s breaches of the injunction were not 'accidental, negligent or merely reckless' but a 'planned, deliberate, direct, flagrant breach of the court’s orders.' 'The defendant has not shown any remorse for his breaches of the order. It would have been surprising had he done so,' Johnson said. 'All of his actions so far suggest he regards himself as above the law.' Robinson, 41, who has been jailed in the past for assault, mortgage fraud and contempt of court, founded the nationalist street protest group EDL in 2009 in response to radical Islam preacher Anjem Choudary. Even after the group faded from view around 2013, he remained one of the most influential far-right figures in Britain and can still draw large crowds to the streets. This summer, police blamed EDL for starting what became a week of rioting across England and Northern Ireland after social media users falsely identified the suspect in a stabbing rampage that killed three young girls in the seaside community of Southport as an immigrant and a Muslim. Robinson, who was out of the country at the time of the attack, was blamed for using his social media presence to stir up the unrest. Although he was banned from Twitter in 2018, he was allowed back after Elon Musk took over the social network and now has 1 million followers on the platform now known as X. Thousands of people rallied in support of Robinson on Saturday in central London at a Unite the Kingdom rally that he planned but wasn’t able to attend because he had been jailed ahead of the hearing. Robinson was locked up Friday on a warrant issued after he failed to appear for the court contempt hearing in July and left the country for Cyprus. He had been ordered not to repeat false allegations he made in 2018 that a teen, Jamal Hijazi, was a violent thug who bullied and threatened other students at a school in West Yorkshire in northern England. Videos Robinson made about Hijazi were viewed more than 1 million times and led to abuse being directed at the boy. He dropped out of school and his family had to leave their home. Hijazi successfully sued Robinson for libel in London's High Court and was awarded 100,000 British pounds ($130,000) in damages and his court costs. An injunction was issued that prevented Robinson from repeating the allegations. But Robinson violated the injunction 10 times since 2023, most notably by airing a documentary, titled 'Silenced,' he made on the case that has been viewed more than 44 million times. Defense lawyer Sasha Wass insisted that Robinson was a journalist who believed in free speech and stood by the documentary, which she said was produced by Alex Jones, the U.S. conspiracy theorist who founded Infowars. 'He acted the way that he did, and he accepts his culpability, because he passionately believes in free speech, a free press and the overwhelming desire that he has to expose the truth,' Wass said. 'Having said all of that, he accepts the breaches as set out, but wants me to make it clear on his behalf that at all times he was following his principles.' Attorney Aidan Eardley, on behalf of the Solicitor General, said that disobeying a court order created a risk that others might not respect court orders. 'The harm here is that millions of people could see Mr. Yaxley-Lennon thumbing his nose at the court,' Eardley said. Robinson's supporters packed the gallery in court and crowded outside the courthouse during the hearing. Robinson, who stood in the dock in a gray suit and white shirt, looked at the dozens of people in the gallery and shrugged his shoulders as the sentence came down. He pounded his chest as he left the courtroom.	https://apnews.com/article/tommy-robinson-contempt-of-court-english-defense-league-2234f6eef821543feb688441c019384f	2024-10-28T02:55:09-07:00

Philippine ex-President Duterte says he kept a 'death squad' as mayor to kill criminals	MANILA, Philippines (AP) — Former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte told a Senate inquiry Monday that he had maintained a 'death squad' of gangsters to kill other criminals when he was mayor of a southern Philippine city. Duterte, however, denied authorizing police to gun down thousands of suspects in a bloody crackdown on illegal drugs he had ordered as president and which is the subject of an investigation by the International Criminal Court as a possible crime against humanity. Duterte, 79, attended the televised inquiry in his first public appearance since his term ended in 2022. The Senate is looking into the drug killings under Duterte, which were unprecedented in their scale in recent Philippine history. Duterte acknowledged without elaborating that he once maintained a death squad of seven 'gangsters' to deal with criminals when he was the longtime Davao city mayor, before he became president. 'I can make the confession now if you want,' Duterte said. 'I had a death squad of seven, but they were not policemen, they were also gangsters.' 'I’ll ask a gangster to kill somebody,' Duterte said. 'If you will not kill (that person), I will kill you now.' Sen. Aquilino Pimentel III, who was overseeing the inquiry, and Sen. Risa Hontiveros, pressed Duterte to provide more details but the former president responded in unclear terms and said he would explain further in the next hearing. Often cursing during the hearing, Duterte said he would take full responsibility for the killings that happened while he was president from 2016 to 2022. But he said he never ordered his national police chiefs, who also attended the inquiry, to undertake extrajudicial killings. 'Did I ever tell you to kill any criminal?' Duterte asked his former police chiefs. They included Ronald Dela Rosa, the current senator who first enforced Duterte's campaign against illegal drugs as his national police chief. 'No, Mr. president,' dela Rosa responded. Aside from the International Criminal Court’s ongoing investigation, there have been no known criminal complaints filed against Duterte in Philippine courts over the killings. 'I’m puzzled why the Justice Department hasn’t filed any case,' Duterte said. 'I’ve been killing people for a long time and they haven’t filed any case up to now?' Former Sen. Leila de Lima, one of the most vocal critics of Duterte who once investigated the drug killings in Davao, said there was adequate evidence and witnesses of the extrajudicial killings but they were scared of testifying against Duterte when he was in power. De Lima was arrested early on in Duterte’s presidency on drug charges she said were fabricated to stop her from proceeding with her Senate investigation. She was cleared of the charges and released from more than six years of detention last year. 'This man, the former mayor of Davao city and the former president of the Republic of the Philippines, for so long has evaded justice and accountability,' said de Lima, sitting near the former president. 'We have not made him to account after all these years,' she said, and added that witnesses could now surface and help prosecute Duterte and his associates. Arturo Lascanas, a retired police officer who served under Duterte for many years in a unit fighting heinous crime in Davao, told The Associated Press in an interview in 2022 that as many as 10,000 suspects may have been killed in Davao city on orders of Duterte and the former mayor’s key aides, including him. Lascanas, who has gone into hiding abroad, said he had provided his testimony and other evidence to the International Criminal Court. Duterte's associates may have removed the remains of the large number of victims buried in a quarry site in Davao city but Lascanas said the remains of some victims who were buried elsewhere by his group of policemen could still be retrieved and used as key evidence against the former leader and others. Duterte sounded defiant through the hearing. 'If I’m given another chance, I’ll wipe all of you,' Duterte said of drug dealers and criminals, who he added had resumed their criminal actions after he stepped down from the presidency. One of Asia’s most unorthodox contemporary leaders, Duterte ended his turbulent six-year term in June 2022, closing out more than three decades in the country’s often-rowdy politics, where he built a political name for his expletives-laced outbursts and disdain for human rights and the West while reaching out to China and Russia. Activists regarded him as 'a human rights calamity' not only for the widespread deaths under his so-called war on drugs but also for his brazen attacks on critical media, the dominant Catholic church and political opposition.	https://apnews.com/article/philippines-duterte-death-squad-killings-fc44bd8305f8e5468dcc6528825170fc	2024-10-28T01:34:11-07:00	
Georgia's president urges West to back protests against governing party after it claims election win	TBILISI, Georgia (AP) — Georgia's president on Monday urged the West to support opposition protests against the official results of a weekend parliamentary election in which the governing party was declared victorious amid voting irregularities and allegations of Russian meddling. Georgian President Salome Zourabichvili, who refused to recognize the official results, told The Associated Press in an interview that the South Caucasus nation has fallen victim to Russian pressure aimed at derailing its plans to join the European Union. 'We’ve seen that Russian propaganda was directly used,' said Zourabichvili, a fierce critic of the governing party. She said Georgia's government has been 'working hand-in-hand with Russia' and probably had help from the Russian security services. On Sunday, Zourabichvili stood alongside opposition leaders and urged Georgians to join a rally on the main street of the capital, Tbilisi, on Monday night to protest what she called a 'total falsification, a total stealing of your votes.' She told the AP that she expects the U.S. and the EU to back the protests. 'We need to have the firm support of our European partners, of our American partners,' Zourabichvili said. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on the social media platform X that 'the Georgian people embraced democracy yesterday' and urged Georgia’s political leaders to 'respect the rule of law, repeal legislation that undermines fundamental freedoms, address deficiencies in the electoral process, and move Georgia toward its Euro-Atlantic future.' The Kremlin has rejected the accusations of interference. 'We aren't meddling in Georgia's internal affairs, and we have no intention of meddling,' Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said. He charged that it was the West that had tried to influence the outcome of the vote. Asked about Zourabichvili's call for the Georgians to join protests, he described it as an attempt to destabilize the country. The Central Election Commission said Sunday that the governing Georgian Dream party received 54.8% of Saturday’s votes with almost all ballots counted. The party — established by Bidzina Ivanishvili, a shadowy billionaire who made his fortune in Russia — has become increasingly authoritarian over the past year, adopting laws similar to those used by the Kremlin to crack down on freedom of speech. The EU suspended Georgia’s membership application process indefinitely because of a Russian-style 'foreign influence law' passed in June. Many Georgians viewed Saturday’s vote as a pivotal referendum on the opportunity to join the EU. The election campaign in the nation of 3.7 million people, which borders Russia, was marked by a bitter fight for votes and allegations of a smear campaign. European electoral observers said the election took place in a 'divisive' environment marked by intimidation and instances of vote buying, double voting and physical violence. During the campaign, Georgian Dream used 'anti-Western and hostile rhetoric ... promoted Russian misinformation, manipulations, and conspiracy theories,' said Antonio López-Istúriz White, the head of the European Parliament monitoring delegation. The election observers said instances of intimidation and electoral violations were particularly noticeable in rural areas. Georgian Dream scored its highest share of the vote — almost 90% — in the Javakheti region of southern Georgia. In the capital it received no more than 44% in any district. Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze, a member of Georgian Dream, on Sunday described his party’s success as 'impressive and obvious,' and that 'any attempts to talk about election manipulation ... are doomed to failure.' Initial figures suggested voter turnout was the highest since Georgian Dream was first elected in 2012. The party has vowed to continue the push toward EU accession but also 'reset' ties with Georgia's former imperial master, Russia. In 2008, Georgia fought and lost a brief war with Russia, which then recognized the independence of two breakaway Georgian regions and beefed up its military presence there. The president of the European Council, Charles Michel, called on Georgian officials to 'swiftly, transparently and independently investigate' the electoral irregularities and urged the governing party to demonstrate its 'firm commitment' to the EU. Hungary’s Victor Orbán was the first foreign leader to congratulate Georgian Dream and will be the first to visit Georgia and meet the prime minister during a trip to Tbilisi on Monday and Tuesday. ___ Associated Press journalist Sophiko Megrelidze contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/georgia-election-russia-european-union-protests-f6667dd64b537bd2082bfc5396f4a955	2024-10-28T01:18:11-07:00	
Borissov appears winner of Bulgaria’s parliamentary election	SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) — The center-right GERB party of ex-premier Boyko Borissov appears to be the winner of Bulgaria’s parliamentary election, the country’s central electoral commission said Monday, with 98% of the ballots counted. Results showed the GERB party receiving 26.5% of the vote, nearly 12 percentage points more than the pro-Western reformist bloc led by the We Continue the Change party. Seven other parties also appear to have gained seats in the 240-seat chamber, according to the latest results. The far-right, ultranationalist and populist party Vazrazhdane came in third with 13.5% of the vote. Capitalizing on pro-Russian sentiments shared by many in this former communist nation, it demands that Bulgaria lift sanctions against Russia, stop helping Ukraine, and hold a referendum on its membership in NATO. The Movement for Rights and Freedoms, which traditionally represented Bulgaria’s large ethnic Turkish minority, recently split into two rival factions, one around party founder Ahmed Dogan, and the other behind U.S.-sanctioned businessman and former media tycoon Delyan Peevski. Both factions entered parliament — the first with 7%, and the latter with 11% of the vote. The remaining seats in the chamber will be divided between four small populist and pro-Russian groups, among them the Socialist Party — heir of the once-almighty Communist Party. It could take days before the final official results are announced. If confirmed, Borissov will be handed a mandate to form his fourth government. In his first comment after the vote, Borissov described his party’s victory as 'categorical' and said that he was ready to compromise to form a coalition with all other parties except Vazrazhdane. But it seems Borissov will face an uphill struggle to cobble together a governing coalition. Political analysts predicted that the results, which do not differ significantly from the six previous elections held within the past three-and-a-half years, will be followed by difficult coalition talks. They don’t rule out another election.	https://apnews.com/article/bulgaria-parliament-election-government-borissov-russia-e280c068db463f13c458735aa212d63e	2024-10-28T00:52:57-07:00	
The trajectory of Ukraine's fight against Russia hangs on the outcome of the US election	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — There is no doubt that the U.S. election will determine the trajectory of the war in Ukraine. The status of military aid from Kyiv’s chief international backer is dependent on who becomes president, as is any prospect for a cease-fire that could benefit Ukraine. Some in Kyiv say the country's very existence hinges on who wins the White House. As Americans vote, exhausted and outmanned Ukrainian soldiers are holding defensive lines under constant Russian fire, knowing the results will dictate their future. The war in Ukraine is one of the most divisive issues of the Nov. 5 election: Former President Donald Trump, the Republican nominee, and Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee, advocate very different views on how much support the U.S. should continue to give Ukraine. After a whirlwind Western tour, Kyiv’s leaders have tried to promote their version of what President Volodymyr Zelenskyy calls his 'victory plan.' They hope key decisions will be made — including Ukraine’s bid for NATO membership — by the new administration. For now, they have no choice but to wait. 'We believe that regardless of the last name of the future president of the U.S., the country of the United States will not give up global dominance, global leadership as such. And this is possible only through the support of Ukraine and through the defeat of the Russian Federation,' said Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Zelenskyy. Harris would likely continue Biden's policies Harris, who has decried President Vladimir Putin's 'brutality,' would likely carry on President Joe Biden's policy of support, albeit within the strict limits on Ukraine's ability to strike deep inside Russian territory that have frustrated Kyiv's leaders. 'President Biden has made it clear from the beginning of this conflict that his top priority has been to avoid an all-out war with Russia. I think that remains the top American priority,' said Malcom Chalmers, deputy director general at the Royal United Services Institute in London. The U.S. has provided Ukraine more than $59.5 billion in military weapons and assistance since Russia invaded in February 2022. But throughout, Kyiv has been captive to fraught American politics that often undermined its battlefield potential. Ukraine lost territory and manpower as weapons stocks dwindled during the six months it took the U.S. Congress to pass an aid package. Even promised military assistance has failed to arrive on time or in sufficient quantities. Ukraine is still hoping for Western approval of strikes inside Russian territory with longer-range weapons supplied by its allies. It also holds hundreds of square kilometers (square miles) in Russia's Kursk region after an incursion in August. Still, Biden’s commitment to support Ukraine has never wavered. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin announced a $400 million package during his recent visit. Zelenskyy said he expects another worth $800 million, the first tranche for Ukraine’s production of long-range capabilities. Still another $8 billion is expected by the end of the year. But for some, all that is too late. 'If the amount of aid that was promised but not delivered had been fulfilled, we could have entered negotiations in a stronger position with Russia,' said Gen. Lt. Ihor Romanenko, former deputy chief of the General Staff. Trump's vague vows and praise for Putin Trump has repeatedly taken issue with U.S. aid to Ukraine, made vague vows to end the war and has praised Putin. He also is considered highly unpredictable. Some Ukrainian officials even privately welcome this quality, saying it could bring about results quicker. But so much is unknown about what decisions Trump would make. 'He has emphasized that he has a very different approach to Ukraine than Kamala Harris. And if what he’s saying now is translated into action, then it’s going to be a very rocky period for Ukraine,' Chalmers said. 'Donald Trump is raising the very distinct probability that the United States will cut off most if not all military aid to Ukraine, which given that the situation on the ground, although deadlocked, is one which Russia currently has the advantage, could tip the balance in Russia’s favor,' he added. Podolyak said Trump 'understands the logic' of Zelenskyy’s plans after meeting with him. 'Mr. Trump realized that there is no way to agree on something in this war, because it is necessary to ensure Russia’s compulsion to understand what a war is, what consequences Russia will have in this war. That is, Russia can be forced to do something, but not asked.' Faced with Trump’s harsh rhetoric, some Ukrainian officials say that despite his stated views, his actions as president at times benefited Ukraine. Some of the toughest sanctions fell on Russia’s elite during his administration. Trump also approved the sale of lethal weapons to Ukraine, something President Barack Obama fell short of doing. Most Ukrainians fear Trump will halt all military aid to Kyiv, and no other country can match the U.S. support. Ukrainian soldiers remain defiant, saying they'll continue to hold the line, no matter what. But the practical implications would be dire, and Kyiv may be forced to accept devastating cease-fire terms, with a fifth of its territory under Russian control. 'If the aid is stopped, the situation will become more complicated,' Romanenko said. 'In this case, the seizure of Ukrainian land will continue, but we do not know how fast, because their offensive potential is not unlimited.' Zelenskyy's plans hang in the balance Zelenskyy has presented his vision for ending the war to both Trump and Harris, arguing for its necessity. He said Ukraine hopes for a post-election response from Washington, particularly on the question of NATO membership, insisting that such an invitation be irreversible. Both Ukraine and Russia are feeling considerable economic and societal strain to maintain the war effort. For the first time, Zelenskyy has openly discussed the potential for a partial cease-fire. But important questions remain about the fate of Russian-occupied territories. Russia has allocated a large part of its government budget to defense spending and continues to lose thousands of men. The potential introduction of what Zelenskyy has put at 10,000 North Korean troops signals that Moscow is having issues with mobilizing new conscripts. Ukraine's battered energy infrastructure and struggling mobilization drive is under far more pressure than Russia, however. Kyiv must find a way to de-escalate the intensity of the war and attacks on shipping and energy assets. 'In the end, it’s only going to happen if both sides calculate that they will get a net benefit from doing so,' Chalmers said. 'My concern would be in the uncertainty of the coming months when the Russians may believe that one last push and they can really get much larger concessions from the Ukrainians,' he added. Zelenskyy’s plans were developed with this reality in mind. It's why his team insists Russia must be forced to talk rather than convinced to do so. Without nuclear weapons to serve as a deterrent, NATO is the only logical alternative. 'I said, ‘We don’t have nuclear weapons, and we are not in NATO, and we will not be in NATO during the war. That’s why I need this package. And you cannot be against it,’' Zelenskyy said, describing his argument to reporters. ___ Follow AP's coverage of Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/ukraine#	https://apnews.com/article/election-ukraine-war-russia-harris-trump-b709d17bf1e81531853bd85fb8414ece	2024-10-27T21:58:12-07:00	
France's president is visiting Morocco after his Western Sahara change brings a 'new honeymoon'	RABAT, Morocco (AP) — French President Emmanuel Macron arrives Monday in Morocco, where he is expected to meet with the North African kingdom’s leaders and discuss partnerships regarding trade, climate change and immigration. During the president’s three-day visit to Rabat, he is scheduled to meet with King Mohammed VI and Prime Minister Aziz Akhannouch and address Morocco’s Parliament. It comes months after Macron changed France’s longstanding public position and backed Morocco’s autonomy plan for the disputed Western Sahara. The move endeared the country to Morocco and alienated it from Algeria, which hosts refugee camps governed by the pro-independence Polisario Front and has long pushed for a U.N.-organized referendum to solve the conflict. In the days leading up to the visit, Moroccan publications lauded the 'warm reunion' and a 'new honeymoon' between the two countries while French flags were hung throughout Rabat. France and Morocco have historically partnered on issues ranging from counterterrorism to Western Sahara. Morocco is the top destination for French investment in Africa and France is Morocco’s top trade partner. Morocco imports French cereals, renewable energy infrastructure like turbines and weapons. Morocco exports goods to France including tomatoes, cars and airplane parts. Moroccans are among the largest foreign-born communities in France, where North African immigrants are a key political constituency and a focal point of debates about the roles of Islam and immigration in French society. In recent months, France’s new Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau has pushed for the country to take a hard-line approach toward immigration and seek deals with countries like Morocco to better prevent would-be migrants from crossing into Europe. On Macron’s last visit to Morocco, he and King Mohammed VI inaugurated Al Boraq, Africa’s first high-speed rail line, made possible by French financing and trains manufactured by the French firm Alstrom. Despite close ties, relations have at times been fragile between France and Morocco, which was a French protectorate from 1912 to 1956. In 2021, Morocco suspended consular relations France momentarily reduced the number of visas offered to Moroccans in protest of its refusal to provide documents needed to deport people who migrated to France without authorization. Relations between the two countries soured further that year when a 2021 report revealed Morocco’s security services had used Israeli spyware to infiltrate the devices of activists and politicians, including Macron. Morocco denied and sued over the allegations.	https://apnews.com/article/morocco-france-macron-visit-rabat-76c3a7d87b0a86d89d7749909c69e4c8	2024-10-27T21:12:59-07:00	
Developers begin cutting trees in a Tokyo park that environmentalists want to protect	TOKYO (AP) — Tree-cutting began Monday in the Jingu Gaien park district of central Tokyo, a flashpoint for more than a year between environmentalists and real estate interests. Developers led by real-estate company Mitsui Fudosan have a 10-year, multi-billion-dollar plan to build three skyscrapers on the coveted land and to raze a historical baseball stadium, replacing it with a new stadium. A small group of protesters gathered Monday. They object to the destruction of trees in a city that lacks green space and is seeing many parks handed over to commercial interests. The plan is backed by Tokyo Gov. Yuiko Koike, who once was Japan’s environmental minister.	https://apnews.com/article/developers-destruction-park-tokyo-japan-tree-cutting-1dd27843bb70d1b2b6fe1285dd27d5fa	2024-10-27T21:10:14-07:00	
Woman charged with assaulting Australian senator who shouted at the king	MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — A woman appeared in an Australian court on Monday charged with a May assault on the Indigenous senator who shouted at King Charles III during a royal reception last week. The assault allegedly occurred on May 25, when independent Sen. Lidia Thorpe attended an Australian Rules Football match in her hometown of Melbourne. Ebony Bell, 28, appeared by a video link in Melbourne Magistrates’ Court. She has been charged with two counts of recklessly causing injury and three counts of unlawful assault at a stadium. A police statement described the 51-year-old senator’s injuries from the alleged assault as 'minor.' But she said in a statement to the AP on Monday she had 'sustained serious nerve and spinal injuries in my neck, which required spinal surgery and a plate to be inserted.' The assault was reported to police the next day and Bell was arrested on July 25. The women knew each other, but the motive for the alleged attack was not explained in court. Bell’s lawyer Manny Nicolosi told Magistrate Belinda Franjic the prosecution case had 'real deficiencies.' He said the prosecution had on Friday made an 'offer,' an apparent reference to a plea deal. 'I haven’t had enough time to really consider it,' Nicolosi told the court. Nicolosi explained that his Indigenous client hadn’t appeared in court in person because of 'recent threats.' The lawyer did not elaborate on those threats. Bell remains free on bail until she appears in court next on Nov. 22. The magistrate agreed to allow her to appear again by video. Thorpe made her first public statement about the alleged assault after she launched an expletive-laden rant at Charles during a reception in Australian Parliament House in Canberra last week. 'You are not our king. You are not sovereign,' Thorpe yelled at Charles as she was led by security guards from the reception. 'You committed genocide against our people. Give us our land back. Give us what you stole from us: our bones, our skulls, our babies, our people,' she added. The main opposition party has called for Thorpe to resign from the Senate due to her attitude toward Charles, who is Australia’s head of state, and have requested legal advice. Thorpe is renowned for high-profile protest action. When she was affirmed as a senator in 2022, she wasn’t allowed to describe the then-monarch as 'the colonizing Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II.' She briefly blocked a police float in Sydney’s Gay and Lesbian Madri Gras last year by lying on the street in front of it. Last year, she was also banned for life from a Melbourne strip club after video emerged of her shouting abuse at male patrons. She revealed her injuries after The Australian newspaper reported she had missed 16 of the Senate's 44 sitting days this year. 'I was ordered by the doctor not to travel and could not attend parliament after I sustained the injury and during recovery from surgery. My doctor told me to take time off work,' her statement said. 'I would have preferred to keep this matter private and I will not be commenting on it further at this stage,' she added. Thorpe was widely criticized for being disrespectful to the monarch during her outburst last week. She faces a further backlash next week when senators sit for the first time since the royal visit. Her office said Monday she has not decided whether she plans to attend senate committee meetings in person or remotely. She also raised questions about the validity of her appointment to the Senate when she recently said she had deliberately affirmed her allegiance to Queen Elizabeth II and her 'hairs,' rather than 'heirs,' during her affirmation ceremony in 2022 to exclude Charles. Thorpe later walked back that statement, saying the mispronunciation was accidental. Lawyers agree that a mispronunciation did not invalidate an affirmation and that Thorpe also signed a written version of the affirmation of allegiance with the correct wording. Sydney University constitutional lawyer Anne Twomey said the Senate's ability to discipline Thorpe was limited because her outburst occurred outside the chamber in Parliament's Great Hall.	https://apnews.com/article/australia-senator-assaulted-king-charles-lidia-thorpe-6433e69a991a429b7e26587bec7ac485	2024-10-27T20:36:14-07:00	
A French court postpones Gérard Depardieu's sex assault trial because of his health	PARIS (AP) — A criminal court in Paris on Monday postponed French actor Gérard Depardieu's trial on charges of sexually assaulting two women on a film set because of concerns about his health, shifting the start of the proceedings to March. Depardieu, who has denied any wrongdoing, is accused of using 'violence, coercion, surprise or threat' in the alleged sexual assaults that prosecutors say took place in 2021 on the set of 'Les Volets verts' ('The Green Shutters.') The court also ordered an expert to assess the 75-year-old actor's health issues. Depardieu’s lawyer Jérémie Assous requested the postponement, saying that the actor has heart trouble and diabetes-related issues. Assous said that doctors decided the actor was not well enough to attend the proceedings even though he was eager to appear in court. 'He is anxious to defend himself, because for over three years, a huge number of inaccuracies, false information and lies have been systematically disseminated and relayed,' Assous told The Associated Press. 'Now, finally, we’re going to be able to have the word of the defense.' Lawyers for both women also argued in favor of the postponement, saying that their clients want to hear Depardieu’s explanations. Prosecutors say that in both cases, women reported that the actor trapped them between his legs and groped their buttocks, genitals, chest and breasts over their clothes. Outside the courtroom, one of the plaintiffs, a 53-year-old production designer, said 'it was extremely difficult to listen to all this violence,' after hearing Depardieu's lawyer defending his client. 'He questioned everything … There were a lot of lies, about almost everything actually.' The Associated Press doesn’t generally identify victims of sexual assault without their consent. Feminist activists protest outside the court France continues to reckon with sexual violence in the wake of the #MeToo movement that initially struggled to find traction, especially in the cinema industry. Depardieu 'is a coward,' French actor Anouk Grinberg told the AP outside the courtroom. Grinberg, who played in 'The Green Shutters,' said she showed up to court 'because I can’t take it anymore... And the impunity, it’s got to stop, society can’t allow it'. About 100 people gathered outside the court on Monday, some holding signs, responding to a call from several feminist groups to show support for victims of sexual violence. Some activists made their way into the courtroom and sat among other members of the general public attending the hearings. Blanche Sabbah, a women’s rights activist, said 'we’re here even though Gérard Depardieu will not show up.' The plaintiffs 'have shown up. They’re here and I am here to support them. That’s why all of these feminists are here.' Prosecutors say there were witnesses on the film set According to Paris prosecutors, the production designer told investigators that Depardieu had earlier made sexual remarks and then one day, as she walked past him, he 'grabbed her, pulled her toward him, blocked her with his legs, and groped her waist, hips and chest, accompanying his gestures with obscene remarks.' Prosecutors said three people witnessed it, and that the woman made an attempt to break away from Depardieu’s grip and seemed 'shocked.' A psychiatrist examined her and granted her a seven-day leave, they said. After the incident, it was arranged for Depardieu to apologize. But in a TV interview that aired Saturday, the woman said the actor was furious and blamed her for causing trouble. Prosecutors said witnesses confirmed that what Depardieu had said did not constitute an apology. In the interview with French online news site Mediapart, the production designer — who spoke on camera but only gave her first name — said the incident had taken a toll on her personal and professional life for at least 18 months. She said she could not sleep well, suffered anxiety attacks and lost weight. The month before the incident, another woman working on the film set had complained about Depardieu, prosecutors said. A director’s assistant told investigators that Depardieu had touched her buttocks on several occasions. She said she had expressed her disapproval and in return Depardieu had been insulting toward her. She was also given a six-day leave by a psychiatrist. Members of the film industry back Depardieu Many have come out in support of Depardieu, including French President Emmanuel Macron, who later expressed 'regret' about not having spoken about the importance for victims to speak out. Late last year, 56 French performers, writers and producers published an essay defending the film star, saying that when 'Gérard Depardieu is targeted this way, it is the art (of cinema) that is being attacked.' Their call came just weeks after national broadcaster France 2 put out a documentary outlining accusations of sexual misconduct by 16 women against Depardieu, and showed the actor making obscene remarks and gestures during a 2018 trip to North Korea. In the footage, Depardieu can be seen making groaning sounds and sexual comments in front of women, including a girl about 10 years old who is riding a horse. He can also be seen posing for a photo, saying he was 'touching the bottom' of a North Korean interpreter by his side. Depardieu was charged in 2020 with rape and sexual assault following allegations from actor Charlotte Arnould. In an open letter, Depardieu said last year, 'I have never, ever abused a woman.' The actor was long seen as a national icon in France. He has been a global ambassador for French film and enjoyed international fame with several roles in Hollywood. —- AP Journalists Nicolas Garriga and Marine Lesprit contributed to the story.	https://apnews.com/article/depardieu-france-sexual-assault-film-d4f9a91e413483ceb49394e754e46d73	2024-10-27T19:42:09-07:00	
Myanmar's civil war reshaped in past year with coordinated offensive by powerful resistance groups	BANGKOK (AP) — Three well-armed militias launched a surprise joint offensive in northeastern Myanmar a year ago, breaking a strategic stalemate with the regime’s military with rapid gains of huge swaths of territory and inspiring others to attack around the country. Before the offensive, the military’s control had seemed firmly ensconced with its vast superiority in troops and firepower, and aided with material support from Russia and China. But today it is increasingly on the back foot, with the loss of dozens of outposts, bases and strategic cities that even its leaders concede will be challenging to regain. How did the offensive unfold? The military seized power from the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi in February 2021, giving rise to intensified fighting with long-established armed groups associated with Myanmar’s ethnic minority groups, and sparking the formation of new pro-democracy militias. But until the launch of Operation 1027, eponymously named for its Oct. 27 start, the military, known as the Tatmadaw, had largely been able to prevent major losses around the country. Operation 1027 brought coordinated attacks from three of the most powerful ethnic armed groups — the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army, the Arakan Army and the Ta’ang National Liberation Army, together known as the Three Brotherhood Alliance — and they were able to quickly capture towns and overrun military bases and outposts along the Chinese border in northeastern Shan state. Two weeks later the Arakan Army launched attacks in its home western state of Rakhine, and since then other militia groups and PDFs have joined in around the country. A year later into the offensive, resistance forces now fully or partially control a vast horseshoe of territory that reaches from Rakhine state in the west, across the north, and then south into Kayah and Kayin states along the Thai border. The Tatmadaw has pulled back toward the center around the capital Naypyidaw and largest city of Yangon. What comes next? Many expect the military to launch a counteroffensive when the rainy season soon comes to an end, bolstered with the influx of some 30,000 new troops since activating conscription in February and its continued complete air superiority. But at the same time, resistance groups are closing in on Mandalay, Myanmar’s second largest city in the center of the country. Facing threats from all around the country, 'it doesn’t look like there’s any viable route back for the military to recapture any of the territory that it’s lost,' said Connor Macdonald of the Special Advisory Council for Myanmar advocacy group. 'The military is on the defensive all over the country, and every time it puts its energy into one part of the country, it basically has to shift troops and then is vulnerable in other parts,' he said. What has happened to Myanmar's civilian population? As the military has faced setbacks in the fighting on the ground, it has been increasingly relying on indiscriminate air and artillery strikes, resulting in a 95% increase in civilian deaths from airstrikes and a 170% increase in civilians killed by artillery since the 1027 offensive began, according to a report last month by the United Nations’ Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. The Tatmadaw has been accused of deliberately targeting civilians in retribution for perceived support for the resistance militias, something it denies. Hundreds of thousands of civilians have been displaced by the fighting, and there are now more than 3 million internally displaced people in Myanmar overall, and some 18.6 million people in need, according to the U.N. What happens if the military regime falls? As the front has expanded it has seen militias advancing out of their own ethnic areas, like when Rakhine-based Arakan Army in January seized the Chin town of Paletwa, which has given rise to some friction between groups — foreshadowing possible future problems should the Tatmadaw eventually fall. At the moment there is a degree of solidarity between the disparate ethnic groups with the focus on a common enemy, but Aung Thu Nyein, director of communications for the Institute for Strategy and Policy-Myanmar think tank said that does not translate to common aspirations. Should the Tatmadaw fall, that could lead to the fragmentation of Myanmar unless the groups work hard to resolve political and territorial differences. 'The resistance being able to bring down the junta is unlikely, but I cannot discount this scenario,' he said. 'If we cannot build trust and common goals, it could lead to the scenario of Syria.' Complicating the political picture is the influence of neighboring China, which is believed to have tacitly supported the 1027 offensive in what turned out to be a successful bid to shut down organized crime activities that had been flourishing along its border. In January, Beijing used its close ties with both the Tatmadaw and the Three Brotherhood groups to negotiate a ceasefire in northern Shan, which lasted for five months until the ethnic alliance opened phase two of the 1027 offensive in June, accusing the military of violating the ceasefire. China has been displeased with the development, shutting down border crossings, cutting electricity to Myanmar towns and taking other measures in a thus-far unsuccessful attempt to end the fighting.	https://apnews.com/article/myanmar-civil-war-militia-1027-offensive-takeaways-63b33397204b8ff78ede24f1e699ceef	2024-10-27T19:34:44-07:00	
Resistance forces push military regime close to brink in Myanmar	BANGKOK (AP) — Three well-armed militias launched a surprise joint offensive in northeastern Myanmar a year ago, breaking a strategic stalemate with the regime's military with rapid gains of huge swaths of territory and inspiring others to attack around the country. The military's control had seemed firmly ensconced with vast superiority in troops and firepower, plus material support from Russia and China.

'To us it doesn't look like there's any viable route back for the military to recapture any of the territory that it's lost.' The military seized power from the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi in February 2021, triggering intensified fighting with long-established armed militias organized by Myanmar's ethnic minority groups in its border regions, which have struggled for decades for more autonomy. The army's takeover also sparked the formation of pro-democracy militias known as People's Defense Forces. They support the opposition National Unity Government, which was established by elected lawmakers barred from taking their seats after the army takeover. But until the launch of Operation 1027, eponymously named for its Oct. 27 start, the military, known as the Tatmadaw, had largely been able to prevent major losses around the country. Operation 1027 brought coordinated attacks from three of the most powerful ethnic armed groups, known as the Three Brotherhood Alliance: the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army, the Arakan Army and the Ta’ang National Liberation Army. The alliance quickly captured towns and overran military bases and outposts along the Chinese border in northeastern Shan state. Two weeks later, the Arakan Army launched attacks in its western home state of Rakhine, and since then other militia groups and PDFs have joined in around the country. Myanmar's military has been pushed back to the country's center A year after the offensive began, resistance forces now fully or partially control a vast horseshoe of territory. It starts in Rakhine state in the west, runs across the north and then heads south into Kayah and Kayin states along the Thai border. The Tatmadaw has pulled back toward central Myanmar, around the capital Naypyidaw and largest city of Yangon. 'I never thought our goals would be achieved so quickly,' Lway Yay Oo, spokesperson for the Ta’ang National Liberation Army, told The Associated Press. 'We only thought that we would attack the military council together to the extent we could, but it has been easier than expected so we’ve been able to conquer more quickly.' Along the way, the Tatmadaw has suffered some humiliating defeats, including the loss of the city of Laukkai in an assault in which the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army captured more than 2,000 troops, including six generals; and of the city of Lashio, which had been home to the military's Northeast Command. 'The 1027 offensive was a highly impressive operation, quite complex, and the use of drones played a big role because basically they were able to dismantle the military's network of fire-support bases across northern Shan,' said Morgan Michaels, a Singapore-based analyst with the International Institute of Strategic Studies who runs its Myanmar Conflict Map project. 'And then, once the military's artillery support eroded, they were able to overrun harder targets like towns and battalion headquarters.' A year later, the military is 'substantially weakened,' he said, but it's too early to write it off. The military has been weakened, but not defeated The Tatmadaw has managed to claw back the town of Kawlin in the Sagaing region, which had fallen in the first days of the 1027 offensive, stave off an attack by three ethnic Karenni militias on Loikaw, the capital of Kayah state, and has retained administrative control of Myawaddy, a key border crossing with Thailand, after holding off an assault by one ethnic group with the assistance of a rival militia. Many expect the military to launch a counteroffensive when the rainy season soon comes to an end, bolstered by some 30,000 new troops since activating conscription in February and its complete air superiority. But at the same time, resistance groups are closing in on Mandalay, Myanmar's second largest city, in the center of the country. And where they might be out-gunned, they have gained strength, hard-won experience and confidence over the last year, said the Ta’ang National Liberation Army's Lway Yay Oo. 'We have military experience on our side, and based on this experience we can reinforce the fighting operation,' she said. Thet Swe, a spokesperson for the military regime, conceded it will be a challenge for the Tatmadaw to dislodge the Three Brotherhood Alliance from the territory it has gained. 'We cannot take it back during one year,' he told the AP in an e-mailed answer to questions. 'However, I hope that I will give you a joyful message ... in (the) coming two or three years.' Civilian casualties rise as the military turns more to indiscriminate strikes As the military has faced setbacks in the fighting on the ground, it has been increasingly relying on indiscriminate air and artillery strikes, resulting in a 95% increase in civilian deaths from airstrikes and a 170% increase in civilians killed by artillery since the 1027 offensive began, according to a report last month by the United Nations' Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. The Tatmadaw has been accused of deliberately targeting civilians whom it believes support the resistance militias, a tactic that is only turning more against them, said Isabel Todd, coordinator for the SAC-M group. 'It doesn't seem to be having the effect that they want it to have,' she said. 'It’s making them even more hated by the population and really strengthening the resolve to ensure that this is the end of the Myanmar military as it’s known.' Military spokesperson Thet Swe denied targeting civilians, saying it was militia groups that were responsible for killing civilians and burning villages. Hundreds of thousands of civilians have been displaced by the fighting, and there are now more than 3 million internally displaced people in Myanmar overall, and some 18.6 million people in need, according to the U.N. At the same time, the 2024 humanitarian response plan is only 1/3 funded, hindering the delivery of aid, said Sajjad Mohammad Sajid, head of the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs operation in Myanmar. 'The humanitarian outlook for the next year is grim, and we anticipate that the deteriorating situation will have a massive impact on the protection of civilians,' he said in an interview. In some areas, however, the offensive has eased pressure, like northwestern Chin state, which borders Bangladesh and India and had previously been the focus of many of the Tatmadaw's operations, said Salai Htet Ni, a spokesperson for the Chin National Front whose armed wing has been involved in fighting the military. 'In October of last year the military convoys that were going up into the Chin mountains were withdrawn,' he said. 'As a result of the 1027 operation there have been almost no major military activities.' Success brings new tensions between resistance groups As the front has expanded it has seen militias advancing out of their own ethnic areas, like when Rakhine-based Arakan Army in January seized the Chin town of Paletwa, which has given rise to some friction between groups, foreshadowing possible future strife should the Tatmadaw eventually fall. In the case of Paletwa, Salai Htet Ni said his group was happy that the AA took it from the Tatmadaw, but added that there should have been negotiations before they began operating in Chin territory and that the AA should now bring Chin forces in to help administer the area. 'Negotiations are mandatory for these regional administration issues,' he said. 'But we will negotiate this case through dialogue, not military means.' At the moment there is a degree of solidarity between the different ethnic groups as they focus on a common enemy, but Aung Thu Nyein, director of communications for the Institute for Strategy and Policy-Myanmar think tank said that does not translate to common aspirations. Should the Tatmadaw fall, it could lead to the fragmentation of Myanmar unless the groups work hard to resolve political and territorial differences. 'As far as I see, there is no established mechanism to resolve the issues,' he said. 'The resistance being able to bring down the junta is unlikely, but I cannot discount this scenario, (and) if we cannot build trust and common goals, it could lead to the scenario of Syria.' Chinese interests and ties with both sides complicate the picture Complicating the political picture is the influence of neighboring China, which is believed to have tacitly supported the 1027 offensive in what turned out to be a successful bid to largely shut down organized crime activities that had been flourishing along its border. In January, Beijing used its close ties with both the Tatmadaw and the Three Brotherhood groups to negotiate a ceasefire in northern Shan, which lasted for five months until the ethnic alliance opened phase two of the 1027 offensive in June, accusing the military of violating the ceasefire. China has been displeased with the development, shutting down border crossings, cutting electricity to Myanmar towns and taking other measures in a thus-far unsuccessful attempt to end the fighting. Its support for the regime also seems to be growing, with China's envoy to Myanmar urging the powerful United Wa State Army, which wasn't involved in the 1027 offensive or related fighting, to actively pressure the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army and Ta’ang National Liberation Army to halt the renewed offensive, according to leaked details of an August meeting widely reported by local media. There is no evidence that the UWSA has done that, however. 'The idea that the northern groups and the Three Brotherhood Alliance etc. are somehow just agents of China is a complete misconception,' Todd said. 'They have their own objectives which they are pursuing that are independent of what China may or may not want them to do, and that's apparent in the incredible amount of pressure that China has put on them recently.' Because of the grassroot support for the resistance, it is less vulnerable to outside influence, said Kyaw Zaw, a spokesperson for the opposition National Unity Government. 'No matter who is putting pressure on us, we are winning because of the power of the people,' he said.	https://apnews.com/article/myanmar-civil-war-militia-1027-offensive-60c0edaed37153fde75b1b838670c441	2024-10-27T19:33:56-07:00	
Stock market today: Asian shares rise and the yen dips after Japan's ruling party loses majority	TOKYO (AP) — Asian shares rose Monday, as the yen dipped in the midst of political uncertainty after Japan's ruling party lost its majority in Parliament's lower house in weekend elections. In currency trading, the U.S. dollar rose to 153.76 Japanese yen from 152.24 yen. It was trading at 140-yen levels last month. The euro cost $1.0796, down form $1.0803. The weak yen is a boon for Japan's giant exporters like Toyota Motor Corp., whose stock gained 3.7% in Tokyo trading. Nintendo Co. gained 2.6%, while Sony Corp. rose nearly 2.0%. Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party is still the top party, but several members failed to win reelection in Sunday's vote after a scandal involving unreported campaign funding. All told, the ruling coalition with junior partner Komeito secured 215 seats, down sharply from the majority of 279 it previously held, according to Japanese media. A change of government is not expected but the LDP may need a third coalition partner. Tokyo stocks rose. Analysts say the ruling party defeat had been greatly expected and factored into markets from before. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 surged 1.6% in morning trading to 38,527.52. Australia's S&amp;P/ASX 200 gained nearly 0.1% to 8,217.80. South Korea's Kospi edged up 0.6% to 2,598.73. Hong Kong's Hang Seng added 0.1% to 20,614.74, while the Shanghai Composite rose 0.3% to 3,310.63. On Wall Street, U.S. stock indexes finished last week, drifting to a mixed finish, giving the market its first losing week since early September. The S&amp;P 500 closed little changed after having been up 0.9% earlier in the day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.6% and also posted its first weekly loss after six straight gains. The Nasdaq composite rose 0.6%. Company earnings reports, which have been mostly solid, continue to be a key focus for investors. More than a third of the companies in the S&amp;P 500 index have reported their latest quarterly financial results. Most of the results have beat analysts' forecasts. Companies from around the world are scheduled to report earnings in coming weeks. Treasury yields ended last week broadly higher. The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.24% Friday from 4.21% late Thursday. Yields have generally climbed following reports showing the U.S. economy remains stronger than expected. Wall Street will have more updates next week on consumer confidence, jobs and inflation. The Fed raised its benchmark interest rate to its highest level in two decades in an effort to tame inflation back to 2%, without sinking the economy into a recession. A key report on U.S. consumer spending is expected later this week, called the PCE. Analysts expect it to show that the rate of inflation has eased to 2%. The central bank started cutting interest rates in September and economists expect another cut at its meeting in November. Russia’s central bank on Friday raised its key interest rate by two percentage points to a record-high 21%. Moscow is trying to combat growing inflation sparked by military spending after its invasion of Ukraine. In energy trading, benchmark U.S. crude fell $3.19 to $68.59 a barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, fell $3.25 to $72.80 a barrel. ___ AP Business Writers Damian J. Troise and Alex Veiga contributed to this report.

Middle East latest: Social platform X suspends new account on behalf of Iran's supreme leader	The social platform X has suspended a new account on behalf of Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei that posted messages in Hebrew. The account was suspended early Monday with a brief note appended to it saying: 'X suspends accounts which violate the X Rules.' It wasn’t immediately clear what the violation was. The Elon Musk-owned social media company did not respond to a request for comment from The Associated Press. The move came after Israel openly attacked Iran for the first time this weekend. Khamenei said in a speech on Sunday that Israel’s strikes — in response to Iran’s ballistic missile attack this month — 'should not be exaggerated nor downplayed,' while stopping short of calling for retaliation. The X account opened Sunday with a message in Hebrew reading: 'In the name of God, the most merciful,' a standard Islamic greeting. Khamenei’s office has maintained multiple accounts for the 85-year-old supreme leader on X for years and has sent messages in a variety of languages in the past. A second message corresponded to a speech Khamenei gave on Sunday and was sent on his English account as: 'Zionists are making a miscalculation with respect to Iran. They don’t know Iran. They still haven’t been able to correctly understand the power, initiative, and determination of the Iranian people.' The message referred to Israel’s attack Saturday on Iran. This isn’t the first time Khamenei has seen a suspension or removal from social media. In February, Meta removed Facebook and Instagram accounts for the supreme leader over his support of the militant group Hamas after its Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel. Social media platforms like X and Facebook have been blocked in Iran for years, requiring Iranians to use virtual private networks to access them. ___ Here’s the latest: UN Security Council schedules emergency meeting at Iran's request UNITED NATIONS — The U.N. Security Council scheduled an emergency meeting Monday afternoon at Iran’s request on Israel’s air strikes against the country. Switzerland, which holds the council’s rotating presidency, announced the meeting on Sunday and said the Iranian request was supported by Russia, China and Algeria, the Arab representative on the council. Iranian president vows to respond ‘appropriately’ to Israeli strikes TEHRAN, Iran — Iran’s President Masoud Pezeshkian says his country will respond to Israel 'appropriately,' after Israel openly attacked Iranian military sites for the first time this weekend. 'We are not seeking war, but we will defend the rights of our nation and country and will respond appropriately to the Zionist regime’s aggression,' Pezeshkian was quoted by state TV on Sunday as saying. Pezeshkian also said the U.S. had promised Iran to stop the war in Gaza and Lebanon if Iran restrained. 'They had promised to end the war in response to our restraint, but they did not keep their word,' he said. The Iranian president also warned tensions will escalate if Israel’s aggression continues, adding, 'We know that the United States is encouraging Israel to commit these atrocities.' Iran says a civilian was killed in Israel's attack DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Iran announced Sunday that a civilian had been killed in Israel’s attack on the country, without offering any details on the circumstances of his death. The state-run IRNA news agency identified the dead man as Allahverdi Rahimpour and said he lived in a suburban area of southwestern Tehran. While offering no details on what he was doing or where he was killed, IRNA made a point to say he was not a member of Iran’s armed forces. Iran has offered few details on the attack and the damage caused by them so far.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-hezbollah-mideast-latest-28-october-2024-6e9675722f26251037569ee8ae655088	2024-10-27T18:55:06-07:00	
Brazilian soccer fan dies after ambush by rival supporters	SAO PAULO (AP) — Brazilian authorities said a Cruzeiro soccer fan has died after a roadside ambush by rival supporters in São Paulo state on Sunday morning. The fan was confirmed dead at a hospital in the city of Mairipora, 46 kilometers (28 miles) north of Sao Paulo. Local media reports said at least 12 fans were injured in the same attack. The Cruzeiro fans were traveling back to Belo Horizonte by bus after their team's 3-0 loss at Athletico Paranaense in the top-tier Brazilian league on Saturday. Brazil's federal road police told journalists the victim was a 30-year-old man, but did not provide more details. São Paulo’s public security secretariat said the attack was carried out by ultra supporters of rival Palmeiras. Footage on Brazilian TV showed a bus on fire and several Cruzeiro fans lying on the sidewalk as Palmeiras supporters punched them and hit them with sticks. Cruzeiro said on its social media channels that it 'deeply regrets yet another incident of fan violence' in Brazil. The club also said 'several fans were wounded.' Sao Paulo-based Palmeiras has not commented so far. ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer	https://apnews.com/article/brazil-cruzeiro-fan-death-ambush-0cb52ae9343a350a289a6c40764e605e	2024-10-27T12:23:41-07:00	
Shohei Ohtani set to play for Dodgers in Game 3 of World Series following shoulder injury	NEW YORK (AP) — Shohei Ohtani is set to play for the Los Angeles Dodgers in Game 3 of the World Series at Yankee Stadium on Monday night despite a partially dislocated left shoulder. Ohtani got hurt sliding into second base when he was caught stealing to end the seventh inning of Saturday night’s 4-2 victory over the New York Yankees in Game 2 at Los Angeles. 'I just don’t see him not playing Game 3,' Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said before Sunday night's workout at Yankee Stadium. 'If he feels good enough to go, then I see no reason why he wouldn’t be in there.' Ohtani did not travel with the team to New York in order to undergo imaging. He was on a separate flight. 'As far as test results, we’ve got doctors scrambling everywhere. I don’t have them,' Roberts said. 'This is more me going by the training staff, Shohei feeling good this morning, range of motion, strength.' Ohtani was due to arrive at the ballpark in time for the workout, which started at 6 p.m. EDT. Roberts said Ohtani had taken dry swings since the injury and was going to hit off a tee and take batting practice in an indoor cage. 'That’s going to be telling,' the manager said. 'He’s got to still go through the workout and swing the bat, but, again, today feels better than yesterday, and our assumption is tomorrow’s going to feel better than today.' Roberts said the injury causes pain but 'it's just everyone’s tolerance.' 'I don’t see him being compromised,' he added. 'It’s the left shoulder, which is the back shoulder. So I don’t see how that affects his hitting, if he’s able to go.' Seeking their eighth title and second in five years, the Dodgers lead 2-0 in the best-of-seven Series. Walker Buehler starts Game 3 for Los Angeles against Clarke Schmidt. Ohtani hits leadoff, and Roberts is counting on his presence. 'If he is able to play, willing to play, he’s going to play,' the manager said. 'Schmidt will know that Shohei’s in the box, so that means everything.' Ohtani clutched his left forearm after being tagged by shortstop Anthony Volpe for the final out in the seventh on a feetfirst slide. He laid near the bag for a couple of minutes before being tended to by athletic trainers and leaving the field. The likely NL MVP was 0 for 3 with a walk in Game 2. He is 1 for 8 in the first two games of the Fall Classic and is batting .260 with three home runs and 10 RBIs in his first postseason in the majors. A two-time AL MVP with the Los Angeles Angels, Ohtani joined the Dodgers last December for a record $700 million, 10-year contract. The 30-year-old Ohtani hit .310 with 54 homers, 130 RBIs and 59 stolen bases, becoming the first player with at least 50 homers and 50 stolen bases in a season. The two-way star did not pitch this season while recovering from elbow surgery on Sept. 19, 2023, and has been limited to designated hitter. 'Any time you have probably the best baseball player in the world, I think it’s going to help and frees up some of the other guys to kind of play with a little less pressure or a little more freedom,' Buehler said. 'He’s been awesome for the clubhouse and awesome for our team, so it’s been a cool year watching him with the 50-50, just kind of the day to day and the kind of human he is, as well.' Ohtani had been one of the few players on the Dodgers roster who got through the season without a major injury. Nearly every member of the starting rotation spent time on the injured list and the team led the majors in injured list placements with 36 and days on the injured list with 2,342. Among the position players, Mookie Betts was out for nearly two months due to a broken left hand, and Max Muncy was out nearly half the season due to a right oblique strain. Freddie Freeman is playing in the postseason with a sprained right ankle. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb	https://apnews.com/article/world-series-ohtani-dodgers-yankees-e9ad1f46a4a6f12b9aeb99c1dee08db6	2024-10-27T11:36:38-07:00	
British chef Jamie Oliver urges followers to help solve the 'grate cheese robbery'	LONDON (AP) — British chef Jamie Oliver is on the case of the stolen cheddar. Oliver, who rose to fame as 'The Naked Chef' on TV by stripping food down to its essentials, got cheeky in an otherwise serious plea to his social media followers to help solve the mystery of the missing 22 metric tons (48,488 pounds) of award-winning cheddar worth 300,000 British pounds ($390,000) that was stolen in a scam. Calling it the 'grate cheese robbery,' Oliver told his 10.5 million Instagram fans to be on the lookout for 'lorry loads of very posh cheese.' Nearly 1,000 wheels of cloth-wrapped artisanal cheddar were swiped from Neal’s Yard Dairy by a con artist posing as a wholesale distributor for a major French retailer, the company said. The cheese was gone before the company realized it had been scammed and reported the theft Oct. 21. 'If the deal seems too gouda to be true, it probably is! Let’s find these cheese stealers,' Oliver wrote. Cheddar, which is named for the village in southwest England where it originated, is the world's best-known cheese because it does not have the protected status of other regional products like champagne and, thus, is produced in many countries. But there are only a small number of real British cheddar makers, Oliver said. 'These are some of the cheeses, or most of them, that got nicked,' he said in a video accompanying his post. The cheeses were from three makers: Hafod Welsh organic cheddar, Westcombe cheddar, and Pitchfork cheddar. Detectives at Scotland Yard and international authorities are searching for the culprits. Neal's Yard Dairy, a distributor, wholesaler, and retailer of British artisanal cheese, has asked international cheesemongers to be on the lookout for the stolen cheese, particularly in 10-kilogram (22-pound) and 24-kilogram (52-pound) blocks. 'If anyone hears anything about posh cheese going for cheap, it’s probably some wrong’uns,' Oliver said.	https://apnews.com/article/great-cheese-theft-london-cheddar-jamie-oliver-fbaf6d697cd5c7e00de1c95d33837d52	2024-10-27T11:00:10-07:00	
Destruction of Lebanon-Syria border crossings in Israeli airstrikes creates difficulties	QUSAIR, Syria (AP) — A stream of refugees fleeing Lebanon to Syria crossed a narrow makeshift bridge on foot Sunday in the Qusair area of Syria’s Homs province after the official border crossing was put out of commission by an Israeli strike two days earlier. Only three functioning crossings remain between the countries, which share a border 375 kilometers (233 mi) long. In late September, an Israeli airstrike hit the border crossing of Matraba in Lebanon’s northeast, forcing it to close. A few weeks later came a strike on Masnaa, the main crossing between the two countries, putting it out of service. The Jousieh crossing was struck on Friday. The Israeli military has accused the Hezbollah militant group of using the crossings to move weapons and military equipment from Syria to Lebanon. But humanitarian officials say that the closure of the crossings have intensified an already severe humanitarian crisis by blocking key routes for supplies and impeding access for those fleeing to safety. 'The situation is a tragedy,' said Ghossoun Mubarak, who fled with her three children from the city of Baalbek in eastern Lebanon, describing the bombardment that pushed her to leave her home. They crossed via the makeshift foot bridge on Sunday. The United Nations refugee agency, or UNHCR, said this week that around 430,000 people had crossed from Lebanon into Syria over the past month since Israel launched a major aerial bombardment and ground invasion of Lebanon as part of its push against Hezbollah. Lebanese officials give a higher estimate of more than half a million people. Rula Amin, a spokesperson for the UN refugee agency, UNHCR, voiced concern over the damage to the crossings, calling them 'a main lifeline for people escaping the conflict.' 'Today, it was better,' said Omar Abu Jabal, 29, who was returning to Lebanon Sunday via the Jousieh crossing after a work trip. 'No issues along the way. But before, there were bombings, which stopped people from moving.' Nabil Aakoul, director of transportation for the Homs province, said the recent strikes destroyed a bridge over the Orontes River, disrupting movement between vital agricultural areas. Aakoul estimated that rebuilding the bridge will cost around 35 billion Syrian pounds (around $2.5 million dollars at the official exchange rate), while the damage has severed access to agricultural areas and isolated communities dependent on cross-river trade and travel. Yahya Abu Youssef, who lives near the damaged bridge, described the strike as 'inhumane' and reported injuries to children and livestock nearby. 'All that’s here is a bridge connecting villages and farms,' he said, noting that villagers now face an additional 10 kilometers (6 miles) of travel to reach the city of Homs.	https://apnews.com/article/lebanon-syria-israel-border-crossing-qusayr-hezbollah-051cf8de4bf5bb5a9448e562ec06fb19	2024-10-27T10:28:48-07:00	
Russian forces thwart attempted cross-border assault from Ukraine, official says	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Russian forces thwarted an attempt at another cross-border incursion by Ukraine into southwestern Russia, a local official reported Sunday, months after Kyiv staged a bold assault on its nuclear-armed enemy that Moscow is still struggling to halt. An 'armed group' sought Sunday to breach the border between Ukraine and Russia’s Bryansk region, its governor, Aleksandr Bogomaz, said but was beaten back. Bogomaz did not clarify whether Ukrainian soldiers carried out the alleged attack, but claimed on Sunday evening that the situation was 'stable and under control' by the Russian military. There was no immediate acknowledgement or response from Ukrainian officials. The region neighbors Kursk province, where Ukraine launched a surprise push on Aug. 6 that rattled the Kremlin and constituted the largest attack on Russia since World War II. Hundreds of Russian prisoners were blindfolded and ferried away in trucks in the opening moments of the lightning advance, and Ukraine’s battle-hardened units swiftly pressed on across hundreds of square miles (square kilometers) of territory. Responsibility for previous incursions into Russia’s Belgorod and Bryansk regions has been claimed by two murky groups: the Russian Volunteer Corps and the Freedom of Russia Legion. Russian officials and state media have sought to downplay the significance of Kyiv’s thunderous run in Kursk, but the country’s forces have so far been unable to dislodge Ukrainian troops from the province. Western officials have speculated that Moscow may send troops from North Korea to bolster its effort to do so, stoking the almost three-year war and bringing geopolitical consequences as far away as the Indo-Pacific region. Russian lawmakers Thursday ratified a pact with Pyongyang envisioning mutual military assistance, a move that comes as the U.S. confirmed the deployment of 3,000 North Korean troops to Russia. North Korean units were detected Wednesday in Kursk, according to Ukraine’s Main Intelligence Directorate, known by its acronym GUR. The soldiers had undergone several weeks of training at bases in eastern Russia and had been equipped with clothes for the upcoming winter, GUR said in a statement late Thursday. It did not provide evidence for its claims. Moscow warns West against approving long-range strikes against Russia Also on Sunday, Russian President Vladimir Putin said Moscow is working on ways to respond if the U.S. and its NATO allies allow Ukraine to strike deep inside Russia with long-range Western missiles. Putin told Russian state TV that it was too early to say exactly how Moscow might react, but the defense ministry has been mulling a range of options. Russia has repeatedly signaled that it would view any such strikes as a major escalation. The Kremlin leader warned on Sept. 12 that Moscow would be 'at war' with the U.S. and NATO states if they approve them, claiming military infrastructure and personnel from the bloc would have to be involved in targeting and firing the missiles. He reinforced the message by announcing a new version of the nuclear doctrine that considers a conventional attack on Russia by a nonnuclear nation that is supported by a nuclear power to be a joint attack on his country — a clear warning to the U.S. and other allies of Kyiv. Putin also declared the revised document envisages possible nuclear weapons use in case of a massive air attack, opening the door to a potential nuclear response to any aerial assault — an ambiguity intended to deter the West. Ukrainian leaders have repeatedly said they need permission to strike weapons depots, airfields and military bases far from the border to motivate Russia to seek peace. In response, U.S. defense officials have argued that the missiles are limited in number, and that Ukraine is already using its own long-range drones to hit targets farther into Russia. That capability was evidenced by a Ukrainian drone strike in mid-September that hit a large Russian military depot in a town 500 kilometers (300 miles) from the border. The U.S. allows Kyiv to use American-provided weapons in more limited, cross-border strikes to counter attacks by Russian forces. Civilian deaths reported in Kherson as warring sides trade drone strikes In a separate update, Bryansk Gov. Bogomaz claimed that over a dozen Ukrainian drones were shot down over the region on Sunday. Separately, a total of at least 16 drones were downed over other Russian regions, including the Tambov province some 450 kilometers (290 miles) north from the border, officials reported. There were no reports of casualties from any of the alleged attacks. In Ukraine’s southern city of Kherson, Russian shelling killed three civilians on Sunday, local Gov. Oleksandr Prokudin claimed. Another Kherson resident died in a blaze sparked by shells hitting a high-rise, according to Ukraine’s Emergency Service. Air raid sirens wailed for over three hours in Kyiv overnight into Sunday, and city authorities later reported that 'around 10' drones had been shot down. They said no one had been hurt. Ukraine’s air force on Sunday reported that it had shot down 41 drones launched by Russia across Ukrainian territory. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-incursion-kursk-5e37bb46493fa704f942e21c9203334c	2024-10-27T09:41:47-07:00	
Iran’s imprisoned Nobel Peace Prize laureate hospitalized with severe health issues	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Iranian authorities have allowed imprisoned Nobel Peace Prize laureate Narges Mohammadi to be hospitalized after almost nine weeks of feeling sick, a group campaigning for the activist said Sunday. The Free Narges Coalition said in a statement that Mohammadi must be granted a medical furlough to receive comprehensive treatment for multiple conditions. It said that just transferring her to the hospital will not address the severe health issues caused by months of neglect and deprivation. Mohammadi is being held at Iran’s notorious Evin Prison, which houses political prisoners and those with Western ties. She already had been serving a 30-month sentence, to which 15 more months were added in January. On Saturday, Iranian authorities issued an additional six-month sentence against her after she staged a protest against the execution of another political prisoner in the women’s ward of Evin Prison on Aug. 6. Mohammadi suffers from heart disease, and according to her medical report issued in September, the main artery of her heart has again developed a serious complication. The coalition said that they continue to demand the unconditional release of Mohammadi and her full access to medical care. Mohammadi is the 19th woman to win the Nobel Peace Prize and the second Iranian woman after human rights activist Shirin Ebadi in 2003. Mohammadi, 52, has kept up her activism despite numerous arrests by Iranian authorities and years behind bars.	https://apnews.com/article/iran-nobel-narges-mohammadi-hospital-71e1ed0c26b0cfa43c521caa619dab99	2024-10-27T07:34:22-07:00	
Bolivia's former President Evo Morales claims his car was shot at in attempted assassination	LA PAZ, Bolivia (AP) — Former President Evo Morales of Bolivia claimed he survived an assassination attempt on Sunday after unidentified men opened fire on his car. He was not injured and there was no immediate confirmation of the attack from authorities. Morales alleged the shots were fired while he was being driven in Bolivia’s coca leaf-growing region of Chapare, the ex-president's rural stronghold whose residents have blockaded the country’s main east-west highway for the past two weeks. The roadblocks — protesting what Morales' supporters decry as President Luis Arce’s attempts to sabotage his former mentor and bitter political rival — have isolated cities and disrupted food and fuel supplies. Morales, who led Bolivia from 2006-2019, emerged unscathed from the alleged attack Sunday, appearing on his weekly radio show in his usual calm manner to recount what happened. He told the radio host that as he was leaving home for the radio station, hooded men fired at least 14 shots at his car, wounding his driver. Morales was quick to blame his successor, President Arce, with whom he is fighting to be the candidate of governing socialist party in next year’s presidential election. He claimed that Arce's government resorted to physical force having been unable to defeat him politically. 'Arce is going to go down as the worst president in history,' Morales said. 'Shooting a former president is the last straw.' Officials in Arce's government did not respond to requests for comment on the incident. Cellphone video circulating online shows Morales' driver bleeding from the back of his head. Morales can be seen in the passenger's seat holding a phone to his ear as the vehicle swerves and a woman's voice shrieks 'Duck!' The footage shows the car’s front windshield cracked by at least three bullets and its rear windshield shattered. Morales can be heard saying, 'Papacho has been shot in the head,' apparently referring to his driver. 'They are shooting at us,' Morales continues on the phone. 'They shot the tire of the car and it stopped on the road.' Morales' claim deepens political tensions in Bolivia at a volatile moment for the cash-strapped Andean nation of 12 million. In June there was an alleged attempted coup by a rogue general. Last month Morales led a massive march against the government's mismanagement of the economy that quickly devolved into street clashes with pro-government mobs. Imported goods are scarce and prices are rising. Drivers wait for hours to fill up at gas stations. The gap between the official and black-market exchange rates is widening. Earlier this month, the feud between Morales and Arce moved to the courts as Bolivian prosecutors launched an investigation into accusations that Morales fathered a child with a 15-year-old girl in 2016, classifying their relationship as statutory rape. Morales has dismissed the allegations as politically motivated and refused to testify in the case. Since reports surfaced of a possible arrest warrant against him, the ex-president has been holed up in the Chapare region, in central Bolivia, where supportive coca growers have kept vigilant watch to protect him from arrest. President Arce accuses Morales of trying to undermine his administration to advance his own ambitions. —— DeBre reported from Buenos Aires, Argentina	https://apnews.com/article/bolivia-morales-assassination-attempt-fdddc18fb237d6030782dc49bc4df9cb	2024-10-27T06:30:25-07:00	
On Navajo Nation, a push to electrify more homes on the vast reservation	HALCHITA, Utah (AP) — After a five-year wait, Lorraine Black and Ricky Gillis heard the rumblings of an electrical crew reach their home on the sprawling Navajo Nation. In five days' time, their home would be connected to the power grid, replacing their reliance on a few solar panels and propane lanterns. No longer would the CPAP machine Gillis uses for sleep apnea or his home heart monitor transmitting information to doctors 400 miles away face interruptions due to intermittent power. It also means Black and Gillis can now use more than a few appliances — such as a fridge, a TV, and an evaporative cooling unit — at the same time. 'We’re one of the luckiest people who get to get electric,' Gillis said. Many Navajo families still live without running water and electricity, a product of historic neglect and the struggle to get services to far-flung homes on the 27,000-square-mile (70,000-square-kilometer) Native American reservation that lies in parts of Arizona, New Mexico and Utah. Some rely on solar panels or generators, which can be patchy, and others have no electricity whatsoever. Gillis and Black filed an application to connect their home back in 2019. But when the coronavirus pandemic started ravaging the tribe and everything besides essential services was shut down on the reservation, it further stalled the process. Their wait highlights the persistent challenges in electrifying every Navajo home, even with recent injections of federal money for tribal infrastructure and services and as extreme heat in the Southwest intensified by climate change adds to the urgency. ______ EDITOR’S NOTE: This is part of a series of on how tribes and Indigenous communities are coping with and combating climate change. ______ 'We are a part of America that a lot of the time feels kind of left out,' said Vircynthia Charley, district manager at the Navajo Tribal Utility Authority, a non-for-profit utility that provides electric, water, wastewater, natural gas and solar energy services. For years, the Navajo Tribal Utility Authority has worked to get more Navajo homes connected to the grid faster. Under a program called Light Up Navajo, which uses a mix of private and public funding, outside utilities from across the U.S. send electric crews to help connect homes and extend power lines. But installing power on the reservation roughly the size of West Virginia is time-consuming and expensive due to its rugged geography and the vast distances between homes. Drilling for power poles there can take several hours because of underground rock deposits while some homes near Monument Valley must have power lines installed underground to meet strict regulations around development in the area. About 32% of Navajo homes still have no electricity. Connecting the remaining 10,400 homes on the reservation would cost $416 million, said Deenise Becenti, government and public affairs manager at the utility. This year, Light Up Navajo connected 170 more families to the grid. Since the program started in 2019, 882 Navajo families have had their homes electrified. If the program stays funded, Becenti said it could take another 26 years to connect every home on the reservation. Those that get connected immediately reap the benefits. Until this month, Black and Gillis' solar panels that the utility installed a few years ago would last about two to three days before their battery drained in cloudy weather. It would take another two days to recharge. 'You had to really watch the watts and whatever you’re using on a cloudy day,' Gillis said. Then a volunteer power crew from Colorado helped install 14 power poles while the tribal utility authority drilled holes six feet deep in which the poles would sit. The crew then ran a wire about a mile down a red sand road from the main power line to the couple's home. 'The lights are brighter,' Black remarked after her home was connected. In recent years, significantly more federal money has been allocated for tribes to improve infrastructure on reservations, including $32 billion from the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 — of which Navajo Nation received $112 million for electric connections. The Navajo tribal utility also received $17 million through the Biden administration's climate law, known as the Inflation Reduction Act, to connect families to the electric grid. But it can be slow to see the effects of that money on the ground due to bureaucracy and logistics. Next spring, the tribal utility authority hopes to connect another 150 homes, including the home of Priscilla and Leo Dan. For the couple, having grid electricity at their home near Navajo Mountain in Arizona would end a nearly 12 year wait. They currently live in a recreational vehicle elsewhere closer to their jobs, but have worked on their home on the reservation for years. With power there, they could spend more time where Priscilla grew up and where her dad still lives. It would make life simpler, Priscilla said.

Analysis: Iran faces tough choices in deciding how to respond to Israeli strikes	JERUSALEM (AP) — It's Iran's move now. How the Islamic Republic chooses to respond to the unusually public Israeli aerial assault on its homeland could determine whether the region spirals further toward all-out war or holds steady at an already devastating and destabilizing level of violence. In the coldly calculating realm of Middle East geopolitics, a strike of the kind that Israel delivered before dawn Saturday would typically be met with a forceful response. Retaliating militarily would allow Iran's clerical leadership to show strength not only to its own citizens but also to Hamas in Gaza and Lebanon's Hezbollah, the militant groups battling Israel that are the vanguard of Tehran's so-called Axis of Resistance. It is too soon to say whether Iran's leadership will follow that path. Tehran may opt to hold back from forcefully retaliating directly for now, not least because doing so might reveal its weaknesses and invite a more potent Israeli response, analysts say. 'Iran will play down the impact of the strikes, which are in fact quite serious,' said Sanam Vakil, the director of the Middle East and North Africa program at the London-based think tank Chatham House. She said Iran is 'boxed in' by military and economic constraints, and the uncertainty caused by the U.S. election and its impact on American policy in the region. Even while the Mideast wars rage, Iran's reformist President Masoud Pezeshkian has been signaling his nation wants a new nuclear deal with the U.S. to ease crushing international sanctions. A carefully worded statement from Iran’s military issued Saturday night appeared to offer some wiggle room for the Islamic Republic to back away from further escalation. It suggested that a cease-fire in the Gaza Strip and Lebanon was more important than any retaliation against Israel. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's ultimate decision-maker, was also measured in his first comments on the strike Sunday. He said the attack 'should not be exaggerated nor downplayed,' and he stopped short of calling for an immediate military response. Saturday's strikes targeted Iranian air defense missile batteries and missile production facilities, according to the Israeli military. With that, Israel has exposed vulnerabilities in Iran’s air defenses and can still step up its attacks, analysts say. Satellite photos analyzed by The Associated Press indicate Israel's raid damaged facilities at the Parchin military base southeast of Tehran that experts previously linked to Iran's onetime nuclear weapons program and another base tied to its ballistic missile program. Current nuclear facilities were not struck, however. Rafael Mariano Grossi, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, confirmed that on X, saying 'Iran’s nuclear facilities have not been impacted.' Israel has been aggressively bringing the fight to the Iranian-backed militant group Hezbollah, killing its leader and targeting operatives in an audacious exploding pager attack. 'Any Iranian attempt to retaliate will have to contend with the fact that Hezbollah, its most important ally against Israel, has been significantly degraded and its conventional weapons systems have twice been largely repelled,' said Ali Vaez, the Iran project director at the International Crisis Group, who expects Iran to hold its fire for now. That's true even if Israel held back, as appears to be the case. Some prominent figures in Israel, such as opposition leader Yair Lapid, are already saying the attacks didn't go far enough. Regional experts suggested that Israel's relatively limited target list was intentionally calibrated to make it easier for Iran to back away from escalation. As Yoel Guzansky, who formerly worked for Israel’s National Security Council and is now a researcher at the Tel Aviv-based Institute for National Security Studies, put it: Israel's decision to focus on purely military targets 'allows them to save face.' Israel's target choices may also be a reflection at least in part of its capabilities. It is unlikely able to destroy Iran's nuclear facilities on its own and would require help from the United States, Guzansky said. Besides, Israel still has leverage to go after higher-value targets should Iran retaliate — particularly now that nodes in its air defenses have been destroyed. 'You preserve for yourself all kinds of contingency plans,' Guzansky said. Thomas Juneau, a University of Ottawa professor focused on Iran and the wider Middle East, wrote on X that the fact Iranian media initially downplayed the strikes suggests Tehran may want to avoid further escalation. Yet it faces a dilemma. 'If it retaliates, it risks an escalation in which its weakness means it loses more,' he wrote. 'If it does not retaliate, it projects a signal of weakness.' Vakil agreed that Iran's response was likely to be muted and that the strikes were designed to minimize the potential for escalation 'Israel has yet again shown its military precision and capabilities are far superior to that of Iran,' she said. One thing is certain: The Mideast is in uncharted territory. For decades, leaders and strategists in the Middle East leaders have speculated about if and how Israel might one day openly strike Iran, just as they wondered what direct attacks by Iran, rather than by its proxy militant groups, would look like. Today, it's a reality. Yet the playbook on either side isn't clear, and may still be being written. 'There appears to be a major mismatch both in terms of the sword each side wields and the shield it can deploy,' Vaez said. 'While both sides have calibrated and calculated how quickly they climb the escalation ladder, they are in an entirely new territory now, where the new red lines are nebulous and the old ones have turned pink,' he said. ___ EDITOR'S NOTE — Adam Schreck, the Asia-Pacific news director for The Associated Press, spent years covering the Mideast and has reported from countries across the region, including both Iran and Israel.	https://apnews.com/article/iran-israel-war-attack-retaliation-analysis-80a619146abd4f8aee2a7776a8f134d1	2024-10-27T05:04:26-07:00	
More than 120 killed in paramilitary rampage in east-central Sudan, UN and a doctors group say	CAIRO (AP) — Fighters from the notorious paramilitary Rapid Support Forces ran riot in east-central Sudan in a multi-day attack that killed more than 120 people in one town, a doctors group and the United Nations said. It was the group's latest attack against the Sudanese military after suffering a series of setbacks, losing ground to the military in the area. The war, which has been going on for more than a year and a half, has wrecked the African country, displacing millions of its population and pushing it to the brink of a full-blown famine. RSF fighters went on a rampage in villages and towns on the eastern and northern sides of the province of Gezira between Oct. 20-25, shooting at civilians and sexually attacking women and girls, the United Nations said in a statement Saturday, adding that they looted private and public properties, including open markets. The attack displaced more than 4,000 people in the city of Tambiuk and other villages in eastern Gezira, according to the International Organization for Migration’s Tracking Matrix. 'The killings and appalling human rights violations in Gezira province intensify the unacceptable human toll this conflict has taken on the people of Sudan,' IOM Director General Amy Pope told The Associated Press ahead of her trip to the country next week. She called for concerted international efforts to stop the conflict, saying: 'There is no time to lose. Millions of lives are in the balance.' 'These are atrocious crimes,' Clementine Nkweta-Salami, U.N. Humanitarian Coordinator in Sudan, said in a statement on Saturday. 'Women, children, and the most vulnerable are bearing the brunt of a conflict that has already taken far too many lives.' She said the attacks resembled the horrors committed during the Darfur genocide in the early 2000s, including rape, sexual violence, and mass killings. The RSF was born out of Arab militias, commonly known as Janjaweed, mobilized by ex-Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir against populations in Darfur that identify as Central or East African. At the time, the Janjaweed were accused of mass killings, rapes and other atrocities, and Darfur became synonymous with genocide. Janjaweed groups still aid the RSF. The Sudanese Doctors’ Union said in a statement that at least 124 people were killed and 200 others were wounded in the town of Sariha, adding that the group rounded up at least 150 others. It called on the U.N. Security Council to pressure the RSF to open 'safe corridors' to enable aid groups to reach people in impacted villages. 'There is no way to help the injured or evacuate them for treatment,' the statement said. Footage circulating online, some shared by RSF fighters themselves, showed members of the paramilitary group abusing detained people. One video showed a man wearing a military uniform grabbing an old man by the chin and dragging him around as other armed men chanted in the background. The RSF didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. The Coordination of Civilian Democratic Forces, an alliance of pro-democracy parties and groups, also accused the RSF of storming villages, and opening fire on civilians as well as rounding up and mistreating 'a large number of residents.' In a statement, the alliance held the RSF 'responsible for these massive violations,' and called for holding the preparators accountable. The attack on Gezira came as the military had successfully taken back areas held by the RSF. In September, the military launched a massive operation in and around the capital city of Khartoum, reclaiming large swaths of areas from the RSF. Also, earlier this month, it seized control of Jebel Moya, a strategic mountainous area in Gezira province, as well as areas in Gezira and nearby Sinnar province, driving out RSF forces. In October, a top RSF commander, Abu Aqlah Keikel, the de facto ruler of Gezira, defected and surrendered himself to the military. That prompted RSF fighters to attack villages and towns in Gezira seen as loyal to Keikel, according to local reports. The war in Sudan began in April 2023 when simmering tensions between the military and the RSF exploded into open fighting in Khartoum, before spreading across the country. The war has been marked by atrocities such as mass rape and ethnically motivated killings. The U.N. and international rights groups say these acts amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity, particularly in the western region of Darfur, which has been facing a bitter onslaught by the RSF. The conflict has killed more than 24,000 people so far, according to the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data, a group monitoring the conflict since it started.	https://apnews.com/article/sudan-war-military-rsf-6693a4a8c10baa49e8bc70506bc170d6	2024-10-27T05:03:52-07:00	
A Philippine town in the shadow of a volcano is hit by landslides it never expected	TALISAY, Philippines (AP) — As a storm pounded his rural home, Raynaldo Dejucos asked his wife and children to stay indoors and keep safe from possible lightning strikes, slippery roads or catching a fever. One thing the 36-year-old didn't mention was landslides. In the lakeside town of Talisay in the northeastern Philippines, the 40,000 inhabitants have never experienced them in their lifetime. But after leaving home last Thursday to check his fish cages in nearby Lake Taal, an avalanche of mud, boulders and toppled trees cascaded down a steep ridge and buried about a dozen houses, including his. Talisay, about 70 kilometers (43 miles) south of Manila, was one of several towns ravaged by Tropical Storm Trami, the deadliest of 11 storms to hit the Philippines this year. The storm veered toward Vietnam across the South China Sea after leaving at least 152 people dead and missing. More than 5.9 million people were in the storm's path in northern and central provinces. 'My wife was breastfeeding our 2-month-old baby,' Dejucos told The Associated Press on Saturday in a municipal basketball gym, where the five white coffins of his entire family were laid side by side with those of a dozen other victims. 'My children were holding each other on the bed when we found them.' 'I was calling out the names of my wife and our children repeatedly. Where are you? Where are you?' Disasters and migration to danger zones are a deadly mix It's the latest reality check in the Philippines, long regarded as one of the world’s most disaster-prone countries, in the era of climate change extremes. Located between the Pacific Ocean and South China Sea, the Philippine archipelago is regarded as the doorway for about 20 typhoons and storms that barrel through its 7,600 islands each year, some with devastating force. The nation of more than 110 million people also lies in the Pacific 'Ring of Fire,' where many volcanic eruptions and most of the world’s earthquakes occur. A deadly mix of increasingly destructive weather blamed on climate change, and economic desperation that has forced people to live and work in previously off-limits disaster zones, has made many communities across Southeast Asia disasters waiting to happen. Villages have sprouted in landslide-prone mountainsides, on active volcano slopes, on earthquake fault lines and on coastlines often inundated by tidal surges. U.N. Assistant Secretary-General Kamal Kishore, who heads the U.N. disaster-mitigation agency, warned during a recent conference in the Philippines that disasters, including those caused by increasingly ferocious storms, were threatening more people and could derail the region’s economic progress if governments don’t invest more in disaster prevention. A volcano town bears the brunt of calamity The picturesque resort town of Talisay lies north of Taal, one of the country's 24 most active volcanoes nestled on an island in the middle of a lake. Fruit and vegetable farms have flourished on the fertile land, which is also a key tourist destination. Thousands of poor settlers like Dejucos have descended on Talisay over the decades, and its villages have expanded inland away from the lake toward a 32-kilometer (20-mile) long ridge with an average height of 600 meters (2,000 feet). Fernan Cosme, a 59-year-old village councilor, told the AP that the towering ridge at Talisay’s northern fringes had never posed any major risks, at least in his lifetime. The key worry has always been the volcano, which has been restive on and off since the 1500s. 'Many take the risks,' Cosme said of Talisay villagers, who have grown accustomed to Taal's volatility and survived in its shadow. In 2020, Taal's eruption displaced hundreds of thousands and sent clouds of ash all the way to Manila, shutting the main international airport. Kervin de Torres, a carpenter, wanted a safer community for his daughter Kisha, a high school student, but he and his wife separated and she bought a house close to the Talisay ridge, where she lived with Kisha. His daughter was in the house when she was buried by the landslide. The mother survived. A distraught de Torres showed his daughter's picture to police officers who on Saturday searched for the last two missing people — Kisha and a baby from another family. Three hours later, a backhoe dug up school uniforms dangling from plastic hangers, in a spot where Kisha was believed to have been entombed by the debris. Dozens of police and volunteers dug furiously with shovels until a foot was seen in the mud. De Torres wept when the remains of a young girl were placed in a black body bag. He nodded when asked if it was his daughter. Teary-eyed residents expressed their sympathies. Doris Echin, a 35-year-old mother, said she nearly died when the mudslide swamped her up to the waist as she darted out of her hut, carrying her two daughters. She said she prayed hard and managed to plod through. Standing beside her hut, which was half-buried in mud as police and emergency personnel searched the area with backhoes and sniffer dogs, Echin worried about her family's fate. 'If we relocate, where will we get the money to build a new house? Which employer will give us jobs?' she asked. 'If we get to rebuild and stay, we’ll be living between a volcano and a crumbling mountain.' ___ Associated Press journalists Aaron Favila and Vicente Gonzales contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/philippines-talisay-volcano-landslide-trami-e18e6d928e8d8233c521c378ff58c1b1	2024-10-27T03:17:12-07:00	
Satellite images show damage from Israeli attack at 2 secretive Iranian military bases	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — An Israeli attack on Iran damaged facilities at a secretive military base southeast of the Iranian capital that experts in the past have linked to Tehran's onetime nuclear weapons program and at another base tied to its ballistic missile program, satellite photos analyzed Sunday by The Associated Press show. Some of the buildings damaged sat in Iran's Parchin military base, where the International Atomic Energy Agency suspects Iran in the past conducted tests of high explosives that could trigger a nuclear weapon. Iran long has insisted its nuclear program is peaceful, though the IAEA, Western intelligence agencies and others say Tehran had an active weapons program up until 2003. The other damage could be seen at the nearby Khojir military base, which analysts believe hides an underground tunnel system and missile production sites. Iran's military has not acknowledged damage at either Khojir or Parchin from Israel's attack early Saturday, though it has said the assault killed four Iranian soldiers working in the country's air defense systems. Iran announced Sunday a civilian also had been killed, but provided no details. Iran's mission to the United Nations did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Israeli military declined to comment. However, Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Sunday told an audience that the Israeli attack 'should not be exaggerated nor downplayed,' while stopping short of calling for an immediate retaliatory strike. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu separately said Sunday that Israel’s strikes 'severely harmed' Iran and that the barrage 'achieved all its goals.' Damage spread across three Iranian provinces It remains unclear how many sites in total were targeted in the Israeli attack. There have been no images of damage so far released by Iran's military. Iranian officials have identified affected areas as being in Ilam, Khuzestan and Tehran provinces. Burned fields could be seen in satellite images from Planet Labs PBC around Iran's Tange Bijar natural gas production site in Ilam province on Saturday, though it wasn't immediately clear if it was related to the attack. Ilam province sits on the Iran-Iraq border in western Iran. The most telling damage could be seen in Planet Labs images of Parchin, some 40 kilometers (25 miles) southeast of downtown Tehran near the Mamalu Dam. There, one structure appeared to be totally destroyed while others looked damaged in the attack. At Khojir, some 20 kilometers (12 miles) away from downtown Tehran, damage could be seen on at least two structures in satellite images. Analysts including Decker Eveleth at the Virginia-based think tank CNA, Joe Truzman at the Washington-based Foundation for Defense of Democracies and former United Nations weapon inspector David Albright, as well as other open-source experts, first identified the damage to the bases. The locations of the two bases correspond to videos obtained by the AP showing Iranian air defense systems firing in the vicinity early Saturday. Base linked to Iran's onetime nuclear weapons program At Parchin, Albright's Institute for Science and International Security identified the destroyed building against a mountainside as 'Taleghan 2.' It said an archive of Iranian nuclear data earlier seized by Israel identified the building as housing 'a smaller, elongated high explosive chamber and a flash X-ray system to examine small-scale high explosive tests.' 'Such tests may have included high explosives compressing a core of natural uranium, simulating the initiation of a nuclear explosive,' a 2018 report by the institute says. In a message posted to the social platform X early Sunday, the institute added: 'It is not certain whether Iran used uranium at ‘Taleghan 2,’ but it is possible it studied the compression of natural uranium hemispheres, which would explain its hasty and secretive renovation efforts following the IAEA’s request to access Parchin in 2011.' It's unclear what, if any, equipment would have been inside of the 'Taleghan 2' building early Saturday. There were no Israeli strikes on Iran's oil industry, nor its nuclear enrichment sites or its nuclear power plant at Bushehr during the assault. Rafael Mariano Grossi, who leads the IAEA, confirmed that on X, saying 'Iran’s nuclear facilities have not been impacted.' 'Inspectors are safe and continue their vital work,' he added. 'I call for prudence and restraint from actions that could jeopardize the safety &amp; security of nuclear &amp; other radioactive materials.' Damage seen at facilities for Iran's ballistic missile program Other buildings destroyed at Khojir and Parchin likely included a warehouse and other buildings where Iran used industrial mixers to create the solid fuel needed for its extensive ballistic missile arsenal, Eveleth said. In a statement issued immediately after the attack Saturday, the Israeli military said it targeted 'missile manufacturing facilities used to produce the missiles that Iran fired at the state of Israel over the last year.' Destroying such sites could greatly disrupt Iran's ability to manufacture new ballistic missiles to replenish its arsenal after the two attacks on Israel. Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard, which oversees the country's ballistic missile program, has been silent since Saturday's attack. Iran's overall ballistic missile arsenal, which includes shorter-range missiles unable to reach Israel, was estimated to be 'over 3,000' by Gen. Kenneth McKenzie, then-commander of the U.S. military's Central Command, in testimony to the U.S. Senate in 2022. In the time since, Iran has fired hundreds of the missiles in a series of attacks. There have been no videos or photos posted to social media of missile parts or damage in civilian neighborhoods following the recent attack — suggesting that the Israeli strikes were far more accurate that Iran’s ballistic missile barrages targeting Israel in April and October. Israel relied on aircraft-fired missiles during its attack. However, one factory appeared to have been hit in Shamsabad Industrial City, just south of Tehran near Imam Khomeini International Airport, the country's main gateway to the outside world. Online videos of the damaged building corresponded to an address for a firm known as TIECO, which advertises itself as building advanced machinery used in Iran's oil and gas industry. Officials at TIECO requested the AP write the company a letter before responding to questions. The firm did not immediately reply to a letter sent to it. ___ Associated Press writer Amir Vahdat in Tehran, Iran, contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/iran-israel-attack-satellite-photos-gaza-lebanon-wars-0c6ee6a8544268612cb7d49727d8449d	2024-10-27T02:14:29-07:00	
In Beirut, a photographer's frozen moments slow down time and allow the contemplation of destruction	We watch video after video, consuming the world on our handheld devices in bites of two minutes, one minute, 30 seconds, 15. We turn to moving pictures — 'film' — because it comes the closest to approximating the world that we see and experience. This is, after all, 2024, and video in our pocket — ours, others', everyone's — has become our birthright. But sometimes — even in this era of live video always rolling, always recording, always capturing — sometimes the frozen moment can entrance the eye like nothing else. And in the process, it can tell a larger story that echoes long after the moment was captured. That's what happened this past week in Beirut, through the camera lens of Associated Press photographer Bilal Hussein and the photographs he captured. When Hussein set up his camera outside an evacuated Beirut apartment building Tuesday after Israel announced it would be targeted as part of military operations against Hezbollah, he had one goal in mind — only one. 'All I thought of,' he says, 'was photographing the missile while it was coming down.' He found a safe spot. He ensured a good angle. He wasn't stressed, he said; like many photographers who work in such environments, he had been in situations like this one before. He was ready. When the attack came — a bomb, not a missile in the end — Hussein swung into action. And, unsurprisingly for a professional who has been doing this work for two decades, he did exactly what he set out to do. Time slowed down The sequence of images he made bursts with the explosive energy of its subject matter. In one frame, the bomb hangs there, a weird and obtrusive interloper in the scene. It is not yet noticed by anyone around it, ready to bring its destruction to a building that, in moments, will no longer exist. The building's balconies, a split-second from nonexistence, are devoid of people as the bomb finds its mark. These are the kind of moments that video, rolling at the speed of life or even in slow motion, cannot capture in the same way. A photo holds us in the scene, stops time, invites a viewer to take the most chaotic of events and break it down, looking around and noticing things in a strangely silent way that actual life could not. In another frame, one that happened micromoments after the first, the building is in the process of exploding. Let's repeat that for effect, since even as recently as a couple generations ago photographs like this were rare: in the process of exploding. Pieces of building are shooting out in all directions, in high velocity — in real life. But in the image they are frozen, outward bound, hanging in space awaiting the next seconds of their dissolution — just like the bomb that displaced them was doing milliseconds before. And in that, a contemplation of the destruction — and the people it was visited upon — becomes possible. Tech gives us new prisms to see the world The technology to grab so many images in the course of little more than one second — and do it in such clarity and high resolution — is barely a generation old. So to see these 'stills,' as journalists call them, come together to paint a picture of an event is a combination of artistry, intrepidity and technology — an exercise in freezing time, and in giving people the opportunity to contemplate for minutes, even hours, what took place in mere seconds. This holds true for positive things that the camera captures — and for visitations of violence like this one as well. Photography is random access. We, the viewers of it, choose how to see it, process it, digest it. We go backward and forward in time, at will. We control the pace and the speed at which dizzying images hurtle at us. And in that process, something unusual for this era emerges: a bit of time to think. That, among many other things, is the enduring power of the still image in a moving-picture world — and the power of what Bilal Hussein captured on that clear, sunny day in Beirut. ___ Ted Anthony is the director of new storytelling and newsroom innovation for The Associated Press.

Georgia's crucial vote was marred by intimidation, European monitors say	TBILISI, Georgia (AP) — European observers said Sunday that Georgia's election took place in a 'climate of hatred and intimidation' with multiple election violations and cases of violence, undermining the outcome of the vote that could decide the country's future in Europe. The country's Central Election Commission said the ruling Georgian Dream won 54.8% of Saturday’s vote with almost all the ballots counted. Following a divisive pre-election campaign, initial figures suggested turnout is the highest since the ruling party was first elected in 2012. There were multiple concerns about the conduct of the election, including 'the widespread climate of pressure, and party-organized intimidation,' vote buying and the impartiality of state institutions, said Julian Bulai, head of the PACE delegation monitoring the polls. Georgian Dream has become increasingly authoritarian over the past year, adopting laws similar to those used by Russia to crack down on freedom of speech. Brussels suspended Georgia’s EU membership process indefinitely because of a 'Russian law,' passed in June. Many Georgians viewed Saturday's vote as a referendum on the opportunity to join the European Union. During the campaign, Georgian Dream used 'anti-Western and hostile rhetoric ... promoted Russian misinformation, manipulations, and conspiracy theories,' said Antonio Lopez-Isturiz White, the head of the European Parliament monitoring delegation. 'Paradoxically, the government further claimed that it was continuing Georgia’s European integration,' he added. The conduct of the polls, he said, is more evidence that points to the ruling party's 'democratic backsliding.' Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze on Sunday described Georgian Dream's victory as 'impressive and obvious,' and said 'any attempts to talk about election manipulation ... are doomed to failure.' Georgian electoral observers, who were stationed across the country, also reported multiple violations and said the results do not reflect 'the will of the Georgian people.' In the capital Tbilisi, Tiko Gelashvili, 32, said, 'The results that were published are just lies and rigged.' Bidzina Ivanishvili, the billionaire founder of Georgian Dream who made his fortune in Russia, claimed victory almost immediately after polls closed Saturday. 'It is rare in the world for the same party to achieve such success in such a difficult situation,' he said. He had vowed ahead of the election to ban opposition parties should his party win. Tina Bokuchava, the chair of the United National Movement opposition party, accused the election commission of carrying out Ivanishvili’s 'dirty order' and said that he 'stole the victory from the Georgian people and thereby stole the European future.' She indicated the opposition would not recognize the results and 'will fight like never before to reclaim our European future.' The UNM party said its headquarters was attacked on Saturday while Georgian media reported two people were hospitalized after being assaulted outside polling stations. 'The most important question is whether or not these elections will be recognized by the international community,' said Natia Seskuria, executive director of the Regional Institute for Security Studies in Tbilisi. Georgia's 'economic and political prospects' hinge on the election, she said. Many Georgians are concerned the EU may close the door on them and fear the country will be more vulnerable to Russia if Georgian Dream remains in power, she said. Georgians have a complex relationship with Russia, which ruled over it from Moscow until Georgia gained independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. Russia and Georgia fought a short war in 2008, and Moscow still occupies 20% of Georgia's territory. Despite that, Georgian Dream has adopted Russia-style laws and many Georgians fear the govermment is distancing the country from the West and into Moscow's orbit. The election observers said instances of intimidation and electoral violations were particularly noticeable in rural areas. Georgian Dream scored its highest share of the vote — polling almost 90% — in the Javakheti region of southern Georgia, 135 kilometers (83 miles) west of the capital Tbilisi, where it got less than 44% of the vote in any district. The region is predominantly agricultural and many people are ethnic Armenians who speak Armenian, Russian and limited Georgian. Before the election, the AP traveled to the region where voters suggested they were instructed how to vote by local officials. Several questioned why Georgia needed a relationship with Europe and suggested it would be better off allied with Moscow. Around 80% of Georgians favor joining the EU, according to polls, and the country’s constitution obliges its leaders to pursue membership in that bloc and NATO. — Associated Press producer Sophiko Megrelidze contributed to this report	https://apnews.com/article/georgia-russia-election-european-union-8f040cb30e1d9c9e778383cbcbb7b2c1	2024-10-27T01:01:03-07:00	
Palestinian officials say Israeli strikes have killed 22 people in northern Gaza	DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Israeli strikes on northern Gaza have killed at least 22 people, mostly women and children, Palestinian officials said Sunday, as its offensive in the hard-hit and isolated north entered a third week and aid groups described a humanitarian catastrophe. The Gaza Health Ministry’s emergency service said that 11 women and two children were among those killed in the strikes late Saturday on several homes and buildings in the northern town of Beit Lahiya. It said another 15 people were wounded and that the death toll could rise. It listed the names of those killed, who mostly came from three families. The Israeli military said it carried out a precise strike on militants in a structure in Beit Lahiya and took steps to avoid harming civilians. It disputed what it said were 'numbers published by the media,' without elaborating or providing evidence for its own account. Israel is still carrying out daily strikes across Gaza, even as it wages and air and ground war with the Hezbollah militant group in Lebanon. Two people were wounded after an explosive drone launched from Lebanon slammed into a building in an industrial area of northern Israel, authorities said. An Israeli airstrike on a southern neighborhood of Beirut sent flames and smoke climbing into the air. On Saturday, Israeli warplanes attacked military targets in Iran — which backs both Hamas and Hezbollah — in response to an Iranian ballistic missile attack earlier this month. Iran’s parliament speaker, Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf, followed other senior officials in downplaying the strikes, which state media said had killed four Iranian soldiers. But he said 'a response to this act of aggression is certain, with necessary considerations.' The cascading conflicts have raised fears of an all-out regional war pitting Israel and the United States against Iran and its militant proxies, which also include the Houthi rebels in Yemen and armed groups in Syria and Iraq. Red Cross describes ‘horrific circumstances’ in northern Gaza Israel has been waging a massive air and ground offensive in northern Gaza since Oct. 6, after saying that Hamas militants had regrouped there. Hundreds of people have been killed and tens of thousands of Palestinians have fled to Gaza City in the latest wave of displacement in the yearlong war. Israel says its strikes on Gaza only target militants, and it blames Hamas for civilian casualties because the militants fight in densely populated areas. The military rarely comments on individual strikes, which often kill women and children. Aid groups have warned of a catastrophic situation in northern Gaza, which was the first target of Israel's ground offensive and had already suffered the heaviest destruction of the war. Israel has severely limited the entry of basic humanitarian aid in recent weeks, and the three remaining hospitals in the north — one of which was raided over the weekend — say they have been overwhelmed by waves of wounded people. The International Committee of the Red Cross on Saturday said that ongoing Israeli evacuation orders and restrictions on the entry of essential supplies to the north had left the civilian population in 'horrific circumstances.' 'Many civilians are currently unable to move, trapped by fighting, destruction or physical constraint and now lack access to even basic medical care,' it said. Hospital reels after Israeli raid detains dozens of medics Israeli troops raided the Kamal Adwan Hospital in the north on Friday, detaining dozens of medical staff and causing heavy damage, according to the Health Ministry. Footage circulated online showing the courtyard bulldozed and the wards ransacked. Israeli troops withdrew on Saturday. The head of the World Health Organization said 44 male staff members were detained at the hospital. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said only female staff, the hospital director and one male doctor were left to care for almost 200 patients. Among those detained and taken away was Dr. Mohamed Obeid, head of the orthopedics’ department at nearby Al-Awda Hospital, according to Al-Awda Hospital. His whereabouts are unknown. Throughout the yearlong Israel-Hamas war, Israeli forces have stormed and bombarded a number of hospitals including the strip’s largest medical facility, Shifa Hospital. Israel accuses Hamas of using medical facilities across Gaza for military purposes, allegations denied by hospital staff, who say the raids have recklessly endangered sick and wounded civilians. The war began when Hamas-led militants blew holes in Israel's border wall and stormed into southern Israel in a surprise attack on Oct. 7, 2023. They killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted around 250. Some 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, around a third of whom are believed to be dead. Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed more than 42,000 Palestinians, according to the local Health Ministry. The ministry does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in its count but says more than half of those killed were women and children. Israel says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence. The offensive has devastated much of the impoverished coastal territory and displaced around 90% of its population of 2.3 million, often multiple times. Hundreds of thousands of people have crowded into squalid tent camps along the coast, and aid groups say hunger is rampant. ___ Magdy reported from Cairo and Krauss from Dubai, United Arab Emirates.

Bulgarians vote with little hope of breaking a political deadlock	SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) — Bulgarians were voting Sunday in a seventh general election in just over three years with little hope that a stable government will be formed to stop the country’s further slide into political instability. Voter fatigue and disillusionment with politicians have created an environment where radical political voices, aided by Moscow’s widespread disinformation, are successfully undermining public support for the democratic process and boosting the popularity of pro-Russian and far-right groups. The never-ending election spiral has a serious impact on Bulgaria’s economy and its foreign policy. The country risks losing billions of euros in EU recovery funds due to lack of reforms. Full integration into the open-border Schengen area and joining the eurozone are likely to be delayed further. Polling stations opened at 7 a.m. local time (0500 GMT) on Sunday. Initial exit poll results will be announced after polls close at 8 p.m. (1800 GMT) and preliminary results are expected on Monday. According to latest opinion polls, Bulgarians’ lack of confidence in elections will result in a record low voter turnout. Gallup World Poll data show only 10% of Bulgarians trust the integrity of their elections — the lowest proportion in the EU, where the average is 62%. Some observers have labelled the past few years as a period of 'revolving-door governments,' which has additionally fueled voters’ apathy. There was no clear winner in the latest vote, held in June, and the seven groups elected to the fragmented legislature were unable to put together a viable coalition. Observers suggest that Sunday’s vote will produce more of the same. These early elections are not expected to break a protracted political stalemate, Teneo, a political risk consultancy, said in a report last week. Although former prime minister Boyko Borissov’s center-right GERB party is set to win a plurality of seats, it will likely struggle to form a majority government in a fragmented parliament, Teneo predicted. 'As a result, a technocratic government or another early election are the most likely outcomes. Political instability and a surging budget deficit are key challenges to Bulgaria’s accession to the eurozone,' the consultancy added. The Balkan country of 6.7 million has been gripped by political instability since 2020, when nationwide protests erupted against corrupt politicians that had allowed oligarchs to take control of state institutions. Bulgaria is one of the poorest and most corrupt European Union member states. Attempts to fight graft are an uphill battle against an unreformed judiciary widely accused of serving the interests of politicians. Despite a fall in support for GERB in recent elections, it is tipped to finish first with a quarter of the votes. It will be a hard task for Borisov, however, to secure enough support for a stable coalition government. Analysts believe that the main pro-Russia party in Bulgaria, Vazrazhdane, could emerge as the second-largest group in parliament. The far-right, ultra-nationalist and populist party demands that Bulgaria lift sanctions against Russia, stop helping Ukraine, and hold a referendum on its membership in NATO. The reformist, pro-EU We Continue the Change/Democratic Bulgaria bloc is tipped to come in third. The Movement for Rights and Freedoms, which traditionally represented Bulgaria’s large ethnic Turkish minority, recently split into two rival factions, one around party founder Ahmed Dogan, and the other behind U.S.-sanctioned businessman and former media tycoon Delyan Peevski. Both factions are tipped to enter parliament, gaining between 7 and 9 percent each, Up to four smaller groups could also pass the 4-percent threshold for entering parliament, which would even more complicate the forming of a government.	https://apnews.com/article/bulgaria-parliament-election-government-russia-borissov-a5f340a55ca3f3d3c520b7ea7c9732e8	2024-10-26T21:05:30-07:00	
A Lebanese family was holding a Sunday gathering when an Israeli strike toppled their building	AIN EL DELB, Lebanon (AP) — It was Sunday, family time for most in Lebanon, and Hecham al-Baba was visiting his sister. She insisted he and their older brother stay for lunch, hoping to prolong the warm gathering in stressful times. The brother declined. Like many in Lebanon, he hadn’t been sleeping because of Israel’s intensifying airstrikes, so he left to take a nap. The 60-year-old al-Baba, on his annual visit from Germany to see his family in Lebanon, stayed. His sister Donize even convinced him to call an old flame over for coffee. He excitedly stepped into the bathroom to clean up before his visitor arrived. Within seconds, a huge boom shook the basement apartment. Al-Baba fell to the floor. Something hit him in the chest, knocking the breath out of him. He pulled himself up and reached for the door, screaming his sister’s name. A second explosion threw him back to the floor. The bathroom ceiling — and the whole building above it — collapsed on his back. An Israeli air raid hit the six-story residential building in Ain el Delb, a neighborhood outside the coastal city of Sidon. The entire building tipped over down a hillside and landed on its face, taking with it 17 apartments full of families and visitors. More than 70 people were killed, and 60 injured. Israel said the Sept. 29 strike targeted a Hezbollah commander and claimed the building was a headquarters for the group. It could not be independently confirmed whether any of the residents belonged to Hezbollah. In a video that surfaced online mourning one of the people believed to be residing in the building, he appeared in an old photo wearing military fatigues, a sign of affiliation with Hezbollah. Either way, experts say the strike illustrates Israel’s willingness to kill significant numbers of civilians in pursuit of a single target. That tactic has fueled the high death toll among Palestinians in Gaza in Israel’s year-old campaign against Hamas. Israel has intensified bombardment of Lebanon since Sept. 23, vowing to cripple Hezbollah, which began firing into northern Israel after Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack triggered the war in Gaza. Israel says it is targeting Hezbollah members and infrastructure and says the group places military assets in civilian areas. Some 2,000 people have been killed, including Hezbollah fighters and commanders — but also hundreds of civilians, often in strikes on homes. 'It seems to be a feature so similar to Gaza in that these are families being killed together in single strikes,' said Emily Tripp, director of the London-based group Airwars, which monitors conflicts. In the first week of Israel's escalation, it hit a home in Tyre province, killing a family of 15, all of them women and children except for a Hezbollah member. A strike in Byblos killed six family members of a Hezbollah fighter, who had already died in fighting a month before — raising questions about the quality of intelligence used in the strikes. A hit on a shack housing Syrian migrant worker families killed 23. The strike in Ain el Delb was one of the deadliest of the Israeli campaign. Among those killed were al-Baba’s sister, her husband and two of their children, a daughter in her 20s and a teenage boy. Al-Baba was trapped for hours, with the rubble pressing him in an agonizing, kneeling position, his neck twisted, his face stuck to the bathroom floor, unable to feel his legs. He knew his sister’s family was dead from the constant, unanswered ringing of their phones. 'No one said a word. I didn’t hear a movement,' he said. 'People don't know. Israel knows' The Israeli military said it enacted evacuation procedures before acting on confirmed intelligence in the Ain el Delb strike. Residents who spoke to The Associated Press said they received no warning. 'I wish we had. We would have left,' said Abdul-Hamid Ramadan, who lived on the top floor and whose wife Jinan and daughter Julia were killed. 'I would have lost my home. But not my wife and daughter.' Israel says it often issues evacuation orders before striking. But in Lebanon, as in Gaza, rights groups say the advance warnings are often inadequate and come in the middle of the night or through social media. Ramadan, a retired army officer, said he knew of no Hezbollah members or weapons in the building, where he has lived for more than 20 years. No one thought the neighborhood — where most residents are Sunni Muslims and Christians — would be on the list of Israeli targets. In the building, 15 out of the 17 apartments were occupied by longtime residents who all knew each other. Displaced people from the south had begun arriving a week earlier, seeking shelter with relatives in the building. Al-Baba said his sister confided in him before she was killed that she was concerned about a much-loved Shiite tenant, mainly because he had been receiving guests. She feared he may be a target of Israel and asked her brother if she should leave. She decided to stay because she had no idea where to go. Neither al-Baba nor his sister knew anything about the tenant being linked to Hezbollah. Israeli strikes have stoked fears among Lebanese over the possibility their building could be hit for hosting someone who Israel claims, rightly or wrongly, to be connected to Hezbollah. Building administrations have asked tenants to declare the names of displaced sheltering with them. Some have refused to take in people from the south. The first strike hit the building's lower floors around 4 p.m. The Ramadan family were shocked but didn’t think the building was collapsing. Only Ramadan's wife, Jinan, ran for the stairs. A few moments passed, long enough for Ramadan’s son Achraf to bring his sister Julia a glass of water to calm her. Then the second missile hit. The building swayed, then collapsed. Ramadan fell off the couch, which along with a nearby cabinet protected him from the falling ceiling. Achraf, a fitness trainer and former soldier, took cover under a door frame. Julia fell to the floor. For what seemed like two hours, the three communicated through the rubble. Ramadan said Julia was only two meters (yards) away, her voice faint but audible. He called for help using his mobile phone still in his hands. When help came, Achraf got out first; then his father, about six hours after the strike. In the chaos, they thought Julia had been pulled out. But the rescuers returned to find the 28-year-old dead. Her mother died in the hospital from internal bleeding. 'I lost the cornerstone of the house: my wife, my partner and friend,' Ramadan said. 'I lost my daughter Julia ... She was my joy, my smile, the future.' They are buried in unmarked graves in a section of the Sidon cemetery dedicated to the Ain el Delb building victims. Like in Gaza, there is concern that the number of civilian casualties is 'quite high' given that the alleged military target is often unstated or relatively small, said Rich Weir, the senior conflict, crisis and arms researcher at Human Rights Watch. He said there has been an 'escalation in terms of the amount of damage ... the taking down of entire buildings in densely packed residential neighborhoods, which brings inherent risks to civilians.' Israel has also expanded the scope of its targets, hitting Hezbollah financial institutions, he said. Ramadan was not surprised at the killing of so many people for one possible Hezbollah member. It has happened before, he said. 'We hear in the news an apartment was targeted. And people wonder who it was,' he said. 'People don’t know. Israel knows.' ‘Worse than a coffin’ At the bottom of the building’s wreckage, Hecham al-Baba was trapped in pitch black darkness for four hours, squeezed with his legs bent under him. The falling door had broken two of his ribs. It was difficult to breathe. All he could think about was that he might lose his legs. 'There was no blood going to my legs,' he said. 'I couldn’t feel them. I couldn’t move. I tried to stay strong. I don’t want to remember. It upsets me.' Finally, he heard movement: people removing bricks, a bulldozer. He started screaming. His lungs and chest hurt. They called to him to shout louder. 'I told them I can’t.' Then through a hole, a beam of light flashed in the darkness. At the sight of him, a rescuer cried out, 'What a way to be stuck! It’s worse than a coffin.' It took another four hours before the rescuers pulled him out head-first through the floor beneath him, covered in dust and soot. The entire rescue operation took more than 43 hours. The Health Ministry put the death toll at 45, but the civil defense chief for Sidon, Mohamed Arkadan, said first responders pulled 73 bodies from the rubble. Five bodies remain unaccounted for, he said. Doctors told al-Baba his ribs will heal with time. But not his pain. He said he will wear black all his life to mourn his sister. Past conflicts never stopped him from returning to Lebanon to visit family. This time, it may be a while before he comes back. 'There will be no peace,' he said, thinking of his family tragedy and the wars in both Lebanon and Gaza. 'No one will bring me justice. No one.'	https://apnews.com/article/lebanon-war-civilian-casualties-families-israel-airstrikes-963fceb3514518420b579a4a381ac286	2024-10-26T20:09:33-07:00	
Uruguay's elections buck the Latin American trend, offering voters a choice between 2 moderates	MONTEVIDEO, Uruguay (AP) — Voters in the small South American nation of Uruguay headed to the polls to choose a new president on Sunday in a race between two moderates that defies regional trends of bitter division and democratic erosion. The contest between Uruguay's incumbent conservative coalition and its challenger, a center-left alliance, got underway with some 2.7 million eligible voters also casting ballots for Parliament and a contentious referendum on overhauling the social security system. The pension vote — which would expand the fiscal deficit in one of Latin America’s wealthiest countries — has consumed more media attention in recent weeks than other top campaign issues, such as child poverty, education and security. With the candidates in broad agreement over many issues, no one expects the outcome of the presidential vote to herald drastic change in this nation of 3.4 million people, long considered a model democracy and bastion of stability in the region. 'In a way, Uruguay has been boring, but boring in this sense is very good,' said Juan Cruz Díaz, a political analyst who runs the Cefeidas consultancy group in Buenos Aires. 'We’ve seen so many dramatic changes in Argentina, Brazil, Ecuador, Colombia and suddenly we face elections in Uruguay in which there is a general consensus, there’s stability.' While in neighboring Brazil and Argentina, voters recently vented their rage at the status quo, Uruguay's electorate remains largely satisfied with the government's business-friendly policies and the economy's steady growth. The current center-right president, Luis Lacalle Pou, enjoys a 50% approval rating. The presidential campaigns have played out without the vitriol or personal attacks seen elsewhere, such as the United States, Argentina or Brazil. As constitutional term limits bar Lacalle Pou from running for a second consecutive term, the governing party's candidate is Álvaro Delgado, 55, a congressman and Lacalle Pou's former chief of staff, who started his career as a veterinarian. 'This government leaves us with a very solid first level to continue building the future,' Delgado said at his closing campaign rally. His main challenger is Yamandú Orsi, 57, a center-left former mayor and history teacher with humble roots from the Frente Amplio (or Broad Front) coalition, which governed for 15 years before Lacalle Pou’s 2019 victory. From 2005-2020, Frente Amplio oversaw progressive laws, such as the legalization of same-sex marriage. Uruguay became the first country to legalize cannabis for recreational use and developed one of the world's greenest grids, powered by 98% renewable energy. The latest polls show Orsi in a comfortable lead at 44%, but not winning outright, which would send the country to a run-off on Nov. 24. Orsi has benefited from the support of popular former President José 'Pepe' Mujica, the eccentric former guerrilla who helped spearhead Uruguay's transformation into the continent's most socially liberal country during his 2010-2015 presidency. Now 89, Mujica is battling esophageal cancer, but he still managed to cast his ballot in Montevideo, the capital, on Sunday. Arriving to vote in a wheelchair, he was quickly swarmed by reporters. 'We need to support democracy, not because it is perfect, but because humans have not yet invented anything better,' he told journalists after exiting the polling station. Like Mujica, who lives in a modest farmhouse on the outskirts of Montevideo, Orsi says he wouldn't live in the presidential palace if elected. In a distant third is Andrés Ojeda, 40, a muscular and media-savvy lawyer who has tried to energize apathetic young voters with splashy campaign videos showing him lifting weights at the gym and describing himself as a classic Capricorn. 'I want to be the candidate who inspires and enthralls people,' he said at his campaign event Thursday. He told The Associated Press that his unconventional style draws inspiration from other charismatic 'leaders of the new politics' in Latin America wielding social media to amass fans, like El Salvador's populist Nayib Bukele and Argentina's radical libertarian Javier Milei. But he backs the ruling coalition and promises no radical change. The electoral contest has largely focused on the rise in homicides and robberies, with the governing coalition advocating a tough-on-crime approach and the liberal coalition vowing to increase the state's role in security matters. Voters are also concerned about the one in five Uruguayan children living in poverty and the low rate of high school graduations. But the overlap between the party platforms has left much of the Uruguayan electorate indifferent. 'It was a presidential campaign far removed from the people that did not achieve the levels of engagement that Uruguay historically has,' said Montevideo-based political analyst Julián Kanarek. Perhaps more pressing than the presidential race is the constitutional referendum that would overhaul Uruguay's social security system. If approved by more than 50% of voters, the $23 billion scheme backed by the country's powerful leftist unions would lower the retirement age, boost payouts and transfer Uruguayans' privately managed savings to a government-run trust. Both leading candidates have spoken out against the proposal, which has already sent tremors through global markets. Shrugging off the fiscal consequences, supporters say it would redistribute Uruguay’s resources more fairly. There is also a referendum on allowing nighttime police raids on homes. Uruguayans are not obliged to vote in the plebiscites, but voting in the congressional and presidential races is compulsory. ___ DeBre reported from Buenos Aires, Argentina	https://apnews.com/article/uruguay-election-politics-leftwing-president-rightwing-86984f87bb0607d9c061c293ec11fe71	2024-10-26T20:02:00-07:00	
Yamamoto shuts down Yankees, Freeman homers again as Dodgers win 4-2 for 2-0 World Series lead	LOS ANGELES (AP) — Yoshinobu Yamamoto walked back to his dugout and made the slightest tip of his cap to cheering fans. He left Japan for moments like this, an opportunity to put the Los Angeles Dodgers in control of the World Series. Yamamoto allowed one hit over 6 1/3 innings, Freddie Freeman homered for the second straight night and Los Angeles beat the New York Yankees 4-2 on Saturday for a 2-0 Series lead. But the Dodgers will head to New York uncertain whether Shohei Ohtani can play after their biggest star partially dislocated his left shoulder on a slide at second base. 'We’re going to get some tests at some point tonight, tomorrow, and then we’ll know more in the next couple days,' manager Dave Roberts said. 'The strength was great. The range of motion good. So we’re encouraged.' Tommy Edman and Teoscar Hernández also went deep off starter Carlos Rodón, who tied a Yankees World Series record by allowing three home runs. New York was held to one hit before the ninth, when the Yankees closed to 4-2 on Giancarlo Stanton's one-out RBI single against Blake Treinen. Anthony Volpe struck out with the bases loaded, and Alex Vesia came in to retire pinch-hitter Jose Trevino on a first-pitch flyout for his first postseason save. 'Thinking back to my front yard at my house, that’s what we would envision,' Vesia said. Game 3 is Monday night at Yankee Stadium. Forty-five of 56 teams holding 2-0 World Series leads have gone on to win the title. 'No one said it’s going to be easy,' Yankees manager Aaron Boone said. 'It’s a long series, and we need to make it a long series now. We won’t flinch.' Yankees star Aaron Judge went 0 for 4 with three strikeouts. He is 1 for 9 in the Series and is hitting .150 with six RBIs and 19 strikeouts in 40 postseason at-bats. 'Just expanding the zone. That’s really what it really comes down to,' Judge said. 'I think it's trying to make things happen instead of letting the game come to you. ... Plain and simple, I've got to start swinging at strikes.' Yamamoto turned down the Yankees last December and joined the Dodgers for a $325 million, 12-year contract, a record for pitchers, teaming with Ohtani to create record interest in Major League Baseball back in Japan. The rookie right-hander threw seven scoreless innings at Yankee Stadium on June 7 but was sidelined from June 15 to Sept. 10 because of a strained rotator cuff. This was his finest start since the injury. Yamamoto gave up Juan Soto's third-inning homer, then retired his last 11 batters. 'He was made for those moments,' Hernández said. 'He was doing it in Japan before he got here, and as soon as he got here, he was doing it here.' Yamamoto struck out four and walked two with a five-pitch array that included curveballs, splitters, sliders and cutters. He improved to 2-0 in four postseason starts. 'It was kind of a mixed feeling because I was very (much) looking forward to it and happy, but then after I felt that I started trying to focus,' Yamamoto said through a translator. Soto’s fourth postseason homer, on an inside fastball, was the only run Yamamoto permitted in two starts and 13 1/3 innings against the Yankees this year. Soto also singled off the right-field wall in the ninth and scored on Stanton's one-out base hit off the third-base bag. Jazz Chisholm Jr. singled and Anthony Rizzo was hit by a pitch for the second time in the game, loading the bases. But the rally ended there. 'This is everything to me, playing on the highest stage with literally the two biggest teams you can play for, biggest franchises, most history,' Vesia said. A night after Freeman hit the first walk-off grand slam in Series history to transform a 3-2 deficit with two outs in the 10th inning into a 6-3 win, Edman put the Dodgers ahead with a solo shot in the second. After Soto tied the score, Mookie Betts singled with two outs in the bottom half and Hernández, in a 3-for-27 slide, homered into the right-center pavilion. Freeman, who before Friday hadn’t gone deep since since Sept. 16, worked the count full and homered to right-center again. Playing on a sprained right ankle, Freeman has homered in four straight Series games dating to Atlanta’s last two games against Houston in 2021. That is one shy of the record held by Astros outfielder George Springer. Freeman had six days off entering the World Series. 'I was able to calm my ankle down,' he said. 'So hopefully with the flight tonight — I’ve been swelling a lot on flights — so, hopefully tomorrow we can get it down and get in a good spot for Game 3.' All three Dodgers homers came on fastballs from Rodón, whose 31 longballs allowed during the regular season tied for second-most in the major leagues. Los Angeles had back-to-back Series homers for just the second time, after Pedro Guerrero and Steve Yeager connected against Yankees lefty Ron Guidry for a 2-1 win in Game 5 in 1981. Rodón gave up four runs and six hits in 3 1/3 innings. He got just one swing and miss on his fastball. Los Angeles took a 2-0 Series lead for the first time since 1988, when Kirk Gibson’s walk-off homer against Oakland’s Dennis Eckersley won the opener and Orel Hershiser followed with a three-hit shutout. The Yankees are 0-2 for the first time since 2001, when they rebounded to win three straight at home and lost Games 6 and 7 at Arizona. Ohtani's MRI and a determination of his availability will be anxiously awaited by the Dodgers and their fans. 'Not only the dugout, but the whole stadium went silent,' Hernández said. 'Hopefully he’s OK and the day off tomorrow will help him get back on the field Monday.' UP NEXT Yankees RHP Clarke Schmidt and Dodgers RHP Walker Buehler start on Monday. Schmidt has a 3.86 ERA in a pair of postseason starts, no-decisions in Game 3s against Kansas City and Cleveland. Buehler also has started a pair of Game 3s, allowing six runs over five innings in a 6-5 loss to San Diego and pitching four innings in an 8-0 win at the New York Mets. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb	https://apnews.com/article/world-series-yankees-dodgers-game-2-score-yamamoto-d672c41e864884be79f2629a749363a6	2024-10-26T19:18:40-07:00	
Shohei Ohtani partially dislocates left shoulder during World Series Game 2, status TBD	LOS ANGELES (AP) — Dodgers superstar Shohei Ohtani partially dislocated his left shoulder during the seventh inning of Saturday's Game 2 of the World Series against the New York Yankees when he tried to steal second base. Ohtani's status for Monday's Game 3 in New York is unclear. Los Angeles manager Dave Roberts said Ohtani 'had a little left shoulder subluxation' and would get image testing either Saturday night or Sunday. Ohtani clutched his left forearm after being tagged by shortstop Anthony Volpe for the final out in the inning on a feetfirst slide. He laid near the bag for a couple minutes before being tended to by trainers and leaving the field. 'We’ll know more in the next couple days,' Roberts said. 'The strength was great. The range of motion good. So we’re encouraged. But obviously I can’t speculate because we don’t get the scans yet. So once we get the scans, we’ll know more. Again, with the strength, the range of motion good, that’s certainly a positive.' The Dodgers held on for a 4-2 victory and lead the Series 2-0. The Japanese slugger — and presumptive National League MVP — was 0 for 3 with a walk in the game. He is 1 for 8 in the first two games of the Fall Classic and is batting .260 with three home runs and 10 RBIs in his first postseason in the majors. 'That was tough. You never like seeing the best player in the game get injured like that,' Yankees superstar Aaron Judge said. 'Trying to steal a base like that there, and something like that happens. But hopefully it’s all good news. We’ll see what happens.' Ohtani had been one of the few players on the Dodgers roster who got through the season without a major injury. The pitching staff has been beset by injuries, with nearly every member of the starting rotation spending time on the injured list. Among the position players, Mookie Betts was out for nearly two months due to a broken left hand, and Max Muncy was out nearly half the season due to a right oblique strain. Freddie Freeman is playing in the postseason with a badly sprained right ankle. Betts is optimistic about the Dodgers persevering if Ohtani is sidelined, especially after the team overcame its injuries while earning the most wins in the majors during the regular season and reaching the World Series for the fourth time in eight seasons. 'We've got a great group of guys in here and I believe we can take care of business for sure. I believe in us all,' Betts said. Most of Ohtani's injuries since coming to the majors in 2018 have been pitching-related, including major operations on his right elbow in 2018 and last year. The two-way phenomenon has not pitched this year but became the first player in major league history with at least 50 homers and 50 stolen bases in a season. In September 2019, he had surgery on his left kneecap due to a rare condition. The procedure was on his bipartite patella, or a two-part kneecap that didn’t fuse together at birth. Ohtani missed the 2017 World Baseball Classic after having ankle surgery because of an injury he suffered during the 2016 Japan Series. 'When you have a group like this, they picked me up when I have been down. We’ll try to do the same for him,' Freeman said. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb	https://apnews.com/article/world-series-dodgers-yankees-ohtani-332dfab365b16f5f8ae607fcb5147a01	2024-10-26T18:51:05-07:00	
Indonesian forests pay the price for the growing global biomass energy demand	JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) — Enormous swathes of pristine forest are being cut down across Indonesia to supply the rapidly rising international demand for biomass material seen as critical to many countries' transitions to cleaner forms of energy. Nearly all of the biomass from forests destroyed for wood pellet production since 2021 has been shipped to South Korea and Japan, The Associated Press found in an examination of satellite images, company records and Indonesian export data. Both countries have provided millions of dollars to support the development of biomass production and use in Indonesia. Indonesia's state-run utility also has plans to dramatically increase the amount of biomass it burns to make electricity. Experts and environmentalists fear the rising international and domestic demand, coupled with weak domestic regulation, will accelerate deforestation at the same time it prolongs the use of highly polluting fossil fuels. Biomass is organic material like plants, wood and waste, and many coal-fired power plants can be easily modified to burn it alongside coal to make energy. 'Biomass production — which is only recently starting to be seen on an industrial scale in Indonesia — is a dire new threat to the country's forests,' said Timer Manurung, director of Auriga Nusantara, an environmental and conservation organization in Indonesia. As countries accelerate their energy transitions, demand for biomass is growing: The use of bioenergy has increased an average of about 3% per year between 2010 and 2022, the International Energy Agency said. Experts including the IEA say it's important for that demand to happen in a sustainable way, such as using waste and crop residue rather than converting forest land to grow bioenergy crops. Deforestation contributes to erosion, damages biodiverse areas, threatens wildlife and humans who rely on the forest and intensifies disasters from extreme weather. And many scientists and environmentalists have rejected the use of biomass altogether. They say burning wood-based biomass can emit more carbon than coal and tree-cutting greatly reduces forests' ability to remove carbon from the atmosphere. Critics also say that using biomass to co-fire, instead of transitioning directly to clean energy, simply prolongs the use of coal. In Indonesia, biomass production is causing deforestation across the archipelago. Auriga Nusantara reports that more than 9,740 hectares (24,070 acres) of forest have been cleared in areas where biomass production is permitted since 2020. Permits have been issued for over 1.4 million hectares (3,459,475 acres) of energy plantation forests in Indonesia, with over one-third of that land being undisturbed forest. Over half of these concession areas are the habitat of flagship species such as sumatran rhino, elephants, orangutans and tigers, said Manurung. In the carbon-rich forests of Gorontalo, Sulawesi, the felling, shredding and shipping of old trees to make energy-dense wood pellets has been streamlined. Over 3,000 hectares (7,410 acres) of forest have been razed in a concession owned by Banyan Tumbuh Lestari, from 2021 to 2024, according to satellite analysis shared with AP by international environmental organization Mighty Earth. An additional 2,850 hectares (7,040 acres) were cleared for logging roads. After trees are cut down, they're turned into wood pellets at a facility near the concessions owned by Biomasa Jaya Abadi, the largest exporter of wood pellets from Indonesia from 2021-2023, according to data Auriga Nusantara compiled from the Indonesian Ministry of Environment and Forestry database. The database has no records of wood pellet exports prior to 2020. Biomasa Jaya Abadi did not respond to repeated requests for interviews or comment. Banyan Tumbuh Lestari do not have contact information publicly available; AP contacted their main shareholders seeking comment but got no response. Indonesia’s ministries of Environment and Forestry; Energy and Mineral Resources and Maritime Affairs and Investment did not respond to requests for comment. Nearly all of Indonesia's wood pellet production is shipped overseas to meet international demand, said Alloysius Joko Purwanto, an energy economist at the Economic Research Institute for ASEAN and East Asia. Most of Indonesia's wood pellets went to South Korea (61%) and Japan (38%) from 2021-2023, according to government data. 'It's clear that Japan and South Korea's governments are trying to buy more biomass from Indonesia to lower their own domestic emissions,' said Bhima Yudhistira, executive director of the Indonesia-based Center of Economic and Law Studies. Both countries have provided millions of dollars of financial support toward the development of biomass in Indonesia through research, policy, construction and other support, according to a review of publicly available business and government agreements by AP. South Korea's Forest Service, which drives South Korea's biomass expansion and policy, did not reply to requests for comment. Japan's Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries also did not respond to a request for comment. The promotion of biomass production and use has coincided with the ramping-up of Indonesia's domestic biomass use. The country's state electricity company, Perusahaan Listrik Negara (PLN), plans to implement 10% biomass co-firing for 52 coal plants across the country. PLN estimates that would take 8 million tons of biomass a year — far greater than the wood pellet industry's capacity at the end of 2023 of less than 1 million tons, according to Indonesian civil society organization Trend Asia. To achieve PLN’s ambitions, a 66% increase in forest plantation land would be needed — 'which would likely come at the expense of intact, carbon-rich and carbon-absorbing forests,' according to a report by Mighty Earth. PLN spokesperson Gregorius Adi Trianto told AP that the company's plan relied on biomass from 'organic waste such as tree branches, rice waste, and wood industry waste ... rather than from actively logged forests.' With Indonesia lacking clear regulations and oversight of its expanding biomass industry, experts fear deforestation is likely to spike for years to come. 'We're already far behind when it comes to monitoring and regulating issues around biomass production in Indonesia,' said Yudhistira. 'There's definitely a lack of due diligence, and forests are suffering.' ___ Associated Press journalist Yuri Kageyama in Tokyo contributed to this report. ___ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Japan's ruling party braces for a blow to its comfortable majority in the lower house in elections	TOKYO (AP) — Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba’ s conservative ruling party braced for a blow to its comfortable majority in the lower house of parliament in Sunday’s elections amid public rage over the party’s financial scandals and discontent over a stagnant economy. The results could weaken Ishiba's grip on power, possibly leading Japan into political uncertainty, though a change of government was not expected. Ishiba took office on Oct. 1, replacing his predecessor Fumio Kishida who resigned after failing to pacify the public over widespread slush fund practices among Liberal Democratic Party lawmakers. Ishiba immediately ordered a snap election in hopes of shoring up support by using his outspoken, reformist image. Voting began Sunday morning across Japan, where 1,344 candidates, including a record 314 women, are running for office. Polls close at 8 p.m., with early results expected within hours. Ishiba has set a goal of retaining 233 seats for the ruling coalition between the LDP and its Buddhist-backed junior partner Komeito, a majority in the 465-member lower house, the more powerful of Japan’s two-chamber parliament. Ishiba, in his final speeches Saturday in Tokyo, apologized over his party’s mishandling of funds and pledged 'to restart as an equal, fair, humble and honest party.' He said only the LDP’s ruling coalition can responsibly run Japan with its experience and dependable policies. Once a popular politician known for his criticism of even his own party's policies, Ishiba has also seen support for his weeks-old Cabinet plunge. The biggest opposition party, the Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan, is led by centrist leader Yoshihiko Noda who briefly served as prime minister during the LDP’s 2009-2012 descent from power. Noda's party is expected to make significant gains. Noda says Sunday’s election is a rare chance for a change of government, which will be the most effective political reform, though his party has trouble finding other opposition groups with which to cooperate. At a downtown Tokyo polling station early Sunday, a number of voters said they considered the corruption scandal and economic measures. A 77-year-old man said his biggest concern was rising prices and wondered if the LDP should win despite the wrongdoings. Another resident in her 60s said she would vote in hope of making a change. Analysts suggest Ishiba could fall short of reaching his target, though his LDP was expected to remain the top party in Japan’s parliament as voters are skeptical about the opposition's ability and inexperience. Losing a majority would mean Ishiba would have difficulty establishing policies and could face calls from within his party for a replacement ahead of next summer’s election in the upper house, experts say. 'The public’s criticisms against the slush funds scandal has intensified, and it won’t go away easily,' said Izuru Makihara, a University of Tokyo professor of politics and public policy. 'There is a growing sense of fairness and people are rejecting privileges for politicians.' Makihara suggested Ishiba needs bold political reform measures to regain public trust. Ishiba pledged to revitalize the rural economy, address Japan’s falling birth rate and bolster defense. But his Cabinet has old faces, only two women and was seen as alienating members of the scandal-tainted faction led by late premier Shinzo Abe. Ishiba quickly retreated from earlier support for a dual surname option for married couples and legalizing same-sex marriage, an apparent compromise to the party’s influential ultra-conservatives. His popularity fell because of 'the gap in what the public expected him to be as prime minister versus the reality of what he brought as prime minister,' said Rintaro Nishimura, a political analyst at The Asia Group. The LDP is also being tested Sunday for its ability to break from the legacy of Abe, whose policies focused on security, trade and industry but largely ignored equality and diversity, and its nearly eight-year long rule led to the corruption, experts say. There could be regrouping attempts among opposition parties to decide whether to cooperate among themselves or join the ruling coalition, political watchers say. Potential new partners for the LDP include the Democratic Party of the People, a breakaway group from the CPDJ, which calls for lower taxes, and a conservative Japan Innovation Party, though both are currently denying a possible coalition with the LDP. The LDP, whose dissolution of most factions that used to help bring together support for pushing through on elections and on policy, is less cohesive and could enter the era of short-lived prime ministers. Ishiba is expected to last at least until the ruling bloc approves key budget plans at the end of December. ___ AP video journalist Mayuko Ono contributed.	https://apnews.com/article/japan-ishiba-parliament-election-ldp-opposition-5c6509c7b83963ffe40588c50998967c	2024-10-26T15:12:09-07:00

Supporters of far-right British figure rally as anti-racism demonstrators mount counter-protest	LONDON (AP) — Thousands of supporters of jailed far-right activist Tommy Robinson marched through London on Saturday as anti-racism demonstrators mounted a nearby counter-protest. The so-called Unite the Kingdom march — planned by Robinson and supposed to feature him as speaker — led to calls for his freedom after his arrest Friday on a warrant for contempt of court. 'We want Tommy out,' the crowd of mostly white men chanted. The sea of marchers toted Union and England flags and some waved 'Make America Great' banners as they gathered near a fenced-off statute of former Prime Minister Winston Churchill in the square opposite the Houses of Parliament. The march was countered by thousands of people organized by the group Stand Up to Racism who held signs saying 'Refugees welcome' and 'Oppose Tommy Robinson.' Robinson, 41, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, is the founder of the nationalist and anti-Islamist English Defense League and remains one of the most influential far-right figures in Britain. He has been blamed for stirring up protests that turned into a week of violent disorder across England and Belfast, Northern Ireland this summer after social media users falsely identified the suspect in a stabbing rampage that killed three young girls in the seaside community of Southport as an immigrant and a Muslim. Robinson supporters railed against the jailing of hundreds of rioters who assaulted police officers, set cars ablaze, screamed racist epithets and attacked hotels housing asylum seekers. Some participants wore 'I am Peter Lynch' badges and one man held a fishing pole with a sign reading 'Peter Lynch RIP patriot.' They were referring to a 61-year-old man who died in prison after pleading guilty for his role as part of an angry mob that smashed windows at a hotel in the northern town of Rotherham housing migrants and injured dozens of riot police. A separate march of several hundred family members, friends and supporters of those who have died in police custody also took place. Some of those activists seemed to echo the anti-racism marchers by holding signs that said 'No to hatred, no to fascism.' At least five people were arrested at the main rallies, the Metropolitan Police said. Two were arrested on suspicion of assault, including one allegedly on a police officer, at the anti-racism march. One person was arrested at the Unite the Kingdom march for a public order offense and another on suspicion of a racially aggravated public order offense. A fifth person was arrested for allegedly directing a racist remark at an officer, but the Met hadn't confirmed which protest the person attended. Robinson, who has been jailed in the past for assault, contempt of court and mortgage fraud, faces a hearing Monday in a contempt-of-court proceeding for allegedly violating a 2021 High Court order barring him from repeating libelous allegations against a Syrian refugee who successfully sued him. While Robinson was banned from Twitter in 2018, he was allowed back after Elon Musk took over the social network and rebranded it X. He now has 1 million followers.	https://apnews.com/article/farright-rally-london-tommy-robinson-counterprotest-537a682347e1286e05aa49cdcfdcf2b3	2024-10-26T10:20:43-07:00	
Foreign threats to the US election are on the rise, and officials are moving faster to expose them	WASHINGTON (AP) — A presidential candidate's phone is hacked. A fake video falsely shows ballots burned in Pennsylvania. National security officials warn that U.S. adversaries may incite violent protests after Election Day. These developments — all revealed in the past week — show how Russia, China and Iran have increased the pace of efforts to meddle in American politics ahead of next month's election, just as intelligence officials and security analysts had predicted. At the same time, officials, tech companies and private researchers have adopted a more aggressive defense by swiftly exposing foreign election threats, highlighting the lessons learned from past election cycles that revealed America's vulnerability to disinformation and cyberespionage. Officials say the U.S. election system is so secure that no foreign nation could alter the results at a scale necessary to change the outcome. Nevertheless, authoritarian adversaries have leveraged disinformation and cyberespionage to target campaigns and voters while stoking distrust and discord. Here's what to know as the presidential election approaches: Russia is the top threat Russia is the most active and sophisticated nation working to manipulate the U.S. election, using fake websites, state-controlled media and unwitting Americans to spread misleading and polarizing content aimed at undermining confidence in elections. The Kremlin's disinformation apparatus seizes on contentious issues like immigration, crime, the economy or disaster relief. The goal is to weaken the U.S., erode support for Ukraine as it fights off Russian invaders and reduce America's ability to counter Russia's growing ties to China, North Korea and Iran, officials have said. Intelligence officials and private security analysts have determined that Russia supports former President Donald Trump, and is using disinformation — sometimes AI-generated — to smear his Democratic opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris. Trump has praised Russian President Vladimir Putin, suggested cutting funds to Ukraine and repeatedly criticized the NATO military alliance. In one particularly audacious campaign, Russia staged a video that falsely accused Harris of paralyzing a woman in a car crash years ago. Another video made fictitious allegations against Harris' running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. On Friday, the FBI confirmed Moscow's role in creating a third video supposedly showing the destruction of mail ballots in Pennsylvania. Local election officials quickly debunked the video as false. Russia also has tried to pay American influencers who spread the Kremlin’s preferred narratives. Last month, U.S. authorities accused two Russian state media employees of funneling $10 million to a Tennessee company to create pro-Russian content. The company then paid several popular right-wing influencers, who have said they had no idea their work was being supported by Russia. Moscow’s campaign won’t end on Election Day. Instead, intelligence officials and private security analysts predict Russia will exploit claims of election irregularities to suggest the results can’t be trusted. A recently declassified intelligence memo said Russia may also encourage violent protests after the election. 'Putin’s aim is to foment chaos, division and polarization in our society,' said Michael McFaul, a former U.S. ambassador to Russia who now teaches at Stanford University. Russia has rejected claims that it seeks to influence the U.S. election. A message left with Russia's embassy in Washington was not immediately returned Saturday. Iranian hack-and-leak operations Iran has been a particularly brazen player in foreign interference this year. It's accused of hacking Trump campaign associates and offering the stolen communications to media organizations and Democrats in hopes that damaging stories would emerge that could hurt the Republican's prospects. Emails dangling dirt were sent to people associated with President Joe Biden’s campaign, but there’s no indication anyone replied, officials have said. The Justice Department last month charged three Iranian hackers who remain at large, accusing them of a yearslong operation targeting a vast array of victims. U.S. officials have described the hacking as part of a broader effort to interfere in an election that Iran perceives as particularly consequential. Iran, they say, has made clear its opposition to the Trump campaign. His administration ended a nuclear deal with Iran, reimposed sanctions and ordered the killing of Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani, an act prompting Iran's leaders to vow revenge. In addition to the cyberoperations, U.S. officials have repeatedly expressed concern about the potential for Iran to carry out violence on U.S. soil against Trump or other members of his administration. Officials in 2022 brought charges in a foiled Iranian plot to kill Trump's national security adviser, John Bolton, and this year charged a Pakistani man with ties to Iran in a plot to carry out political assassinations in the U.S., including potentially of Trump. Leaders in Tehran also may try to encourage violent protests after the election, according to the declassified intelligence memo. Authorities say Iran also covertly funded and supported protests in the U.S. over Israel's war in Gaza. Iranian authorities have dismissed allegations that the country is seeking to influence the election. Iran's mission to the United Nations released a statement this week saying, 'Iran neither has any motive nor intent to interfere in the U.S. election.' A neutral China? U.S. intelligence officials believe China is taking a more neutral stance in the election and is focused on down-ballot races, targeting candidates from both parties based on their positions on issues of key importance to Beijing, including support for Taiwan. But the Chinese government has for years operated a sophisticated hacking operation targeting all manners of Western life and industry that goes well beyond election influence. 'From city council to president, they want access,' said Adam Darrah, a former CIA political analyst who is now vice president of intelligence at the cybersecurity firm ZeroFox, which tracks foreign online threats. On Friday, news broke that Chinese hackers as part of a much broader espionage effort had targeted cellphones used by Trump, his running mate JD Vance and people associated with Harris' campaign. It was not immediately clear what data, if any, had been accessed. A spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington said they were unfamiliar with the details and couldn't comment but contended that China is routinely victimized by cyberattacks and opposes the activity. Are these tactics new? Hardly. Foreign adversaries, including the same ones blamed for meddling now, have sought to interfere in the last several election cycles — with varying degrees of success. But the U.S. government, blamed for sitting on information about the scope of Russian interference in the 2016 election, has worked this year to aggressively call out foreign threats as part of an effort to reduce their impact and assure Americans that the election is secure. In 2016, Russian military intelligence officers hacked into the email accounts of Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman and the Democratic Party and released tens of thousands of communications in an effort to boost Trump's successful presidential campaign. Russia also engaged that year in a huge but hidden social media trolling campaign aimed at sowing discord on hot-button social issues, creating division in the American electoral process and harming Clinton's bid for president. The antics continued in the 2020 election cycle when a Ukrainian lawmaker described at the time by U.S. officials as an 'active Russian agent ' released audio recordings of Democrat Joe Biden, who was then running for president. That same year, Iranian hackers were blamed for emails purported to come from the far-right group The Proud Boys that officials said were designed to harm Trump's candidacy.	https://apnews.com/article/trump-harris-russia-iran-china-disinformation-election-6f4cb99be3facb08c58cecd11b2c5d41	2024-10-26T09:56:41-07:00	
Tens of thousands of demonstrators march across Italy calling for an end to war worldwide	ROME (AP) — Tens of thousands of demonstrators took to the streets in seven Italian cities on Saturday calling for an immediate cease-fire in the Middle East, Ukraine and all global conflicts. Peaceful rallies were held in Rome, Turin, Milan, Florence, Bari, Palermo and Cagliari, with the support of hundreds of associations committed to peace, disarmament and human rights. The marches came in response to escalating violence in the Middle East and growing conflicts worldwide and denounced the diminished role of the United Nations on the global scene. In Rome, a few thousand demonstrators marched waving a giant rainbow flag in front of the Colosseum and a banner with the slogan: 'Let’s stop wars. The time for peace is now!' 'The war in Ukraine has been going on for years now and what was the result? Nothing. … There are only a lot of Ukrainian and Russian people who died, many soldiers and many children,' said Daniela Ferraci, a demonstrator in the Italian capital. 'The same is happening in Gaza, in Israel, in Lebanon.' Giulio Marcon, one of the organizers of the Rome rally, said 'wars are never resolving problems.' 'War brings more war, weapons bring more weapons. We must choose the path of negotiation, cease-fire and diplomacy. This is the message from this square,' he said. Maurizio Landini, leader of Italy's CGIL trade union, called for the role of international diplomacy to be reaffirmed. 'Our strongest request is a ceasefire to let governments open a real peace conference, because the new world’s balance can’t be decided by wars,' he said on stage.	https://apnews.com/article/italy-peace-rallies-wars-mideast-ukraine-un-b3f127bcff3d1cb3065590fd06e01e4e	2024-10-26T07:48:22-07:00	
Catholic church reform process expected to disappoint hopes of more equity for women	VATICAN CITY (AP) — A yearslong process to reform the Catholic Church closes Saturday with recommendations that are expected to fall far short of hopes that women would be given more equity but that reflect the pope’s aims for a church that at least listens more to its flock. The Vatican’s top doctrinal officer, Cardinal Victor Manuel Fernandez, told the extraordinary assembly of bishops and laypeople this week that Pope Francis said the moment for allowing ordination of women as deacons in the church 'is not ripe.' The multi-year synod process had sparked great hopes for change, especially for women, who have long complained that they are treated as second-class citizens in the church. Women are barred from the priesthood and the highest ministerial positions in the Catholic Church, yet do the lion’s share of the work running Catholic hospitals and schools and passing the faith onto future generations. Speaking to the synod on Thursday, Fernandez explained that a special working group would continue beyond the closing of the meeting, but that its focus would be on discussing the role of women in the church — not in the diaconate. He added that while working with women in previous pastoral roles, 'most did not ask for or want the diaconate, which would be cumbersome for their lay work.' He did not respond directly to a request to define what would determine 'ripeness' for a greater role for women. The outcome is shaping up to be a disappointment for Catholics who have been campaigning for recognition that women share a spiritual calling that is no different than a man’s. They also noted that despite the inclusion of women in the synodal process, the working group that is guiding discussions on women’s role is being run by the Roman curia, operating outside the synod. 'I think it is very clear that ordained men get to decide when the time is right, and they get to decide what baptismal equality amounts to. It is very frustrating, but they laid it all out,’’ said Kate McElwee, the executive director of the Women’s Ordination Conference. The first phase of the synod process ended last year by concluding it was 'urgent' to guarantee fuller participation by women in church governance positions, and calling for theological and pastoral research to continue about allowing women to be deacons. Deacons perform many of the same functions as priests, such as presiding over baptisms, weddings and funerals, but they cannot celebrate Mass. If before the synod the idea of allowing women to be deacons was a fringe proposal pushed by Western progressives, the idea gained attention during the debate. It became something of a litmus test of how far the church was going to go, or not, to address demands of women for greater equality and representation in the highest ranks of the church. Francis, though, had other ideas, insisting that ordaining women would just 'clericalize' them and that there were plenty of other ways to empower women in the church, even leading Catholic communities, without resorting to ordination. Advocates say allowing women to be deacons would help offset the shortage of Catholic priests and address longstanding complaints about their second-class status. Opponents say ordaining women to the deaconate would signal the start of a slippery slope toward ordaining women to the priesthood. The Catholic Church reserves the priesthood for men. Francis has repeatedly reaffirmed the all-male priesthood and has sharply criticized 'obtuse' agitators pressing for a female diaconate.	https://apnews.com/article/vatican-reforms-women-equity-ordination-synod-francis-5cdd62a4d191b77ec71b30440c59e75e	2024-10-26T05:58:12-07:00	
EU leader denounces Russia's 'hybrid war' aiming to destabilize Western Balkan democracies	PRISTINA, Kosovo (AP) — European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen on Saturday denounced Russia's hybrid attacks against democracies, saying the European Union is fighting daily to debunk misinformation. Von der Leyen was in Kosovo as part of a trip this week to aspiring EU member states in the Western Balkans to assure them that EU enlargement remains a priority for the 27-nation bloc. Von der Leyen denounced Russia's efforts 'to destabilize these democracies,' adding that Brussels works to unveil propaganda 'to the benefit of a whole region.' 'It is possible for us to stand up with the truth and with transparency and with very clear messaging. So here we are really countering a hybrid attack that Russia is leading against democracies,' she said at a news conference in the capital, Pristina. Von der Leyen came to Kosovo from neighboring Serbia, which has close ties to Russia and has refused to join international sanctions on Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine. She did not mention the 13-year old EU-led dialogue to normalize ties between Serbia and its former province, Kosovo, instead focusing on the bloc's efforts to promote the region's economy. Kosovo-Serbia ties remain tense, even 25 years after NATO’s 78-day bombing campaign in 1999 that ended a war between Serbian government forces and ethnic Albanian separatists in Kosovo, which left about 13,000 people dead, mainly ethnic Albanians. Kosovo proclaimed independence in 2008, which Belgrade has not recognized. Last year EU officials offered a 6-billion-euro (about $6.5 billion) growth plan to the Western Balkan countries in an effort to double the region’s economy over the next decade and accelerate their efforts to join the bloc. That aid is contingent on reforms that would bring their economies in line with EU rules. The Western Balkan countries — Albania, Bosnia, Kosovo, Montenegro, North Macedonia and Serbia — are at different stages in their applications for EU membership. The countries have been frustrated by the slow pace of the process, but Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 has propelled European leaders to push the six to join the bloc. The Commission on Wednesday approved the reform agendas of Albania, Kosovo, Montenegro, North Macedonia and Serbia following a green light from EU member states. That was a key step to allow payments under the growth plan upon completion of agreed reform steps. Von der Leyen's trip concludes with a visit to Montenegro.	https://apnews.com/article/european-commission-von-der-leyen-balkans-kosovo-russia-04edfec4d473d88620793c5b9f9d6ed3	2024-10-26T04:29:28-07:00	
At least 126 dead and missing in massive flooding and landslides in Philippines	TALISAY, Philippines (AP) — The number of dead and missing in massive flooding and landslides wrought by Tropical Storm Trami in the Philippines has reached nearly 130 and the president said Saturday that many areas remained isolated with people in need of rescue. Trami blew away from the northwestern Philippines on Friday, leaving at least 85 people dead and 41 others missing in in one of the Southeast Asian archipelago’s deadliest and most destructive storms so far this year, the government’s disaster-response agency said. The death toll was expected to rise as reports come in from previously isolated areas. Dozens of police, firefighters and other emergency personnel, backed by three backhoes and sniffer dogs, dug up one of the last two missing villagers in the lakeside town of Talisay in Batangas province Saturday. A father, who was waiting for word on his missing 14-year-old daughter, wept as rescuers placed the remains in a black body bag. Distraught, he followed police officers, who carried the body bag down a mud-strewn village alley to a police van when one weeping resident approaching him to express her sympathies. The man said he was sure it was his daughter, but authorities needed to do checks to confirm the identity of the villager dug up in the mound. In a nearby basketball gym at the town center, more than a dozen white coffins were laid side by side, bearing the remains of those found in the heaps of mud, boulders and trees that cascaded Thursday afternoon down the steep slope of a wooded ridge in Talisay's Sampaloc village. President Ferdinand Marcos, who inspected another hard-hit region southeast of Manila Saturday, said the unusually large volume of rainfall dumped by the storm — including in some areas that saw one to two months’ worth of rainfall in just 24 hours — overwhelmed flood controls in provinces lashed by Trami. 'The water was just too much,' Marcos told reporters. 'We’re not done yet with our rescue work,' he said. 'Our problem here, there are still many areas that remained flooded and could not be accessed even big trucks.' His administration, Marcos said, would plan to start work on a major flood control project that can meet the unprecedented threats posed by climate change. More than 5 million people were in the path of the storm, including nearly half a million who mostly fled to more than 6,300 emergency shelters in several provinces, the government agency said. In an emergency Cabinet meeting, Marcos raised concerns over reports by government forecasters that the storm — the 11th to hit the Philippines this year — could make a U-turn next week as it is pushed back by high-pressure winds in the South China Sea. The storm was forecast to batter Vietnam over the weekend if it would not veer off course. The Philippine government shut down schools and government offices for the third day on Friday to keep millions of people safe on the main northern island of Luzon. Inter-island ferry services were also suspended, stranding thousands. Weather has cleared in many areas on Saturday, allowing cleanup work in most areas. Each year, about 20 storms and typhoons batter the Philippines, a Southeast Asian archipelago which lies between the Pacific Ocean and the South China Sea. In 2013, Typhoon Haiyan, one of the strongest recorded tropical cyclones, left more than 7,300 people dead or missing and flattened entire villages.	https://apnews.com/article/tropical-storm-trami-philippines-vietnam-ee57cf85bc41683260f416f38ed3de30	2024-10-26T03:47:07-07:00	
Five things to know about Israel's attack on Iran	JERUSALEM (AP) — Israel delivered its long-expected response to Iranian missile attacks early Saturday by carrying out a series of airstrikes against the Islamic Republic. Here's what to know: Multiple targets were struck Under the cover of darkness early Saturday, Israel struck multiple sites in different parts of Iran. Explosions were heard in the capital, Tehran, which sits deep inside the country. The Israeli military said its 'precise and targeted strikes' hit missile air defense systems and 'aerial capabilities' as well as missile manufacturing facilities used to produce weapons that have been used against Israel. Iran insisted the strikes caused only 'limited damage.' It was not immediately clear how hard of a blow Israel dealt, with neither country providing detailed assessments of the destruction. Iran said the strikes targeted military bases in the provinces of Ilam, Khuzestan and Tehran. Israel appeared confident in its battering of Iran's air defenses, with military spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari saying that 'Israel now has broader aerial freedom of operation in Iran.' What wasn't hit also matters The strikes did not appear to target facilities that would all but ensure a harsh Iranian response. Those most notably include Iran's oil infrastructure, the backbone of the OPEC member's economy, and its nuclear facilities. President Biden earlier this month said he would not support an Israeli strike on Iranian nuclear sites. U.S. officials felt they had secured agreement from Israel not to hit nuclear or oil sites after dispatching another air-defense missile battery and associated troops, though those assurances were not set in stone. This attack has finished Israel signaled that the pre-dawn bombardment was the end of this attack. 'The retaliatory strike has been completed, and its objectives have been achieved,' Hagari said early Saturday, still the Sabbath in Israel. Not long after, Iran’s Civil Aviation Organization said commercial flights would resume after being halted because of the airstrikes. Tehran's shops were open and streets were calm, though lines grew at gas stations as residents stocked up on fuel. The Israeli attacks aimed to deter future aggression and 'show we won’t be silent,' but to do so in a way that would minimize the embarrassment for Iran, said Yoel Guzansky, a researcher at the Tel Aviv-based Institute for National Security Studies. Outrage and calls for restraint The White House indicated that it wants the strikes to end the direct exchanges of fire between Israel and Iran, and warned Iran against responding. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said there was a 'need to avoid further regional escalation' and called on all sides to show restraint. Reactions in the region were tougher. Saudi Arabia, Iran's main Arab rival, condemned the strike, calling it a threat to regional security and 'a violation of international laws and norms.' Turkey accused Israel of having 'brought our region to the brink of a greater war' and said 'putting an end to the terror created by Israel in the region has become a historic duty.' Syria and Iraq were among other countries in the region condemning the strikes. So did Hamas, which along with other militants attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking some 250 hostages into Gaza. Israel's retaliatory offensive in the Gaza Strip has so far killed more than 42,000 Palestinians, according to local health officials, who don’t differentiate between civilians and combatants but say women and children make up for more than half the deaths. Iran's response will be key The Iranian Foreign Ministry said Iran would respond to the airstrikes, calling them a clear violation of international law as it asserted Tehran's right to self-defense. Israel characterized Saturday's attack as a response to previous aerial assaults by Iran using missiles and exploding drones in April and another missile attack this month. Many of those projectiles were shot down before reaching their targets. Iran could attempt another direct bombardment, though doing so risks provoking yet another direct Israeli attack on its territory at a moment when its defenses are weakened. It could also encourage allied militant groups such as Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon to intensify their attacks, though both have suffered serious blows in their ongoing wars with Israel. 'Iran will play down the impact of the strikes, which are in fact quite serious,' predicted Sanam Vakil, the director of the Middle East and North Africa program at the London-based think tank Chatham House. She said Iran is 'boxed in by their own military limitations, economic constraints from sanctions and by the U.S. election outcome,' which could affect the course of further escalation or diplomatic outreach.	https://apnews.com/article/iran-attack-israel-strikes-mideast-war-tehran-35a2b1474e5feedbb200c3aaa557fe60	2024-10-26T03:29:46-07:00	
Attack on a police convoy in a restive southeastern province of Iran kills 10 officers	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — An attack on an Iranian police convoy Saturday in the country's restive southern province of Sistan and Baluchestan killed at least 10 officers, authorities said. Details remain scarce over the attack in Gohar Kuh, some 1,200 kilometers (745 miles) southeast of the Iranian capital, Tehran. Initially, reports simply described an attack by 'miscreants' without more information. But shortly after, Iranian state media said 10 officers had been killed. HalVash, an advocacy group for the Baluch people of Afghanistan, Iran and Pakistan, posted photos and video of what appeared to be a disabled truck painted with the green stripe used by Iranian police vehicles. One graphic photo shared by the group showed what appeared to be the corpses of two police officers in the front seat of the truck. HalVash said the attack appeared to target two security force vehicles and all those riding in them were killed. The truck appeared to have only damage from bullets, rather than any explosive being used. The state-run IRNA news agency said that Eskandar Momeni, the country's interior minister, ordered an investigation into the incident that it described as causing the 'martyrdom of a number of police.' Authorities identified no immediate suspects for the attack, nor did any group claim responsibility. The assault came after Israel launched a major attack across Iran early Saturday morning. The Baluch regions across the three nations have faced a low-level insurgency by Baluch nationalists for more than two decades. Verifying information remains difficult in Iran's Sistan and Baluchistan, which for decades has been home to violence involving heroin traffickers. The province is one of the least developed parts of Iran. Relations between the predominantly Sunni Muslim residents of the region and Iran’s Shiite theocracy have long been strained. Typical attacks involve hit-and-run assaults by militants in the region, like the Sunni militant group Jaish al-Adl, that kill a few security officials at a time. However, there have been mass casualty attacks by militants in the past. In April, gunmen wearing explosive vests attacks several sites in the province, killing 10 before security forces gunned down 18 militants. Last December, another assault killed 11 and wounded eight others. Meanwhile, the Taliban said they are investigating reports that Afghan migrants had been killed by Iranian security forces in the region earlier in October, an incident that threatened to further strain relations between the nations. ___ Associated Press writer Amir Vahdat in Tehran, Iran, contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/iran-police-shooting-sistan-baluchestan-province-8e1ea2c0c73606ffd189eb97efaaf05d	2024-10-26T02:24:47-07:00	
US approves $2 billion in arms sales to Taiwan including advanced missile defense system	TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) — The United States has approved $2 billion in arms sales to Taiwan, including the first-time delivery to the self-ruled island of an advanced surface-to-air missile defense system, in a move sure to anger China. Taiwan’s presidential office on Saturday thanked Washington for greenlighting the potential arms sales. Under the island's new president, Lai Ching-te, Taiwan has been stepping up defense measures as China increased its military threats against the territory it claims as its own. Beijing last week held war games encircling Taiwan for the second time since Lai took office in May. The U.S. is Taiwan’s strongest unofficial ally and its laws bound it to provide Taiwan with the means to defend itself. 'Strengthening Taiwan’s self-defense capabilities is the foundation for maintaining regional stability,' Taiwan's presidential spokesperson Karen Kuo said. The potential sales package includes three National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile Systems (NASAMS) and related equipment valued at up to $1.16 billion, according to the U.S. State Department’s Bureau of Political-Military Affairs. It also includes radar systems worth an estimated $828 million. The Chinese government did not immediately comment on the potential arms sales. The NASAMS system has been battle-tested in Ukraine and will help to strengthen the Taiwanese army’s air defense capabilities, Taiwan’s Defense Ministry said. China’s war games last week were aimed at practicing the 'sealing off of key ports and key areas' around Taiwan, according to Chinese officials. Taiwan counted a record one-day total of 153 aircraft, 14 navy vessels and 12 Chinese government ships.	https://apnews.com/article/us-taiwan-china-arms-sale-missile-defense-bd14986ada9cfc894c5b1168aea27d02	2024-10-26T02:23:44-07:00	
The Menendez brothers built a green space in prison. It’s modeled on this Norwegian idea	COPENHAGEN (AP) — Nearly 30 years after they killed their parents, Erik and Lyle Menendez launched a beautification project in the California prison where they're serving life sentences. Their project was inspired by the Norwegian approach to incarceration that believes rehabilitation in humane prisons surrounded by nature leads to successful reintegration into society, even for those who have committed terrible crimes. Norway is a long, narrow country in northern Europe, running 1,100 miles (1,750 kilometers) from north to south. It has set up small prisons across the country, which allows people to serve their sentences close to home, said Kristian Mjåland, a Norwegian associate professor of sociology at the University of Agder in Kristiansand. The entire country has about 3,000 people in prison, he said, putting Norway’s per-capita incarceration rate at roughly one-tenth that of the United States. Norway has some of the world’s lowest levels of recidivism. Government statistics give the proportion of people reconvicted within two years of release in 2020 as 16%, with the figure falling each year. Meanwhile, a U.S. Department of Justice survey carried out over a decade found that 66% of people released from state prisons in 24 states were rearrested within three years, and most of those were incarcerated again. Mjåland said Norway's incarceration system is based on the principles that people should be 'treated decently by well-trained and decent staff' and have 'opportunities for meaningful activities during the day' — something he called the 'principle of normality' — and that they should retain their basic rights. Mjåland, whose research has focused on punishments and prisons, said that, for instance, prisoners in Norway retain the right to vote and access services such as libraries, health care and education delivered by the same providers working in the wider community. Norway also operates open prisons, some on islands where there is a lot of farm work and contact with nature. The most famous is on the island of Bastoey, 'which is very beautifully located in the Oslo Fjord,' Mjåland said. Even Anders Behring Breivik — who killed eight people in the 2011 bombing of a government building in Oslo, then gunned down 69 more at a holiday camp for left-leaning youth activists — has a dining room, fitness room and TV room with an Xbox. His cell wall is decorated with a poster of the Eiffel Tower and parakeets share his space. The idea of creating normal, humane conditions for people in prison is starting to spread in the U.S. as well. The Pennsylvania Department of Corrections, for instance, has in recent years been trying to apply certain elements of the Nordic approach, and unveiled a program it calls 'Little Scandinavia' in a prison in Chester in 2022. The Menendez brothers’ case was again in the public spotlight Thursday when the Los Angeles County district attorney recommended that their life-without-parole sentences be thrown out. Prosecutors hope a judge will resentence them so they can be eligible for parole. If the judge agrees, a parole board must then approve their release. The final decision rests with the California governor. Their lawyer and the LA district attorney argued that they have served enough time, citing evidence that they suffered physical and sexual abuse at the hands of their entertainment executive father. They also say that the brothers, now in their 50s, are model prisoners who have committed themselves to rehabilitation and redemption. Both point to the brothers' years of efforts to improve the San Diego prison where they have lived for six years. Before that, the two had been held in separate prisons since 1996. In 2018, Lyle Menendez launched the beautification program, Green Space, at the Richard J. Donovan Correctional Facility. His brother, Erik Menendez, is the lead painter for a massive mural that depicts San Diego landmarks. 'This project hopes to normalize the environment inside the prison to reflect the living environment outside the prison,' Pedro Calderón Michel, deputy press secretary for the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, told the AP in an email Friday. The Menendez brothers' work is ongoing, with the ultimate goal of transforming the prison yard 'from an oppressive concrete and gravel slab into a normalized park-like campus setting surrounded by a majestic landscape mural,' according to the project's website. The final product will include outdoor classrooms, rehabilitation group meeting spaces and training areas for service dogs. The prison system recently launched the 'California Model' in the hopes of bringing similar projects across the state to build 'safer communities through rehabilitation, education and reentry,' Calderón Michel wrote. The brothers' lawyer, Mark Geragos, said he believes Lyle Menendez learned about the Norwegian model during his university classes. Lyle Menendez is currently enrolled in a master's program where he's studied urban planning and recidivism, and Geragos said his client hopes the beautification will make reintroduction into society easier for people who are paroled. 'When you’re there in a gray space that is not very welcoming, it’s disorienting to some degree,' Geragos told The Associated Press on Friday. 'And also you have the issue that the terrain is not something that’s welcoming or helpful in terms of being acclimated and being re-acclimated into a community.' Dominique Moran, a professor at the University of Birmingham in the U.K. said she found in her research that introducing green spaces in prisons improves the wellbeing of prisoners as well as correctional staff. 'Green spaces in prisons reduce self-harm and violence, and also reduces staff sickness,' said Moran, author of 'Carceral Geography: Spaces and Practices of Incarceration.' Moran has studied prisons around the world, and said in an emailed statement that in the Scandinavian approach, 'people go to prison AS punishment, not FOR further punishment.' 'The deprivation of liberty is itself the punishment,' she said. 'There should not be further punishment through the nature of the environment in which people are held.' ___ Gera reported from Warsaw, Poland, and Dazio from Los Angeles.

A suicide attack kills 4 security personnel in northwest Pakistan	PESHWAR, Pakistan (AP) — A suicide attack at a checkpoint killed four Pakistani security personnel and injured five in the country’s northwest on Saturday, police said. The car bombing took place in the Mir Ali area of ​​North Waziristan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, police officer Amjad Khanand said, adding that the injured were in critical condition. There was no immediate claim of responsibility but suspicion is likely to fall on the Pakistani Taliban, who operate out of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and target security personnel. Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi condemned the attack and expressed his condolences to the families of the victims. In a separate incident, a remote-controlled bomb struck a military convoy in Tank district, also in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. No casualties were reported. ___ This story corrects the type of vehicle used in bombing.	https://apnews.com/article/pakistan-suicide-attack-checkpoint-northwest-64329aedc9b41612738e556fa185d0ef	2024-10-26T02:15:00-07:00	
Middle East latest: Israeli airstrikes hit military sites in Iran	Israel unleashed a series of pre-dawn airstrikes against military sites in Iran on Saturday, saying it targeted facilities used to make the missiles fired at Israel and surface-to-air missile locations. The attack risks pushing the archenemies closer to all-out war at a time of spiraling violence across the Middle East, where militant groups backed by Iran — including Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon — are already at war with Israel. Lebanon’s Health Ministry says the total toll over the past year is over 2,600 killed and 12,200 wounded. The fighting in Lebanon has driven 1.2 million people from their homes, including more than 400,000 children, according to the United Nations children’s agency. Israeli strikes have killed much of Hezbollah’s top leadership since fighting ramped up in September. Israel’s offensive in Gaza has killed over 42,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities, who do not differentiate between militants and civilians. The Israel-Hamas war began after Hamas-led militants on Oct. 7, 2023, blew holes in Israel’s security fence and stormed in, killing some 1,200 people — mostly civilians — and abducting 250 others. ___ Here's the latest: EgyptAir cancels flights to Iraq and Jordan CAIRO — Egypt’s flagship airliner has canceled Saturday flights from Cairo to Baghdad and Erbil in Iraq and Amman, Jordan. EgyptAir blamed the cancellations on 'the ongoing developments in the region.' The flight cancellations came hours after Israel launched a series of pre-dawn airstrikes against military sites in Iran. Turkey accuses Israel of pushing the Mideast to the brink of a greater war ISTANBUL — Turkey accused Israel of having 'brought our region to the brink of a greater war' following its strikes on Iran. 'Putting an end to the terror created by Israel in the region has become a historic duty in terms of establishing international security and peace,' the Foreign Ministry said in a statement. It called on the international community to take 'immediate action to enforce the law and stop the Netanyahu government.' Turkey has been a harsh critic of Israel’s military operations in Gaza and Lebanon while voicing support for Hamas. Israeli troops detain people at a Gaza hospital, Palestinian health officials say CAIRO —Israeli troops withdrew from Kamal Adwan Hospital in northern Gaza after holding a number of people inside detained for hours, the Palestinian Health Ministry said. Those held included medical staff and patients, the ministry said, and women were held separately 'with no water or food.' The Israeli army did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The troops later withdrew from the hospital, leaving behind massive damage, the ministry said. Footage circulated online showing the courtyard bulldozered and the wards vandalized. Among those detained and taken away was Dr. Mohamed Obeid, head of the orthopedics’ department at nearby Al-Awda Hospital, according to Al-Awda Hospital. His whereabouts are unknown. The Israeli army began raiding the hospital, located in the Beit Lahiya area, on Friday as part of its weekslong ground offensive on the northern parts of Gaza. Kamal Adwan is one of three hospitals in northern Gaza that has been left largely inaccessible because of the fighting. Earlier this week, the director of the hospital told The Associated Press that the facility is facing a 'catastrophic' shortage of basic supplies and that ambulances can no longer service the site. Throughout the yearlong Israel-Hamas war, Israeli forces have stormed and bombarded a number of hospitals including the strip’s largest medical facility, Shifa Hospital. Israel accuses Hamas of using medical facilities across Gaza for military purposes, an accusation the militant group has denied. Egypt says a cease-fire in Gaza the only way to de-escalate tensions CAIRO — Egypt said it's following with 'great concern the rapid and serious escalation' in the region, including Israel’s attack on Iran, and warned about 'serious confrontations' across the Middle East. The Foreign Ministry said that a cease-fire deal in Gaza 'is the sole means to de-escalate' tensions in the Middle East. Egypt, Qatar and the United States have been leading efforts to reach a cease-fire deal in Gaza, which includes the release of hostages held by Hamas as well as Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails. UK prime minister urges restraint APIA, Samoa — British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Iran should not respond to Israeli airstrikes and urged all sides to show restraint. His comments at the Commonwealth Summit in Samoa came after Israel attacked Iran with a series of pre-dawn airstrikes Saturday in what it said was a response to the barrage of ballistic missiles the Islamic Republic fired upon Israel earlier this month. Starmer said Israel has the right to defend itself against Iranian aggression. 'This is a live situation, and we are obviously monitoring it closely alongside our partners,' Starmer said. 'We need to avoid further regional escalation and urge all sides to show restraint. Iran should not respond. We will continue to work with allies to de-escalate the situation across the region.' Iran vows response to Israel's strikes TEHRAN, Iran — Iran's Foreign Ministry condemned the Israeli attacks on military bases and said Iran will respond. A statement by the Foreign Ministry called the attacks a clear violation of international law and the U.N. Charter, particularly regarding the prohibition against threats or the use of force against the territorial integrity and sovereignty of nations. The ministry emphasized Iran’s inherent right to self-defense, as reflected in Article 51 of the U.N. Charter, saying it has an obligation to respond to foreign aggression. Israel's opposition leader says the military should've hit Iran harder JERUSALEM — Israel’s opposition leader Yair Lapid praised the work of the military but said Israel should have struck harder. 'The decision not to attack strategic and economic targets in Iran was wrong. We could and should have exacted a much heavier price from Iran,' Lapid wrote in a post on X. He said the air force actions showed its operational capabilities, and that Israel’s enemies know that its military is strong and can attack anywhere. Iranian army says 2 soldiers died in Israeli bombing TEHRAN, Iran — The Iranian army said two soldiers were killed in Israeli strikes. The army statement was carried by the Arabic-language channel of the state TV, Al-Alam. The report did not elaborate. Iran says Israeli strikes targeted military bases in 3 provinces, causing ‘limited damage’ DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Iran’s military said early Saturday that Israeli strikes on the country targeted military bases in Ilam, Khuzestan and Tehran provinces, causing 'limited damage.' The statement from Iran’s armed forces was read aloud on state television, which showed no images of the damage described. Iran’s military claimed its air defenses limited the damage done by the strikes, without providing additional evidence. Israel said it launched attacks targeting missile manufacturing plants and other sites in the country. Israel says it has completed its strikes on Iran, including missile plants DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Israel said early Saturday it had completed its strikes targeting Iran. The Israeli military issued a statement saying its planes 'have safely returned home.' Its aircraft 'struck missile manufacturing facilities used to produce the missiles that Iran fired at the state of Israel over the last year,' the military said. 'These missiles posed a direct and immediate threat to the citizens of the state of Israel.' It added that it also 'struck surface-to-air missile arrays and additional Iranian aerial capabilities, that were intended to restrict Israel’s aerial freedom of operation in Iran.' It offered no damage assessment. Iran acknowledged only 'limited damage' to military facilities. The early Saturday airstrikes on Iran were in retaliation for a ballistic missile assault Oct. 1, Israeli officials said. The attack, threatened for weeks by Israel, comes as the Middle East sits on the precipice of a regional war more than a year after an initial attack by the militant group Hamas on Israel. In the time since, Israel has launched a devastating ground offensive in the Gaza Strip and an invasion of neighboring Lebanon, targeting militants long armed and aided by Tehran.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-hezbollah-mideast-latest-26-october-2024-41d99530f6f6b728e828198f53d62b6c	2024-10-26T00:30:32-07:00	
Russian strikes on Kyiv and central Ukraine kill 2 teenagers and injure dozens	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — A Russian drone strike killed a teenager in Kyiv during a nighttime barrage on the Ukrainian capital that lasted for hours, officials said, while five people were reportedly killed in a missile attack on central Ukraine that also left at least 21 injured. According to Kyiv Mayor Vitalii Klitschko, the drone slammed into a 25-story apartment block Friday night in the city's west, killing a 15-year-old girl and injuring five others. Ukraine's Emergency Service said 100 people were evacuated following the strike, which damaged several apartments on the building's upper floors. Serhii Popko, who heads Kyiv's local military administration, said that Russian forces overnight pummeled the city for 7 1/2 hours. Air raid sirens wailed throughout the night, and Popko said that Ukrainian air defense shot down up to a dozen Russian drones. Also late Friday, a Russian missile hit a residential area in the central city of Dnipro, killing a 14-year-old and four others, said regional Gov. Serhii Lysak, adding that at least 21 others were injured including an 8-year-old and teenagers. The wife and teenage daughter of a local policeman were pulled dead from the rubble, police reported. The attack damaged over a dozen apartment buildings, private houses and a medical facility. A man and woman died after a Russian drone dropped explosives on a village in the southern Kherson region, local prosecutors said, while two people in their 60s were killed by shelling in the Kharkiv province in the northeast. In the Kyiv province, which surrounds but does not include the capital, flying debris from a drone attack killed a woman, Ukraine’s Emergency Service reported. A 13-year-old boy was wounded elsewhere in the region, it said. Russian forces overnight launched a total of 91 drones and seven missiles at Ukrainian territory, Ukraine’s air force said Saturday in the latest of regular media updates. It said 44 of the drones were shot down. In Russia, air defense brought down 17 Ukrainian drones over four regions near the border, the defense ministry in Moscow reported Saturday. Also according to the Russian defense ministry, Moscow's troops have continued eking out battlefield gains in Ukraine's industrial east, capturing the hamlet of Oleksandropil in the Donetsk region. Russia has been conducting a ferocious monthslong campaign along the eastern front in Ukraine, gradually compelling Kyiv to surrender ground. But Russia has struggled to push Ukrainian forces out of its Kursk border region following an incursion almost three months ago.	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-kyiv-attack-drone-4325c6b695c010cb2556e48f2efa275c	2024-10-25T23:45:20-07:00	
Israel attacks Iran in series of pre-dawn airstrikes targeting military infrastructure	TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Israel attacked Iran with a series of pre-dawn airstrikes Saturday in what it said was a response to the barrage of ballistic missiles the Islamic Republic fired upon Israel earlier in the month. The Israeli military said its aircraft targeted facilities that Iran used to make missiles fired at Israel as well as surface-to-air missile sites. There was no immediate indication that oil or missile sites were hit — strikes that would have marked a much more serious escalation — and Israel offered no immediate damage assessment. Explosions could be heard in the Iranian capital, Tehran, though the Islamic Republic insisted they caused only 'limited damage' and Iranian state-run media downplayed the attacks. Still, the strikes risk pushing the archenemies closer to all-out war at a time of spiraling violence across the Middle East, where militant groups backed by Iran — including Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon — are already at war with Israel. 'Iran attacked Israel twice, including in locations that endangered civilians, and has paid the price for it,' said Israeli military spokesperson Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari in a video statement. 'We are focused on our war objectives in the Gaza Strip and Lebanon. It is Iran that continues to push for a wider regional escalation.' Photos and video released by Israel showed Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, wearing a casual black jacket, and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant meeting with military advisors and others in a conference room at a military command and control center in the Kirya military base in Tel Aviv. The strikes filled the air for hours until sunrise in Iran. They marked the first time Israel's military has openly attacked Iran, which hasn't faced a sustained barrage of fire from a foreign enemy since its 1980s war with Iraq. It came as part of Israel's 'duty to respond' to attacks on it from 'Iran and its proxies in the region,' Hagari said. 'The Israel Defense Forces has fulfilled its mission,' Hagari said. 'If the regime in Iran were to make the mistake of beginning a new round of escalation, we will be obligated to respond.' The United States warned against further retaliation, indicating that the overnight strikes should end the direct exchange of fire between the Israel and Iran. Nuclear facilities and oil installations were all seen as possible targets for Israel’s response to Iran’s Oct. 1 attack, before U.S. President Joe Biden's administration won assurances from Israel in mid-October that it would not hit such targets, which would be a more severe escalation. Iran’s military said the strikes targeted military bases in Ilam, Khuzestan and Tehran provinces, without elaborating. Iran’s state-run media acknowledged blasts that could be heard in Tehran and said some of the sounds came from air defense systems around the city. But beyond a brief reference, Iranian state television for hours offered no other details. Iran's move to quickly downplay the attack may offer an avenue for it not to respond, averting further escalation. Iran fired a wave of missiles and drones at Israel in April after two Iranian generals were killed in an apparent Israeli airstrike in Syria on an Iranian diplomatic post. The missiles and drones caused minimum damage, and Israel — under pressure from Western countries to show restraint — responded with a limited strike it didn't openly claim. Dozens were killed and thousands wounded in September when pagers and walkie-talkies used by Hezbollah exploded in two days of attacks attributed to Israel. A massive Israel airstrike the following week outside Beirut killed Hezbollah’s longtime leader, Hassan Nasrallah, and several of his top commanders. On Oct. 1, Iran launched at least 180 missiles into Israel in retaliation, sending Israelis scrambling into bomb shelters but causing only minimal damage and a few injuries. Netanyahu immediately said Iran had 'made a big mistake.' Israel then ratcheted up the pressure on Hezbollah by launching a ground invasion into southern Lebanon. More than a million Lebanese people have been displaced, and the death toll has risen sharply as airstrikes hit in and around Beirut. Israel and Iran have been bitter foes since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. Israel considers Iran to be its greatest threat, citing its leaders’ calls for Israel’s destruction, their support for anti-Israel militant groups and the country’s nuclear program. During their yearslong shadow war, a suspected Israeli assassination campaign has killed top Iranian nuclear scientists and Iranian nuclear installations have been hacked or sabotaged, all in mysterious attacks blamed on Israel. Meanwhile, Iran has been blamed for a series of attacks on shipping in the Middle East in recent years, which later grew into the attacks by Yemen’s Houthi rebels on shipping through the Red Sea corridor. The shadow war has increasingly moved into the light since Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas and other militants attacked Israel. They killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took some 250 hostages into Gaza. In response, Israel launched a devastating air and ground offensive against Hamas, and Netanyahu has vowed to keep fighting until all of the hostages are freed. Some 100 remain and roughly a third are believed to be dead. More than 42,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza, according to local health officials, who don’t differentiate between civilians and combatants but say more than half of the dead have been women and children. ___ Gambrell reported from Dubai, United Arab Emirates.

3 dead after light planes collided in Australia	SYDNEY (AP) — Three men died after two light planes collided midair and crashed into a forested area southwest of Sydney on Saturday. Australian police, fire and ambulance crews reached the two wreckage sites, located in a semirural bushland area about 55 miles southwest of Sydney, on foot. One plane had burst into flames on impact. New South Wales Police Acting Superintendent Timothy Calman confirmed that a Cessna 182 carrying two people collided with an ultralight aircraft from a nearby airfield carrying one. Further details of the victims have not been disclosed. Witnesses saw 'debris coming from the sky' and tried to help, but 'there was probably not much that could’ve been done,' Calman said to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation . He noted both crashes, about one kilometer apart, were 'not survivable.' NSW Ambulance Inspector Joseph Ibrahim, part of the emergency response team, said to the ABC, 'unfortunately, there was nothing they could’ve done.' The cause of the crash will be investigated by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau.	https://apnews.com/article/australia-plane-crash-8c3ff11001d29ab480a1daa7146be40e	2024-10-25T22:22:20-07:00	
Nick Harkaway steps into his father John le Carré's footsteps with spy thriller 'Karla's Choice'	LONDON (AP) — George Smiley, the subtle fictional spymaster navigating treacherous Cold War currents, is back. And so, somewhat surprisingly, is his creator, John le Carré. Four years after the spy writer’s death at the age of 89, comes a new thriller, 'Karla’s Choice.' Billed as 'a John le Carré novel,' it was written by Nick Harkaway, whose qualifications for the job include seven published novels, a lifetime of reading le Carré — and the fact he is the late author’s son. After decades avoiding his famous father’s shadow, like Smiley trying to leave the intelligence agency known as the Circus, he was drawn back in. Apprehensive author Le Carré left a note asking his family, as custodians of his estate, to help his works live on and find new readers. They took that as permission to write new books. But Harkaway, who made his name with sci-fi thrillers including 'The Gone-Away World,' 'Angelmaker' and 'Titanium Noir,' was apprehensive about being the one to do it. 'I would go so far as to say terrified,' said 51-year-old Harkaway, whose real name is Nicholas Cornwell. Le Carré was the pen name of his father, David Cornwell. 'It’s this piece of 20th-century literature that defines a genre and potentially a historical period. This body of work is immense. And it’s my father’s universe,' he said. 'There’s every reason for people to be skeptical.' Sitting in his spacious north London home — in the 'very uncomfortable' writing chair that once belonged to his father – Harkaway has relaxed a bit now that the book has been published (by Viking) to largely glowing reviews. The Daily Telegraph said Harkaway’s 'recreation of the Smiley milieu is note-perfect,' while The Guardian declared the novel 'a treat.' 'Karla’s Choice' is set in 1963, months after the end of le Carré’s breakthrough novel, 'The Spy Who Came in From the Cold.' It opens with a hitman, dispatched by Moscow to assassinate a Hungarian publisher in London, having a last-minute crisis of conscience. A recently retired Smiley is pulled in for one last job. He’s assured it will be short and simple. Famous last words. The peril-filled saga that follows fleshes out the early relationship between Smiley and the Soviet spymaster Karla, who becomes his nemesis in later works like 'Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy' and 'Smiley’s People.' Childhood memories Harkaway says that once he got over his terror, capturing Smiley’s voice came easily — he had literally grown up with it. Some of his earliest memories involve his father reading aloud draft pages of his works in progress. 'The formative moment in my life where I was actually learning to speak, was learning to use language, I was getting 90 minutes or more of George Smiley in my ear every day,' he said. 'And so when I came to sit down to do this, I found that I did not have to turn the dial very far to find a voice that is absolutely my own, but which reads to people as being sufficiently of the le Carré mood.' That mood is often dark. Le Carré had been a real-life Cold War intelligence agent, and his thrillers are steeped in the moral murk of the spy world. But bespectacled, understated Smiley – antithesis of that other famous fictional spy, James Bond — offers decency and hope. Harkaway sees Smiley as 'this compassionate, anonymous little everyman who can turn up and see the broken pieces of life on the floor and put them back together.' There is a bit more humor in 'Karla’s Choice' than in many of his father’s books, and female characters, including Smiley's wife Ann, get more space and voice. 'I had a flat-out ambition that the Circus and the Circus universe should not just be elderly, straight white men,' Harkaway said. He acknowledges that women were often on the sidelines in his father’s work — a reflection of the male-dominated era, and of a complicated life. David Cornwell’s mother left when he was 5 years old, leaving him with his father, a charismatic conman. He didn’t see her again until he was 21. As an adult he had two long marriages — the second to Harkaway’s mother, Valerie Jane Eustace — and multiple affairs. 'On a fundamental level for him, his relationships with women were about absence and pain,' Harkaway said. 'That got better over time. But when he was writing Smiley, that’s what came through. And that’s not my life.' Grief and joy Harkaway says working on the book didn’t bring 'an Obi Wan Kenobi moment' in which an apparition of his father appeared to offer writing advice. But he found the experience 'very moving.' 'Despite the fact that it’s … slightly a project that has grief attached to it, it’s still a joyful process,' he said. It seems inevitable that more le Carré thrillers will follow. Harkaway also plans to continue writing under his own name and in his own style, with a sequel to 'Titanium Noir' due to be published in April. 'Karla’s Choice' carries a double dedication: To David John Moore Cornwell, 'father, husband, brother, son,' and to 'John le Carré, novelist.' 'John le Carré was, among other things, a shield that my father created, because he was quite a shy guy,' Harkaway said. 'John le Carré was kind of the suit that he put on to be able to do it all. And then David Cornwell was my dad. He was a terrible cook, he was a ping pong player of enormous aggression and flair … he was the person I lived with. 'I wanted with that dedication to thank them both. And also just to remind everybody, he was an awful lot of things to a lot of people.'	https://apnews.com/article/john-le-carre-nick-harkaway-karlas-choice-02f14ac19e45aaf9bafbdb31624c7ceb	2024-10-25T19:06:50-07:00	
Georgia votes in an election that could take it toward the EU or into Russia's orbit	TBILISI, Georgia (AP) — Georgians headed to the polls Saturday in a ballot many citizens see as a make-or-break vote on the opportunity to join the European Union. The pre-election campaign in the South Caucasus nation of 3.7 million people has been dominated by foreign policy and marked by a bitter fight for votes and allegations of a smear campaign. Some Georgians complained of intimidation and being pressured to vote for the ruling party, Georgian Dream, while the opposition accused the party of carrying out a 'hybrid war' against its citizens. Ahead of the parliamentary election, Bidzina Ivanishvili — a shadowy billionaire who set up Georgian Dream and made his fortune in Russia — vowed again to ban opposition parties should his party win. Georgian Dream will hold opposition parties 'fully accountable under the full force of the law' for 'war crimes' committed against the people of Georgia, Ivanishvili said at a pro-government rally in the capital Tbilisi Wednesday. He did not explain what crimes he believes the opposition has committed. Georgians will elect 150 lawmakers from 18 parties. If no party wins the 76 seats required to form a government for a four-year term, the president will invite the largest party to form a coalition. Many believe the election may be the most crucial vote of their lifetimes; it will determine whether Georgia gets back on track to EU membership or embraces authoritarianism and falls into Russia's orbit. 'It's an existential election,' Georgian President Salome Zourabichvili said. Georgians want 'European integration, want to move forward and want policies which will bring us a better, more stable, future,' Qristine Tordia, 29, told The Associated Press shortly after voting in the capital, Tbilisi. Around 80% of Georgians favor joining the EU according to polls and the country’s constitution obliges its leaders to pursue membership in that bloc and NATO. But Brussels put Georgia’s bid for entry to the EU on hold indefinitely after the ruling party passed a 'Russian law' cracking down on freedom of speech in June. Many Georgians fear the party is dragging the country towards authoritarianism and killing off hopes it could join the EU. The opposition parties have ignored Zourabichvili’s request to unite into a single party but have signed up to her 'charter' to carry out the reforms required by the EU to join. Zourabichvili told the AP on Thursday she believed most Georgians would mobilize to vote 'despite some instances of intimidation, despite the use of state resources ... and the use of financial resources' by the government. Georgian Dream took out billboards across the country contrasting black-and-white images of destruction in Ukraine with colorful images of life in Georgia alongside the slogan, 'Say no to war — choose peace.' The governing and opposition parties told voters they would pursue EU membership even though laws passed by Georgian Dream have put that hope on hold. 'The EU decided to stop Georgia’s integration process unilaterally,' said Vakhtang Asanidze, who spoke to AP at a pro-government rally in Tbilisi. He said he saw no reason why Georgia could not join the EU in spite of the laws. At the EU summit last week, EU leaders said they have 'serious concerns regarding the course of action taken by the Georgian government.' While Georgian Dream has adopted laws similar to those used by the Kremlin to crack down on its critics, voters at the pro-government rally said they did not view the election as a choice between Russia or Europe. 'We remember everything about Russia, including Abkhazia and South Ossetia,' said Latavra Dashniani at the rally, referring to Russia's occupation of 20% of Georgian territory after the two countries fought a short war in 2008. Voting for the ruling party, she said, would ensure Georgia enters Europe 'with dignity,' alluding to its conservative values, including opposition to rights for LGBTQ+ people. Polls opened in the parliamentary election at 8 a.m. local time and will close 12 hours later. Georgian Dream stands against three coalitions: the Unity National Movement, the Coalition for Changes Lelo, and Strong Georgia. The Gakharia for Georgia party, set up by former prime minister Giorgi Gakharia, said it will not go into an alliance with anyone but will support the opposition to form a government. — Associated Press producer Sophiko Megrelidze contributed to this report	https://apnews.com/article/georgia-elections-european-union-russia-06103525947fe3a1d372539a74cb573f	2024-10-25T19:04:23-07:00

War affects over 600 million women and girls, UN says	UNITED NATIONS (AP) — More than 600 million women and girls are now affected by war, a 50% increase from a decade ago, and they fear the world has forgotten them amid an escalating backlash against women’s rights and gender equality, top U.N. officials say. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in a new report that amid record levels of armed conflict and violence, progress over the decades for women is vanishing and 'generational gains in women’s rights hang in the balance around the world.' The U.N. chief was assessing the state of a Security Council resolution adopted on Oct. 31, 2000, that demanded equal participation for women in peace negotiations, a goal that remains as distant as gender equality. Guterres said current data and findings show that 'the transformative potential of women’s leadership and inclusion in the pursuit of peace' is being undercut — with power and decision-making on peace and security matters overwhelmingly in the hands of men. 'As long as oppressive patriarchal social structures and gender biases hold back half our societies, peace will remain elusive,' he warned. The report says the proportion of women killed in armed conflicts doubled in 2023 compared with a year earlier; U.N.-verified cases of conflict-related sexual violence were 50% higher; and the number of girls affected by grave violations in conflicts increased by 35%. At a two-day U.N. Security Council meeting on the topic that ended Friday, Sima Bahous, head of the U.N. agency promoting gender equality known as UN Women, also pointed to a lack of attention to women’s voices in the search for peace. She cited the fears of millions of women and girls in Afghanistan deprived of an education and a future; of displaced women in Gaza 'waiting for death'; of women in Sudan who are victims of sexual violence; and of the vanishing hopes of women in Myanmar, Haiti, Congo, the Sahel region of Africa, South Sudan, Syria, Ukraine, Yemen and elsewhere. Bahous said 612 million women and girls who are affected by war 'wonder if the world has already forgotten them, if they have fallen from the agenda of an international community overwhelmed by crises of ever deeper frequency, severity and urgency.' The world needs to answer their fears with hope, she said, but the reality is grim: 'One in two women and girls in conflict-affected settings are facing moderate to severe food insecurity, 61% of all maternal mortality is concentrated in 35 conflict-affected countries.' As for women’s participation in decision-making and politics in countries in conflict, Bahous said it’s stalled. 'The percentage of women in peace negotiations has not improved over the last decade: under 10% on average in all processes, and under 20% in processes led or supported by the United Nations,' she said. U.N. Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed announced the launch of a 'Common Pledge on Women’s Participation in Peace Processes,' and urged governments, regional organizations and others involved in mediation to join the U.N. in taking concrete steps toward that end. The commitments include appointing women as lead mediators and team members, promoting direct and meaningful participation of women in peace processes, consulting women leaders at all stages and embedding women with expertise 'to foster gender-responsive peace processes and agreements,' she said. Many U.N. ambassadors who spoke at the council meeting focused on the lack of 'political will' to promote women in the peace process. 'We’ve seen how the lack of political will continues to stand in the way of the full implementation of the commitments entered into by member states,' Panama’s U.N. Ambassador Eloy Alfaro de Alba said Friday.	https://apnews.com/article/united-nations-women-war-gender-equality-0730fc6f9bb752b955d0078fe8b275a9	2024-10-25T15:45:59-07:00	
Microsoft fires employees who organized vigil for Palestinians killed in Gaza	Microsoft has fired two employees who organized an unauthorized vigil at the company's headquarters for Palestinians killed in Gaza during Israel's war with Hamas. The two employees told The Associated Press they were fired by phone call late Thursday, several hours after a lunchtime event they organized at Microsoft's campus in Redmond, Washington. Both employees were members of a coalition of employees called 'No Azure for Apartheid' that has opposed Microsoft's sale of its cloud-computing technology to the Israeli government. But they contended that Thursday's event was similar to other Microsoft-sanctioned employee gift campaigns for people in need. 'We have so many community members within Microsoft who have lost family, lost friends or loved ones,' said Abdelrahman Mohamed, a researcher and data scientist. 'But Microsoft really failed to have the space for us where we can come together and share our grief and honor the memories of people who can no longer speak for themselves.' Microsoft said Friday it has 'ended the employment of some individuals in accordance with internal policy' but declined to provide details. Mohamed, who is from Egypt, said he now needs a new job in the next two months to transfer a work visa and avoid deportation. Another fired worker, Hossam Nasr, said the purpose of the vigil was both 'to honor the victims of the Palestinian genocide in Gaza and to call attention to Microsoft’s complicity in the genocide' because of the use of its technology by the Israeli military. Nasr said his firing was disclosed on social media by the watchdog group Stop Antisemitism more than an hour before he received the call from Microsoft. The group didn't immediately respond Friday to a request for comment on how it learned about the firing. The same group had months earlier publicly called on Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella to take action against Nasr for his public stances on Israel. Nasr, an Egyptian-raised 2021 graduate of Harvard University, is also a co-organizer of Harvard Alumni for Palestine. Google earlier this year fired more than 50 workers in the aftermath of protests over technology the company is supplying the Israeli government amid the Gaza war. The firings stemmed from internal turmoil and sit-in protests at Google offices centered on 'Project Nimbus,' a $1.2 billion contract signed in 2021 for Google and Amazon to provide the Israeli government with cloud computing and artificial intelligence services. Microsoft said in its statement Friday about the firings that it remains 'dedicated to maintaining a professional and respectful work environment. Due to privacy and confidentiality considerations, we cannot provide specific details.'	https://apnews.com/article/microsoft-fired-workers-israel-palestinians-gaza-72de6fe1f35db9398e3b6785203c6bbf	2024-10-25T15:41:28-07:00	
Delta sues cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike over tech outage that canceled flights	ATLANTA (AP) — Delta Air Lines sued CrowdStrike on Friday, claiming the cybersecurity company had cut corners and caused a worldwide technology outage that led to thousands of canceled flight in July. The airline is asking for compensation and punitive damages from the outage, which started with a faulty update sent to several million Microsoft computers. Delta said the outage crippled its operations for several days, costing more than $500 million in lost revenue and extra expenses. CrowdStrike said Delta is giving 'misinformation,' does not understand cybersecurity and is trying to shift blame for its slow recovery from the outage. The U.S. Department of Transportation is investigating why Delta took longer to recover than other carriers. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said the department also would look into complaints about Delta customer service during the outage, including long waits for help and reports that unaccompanied minors were stranded at airports. In its lawsuit, Delta claims that the outage occurred because CrowdStrike failed to test the update before rolling it out worldwide. Delta canceled about 7,000 flights over a five-day period during the peak summer vacation season. The outage also affected banks, hospitals and other businesses. 'CrowdStrike caused a global catastrophe because it cut corners, took shortcuts, and circumvented the very testing and certification processes it advertised, for its own benefit and profit,' Delta said in the lawsuit, which was filed in Fulton County Superior Court in Georgia, near the company's headquarters. A CrowdStrike spokesperson said the company tried to resolve the dispute — one of its lawyers said in August that CrowdStrike's liability to Delta was less than $10 million. The spokesperson said Delta's claims are based on 'misinformation, demonstrate a lack of understanding of how modern cybersecurity works, and reflect a desperate attempt to shift blame for its slow recovery away from its failure to modernize its antiquated IT infrastructure.'	https://apnews.com/article/delta-airlines-crowdstrike-outage-lawsuit-43bb230d2edf235bb9f7928c4279fec2	2024-10-25T14:38:21-07:00	
AP sources: Chinese hackers targeted phones of Trump, Vance, people associated with Harris campaign	WASHINGTON (AP) — Chinese hackers engaged in a broader espionage operation targeted cellphones used by Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, his running mate, JD Vance, and people associated with the Democratic campaign of Kamala Harris, people familiar with the matter said Friday. It was not immediately clear what data, if any, may have been accessed. U.S. officials are continuing to investigate, according to the people, who were not authorized to publicly discuss the ongoing inquiry and spoke on the condition of anonymity to The Associated Press. An FBI statement did not confirm the identities of any of the potential targets but said it was investigating 'unauthorized access to commercial telecommunications infrastructure by actors affiliated with the People’s Republic of China.' 'Agencies across the U.S. Government are collaborating to aggressively mitigate this threat and are coordinating with our industry partners to strengthen cyber defenses across the commercial communications sector,' the FBI said. U.S. officials believe the campaigns were among numerous targets of a larger cyberespionage operation launched by China, the people said. It was not immediately clear what information China may have hoped to glean, though Beijing has for years engaged in vast hacking campaigns aimed at collecting the private data of Americans and government workers, spying on technology and corporate secrets from major American companies and targeting U.S. infrastructure. News that high-profile political candidates and their campaigns were targeted comes as U.S. officials remain on high alert for foreign interference in the final stretch of the presidential campaign. Iranian hackers have been blamed for targeting Trump campaign officials and the Justice Department has exposed vast disinformation campaigns orchestrated by Russia, which is said to favor Trump over Harris. China, by contrast, is believed by U.S. intelligence officials to be taking a neutral stance in the race and is instead focused on down-ballot races, targeting candidates from both parties based on their stance on issues of key importance to Beijing, including support for Taiwan. The New York Times first reported that Trump and Vance had been targeted and said the campaign was advised of the development this week. Three people confirmed the news to the AP, including one who said that people associated with the Harris campaign were also targeted. A spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in Washington said Friday that they were not familiar with the specifics and could not comment, but contended that China is routinely victimized by cyberattacks and opposes the activity. 'The presidential elections are the United States’ domestic affairs. China has no intention and will not interfere in the U.S. election. We hope that the U.S. side will not make accusations against China in the election,' the statement said. Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung did not offer any details about the Chinese operation but issued a statement accusing the Harris campaign of having emboldened foreign adversaries, including China and Iran. Trump did not respond to shouted questions about whether his phone had been hacked by China as he departed an event in Texas. The FBI has repeatedly warned over the last year about Chinese hacking operations, with Director Chris Wray telling Congress in January that investigators had disrupted a state-sponsored group known as Volt Typhoon. That operation disrupted a botnet of hundreds of U.S.-based small office and home routers owned by private citizens and companies. Their ultimate targets included water treatment plants, the electrical grid and transportation systems across the U.S, with Wray warning that Beijing was positioning itself to disrupt the daily lives of Americans if the United States and China ever go to war. Last month, Wray said that the FBI had interrupted a separate Chinese government campaign, called Typhoon Flax, that targeted universities, government agencies and other organizations and that installed malicious software on more than 200,000 consumer devices, including cameras, video recorders and home and office routers. The Wall Street Journal reported this month that Chinese hackers had burrowed inside the networks of U.S. broadband providers and had potentially accessed systems that law enforcement officials use for wiretapping requests. ____ Michelle L.

Here's a look at what came out of Blinken's 11th trip to the Middle East	LONDON (AP) — Secretary of State Antony Blinken's weeklong trip to the Middle East ended unexpectedly in London on Friday, but the lack of a cease-fire breakthrough for Gaza came as no surprise to U.S. and Arab officials, who described the growing regional conflicts as a 'nightmare.' The trip to Israel, Qatar and Saudi Arabia had been expected after President Joe Biden said this month that he would dispatch Blinken to the region following Israel’s killing of Hamas military chief Yahya Sinwar, a move that Blinken said helped open a window for new talks on a cease-fire proposal that has been languishing for months. Blinken and other U.S. officials discussed various proposals that could potentially trigger the release of Israeli hostages and end the devastating war in Gaza. The main discussion this week was more focused on a post-war plan for Palestinian governance, reconstruction and security for the larger region. The impact of the war was on full display on Blinken's last day in Tel Aviv, when shortly before departing for the airport Wednesday, air raid sirens blared at the hotel where U.S. officials and press had been staying. The Israeli military said two rockets fired into Israel from Lebanon were intercepted, with smoke visible from the hotel. Here are some takeaways from Blinken's 11th visit to the Middle East since the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza began over a year ago: Reigniting peace talks While expectations were low for an agreement between Israel and Hamas militants, America and Israel did announce that after several weeks with no meetings, U.S. and Israeli negotiators will be arriving in Qatar in the coming days to revive talks. Qatar has served as a key mediator between Israel and Hamas. Blinken, speaking to reporters Thursday in the Qatari capital, Doha, said negotiators would soon return to the Gulf city. 'What we really have to determine is whether Hamas is prepared to engage,' Blinken said. But Hamas’ political representatives have not so far signaled a softer stance. 'There is no change in our position,' senior Hamas official Osama Hamdan told Al Mayadeen, a Lebanese broadcaster. Hamdan said their delegates heard from mediators in Cairo about the potential to revive cease-fire negotiations, but he reiterated that the group still insists on an end to Israel’s offensive in Gaza, as well as its complete withdrawal from the territory. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said the head of the Mossad, the country’s spy agency, would travel to Qatar on Sunday to meet with CIA director Bill Burns and the Qatari prime minister. Laying out red lines Throughout the trip, the U.S. questioned aspects of Israel's handling of the war, raising concerns about a controversial plan in northern Gaza as well as pushing its ally to adhere to U.S. humanitarian law regarding the insufficient level of aid reaching Palestinians. Before leaving Tel Aviv, Blinken and other U.S. officials cornered Netanyahu and members of his government regarding a proposal backed by some Israeli officials in which civilians would be ordered to leave the north and anyone remaining would be starved out or killed. A senior State Department official said Tuesday that both Netanyahu and his aide Ron Dermer denied having a proposal titled the 'General’s Plan' and that it was damaging for such a perception to even exist. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the private talks, said the U.S. responded by imploring the Israelis to go to great lengths to make it clear publicly that this is not their policy. In that same meeting, Blinken also broached the issue of aid getting into Gaza, following up on a stern letter issued by him and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin recently that called for a remedy to the dire situation on the ground for Palestinians. Blinken, according to the official, laid out a series of areas where the Israelis needed to improve, providing a 30-day deadline to begin seeing progress. Days later in Doha, Blinken announced an additional $135 million in U.S. aid to the Palestinians but said again that the assistance would be hopeless if it is not able to get to the civilians in need. Frustration from Arab partners Many Arab leaders this week publicly expressed their exasperation at the status of the cease-fire negotiations more than a year into the conflict. Qatar’s prime minister, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, said he was sad that mediators got so close to a deal several times in recent months only to be derailed. 'Every time we got closer to a solution, unfortunately, there were many steps back,' he told reporters Thursday in Doha. He added that going forward, there would be consequences 'should there be any of the parties that refuse to be constructively part of the negotiations.' Jordan's foreign minister, Ayman Safadi, took it even further, saying directly to Blinken during a meeting Friday in London that the 'Israeli government is not listening to anyone,' and as a result, the conflicts have became a 'nightmare that the region is continuing to live through.' 'The only path to save the region from that is for Israel to stop the aggressions on Gaza, on Lebanon, stop unilateral illegal measures of the West Bank that is also pushing the situation,' Safadi said. Running out of time Many questioned if the timing of the trip was the Biden administration's 11th-hour effort to achieve even the most modest of breakthroughs in the region before the U.S. presidential election. Blinken, instead, pointed to Sinwar's death as providing a much-needed opening for mediators who had spent the last month trying to get back to the negotiating table. The discussions around a post-war plan are being pushed by the U.S. as a way to rebuild goodwill among the various stakeholders after several lethal strikes over the summer, including two that took out the leaders of Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon. This is the last time Blinken will be in the region before Election Day in 11 days, and Democrats had hoped for a cease-fire deal by the time Americans began to vote. That would have helped alleviate the serious criticism many voters have had toward Vice President Kamala Harris' stance on the war. Critics say the Biden administration has not gone far enough to deter Israel's conduct of the war, which has left more than 42,000 Palestinians dead. Local health authorities do not differentiate between militants and civilians in their count but say women and children make up more than half the fatalities.	https://apnews.com/article/us-israel-gaza-lebanon-hamas-blinken-c450119702081057ff6c816d6a19e51a	2024-10-25T09:19:37-07:00	
Here's a look at Musk's contact with Putin and why it matters	WASHINGTON (AP) — Elon Musk, the billionaire owner of major government contractor SpaceX and a key ally of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, has been in regular contact with Russian President Vladimir Putin for the last two years, The Wall Street Journal reported. A person familiar with the situation, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive matter, confirmed to The Associated Press that Musk and Putin have had contact through calls. The person didn't provide additional details about the frequency of the calls, when they occurred or their content. Musk, the world's richest man who also owns Tesla and the social platform X, has emerged as a leading voice on the American right. He's poured millions of dollars into Trump's presidential bid and turned the platform once known as Twitter into a site popular with Trump supporters, as well as conspiracy theorists, extremists and Russian propagandists. Musk's contacts with Putin raise national security questions, given his companies' work for the government, and highlight concerns about Russian influence in American politics. Here's what to know: What they talked about Musk and Putin have spoken repeatedly about personal matters as well as business and geopolitics, The Journal reported Thursday, citing multiple current and former officials in the U.S., Europe and Russia. During one talk, Putin asked Musk not to activate his Starlink satellite system over Taiwan as a favor for Chinese President Xi Jinping, whose ties to Putin have grown closer, the Journal reported. Putin and Xi have met more than 40 times since 2013. Russia has denied the conversations took place. In 2022, Musk said he'd only spoken to Putin once, in a call 18 months earlier focused on space. The Chinese Embassy in Washington said Friday that it was 'not aware of the specifics' of any requests made by Putin on China’s behalf. There was no immediate response to messages left with X and Tesla seeking Musk's comment. What the talks mean for national security Musk’s relationship with Putin raises national security questions given the billions of dollars in government contracts awarded to SpaceX, a critical partner to NASA and government satellite programs. Trump also has vowed to give Musk a role in his administration if he wins next month. The head of any large defense contractor would face similar questions if they held private talks with one of America's greatest adversaries, said Bradley Bowman, a former West Point professor and Senate national security adviser who now serves as senior director of the Center on Military and Political Power at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a Washington-based defense think tank. Bowman said the timing of the calls as reported by The Journal and Musk's changing views on Ukraine was a 'disturbing coincidence.' 'The policy of the U.S. government is to try to isolate Vladimir Putin, and Elon Musk is directly undercutting that,' Bowman said. 'What is Putin doing with Musk? He's trying to reduce his international isolation and impact American foreign policy.' The request from Putin on Starlink as a favor to China is also likely to get attention, given U.S. support for Taiwan and concerns about the growing partnership between the Kremlin and Beijing. Musk, whose Tesla operates Gigafactory Shanghai, has developed a close relationship with China’s top leaders. His remarks about China have been friendly, and he has suggested Taiwan cede some control to Beijing by becoming a special administrative region. Moscow has growing ties to other American adversaries. The U.S. has accused Russia of sending ballistic missiles to Iran and said North Korea sent troops to Russia, possibly for combat in Ukraine. On Ukraine, Musk's views have shifted since he initially supported Kyiv following Russia's invasion in 2022 and provided it with his Starlink system for communications. Musk then refused to allow Ukraine in 2023 to use Starlink for a surprise attack on Russian soldiers in Crimea. He also floated a proposal in 2022 to end the war that would have required Ukraine to drop its plans for NATO membership and given Russia permanent control of Crimea, which it seized in 2014. The plan infuriated Ukrainian leaders. One person familiar with the talks between Musk and Putin told The Journal that there is no evidence the contact between Musk and Putin represents a security problem for the U.S. Asked about Musk’s contacts with Putin, White House national security spokesman John Kirby told reporters Friday that he had no information to share. The CIA, Pentagon and National Security Agency and had no comment. The State Department didn't immediately respond to an email seeking comment. Musk's close ties to Trump Musk recently appeared at a Trump rally, sporting a Make America Great Again hat and delivered a ominous warning that if Trump lost the race 'this will be the last election.' Last year, Musk mocked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s request for aid for his country with a meme and said in February that the U.S. should cut its assistance because Ukraine couldn’t win. Trump, who has praised Putin’s leadership and criticized the NATO alliance and U.S. aid for Ukraine, has raised questions about what he would be willing to concede if he's elected in a negotiation over Ukraine's future U.S. intelligence officials and private tech analysts have concluded that Russia is working to covertly support Trump with disinformation and propaganda targeting his Democratic opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris. Since he took over X, it has become a leading online source of Russian propaganda and disinformation aimed at Americans. Trump has faced scrutiny over his own recent contacts with Putin, outlined in a new book by Watergate journalist Bob Woodward. Woodward quoted an unnamed Trump aide who said the former president and Putin may have had as many as seven conversations since Trump lost reelection in 2020. Before one of the calls, the aide said they were asked to leave Trump’s office to give the two privacy. The Trump campaign and the Kremlin have denied those calls occurred. In response to questions about Musk and Putin, Trump campaign press secretary Karoline Leavitt called the billionaire 'a once-in-a-generation industry leader' whose ideas could benefit 'our broken federal bureaucracy.' 'As for Putin, there’s only one candidate in the race that he did not invade another country under, and it’s President Trump,' Leavitt said in a statement. 'President Trump has long said that he will re-establish his peace through strength foreign policy to deter Russia’s aggression and end the war in Ukraine.' Russia confirms one conversation Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Friday rejected The Journal’s report as 'absolutely false information.' Peskov said Putin and Musk once held a 'medium-length phone conversation' prior to 2022 that was 'as more of an introductory nature' and that the two talked about 'visionary technologies, technological solutions for the future.' 'After that, Musk had no contacts with Putin,' Peskov said, dismissing The Journal’s article as political. 'The election has entered its home stretch, and of course the opponents stop at nothing,' Peskov said. 'Remember that a week ago they were saying that Putin allegedly talks to Trump all day long. Now he allegedly talks to Musk all the time. It’s all untrue.' Ukraine’s military intelligence told the AP that they would 'refrain from commenting' about communication between Putin and Musk. ___ Associated Press writers Didi Tang in Washington, Daria Litvinova in Tallinn, Estonia, and Illia Novikov in Kyiv, Ukraine, contributed.	https://apnews.com/article/musk-putin-x-trump-tesla-election-russia-9cecb7cb0f23ccce49336771280ae179	2024-10-25T08:21:30-07:00	
Tunisian commentator sentenced to two years under controversial anti-fake news law	TUNIS, Tunisia (AP) — A well-known Tunisian attorney and commentator was sentenced to two years in prison over remarks she made about the North African country and its treatment of migrants from sub-Saharan Africa. Sonia Dahmani was found guilty on Thursday of violating a statute against fake news that critics have long argued Tunisian authorities use to stifle criticism of President Kais Saied. Saied, a populist, has aggressively pursued his opponents since taking office, often casting them as foreign agents or accusing them of undermining state security. The cybercrime statute, known as Decree-Law 54, makes it illegal 'to produce, spread, disseminate, send or write false news ... with the aim of infringing the rights of others, harming public safety or national defense or sowing terror among the population.' Since its passage in 2022, journalists and human rights groups have said Decree-Law 54 is among the ways that authorities have curbed freedom of expression in Tunisia under Saied. Dozens of opposition figures, journalists and political commentators have been charged after criticizing the government, including Dahmani, who is being prosecuted in several cases for remarks she made earlier this year, her attorney Sami Ben Ghazi told The Associated Press. In May, she sarcastically criticized Tunisia on a private radio station, calling attention to the economic conditions and the racism afflicting Black migrants living in the country. 'What a magnificent country you speak of,' she said on the radio during a discussion about migrants that followed clashes between them and Tunisians. Masked plainclothes officers subsequently raided the headquarters of Tunisia’s bar association to arrest her. Ben Ghazi called Thursday's sentence unjust and 'part of the pattern of harassment practiced by the authorities against free voices' while Dahmani's defense committee said she was a 'victim of injustice and various judicial abuses.' Arrests ramped up in the months before Tunisia's Oct. 6 presidential election, which Saied won with 90.7% of the vote. Government critics including Dahmani, her fellow Radio IFM commentators Mourad Zeghidi and Borhane Bsaïs, and journalist and commentator Mohammed Boughalleb were all sentenced on charges that included violating Decree-Law 54. Zeghidi and Bsais in May were sentenced to one year in prison for violating the statute. Boughalleb was sentenced to six months in prison in April. 'Under such a decree, no critic of the authorities can feel safe,' Human Rights Watch said in a report last December in which it documented 22 court cases against government critics. Tunisia is among the countries in which populist politicians have in recent years pushed for legislation targeting the dissemination of so-called fake news. From Egypt to Uganda, press freedom advocates have said that leaders have exploited newfound concerns about misinformation to pass new laws that stifle legitimate criticism of the government. The National Syndicate of Tunisian Journalists in a statement expressed its 'firm condemnation of the ongoing policy of blackout and restrictions on journalistic work' put in place by authorities. __ Metz reported from Rabat, Morocco.	https://apnews.com/article/tunisia-dahmani-decree-54-misinformation-crackdown-dissent-5d1cd879bb081796439a469db744014e	2024-10-25T08:10:59-07:00	
Brazil reaches a $23 billion settlement with mining firms over a 2015 environmental disaster	SAO PAULO (AP) — Brazil's federal government on Friday reached a multibillion-dollar settlement with the mining companies responsible for a 2015 dam collapse that the government said was the country's worst-ever environmental disaster. Under the agreement, Samarco — a joint venture of Brazilian mining giant Vale and Anglo-Australian firm BHP — will pay 132 billion reais ($23 billion) over 20 years. The payments are meant to compensate for human, environmental and infrastructure damage caused by the release of an immense amount of toxic mining waste into a major river in southeastern Minas Gerais state, killing 19 people and ravaging entire villages. 'We are fixing a disaster that could have been avoided, but wasn’t,' President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva said in a hall of the presidential palace, surrounded by governors of the affected states, members of his administration, reporters and victims. Lula's speech, filled with criticism of what he called the mining companies’ irresponsibility in chasing profit over safety, was met with applause from the audience. The toxic sludge — enough to fill 13,000 Olympic-size swimming pools — flowed down the Doce River for 420 miles to the Atlantic Ocean, contaminating waterways and coastal areas in two neighboring states. The mining companies told the federal government during negotiations that they had already paid 38 billion reais ($6.7 billion) in reparations. In a statement Friday, Samarco said the agreement allowed for the resolution of lawsuits related to the dam rupture. Rodrigo Vilela, Samarco's president, said in the statement that the collapse was a watershed in their history, which they 'deeply regret and will never forget.' 'The agreement signed today reinforces Samarco and its shareholders’ commitment to people, communities and the environment, ensuring the continuation of full and definitive repair and compensation for the damages,' he added. The settlement includes compensation for more than 300,000 victims, though that figure does not account for everyone affected. Twice as many people — 620,000 — took their case to a UK court on Monday seeking reparations. The class action lawsuit at the High Court in London seeks an estimated 36 billion pounds ($47 billion) in damages from BHP. The case was filed in Britain because one of BHP’s two main legal entities was based in London at the time. The London suit prompted the Brazilian Supreme Court's Chief Justice, Luís Roberto Barroso, to personally seek Lula's commitment to ensure parties reached an agreement domestically. 'I spoke with Lula and said, ‘Mr. President, there is a case abroad, and it will be very damaging to the Brazilian courts if this matter is resolved outside the country,’' Barroso said Friday at the presidential palace. The Brazilian federal government said victims would receive 35,000 reais ($6,150) each, while fishermen and farmers would be paid 95,000 reais ($17,000) in total through monthly installments over four years. Cristiano Sales, 42, was born and raised in Bento Rodrigues, one of the districts in the municipality of Mariana that was washed over by the sludge nine years ago. When he returned to the ruins of his house three months later, the only item he found was a jersey from his favorite soccer team, Cruzeiro. Sales lives in a new house in a neighborhood built by the mining companies as part of compensation to his father. After filing a lawsuit, he personally received 100,000 reais ($18,000) and is still pursuing additional reparations through the London suit. 'Money can’t pay for what we’ve been through here,' he said. 'We take the money because it’s our right. But to say that 100,000 or even 200,000 or 300,000 could bring back the life we had — I don’t think any amount of money can do that.' Melbourne, Australia-based BHP said in a statement on Oct. 19 it believes the U.K. action is unnecessary because it duplicates matters covered by reparation efforts and legal proceedings in Brazil, but will continue to defend itself. Pogust Goodhead, the law firm representing the plaintiffs, said Friday the settlement in Brazil shouldn’t have any impact on the London case and that there will be no double compensation. The firm added that its clients were excluded from the negotiations and are still pursuing full reparations for unresolved damages. 'The Mariana agreement signed this Friday in Brazil demonstrates that, after 9 years of negligence, the mining companies have finally decided to react to the pressure from public opinion and the trial in England, which began last Monday,' the law firm said in a statement. 'Even so, the amounts defined are far from covering the profound losses suffered by the victims, who continue to fight for justice and full reparations.' ___ Hughes reported from Bento Rodrigues, Brazil.	https://apnews.com/article/brazil-mining-collapse-settlement-bhp-samarco-vale-mariana-8b84c808fa25139e019d7981a3b7de19	2024-10-25T07:58:43-07:00	
Calls for reparations for Britain's slave trade are rooted in dark legacy	LONDON (AP) — A debate about reparations for Britain’s role in the slave trade overshadowed a summit in Samoa of the Commonwealth, many of whose member nations were once British colonies. Britain insists it will not pay to make amends for the historic wrong, but both King Charles III and Prime Minister Keir Starmer addressed the issue indirectly at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting. 'None of us can change the past but we can commit with all our hearts to learning its lessons and to finding creative ways to right the inequalities that endure,' Charles said. The legacy of slavery is interwoven in some of Britain’s richest and most revered institutions — from the Church of England to the insurance giant Lloyd’s of London to the monarchy itself. 'Britain benefited from transatlantic enslavement,' said Olivette Otele, professor of the legacies and memory of slavery at the School of African and Oriental Studies at University of London. 'The money and the money trail is there to prove it. So we need to have these conversations much more openly.' It's a discussion that has been going on for a long time. Charles, when he was Prince of Wales, spoke of the 'appalling atrocity of slavery, which forever stains our history' during a visit to Barbados in 2021. At the Commonwealth summit two years ago in Rwanda, he spoke of his sorrow over slavery and its legacy for Indigenous communities and said it was a 'conversation whose time has come.' Here's a look at why the issue is getting attention now. What was Britain's role in the slave trade? Britain got involved in the slave trade in the mid-1500s, following Portugal and Spain. John Hawkins, one of the most notable sailors and naval commanders of the 16th century, is considered one of the pioneers of the English slave trade triangle. Goods were traded in West Africa for captured slaves who were shipped across the Atlantic to work in British sugar and tobacco plantations in the Caribbean and the Americas. Goods produced in the so-called New World were transported back to England. In 1672, the Royal African Company, established under King Charles II and run by his brother, Prince James (the future King James II), was given a monopoly on the slave trade. The company trafficked 80,000 African men, women and children to slavery in the Americas and about 20,000 died on the journey before the monopoly ended in 1698 when any Englishman could trade slaves. At its height, Britain was the world's biggest slave-trading nation and transported more than 3 million Africans across the Atlantic. When was it abolished? An abolitionist movement arose in England in the late 1700s, supported by Quakers, a few politicians and some former slaves. The slave trade was not outlawed until 1807. Even then Parliament did not emancipate slaves in its territories until 1833. 'But it didn’t go as planned,' Otele said. 'Plantation owners, some of them absentee plantation owners because they lived in Britain, were extremely wealthy. Their ancestors had been trading for centuries so they resisted and put pressure on Parliament ... to pay them for the so-called loss of their property..' The 1837 Compensation Act led to 20 million pounds, 40% of the national budget at the time, being paid to plantation owners for the loss of their slaves. It took until 2015 for the Bank of England to pay off the debt from those payouts. What is the current debate about? The movement demanding reparations goes back decades. The U.K. has never formally apologized for its role in the trade. Studies estimate Britain would owe between hundreds of millions and trillions of dollars in compensation to descendants of slaves. Former Prime Minister Tony Blair expressed deep sorrow in 2006 for Britain’s role in the trade but stopped short of offering an apology or compensation for descendants of slaves. Activists said Blair's careful word choice reflected the government’s fear of paying out huge reparations. In 2013, the Caribbean trade bloc known as Caricom made a list of requests including that European governments formally apologize and create a repatriation program for those who wish to return to their homeland, which has not happened. On Thursday, Bahamas Prime Minister Philip Davis said he wanted a 'frank' discussion with Starmer about the matter and would seek mention of reparations in the leaders’ final statement at the Samoa event. All three candidates to be the next Commonwealth Secretary-General — from Gambia, Ghana and Lesotho — have endorsed policies of reparatory justice for slavery. Other European nations, including the Netherlands, and some British institutions have started to own up to their role in the trade. The Church of England last year announced a 100-million-pound ($130 million) fund last year for projects 'focused on improving opportunities for communities adversely impacted by historic slavery,' though a church advisory panel said it should increase it to $1 billion. Some of the descendants of slave traders have made their own amends. A descendant of Scottish 19th-century sugar and coffee plantation owner John Gladstone — father of 19th-century British Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone — apologized last year to Guyana for his great-great-great grandfather's role as an absentee slave owner in what was then British Guiana. He received 100,000 pounds in compensation for hundreds of slaves. After earlier insisting that the Samoa summit should avoid becoming mired in the past and 'very, very long endless discussions about reparations,' Starmer acknowledged 'calls to face up to the harms and injustices of the past through reparatory justice.' Starmer said the 'most effective way to maintain a spirit of respect and dignity is by working together to make sure the future is not in the shadow of the past, but is illuminated by it.' Jacqueline McKenzie — a partner at London law firm Leigh Day — working on the issue of reparations, said the issue of how to reckon with the legacy of the slave trade is 'complex.' 'Reparations is not straightforward,' she said. 'At the moment it’s a discussion among the elites, and the people, the descendants of the enslaved … aren’t really part of the discussion.' ___ Associated Press writer Jill Lawless contributed.	https://apnews.com/article/britain-slavery-history-reparations-colonies-16c0e99c4b4fa6da743baa21c8dcd09f	2024-10-25T07:55:05-07:00	
The Latest: Trump sits down with Joe Rogan, Harris to rally with Beyoncé	Kamala Harris and Donald Trump will center their attention on Texas on Friday with both presidential candidates holding events in the staunchly Republican state. The vice president will team up with Beyoncé for a rally aimed at highlighting the perilous medical fallout from the state’s strict abortion ban and putting the blame squarely on Trump. Meanwhile, the former president held a news conference in Austin Friday afternoon and is expected to sit down with podcaster Joe Rogan later in the day. President Joe Biden visited a reservation in Arizona, a long-promised trip to Indian Country that Democrats hope could boost Harris' turnout effort in a key battleground state. Follow the AP’s Election 2024 coverage at: https://apnews.com/hub/election-2024. Here’s the latest: Trump wraps remarks in Austin without taking questions from reporters Donald Trump has concluded his remarks in Austin, Texas. He spoke for about 45 minutes, with a heavy emphasis on immigration. Trump did not take questions from reporters while speaking, and he didn’t answer shouted questions afterward. Both major presidential candidates are in Texas on Friday. Kamala Harris took questions from reporters ahead of her rally later this evening with Beyoncé in Houston. Trump predicts he’ll break records for deportations if he wins the election Donald Trump is predicting he’ll break records for the number of people deported from the United States if he wins the election. At an appearance in Texas, Trump praised President Dwight D. Eisenhower for overseeing mass deportations as part of a sweeping plan known by the racist title 'Operation Wetback.' Trump has made mass deportation a centerpiece of his campaign for a second term in the White House. 'I think we’ll break that record,' Trump said of Eisenhower’s deportations. 'Not that I want to break it, but I think we have no choice.' He said his administration will put 'these vicious and bloodthirsty criminals in jail or kick them the hell out of the country.' Leonardo DiCaprio endorses Harris for president Leonardo DiCaprio is endorsing Kamala Harris for president, with the Oscar-winning actor expressing support for the Democratic nominee in a video Friday. 'Climate change is killing the earth and ruining our economy. We need a bold step forward to save our economy, our planet and ourselves,' DiCaprio said. 'That’s why I’m voting for Kamala Harris.' DiCaprio, long an outspoken advocate for addressing the climate crisis, has supported Democratic candidates in the past. In early 2020, he attended a fundraiser for Joe Biden at the home of former Paramount Pictures chief Sherry Lansing. With less than two weeks until Election Day, Harris has received the support of many high-profile entertainers including Taylor Swift, Oprah Winfrey, Meryl Streep, Chris Rock and George Clooney. Republican nominee Donald Trump’s celebrity supporters include Elon Musk, Dennis Quaid, Roseanne Barr and Kid Rock. In December 2016, DiCaprio and the head of his eponymous foundation met with Trump, then president-elect, to discuss how jobs centered on preserving the environment could boost the economy. Trump again likens the US to a ‘garbage can’ AUSTIN, Texas — Former President Donald Trump is doubling — and tripling — down on likening the United States to a trash receptacle. 'We’re like a garbage can. We’re like a garbage can,' he said Friday. He noted that, 'The first time I said it was last night.' During a Thursday night event, Trump had declared that the U.S. was 'like a garbage can for the world.' Vice President Kamala Harris, in response on Friday, called that comment, 'Another example of how he really belittles our country.' Moments after her reaction, Trump said it twice more during an appearance in Texas. Trump derides Harris’ rally with Beyoncé as ‘rubbing shoulders’ with ‘woke celebrities’ AUSTIN, Texas — Donald Trump is dismissing Kamala Harris’ rally in Houston with Beyoncé as his opponent 'rubbing shoulders' with 'woke celebrities.' 'I think she’s coming here today,' Trump said in Austin. 'She picked the wrong place. I think she picked the wrong place.' He said that instead of her rally with a superstar, Harris should meet with victims of violent crimes committed by people in the country illegally. He called some immigrants arrested for allegedly committing violent crimes 'animals.' Trump says Biden administration has made Texas ‘ground zero’ for a border ‘invasion’ AUSTIN, Texas — Former President Donald Trump is saying in Texas that Vice President Kamala Harris is using the state as a 'staging ground' to bring armies of people into the U.S. illegally. The former president says the Biden administration is making Texas 'ground zero' for a border 'invasion,' though he blamed Harris. Trump also suggested that mismanagement of the U.S.-Mexico border was a crime against humanity. There is no evidence to support those claims, however. Trump slams judge’s order for Virginia to restore some purged voter registrations AUSTIN, Texas — Trump has kicked off his remarks in Texas by slamming a judge ordering Virginia to restore registered voters who were purged from the state’s voter roles close to Election Day. 'The outrageous decision goes against the bedrock of our democracy,' Trump said. ‘I do not have a Cabinet yet’ HOUSTON — Asked about reporting that JP Morgan chief Jamie Dimon would consider a role in Kamala Harris’ possible administration, Harris said she didn’t want to talk about theoretical leadership with the election not over. 'We have 11 days to go,' she said. 'I do not have a Cabinet yet.' Harris pledges to sign bill ‘putting back in place reproductive freedom’ HOUSTON — Answering a question about how she as president would advance reproductive rights legislation through Congress, where Democrats might not have control in either chamber following the elections, Kamala Harris promoted Democrat Colin Allred’s effort to unseat GOP Sen. Ted Cruz from his Texas seat. 'It is my pledge — when Congress passes a bill putting back in place reproductive freedom — I will sign it,' she added. 'There’s no other plan. We keep fighting.' Harris calls Texas ‘ground zero’ when it comes to issues related to abortion HOUSTON — Vice President Kamala Harris kicked off her remarks to reporters ahead of a campaign event in Texas Friday by calling the non-battleground state 'ground zero' when it comes to issues related to abortion. The Democratic nominee called elected leaders to task for that situation, saying her event Friday night will be centered around 'the harm' that has caused for Americans. Trump arrives in Austin, Texas AUSTIN, Texas — Former President Donald Trump has arrived in Austin, Texas, where he’ll deliver remarks ahead of an expected taping of Joe Rogan’s popular podcast. He’ll be speaking in an airport hangar before invited guests. Signs that read 'END MIGRANT CRIME' and 'DEPORT ILLEGALS NOW' will be his backstop. Trump visiting Texas to tape Joe Rogan’s podcast and to criticize Harris on immigration AUSTIN, Texas — Former President Donald Trump on Friday is heading to Texas — his first public campaign event in the state since receiving the Republican nomination — to sit down with the most listened-to-podcaster in the country, creating another opportunity for him to highlight the hypermasculine tone that has defined much of his 2024 White House bid. The GOP presidential nominee will hold a news conference in Austin and meet with podcaster Joe Rogan at his studio there. It is only the second time he has campaigned in the state after a Dallas visit where he addressed members of the National Rifle Association in May. On Friday, his Democratic opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris, will also be visiting Texas for a rally on abortion rights with superstar Beyoncé. Read more here. Holocaust survivor criticizes Harris for calling Trump a ‘fascist’ WASHINGTON — A 94-year-old Holocaust survivor is criticizing Vice President Kamala Harris for calling former President Donald Trump a ' fascist.' Jerry Wartski appears in a video for Trump’s campaign, saying, 'I know more about Hitler than Kamala will ever know in a thousands lifetimes.' He’s referring to Nazi leader Adolf Hitler, who he describes having murdered his parents. In the video, Wartski rolls up his sleeve to reveal a number tattooed on his arm while he was a prisoner at the Auschwitz concentration camp. He says Harris owes Holocaust victims and survivors an apology. Harris called Trump a fascist during a CNN town hall this week. She said his comments denouncing the 'enemy within' mean he may prove willing to target Americans who disagree with him should he win the Nov. 5 election. Trump to return to Milwaukee’s Fiserv Forum next week MILWAUKEE — Former President Donald Trump is returning to the site of the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee just four days before the election. Trump plans to hold a rally at the Fiserv Forum on Nov. 1, his campaign said Friday. The stop comes two days after another planned rally in Green Bay, Wisconsin. The state is one of the most hard-fought this year with both sides expecting a razor-close finish. Vice President Kamala Harris was in both Milwaukee and Green Bay last week. Johnson and McConnell blast Harris over saying she believes Trump is a fascist WASHINGTON — House Speaker Mike Johnson and Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell are criticizing Vice President Kamala Harris for saying she believes that former President Donald Trump is a fascist during a CNN town hall, saying her words could lead to violence. 'Labeling a political opponent as a ‘fascist,’ risks inviting yet another would-be assassin to try robbing voters of their choice before Election Day,' the two Republicans said in their statement. When asked if she believed Trump is a fascist, Harris replied twice, 'Yes, I do.' Later, she brought it up herself, saying Trump would, if elected again, be 'a president who admires dictators and is a fascist.' The two lawmakers said they have been briefed on ongoing threats to Trump and called on Harris to take the threats seriously, adding 'stop escalating the threat environment, and help ensure President Trump has the necessary resources to be protected from those threats.' The two did not address comments coming from Trump, who at his rallies has also referred to Harris as a 'Marxist' and a 'fascist.' ACLU wants South Carolina to reopen voter registration for 1,900 teens COLUMBIA, S.C. — A civil rights organization wants South Carolina to reopen voter registration for nearly 1,900 teens after the state Department of Motor Vehicles failed to notify election officials that they checked the box to register as they got their driver’s licenses. The teens were 17 at the time they went to the DMV, but would be 18 by Election Day. The American Civil Liberties Union filed the lawsuit Tuesday, a day after early voting started in South Carolina. Lawyers for the DMV, election officials and lawmakers said they are sympathetic toward the teens, but it is too late to verify the teens are eligible and adjust the voting rolls. A judge promised a ruling Friday after hearing arguments from both sides. Federal judge orders Virginia to restore more than 1,600 voter registrations ALEXANDRIA, Va. — A federal judge on Friday ordered Virginia to restore more than 1,600 voter registrations that she said were illegally purged in the past two months to keep noncitizens from voting. U.S. District Judge Patricia Giles granted an injunction request brought against Virginia election officials by the Justice Department, which claimed the voter registrations were wrongly canceled during a 90-day quiet period ahead of the November election that restricts states from making large-scale changes to their voter rolls. Thomas Sanford, an attorney with the Virginia attorney general’s office, told the judge at the conclusion of Friday’s hearing that the state intends to appeal her ruling. The Justice Department and private groups, including the League of Women Voters, said many of the 1,600 voters whose registrations were canceled were citizens whose registrations were canceled because of bureaucratic errors or simple mistakes like a wrongly checked box on a form. Election workers identified about 2,500 Pennsylvania voter registration forms that may be fraudulent, officials say LANCASTER, Pa. — Officials in a Pennsylvania county say an investigation is underway after election workers identified about 2,500 voter registration forms that may be fraudulent. The Lancaster County Elections Board and the county prosecutor plan to hold a news conference Friday to discuss the steps taken so far. The county says the registrations in question arrived in two batches shortly before Pennsylvania’s deadline to register to vote, which was this past Monday. Harris, Beyoncé team up for a Texas rally on abortion rights and hope battleground states hear them HOUSTON — Vice President Kamala Harris will team up with Beyoncé on Friday for a rally in solidly Republican Texas aimed at highlighting the perilous medical fallout from the state’s strict abortion ban and putting the blame squarely on Donald Trump. It’s a message intended to register far beyond Texas in the political battleground states, where Harris is hoping that the aftereffects from the fall of Roe v. Wade will spur voters to turn out to support her quest for the presidency. Harris will also be joined at the rally by women who have nearly died from sepsis and other pregnancy complications because they were unable to get proper medical care, including women who never intended to end their pregnancies.

Biden heads to Indian Country as Harris steps up appeal to Native American voters PHOENIX — President Joe Biden is at last making his way to Indian Country, paying a long-promised visit to a reservation in Arizona that Democrats hope could provide a boost to Vice President Kamala Harris’ turnout effort in a key battleground state. Biden’s visit to the Gila River Indian Community’s land on the outskirts of metro Phoenix will be his first to Indian Country as president — something he promised tribal leaders he would do nearly two years ago. During the visit, Biden intends to formally apologize to Native Americans for the U.S. government’s role in the abuse and neglect of Native children sent to federal boarding schools to assimilate them into white society, according to the White House. Read more here. Allies hope a Trump win changes the system for mortgages. Some warn it will make them pricier If Donald Trump wins the presidential election, Republicans hope he will fulfill a longstanding GOP goal of privatizing the mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which have been under government control since the Great Recession. But Democrats and some economists warn that, especially in this time of high mortgage rates, doing so will make buying a home even more expensive. Read more here. Like Biden, Harris puts focus on Trump as Election Day draws near WASHINGTON — With the end of her abbreviated presidential campaign in sight, Kamala Harris is trying to put the focus squarely on Donald Trump and his threat to democratic institutions, echoing the strategy used by Joe Biden before he ended his reelection bid. It’s a bet that fear of the former Republican president can rally Harris supporters and nudge undecided voters to her side in the final days. Harris’ challenge will be connecting philosophical questions about American democracy with the everyday concerns of individual Americans. The effort will be on full display Tuesday, when Harris delivers what her team describes as her closing argument from the Ellipse, the grassy space adjacent to the National Mall in Washington. It’s the same place where Trump stood when he urged his supporters to march on the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, in what became a bloody attempt to prevent the certification of Biden’s election victory.

Criminals may be leveraging climate change as record acreage burns in Brazil's Amazon	BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) — Wildfires in Brazil have swept through an area the size of Switzerland, a level of destruction that will take decades to recover, if it ever does, according to a new satellite assessment. The breadth of forest that has been lost or degraded was revealed as smoke that has blanketed the country cleared, thanks to rains that may be ending the worst drought Brazil has ever recorded. 'The data is exceptionally alarming, it's a very abrupt surge,' Ane Alencar, science director at the Amazon Environmental Research Institute, a Brazilian nonprofit, told The Associated Press. The area that burned between January and mid-October 2024 represents an 846% increase over the same period in 2023. That's five times larger than the forest fires of 2019 when, under far-right President Jair Bolsonaro, rampant destruction of the Amazon made headlines worldwide. The estimate comes from the National Institute for Space Research, which tracks Brazil's official deforestation rate. This surge in fire comes one year before the Amazon city of Belém will host the annual U.N. climate conference, COP30. The level of destruction is raising suspicions among Brazilian officials and experts that criminals are using climate change to their advantage. Deforestation in the Amazon usually begins with chainsaws. Wet, fallen trees are left lying on the ground until they're dry enough to set afire. They're not even used for lumber. Now with the forest drying out from drought, lawbreakers seeking to create more pasture may be skipping the expensive, labor-intensive step of felling trees. A lighter and a few gallons of gasoline suffice to start a blaze. 'The drought played a major role in fueling the spread, but fire has also been weaponized,' Alencar said. 'The forest’s resilience to a severe drought is proving to be very low,' André Lima, secretary of deforestation control at the Ministry of the Environment and Climate Change, told the AP in his office in Brasilia. 'You don't need 1 million people setting fires to cause the disaster. One thousand can do it. We recorded 500 large blazes, that all began with a match.' Fueled by human-induced climate change and the El Nino phenomenon, the world’s largest basin is reeling from two years of severe drought. Many rivers fell to record lows in 2023, then broke those records again in 2024. Fish and endangered river dolphins have died in water that is too hot for them. Hundreds of river communities have been stranded without transportation. Then came fire. In September, wildfires surged through the region, doubling the acreage that had burned so far this year. With more than two months still remaining in 2024, it's already the largest area burned since the government began using its current methodology a decade ago. The estimate of forest loss comes as delegates from around the world are meeting in the Colombian city of Cali for COP16, focused on preserving biodiversity. The hypothesis that criminals are piggybacking on climate change needs more study, Lima said. But there is some evidence for it. One clue is that the conservation area that has suffered the most damage is Jamanxim National Forest. Dozens of landgrabbers have been illegally ranching cattle there, hoping their operations will be legalized. It is near the city of Novo Progresso, a deforestation hotspot where Bolsonaro, who favors economic development over forest preservation, received 83% of the votes in his failed 2022 re-election bid. The blazes have swept through 1,900 square kilometers (733 square miles) of Jamanxim this year, mostly in September, a 700% increase over 2023, according to MapBiomas, a network of non-governmental organizations that monitors land use. The unprecedented rise in fire has prompted Brazil's government to consider mandating that all burned areas be reforested — a deterrent for landgrabbers who hope to convert public forest into their own private pasture. Lima thinks local and state governments should act as well, since most fires start on rural private property, which is their jurisdiction. 'We need structural changes in policies to address climate change,' he said. The rise of wildfire in the Amazon is part of a global trend and makes climate change worse. A recent study published in the journal Science estimated that carbon emissions from forest fires increased 60% between 2001 and 2023. The researchers warned that forests, and all the carbon they store, are increasingly vulnerable to fire. Unlike wildfire in North America, where blazes sometimes reach treetops and expand from there, in the Amazon rainforest, fire spreads mostly through leaves on the ground, causing less harm. The deforestation control agency, known as INPE, tallies these areas as burn scars, not as deforestation. That is why, despite the surge in fire, this year's deforestation rate is still slowing under President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva and could end 2024 with a 60% reduction compared to Bolsonaro's years. This shows how deforestation is only one metric — and one that does not provide a full picture for damage to the forest in a given year. 'In areas where the fire was very intense, the forest may completely collapse,' Claudio Almeida, a senior officer at INPE, told the AP. 'Even regions where the fire was not as intense are now severely degraded and fragile. Another season of intense drought and fires could lead to the breakdown of the forest.' ____ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Ex-commander of a Ugandan rebel group has been sentenced to 40 years in prison	A former commander of the Lord’s Resistance Army rebels was sentenced by a court in Uganda on Friday to 40 years in prison for brutal crimes committed by the group during its insurgency that started in the 1980s. The jail sentence of Thomas Kwoyelo — a child soldier turned rebel commander — applies to the most serious crimes he faced, including multiple counts of murder, rape, pillaging, and enslavement. In August, Kwoyelo was convicted on 44 of the 78 counts he faced for crimes committed during the insurgency between 1992 and 2005. The sentence was delivered by a panel of the High Court that sat in Gulu, the northern city where the LRA once was active. He can appeal the sentence. Kwoyelo, whose trial began in 2019, had been in detention since 2009 as Ugandan authorities tried to figure out how to dispense justice in a way that was fair and credible. Human Rights Watch described his trial as 'a rare opportunity for justice for victims of the two-decade war between' Ugandan troops and the LRA. Prosecutors said Kwoyelo held the military rank of colonel within the LRA and that he ordered violent attacks on civilians, many of them displaced by the rebellion. The LRA’s overall leader, Joseph Kony, is believed to be hiding in a vast area of ungoverned bush in central Africa. The U.S. has offered $5 million as a reward for information leading to the capture of Kony, who is also wanted by the International Criminal Court. One of Kony’s lieutenants, Dominic Ongwen, was sentenced in 2021 by the ICC to 25 years of imprisonment for war crimes and crimes against humanity. Thousands of other rebel combatants have received Ugandan government amnesty over the years, but Kwoyelo, who was captured in neighboring Congo, was denied such reprieve. Ugandan officials have never explained why. Kwoyelo, who denied the charges against him, testified that only Kony could answer for LRA crimes, and said everyone in the LRA faced death for disobeying the warlord. The LRA, which began in Uganda as an anti-government rebellion — and later expanded its operations to neighboring Congo as well as Central African Republic — was accused of recruiting boys to fight and keeping girls as sex slaves. At the peak of its power, the group was a notoriously brutal outfit whose members for years eluded Ugandan forces in northern Uganda. The LRA was accused of committing multiple massacres targeting mostly members of the Acholi ethnic group. Kony, himself an Acholi, is a self-proclaimed messiah who said early in his rebellion that he wanted to rule Uganda according to the biblical Ten Commandments. When military pressure forced the LRA out of Uganda in 2005, the rebels scattered across parts of central Africa.

Israeli airstrike in south Lebanon kills 3 journalists as they sleep	BEIRUT (AP) — An Israeli airstrike killed three journalists as they slept at a guesthouse in southeast Lebanon early Friday, a rare strike on an area that had so far been spared the hostilities in the rest of the region. It was the latest in a series of Israeli attacks against journalists covering the war in Gaza and Lebanon in the past year. The 3 a.m. airstrike turned the site — a series of guesthouses nestled among trees that had been rented by various media outlets covering the war — into rubble, with cars marked 'PRESS' overturned and covered in dust and debris. The Israeli army did not issue a warning prior to the strike, and later said it was looking into it. Those killed were camera operator Ghassan Najjar and broadcast technician Mohammed Rida of the Beirut-based pan-Arab Al-Mayadeen TV, and camera operator Wissam Qassim, who worked for Al-Manar TV of Lebanon’s Hezbollah group. It came after a strike earlier in the week that hit an office belonging to Al-Mayadeen on the outskirts of Beirut’s southern suburbs. Both outlets are aligned with Hezbollah and its main backer, Iran. The strike in the Hasbaya region, which had so far been spared from the Israeli airstrikes pummeling other parts of south Lebanon, drew widespread condemnation from officials, journalists and press advocacy groups. TV crews had arrived in Hasbaya, deeming it safer after Israel had ordered an evacuation order for a town further south from which they were reporting. 'That is why we consider it a direct targetting, aimed at getting the journalists out of the south,' said Elsy Moufarrej, coordinator for the Alternative Press Syndicate in Lebanon. 'They want to prevent the journalists from covering and having presence in the south of Lebanon.' Lebanese Information Minister Ziad Makary said the journalists were killed while reporting on what he called Israel’s 'crimes,' and noted they were among a large group of members of the media. 'This is an assassination, after monitoring and tracking, with premeditation and planning, as there were 18 journalists present at the location representing seven media institutions,' he wrote in a post on X. Imran Khan, a senior correspondent for Al Jazeera English who was among the journalists in the Hasbaya Village Club guesthouses, said the airstrike hit at around 3:30 a.m. without warning. 'These were just journalists that were sleeping in bed after long days of covering the conflict,' he posted on social media, adding that he and his team were unhurt. Hussein Hoteit, a cameraman for Egypt’s Al-Qahira TV, said he was sleeping when he woke up to a 'huge weight' as the walls and ceiling collapsed. He was miraculously saved by colleagues who managed to move the debris covering him few minutes later. He said two missiles hit the chalet next door, although he didn’t hear them. He spoke from his hospital bed where he is being treated for thigh injuries. Friday’s deaths are the latest in a long list of journalists who have been killed by Israel in the past year in Gaza and Lebanon. In a report earlier this month, the Committee to Protect Journalists said at least 128 journalists and media workers, all but five of them Palestinian, had been killed in Gaza and Lebanon — more journalists than have died in any year since it started documenting journalist killings in 1992. All of the killings except two were carried out by Israeli forces, it said. 'One year in, Israel’s conduct of the war in Gaza has exacted an unprecedented and horrific toll on Palestinian journalists and the region’s media landscape,' it said in the report released Oct. 4. The killing of journalists has prompted international outcry from press advocacy groups and United Nations experts, although Israel has said it does not deliberately target them. Lebanon’s Health Minister says over the past year 11 journalists have been killed and eight wounded by Israeli fire in Lebanon. In November 2023, two journalists for Al-Mayadeen TV were killed in a drone strike. A month earlier, Israeli shelling in southern Lebanon killed Reuters videographer Issam Abdallah and wounded other journalists from France’s international news agency, Agence France-Presse, and Qatar’s Al-Jazeera TV. This week, Israel accused journalists working for Al Jazeera of being members of militant groups, citing documents it purportedly found in Gaza. The network has denied the claims as 'a blatant attempt to silence the few remaining journalists in the region.' The Committee to Protect Journalists has dismissed them as well, and said that 'Israel has repeatedly made similar unproven claims without producing credible evidence.' Jad Shahrour, spokesperson for the Samir Kassir Eyes Center for Media and Cultural Freedom, told The Associated Press Friday that bombing press centers is a deliberate effort to obliterate the truth. 'It means they are establishing a media blackout,' he said, adding that it was a troubling trend that is now shifting from Gaza to Lebanon. Al-Mayadeen’s director, Ghassan bin Jiddo, alleged that the Israeli strike Friday was intentional and directed at those covering elements of its military offensive. Ali Shoeib, Al-Manar’s well-known correspondent in south Lebanon, was seen in a video filming himself with a cellphone saying that the camera operator who had been working with him for months was killed. Shoeib said the Israeli military knew that the area that was struck housed journalists of different media organizations. 'We were reporting the news and showing the suffering of the victims and now we are the news and the victims of Israel’s crimes,' Shoeib added in the video aired on Al-Manar TV. ___ Karam reported from London.

Greek ferry crews call off strike early ahead of three-day holiday weekend	ATHENS, Greece (AP) — Greek ferry crews have curtailed a four-day strike by several hours, announcing Friday they would go back on the job in the early afternoon instead of at midnight. The strike had threatened to disrupt the travel plans of thousands of Greeks heading to islands for a long weekend ahead of a national holiday on Monday. The Greek seamen’s union said their strike that had left ferries tied up in port since Tuesday would end by 2 p.m. Friday, saying they had won some concessions from the government, including increased fines for violations of working conditions and better unemployment benefits for out-of-work seamen. The union said it would continue to pursue all of its demands, which originally included a 12% pay rise. Labor unions are pressing for the restoration of rights that were significantly rolled back during successive international bailouts between 2010 and 2018. The austerity measures implemented as a condition for the rescue loans included severe cuts to public spending, tax increases and labor reforms that resulted in a weakening of collective bargaining rules. School teachers also held a strike earlier this week, seeking salary increases and more permanent positions for temporary staff, among other demands.	https://apnews.com/article/greece-ferry-strike-61dab30d8338606e84032a7780d93c95	2024-10-25T02:55:17-07:00	
The son-in-law of former Myanmar's strongman is arrested over Facebook posts	BANGKOK (AP) — Myanmar’s security forces arrested the son-in-law of the country’s former longtime military ruler, Than Shwe, for allegedly posting inflammatory statements on his Facebook account, the state-run media said Friday. Nay Soe Maung, a 67-year-old retired colonel and a former army medical officer, was the latest to be arrested and jailed for writing Facebook posts that allegedly spread inflammatory news. His arrest came two weeks after he posted criticism of the current military leader and his condolences for the death of Zaw Myint Maung, a senior member of Myanmar’s former ruling party whose government was ousted during the 2021 military takeover. The state-run The Mirror Daily newspaper said Nay Soe Maung was detained and prosecuted at a police station in Pyigyidagun township in Mandalay, the country’s second-largest city on Wednesday. Friday’s report said people who make incitements or share propaganda and support for opposition groups on social media will be prosecuted under the country's laws including counter-terrorism, electronic transactions, sedition and incitement. Myanmar has been in turmoil since the army seized power from the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi on Feb.1, 2021. The army’s takeover triggered mass public protests that the military and police responded to with lethal force, triggering armed resistance and violence that has escalated into a civil war. Myanmar’s military leadership is known for being close-knit, secretive and sensitive. Data for Myanmar, an independent research group, said in a report last month that about 1,691 people were detained for criticizing the military regime and showing support for opposition groups on social media since the army takeover. Nay Soe Maung is married to a daughter of dictator Than Shwe, who ruled from 1992 until 2011, when he handed power to a nominally civilian, pro-military government. During his rule, he led a feared junta that brutally crushed dissent and routinely jailed political opponents, including Suu Kyi, the charismatic face of Myanmar’s pro-democracy movement. Nay Soe Maung served as a lecturer and rector of the University of Public Health, Yangon, the country’s largest city, after retiring as army doctor. Before the army’s 2021 takeover, he had express support for the previous government led by Aung San Suu Kyi and joined peaceful protests on the streets in Yangon after the military arrested her during the takeover. Days before his arrest, he posted condolences on the death of Zaw Myint Maung, Suu Kyi’s colleague and spokesperson of her NLD party.	https://apnews.com/article/nay-soe-maung-than-shwe-myanmar-incitement-4f2895d28fbe44221378f50bf4b05463	2024-10-25T02:37:53-07:00	
Ukraine's Zelenskyy claims North Korean troops will be deployed by Russia in coming days	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — North Korean troops are poised to be deployed by Russia on the battlefield in Ukraine as early as this weekend, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy claimed Friday. Western officials have warned that such a development would stoke the almost three-year war and bring geopolitical consequences as far away as the Indo-Pacific region. Zelenskyy said Ukrainian intelligence had determined that 'the first North Korean military will be used by Russia in combat zones' between Sunday and Monday. He said on Telegram that the deployment was 'an obvious escalating move by Russia.' He didn’t provide any further details, including where the North Korean soldiers may be sent. Russia has been conducting a ferocious summer campaign along the eastern front in Ukraine, gradually compelling Kyiv to surrender ground. But Russia has struggled to push Ukrainian forces out of its Kursk border region following an incursion almost three months ago. North Korean units were detected on Wednesday in Kursk, according to Ukraine’s Main Intelligence Directorate, known by its acronym GUR. The soldiers had undergone several weeks of training at bases in eastern Russia and had been equipped with clothes for the upcoming winter, GUR said in a statement late Thursday. It estimated the number of North Korean soldiers sent by Pyongyang to Russia at around 12,000, including some 500 officers and three generals. GUR provided no evidence for its claims. The deployment of North Korean forces under a military pact between Moscow and Pyongyang brings a new dimension to the conflict, which is Europe’s biggest war since World War II and has cost tens of thousands of lives on both sides, including many civilians. The U.S. said Wednesday that 3,000 North Korean troops have been deployed to Russia and are training at several locations, calling the move very serious. Zelenskyy said a week ago that his government has intelligence information that 10,000 troops from North Korea are being readied to join Russian forces fighting against his country. He said that a third nation wading into the hostilities would turn the conflict into a 'world war.' North Korea had already been supplying ammunition to Russia under a defense pact, but putting boots on the ground could severely complicate a war that has inflamed international politics, with most Western countries supporting Kyiv. Russian President Vladimir Putin, meanwhile, has looked for support among BRICS countries. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-north-korea-troops-9d83c419ef741259d09860b576b8a27d	2024-10-25T01:52:08-07:00	
7 charged in cyberbullying campaign targeting Paris Olympics' artistic director	PARIS (AP) — French authorities said Friday they have charged seven individuals in connection with a cyberbullying campaign targeting Thomas Jolly, the artistic director behind the Paris Olympics’ opening and closing ceremonies. Jolly became the target of an online hate campaign filled with homophobic and antisemitic abuse following his acclaimed but controversial queer-inclusive opening show in July. He filed a complaint on July 31. The Paris prosecutor’s office, which launched an investigation, reported Friday that the arrests mark only the 'first wave' of detentions, with more expected as authorities expand their probe. The seven defendants, who are 22 to 79 years old, face charges of making death threats, aggravated insults, and cyberbullying, with potential prison sentences and significant fines. Jolly’s opening ceremony was a daring blend of French tradition and LGBTQ+ expression, featuring drag performers, flamboyant runway sequences, and a scene that some have drawn parallels with Da Vinci's 'The Last Supper.' The event, held along the Seine and featuring stars like Celine Dion and Lady Gaga, was meant to be a celebration of freedom and inclusivity. But it became a flashpoint for criticism, with far-right politicians and religious figures condemning some scenes as provocative. Hungary’s ambassador to the Vatican criticized what became known as the 'Last Supper' scene for allegedly mocking Christian iconography. Republican presidential nominee and former U.S. President Donald Trump also weighed in, calling the scene 'a disgrace.' Jolly afterward drew attention away from 'The Last Supper' references, saying that hadn’t been his intention. Among the performers, Hugo Bardin, known as the drag queen Paloma, expressed pride in the event’s bold message of inclusion and called it 'a really important moment for the French people and the representation of France around the world.' Le Filip, the winner of Drag Race France, also expressed shock at the backlash against Jolly's event, describing the ceremony as 'a crowning moment' for the LGBTQ+ community. The prosecutor’s office Friday emphasized the seriousness of the charges, noting that the case reflects a troubling pattern of cyberbullying and hate speech directed at prominent figures. It said the suspects sought to 'intimidate and silence expressions of inclusivity' and diversity in a highly public and symbolic event. The arrests are seen as a first step in France’s fight against cyberbullying, which authorities note has become increasingly sophisticated. In Jolly’s case, prosecutors pointed to the disturbing 'pack behavior' of attackers acting independently to escalate the harassment, a pattern seen in other online hate campaigns. The seven accused are set to appear in court on March 5.	https://apnews.com/article/olympics-thomas-jolly-cyberbullying-24c1871664f4d9adc240643ebb20272c	2024-10-25T01:04:36-07:00	
4 astronauts return to Earth after being delayed by Boeing's capsule trouble and Hurricane Milton	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) — Four astronauts returned to Earth on Friday after a nearly eight-month space station stay extended by Boeing's capsule trouble and Hurricane Milton. A SpaceX capsule carrying the crew parachuted before dawn into the Gulf of Mexico just off the Florida coast after undocking from the International Space Station mid-week. The three Americans and one Russian should have been back two months ago. But their homecoming was stalled by problems with Boeing’s new Starliner astronaut capsule, which came back empty in September because of safety concerns. Then Hurricane Milton interfered, followed by another two weeks of high wind and rough seas. SpaceX launched the four — NASA's Matthew Dominick, Michael Barratt and Jeanette Epps, and Russia's Alexander Grebenkin — in March. Barratt, the only space veteran going into the mission, acknowledged the support teams back home that had 'to replan, retool and kind of redo everything right along with us ... and helped us to roll with all those punches.' Their replacements are the two Starliner test pilots Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, whose own mission went from eight days to eight months, and two astronauts launched by SpaceX four weeks ago. Those four will remain up there until February. The space station is now back to its normal crew size of seven — four Americans and three Russians — after months of overflow. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.

2 Indian soldiers and 2 civilian porters are killed in an alleged rebel ambush in Kashmir	SRINAGAR, India (AP) — Two Indian army soldiers and their two civilian porters were killed in a rebel ambush in Indian-controlled Kashmir, officials said Friday. Police said rebels sprayed bullets at an army vehicle carrying soldiers close to the highly militarized line of control near the resort town of Gulmarg on Thursday night. The de facto frontier divides the disputed Kashmir between India and Pakistan, which they both claim it in its entirety. Two soldiers and two civilians working as porters with the Indian military were killed and three other soldiers were wounded, police said. The military said it was a brief firefight and gave no other details. There was no independent confirmation of the incident. On Sunday, gunmen fatally shot at least seven people and injured five others working on a strategic tunnel project near another resort town of Sonamarg. Police blamed militants fighting against Indian rule for decades for the attack. Militants in the Indian-controlled portion of Kashmir have been fighting New Delhi’s rule since 1989. Many Muslim Kashmiris support the rebels’ goal of uniting the territory, either under Pakistani rule or as an independent country. India insists the Kashmir militancy is Pakistan-sponsored terrorism. Pakistan denies the charge, and many Kashmiris consider it a legitimate freedom struggle. Tens of thousands of civilians, rebels and government forces have been killed in the conflict. Nuclear-armed rivals India and Pakistan have fought two of their three wars over Kashmir since they gained independence from British colonial rule in 1947.	https://apnews.com/article/kashmir-india-rebel-ambush-d81cc1d887b8d65ff7446f97a1dd0935	2024-10-24T21:12:53-07:00	
Middle East latest: Israeli strikes on Lebanon and Gaza leave dozens dead	Lebanon’s state-run National News Agency said an Israeli airstrike hit guesthouses where journalists were staying in southeast Lebanon, killing three media staffers from two different news agencies Friday. In the southern Gaza Strip, an Israeli attack in the l eft 38 people dead. Several journalists have been killed since a near-daily exchange of fire began along the Lebanon-Israel border on Oct. 8, 2023. Lebanon’s health ministry says the total toll over the past year is over 2,500 killed and 12,000 wounded. The fighting in Lebanon has driven 1.2 million people from their homes, including more than 400,000 children, according to the United Nations children’s agency. Israeli strikes have killed much of Hezbollah’s top leadership since fighting ramped up in September. Israel’s offensive in Gaza has killed over 42,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities, who do not differentiate between militants and civilians. The Israel-Hamas war began after Hamas-led militants on Oct. 7, 2023, blew holes in Israel’s security fence and stormed in, killing some 1,200 people — mostly civilians — and abducting 250 others. United States Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with Jordan’s Foreign Minister, Ayman Safadi, on Friday in London, where the Arab leader accused Israel of engaging in ethnic cleansing in Gaza. Safadi did not mince words when describing Israel’s role in the conflicts, saying cease-fire negotiation mediators are trying to 'get through the nightmare that the region continues to live in.' ___ Here's the latest: 41 people killed in 24 hours in Lebanon, health ministry says BEIRUT — Lebanon’s health ministry said Friday that 41 people were killed and 133 wounded in the past 24 hours, raising the total toll over the past year of conflict between Israel and Hezbollah to 2,634 killed and 12,252 wounded. Lebanon’s crisis response unit recorded 125 airstrikes and incidents of shelling in the past day, mostly concentrated in southern Lebanon and the Nabatiyeh province. Several intense airstrikes targeted Khiam village in southern Lebanon, killing four people and wounding four others, Lebanon’s state media said. Some 1,097 centers are sheltering 190,975 people, including 43,712 families, displaced by the Israeli offensive in Lebanon, the health ministry's report said. Among these shelters, 929 have reached full capacity. The fighting in Lebanon has driven 1.2 million people from their homes, including more than 400,000 children, according to the U.N. children’s agency. People are also flowing across the border to Syria. Between Sept. 23 and Oct. 25, Lebanese General Security recorded nearly half a million people crossing into Syria, including 348,237 Syrian and 156,505 Lebanese citizens, the report said. Group decries Israeli airstrike that killed 3 journalists JERUSALEM — The Committee to Protect Journalists said it was appalled by the killing of the three journalists by an Israeli strike in Lebanon. The group on Friday called for an independent investigation into why the guesthouse where they were sleeping was targeted. 'CPJ is deeply outraged by yet another deadly Israeli airstrike on journalists, this time hitting a compound hosting 18 members of the press in south Lebanon,' said the organization’s program director, Carlos Martinez de la Serna. 'Deliberately targeting journalists is a war crime under international law. This attack must be independently investigated and the perpetrators must be held to account.' The Israeli army did not issue a warning prior to the strike, and later said it was looking into it. 2 people in Israel killed in rocket attack from Lebanon JERUSALEM — Two people in Israel died of their wounds after a rocket attack from Lebanon on Friday, the country’s rescue services said. A 35-year-old woman and a 21-year-old man died after sustaining critical injuries from rocket shrapnel in the predominantly Arab town of Majd Al-Krum in northern Israel, rescue services said. Rocket shrapnel hit the town’s 'industrial center,' injuring seven others. The Israeli military said that militants in Lebanon fired 45 rockets into Israel on Friday, with some escaping interception. UN human rights chief decries bombing in northern Gaza GENEVA -- The United Nations’ human rights chief says the Israeli government’s actions in northern Gaza 'risk emptying the area of all Palestinians' and argues that 'we are facing what could amount to atrocity crimes.' Volker Türk, the U.N. high commissioner for human rights, decried 'nonstop' bombing in northern Gaza in a statement Friday and said that 'the Israeli military has ordered hundreds of thousands to move, with no guarantees of return. But there is no safe way to leave.' Israel has been carrying out a major offensive in northern Gaza for more than two weeks. Hundreds of people have been killed and tens of thousands have fled their homes. The military says it is battling Hamas fighters who regrouped in the north, one of the first targets of the ground offensive at the start of the war. Türk said that 'the Israeli government’s policies and practices in northern Gaza risk emptying the area of all Palestinians. We are facing what could amount to atrocity crimes, including potentially extending to crimes against humanity.' He said Palestinian armed groups also reportedly continue to operate amongst civilians and put them in harm’s way. Türk called on world leaders to act, pointing to a duty under the Geneva Conventions to ensure respect for international humanitarian law. Three more Israeli soldiers killed in Gaza JERUSALEM — Israel’s military announced Friday that three more soldiers were killed in Gaza. All three died on Wednesday, the military said, without specifying if they were all killed in the same incident or providing any details. In all, 359 Israeli soldiers have been killed in fighting in Gaza since the start of the ground operation, following Hamas militants’ attack on Israel Oct. 7. Israel says 3 injured by shrapnel from rocket attack from Lebanon JERUSALEM — Shrapnel from a rocket attack from Lebanon critically injured three people in Israel Friday, Israeli rescue services said. The three — two 21-year-old men and a 35-year-old woman — were injured in Majd Al-Krum, a predominantly Arab town in the country’s north, rescue services said. It said six others were injured, including an 80-year-old man in serious condition. Israel’s military said the rocket barrage hit a gym in the town. Militants in Lebanon fired 45 projectiles into Israel Friday, including some which were intercepted by Israel’s air defenses and others that fell in open areas, the military said. Israeli military confirms its troops operating near north Gaza hospital JERUSALEM — Israel’s military confirmed Friday that its troops were operating around Kamal Adwan hospital in north Gaza. The hospital’s director had said the facility was facing a catastrophic situation with bombardment, Israeli troops preventing the entry of crucial aid and patients dying for lack of medical supplies. In a social media video posted late Thursday, the hospital’s director, Dr. Hussam Abu Safiya, said the hospital had been directly shelled by a tank, a claim the Israeli military did not immediately respond to. 'We’re a few hours away from the death of all these people,' he said. 'Until when will this continue? Instead of receiving aid, we receive tanks.' Israel said troops were operating in the area because it had intelligence that militants and militant infrastructure were there, and said it had evacuated some patients from the hospital the night before and delivered fuel and supplies to the facility. The Associated Press was not immediately able to verify the claims. The hospital is in the Jabaliya refugee camp in north Gaza, where Israel is staging a renewed offensive against Hamas fighters it says have regrouped there. It has called for the evacuation of all civilians in the north. In a voice recording obtained by AP from Thursday, Abu Safiya said the hospital has 14 patients in pediatric and neonatal intensive care, and several patients had died due to a lack of supplies and medicine like antibiotics. He said that one doctor at the hospital was killed Wednesday, as bombing could be heard in the background. His video showed one woman knelt over the yellowed body of a child, who Abu Safiya said had died that morning. Another small child sat alone on a bed, face bloodied and both arms bandaged, crying as flies swarmed around the open wounds on his head. Jordan's foreign minister alleges Israel is engaging in ethnic cleansing LONDON — United States Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with Jordan’s Foreign Minister, Ayman Safadi, on Friday in London, where the Arab leader accused Israel of engaging in ethnic cleansing in Gaza. 'The only path to save the region from that is for Israel to stop the aggressions on Gaza, on Lebanon, stop unilateral illegal measures of the West Bank that is also pushing this situation,' Safadi said. 'We meet at a very, very critical moment, as you mentioned, the humanitarian situation is really difficult when we look at Northern Gaza, where we do see ethnic cleansing taking place, and that has got to stop,' he said. Safadi is one of many Arab leaders with whom Blinken has met with as he took negotiations over a cease-fire in Gaza and a post war plan on a tour of the Middle East. Safadi did not mince words Friday when describing Israel’s role in the conflicts, saying mediators are trying to 'get through the nightmare that the region continues to live in.' Israeli attack kills 38 overnight in Khan Younis DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — The Israeli military conducted operations overnight into Friday in Khan Younis, killing 38 people and injuring more than a dozen others, health officials said. Palestinians who were killed or injured were taken to the European and Nasser Hospitals. Records from the European hospital obtained by the AP showed at least 15 members from al-Farra family were killed, including 13 children. Gaza Civil Defense spokesperson Mahmoud Bassal posted a video Friday morning of rescuers recovering the bodies of 9 children from the Al-Farra family in Al Manara neighborhood. The Israeli attack, which included airstrikes and shelling, according to health officials, targeted several residential buildings in neighborhoods east of Khan Younis Governorate. Six members of the Abdeen family were also killed, according to health officials. Israel has attacked 55 hospitals, Lebanon's health minister says BEIRUT — Lebanon’s Health Minister Firass Abiad said Friday that Israel has carried out attacks on 55 hospitals — 36 of which were directly hit — leaving 12 people dead and 60 wounded. Abiad told reporters that eight hospitals have been closed while seven are still partially functioning. He said that paramedic groups have been targeted in different areas, killing 151 people and wounding 212. Of the paramedics killed, eight remain in their ambulances in south Lebanon with Israel’s military preventing anyone from reaching them, he said. 'Attacks against the medical and paramedic sectors in Lebanon are direct and intentional aggressions,' Abiad said, adding that Israel’s military claims to have intelligence information on what is happening in Lebanon, thus cannot say that these attacks happened by mistake. 'This is a war crime,' Abiad said. Israeli strike closes Lebanese border crossing with neighboring Syria BEIRUT — An Israeli airstrike in northeast Lebanon has closed another border crossing with neighboring Syria, Lebanon’s state news agency said Friday. The airstrike on the outskirts of the village of Qaa brings the number of border crossings between the two countries that have been struck by Israel’s military to three. That leaves three functioning border crossings. An Israeli airstrike on Oct. 5 blocked a highway and left a giant crater near the Lebanese side of the crossing, known as Masnaa, about 50 kilometers (30 miles) from Beirut. Masnaa is the busiest border crossing between the two countries. In late September, an Israeli airstrike struck the border crossing of Matraba in Lebanon’s northeast, forcing it to close. Lebanon's information minister accuses Israel of committing a war crime BEIRUT — Lebanon’s Information Minister Ziad Makary alleged Friday that the attack on a compound housing journalists which killed three media staffers is an 'assassination' and 'a war crime.' In a statement, Makary said there were 18 journalists representing seven media organizations at the compound in the town of Hasbaya in south Lebanon. The Beirut-based pan-Arab Al-Mayadeen TV said two of its staffers — camera operator Ghassan Najar and broadcast technician Mohammed Rida — were among the journalists killed early Friday. Al-Manar TV of Lebanon’s Hezbollah group said its camera operator Wissam Qassim was also killed in the airstrike. The Israeli military did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the strike in Lebanon. Ghassan bin Jiddo, the director of Al-Mayadeen, alleged in a social media post that the journalists were deliberately targeted. 'We hold the (Israeli) occupation fully responsible for this war crime, in which journalist crews, including the Al-Mayadeen team, were targeted,' he said. An Israeli airstrike on a journalist compound kills 3 TV staffers, Lebanon’s state news says BEIRUT — An Israeli airstrike on a compound housing journalists in southeast Lebanon has killed three media staffers, Lebanon’s state-run National News Agency said Friday. Local news station Al Jadeed aired footage from the scene showing collapsed buildings and cars marked 'PRESS,' covered in dust and rubble. The Israeli army did not issue a warning prior to the strike, which hit a collection of chalets that had been rented by various media outlets.

Deadly storm blows away from northern Philippines, but forecasters warn it may do a U-turn	MANILA, Philippines (AP) — Tropical storm Trami blew away from the northwestern Philippines on Friday, leaving at least 46 people dead after extensive flooding that forced authorities to scramble for more rescue boats to save thousands of terrified people, who were trapped, some on their roofs. But the onslaught may not be over: state forecasters raised the rare possibility that the storm, the 11th and one of the deadliest to hit the Philippines this year, could make a U-turn next week as its pushed back by high-pressure winds in the South China Sea. The storm was last tracked at dawn blowing 125 kilometers (78 miles) west of the coastal town of Bacnotan in northern La Union province with sustained winds of up to 95 kilometers (59 miles) per hour and gusts of up to 115 kph (78 mph). It was moving northwest at 25 kph (15 mph) toward Vietnam, which was forecast to be lashed by Trami starting on Sunday if it stays on course. The Philippine weather agency, however, said it's possible that high-pressure winds and other weather factors in the South China Sea could force the storm to turn back toward the Philippines. President Ferdinand Marcos, sounding exasperated, inquired about that prospect in an emergency meeting with Cabinet members and disaster-response officials Friday about the response to the widespread devastation. 'What is the forecast for that? Is it possible it would return?' Marcos asked. A government forecaster told him Trami could turn toward the western Philippines early next week, but its more likely to blow away from the Philippines again without making landfall. 'It doesn’t have to make landfall for the damage to occur,' Marcos said, citing the continuing downpours set off by Trami in the Philippines. Marcos also cited another brewing storm in the Pacific Ocean that could again threaten the country. 'Oh God, it is what it is. We just have to deal with it,' Marcos said. State forecaster Jofren Habaluyas told The Associated Press that Trami's possible U-turn has drawn interest among government weather experts in Asia, including those from Japan, which has been providing information to the Philippines to help track the storm. The death toll from Trami rose to at least 46 after five more people were reported killed in floodwaters and landslides in hard-hit Bicol, an agricultural region and tourism destination southeast of Manila that is popular for Mayon, one of the country’s 24 most active volcanoes that has a near-perfect cone. Nine of the newly reported storm deaths were caused by flooding and landslides in Batangas, a coastal resort province south of Manila, which was drenched by torrential rains in the last two days, according to police, which said that they were still gathering details about the deaths. Although Trami did not strengthen into a typhoon, it dumped unusually heavy rains in some regions, including some that saw one to two months’ worth of rainfall in just 24 hours, that inundated communities with flash floods. Officials in Naga city, where 11 people died by drowning, and the outlying provinces of Camarines Sur and Albay pleaded for more rescue boats at the height of the onslaught to reach people trapped on the upper floors of their homes or on their roofs as floodwaters rose. In the foothills of Mayon volcano in Albay province, mud and other debris cascaded toward nearby towns as the storm hit, engulfing houses and cars in black-colored mudflows. More than 2.6 million people were affected by the deluge, with nearly 320,000 people fleeing into evacuation centers or relatives' homes, disaster-mitigation officials said. The government shut down schools and government offices on the main northern island of Luzon. Inter-island ferry services were also suspended, stranding thousands. In Vietnam, state forecasters warned of heavy rains in the central region. Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh ordered coastal provinces to stay vigilant, closely monitor Trami’s course and brace for contingencies. Last month, Typhoon Yagi battered Vietnam, killing 323 people and causing extensive damages valued at $3.3 billion, according to a Vietnamese government report. Each year, about 20 storms and typhoons batter the Philippines, a Southeast Asian archipelago which lies between the Pacific Ocean and the South China Sea. In 2013, Typhoon Haiyan, one of the strongest recorded tropical cyclones, left more than 7,300 people dead or missing and flattened entire villages. ___ Dinh reported from Hanoi, Vietnam.	https://apnews.com/article/storm-trami-philippines-vietnam-439d996e3409a15f0791c70c9a5a24f4	2024-10-24T20:43:15-07:00

Asian stocks are mostly higher, while Japan's Nikkei falls ahead of weekend election	HONG KONG (AP) — Asian stocks were mostly higher Friday aside from in Japan, where investors were awaiting the outcome of an election on Sunday. U.S. futures fell and oil prices rose. Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, who took office just weeks ago, called the snap general election to drum up support as the ruling Liberal Democrats grapple with a political funding scandal. Recent upheavals have added to uncertainty for markets, complicating the Bank of Japan's efforts to shift away from long-standing near-zero interest rates. Core inflation in Japan’s capital was 1.8% in October, lower than the central bank’s 2% target for the first time in five months, the government reported. That reinforced expectations that the central bank will keep its key interest rate unchanged at a policy meeting next week. Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 index lost 1% to 37,771.79, while the Japanese yen rose against the U.S. dollar. Early Friday, the dollar was trading at 151.64 yen, down from 151.89 yen. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng added 1.1% to 20,720.60, and the Shanghai Composite gained 0.8% to 3,307.14. China’s central bank kept its medium-term lending rate unchanged at 2%. It also issued 700 billion yuan ($98.3 billion) in one-year medium-term lending facility loans to financial institutions, according to the bank’s statement. Elsewhere, South Korea’s Kospi climbed 0.3% to 2,590.30 and Australia’s S&amp;P/ASX 200 climbed 0.1% to 8,216.50. Taiwan’s Taiex increased 0.3%. On Thursday, the S&amp;P 500 rose 0.2% to 5,809.86, breaking its first three-day losing streak since early September. It bounced between losses and gains through the day, and it was roughly evenly split between stocks rising and falling. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.3% to 42,374.36 and the Nasdaq composite rose 0.8% to 18,415.49. Tesla led the market with a jump of 21.9% after the electric-vehicle maker reported better profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. An optimistic CEO Elon Musk also predicted 20%-30% sales growth next year, though revenue for the latest quarter fell short of analysts’ forecasts. It was the best day for Tesla’s stock since 2013. Boeing sank 1.2% after its machinists voted to continue their strike, which has crippled aircraft production. More than 60% of union members who voted on the proposed contract rejected it, keeping them on the picket lines six weeks into their strike. Stocks have broadly retreated this week after the S&amp;P 500 and Dow both set records at the end of last week. They’ve been hurt by rising Treasury yields in the bond market, which can make investors less willing to pay high prices for stocks. Critics had already been saying beforehand that stocks looked too expensive given how much faster their prices have risen than corporate profits. A report on unemployment claims Thursday offered a mixed picture on the job market. It said fewer workers applied for unemployment benefits last week, which can be a signal of relatively low layoffs. But it also said the total number of those collecting benefits rose to its highest level in almost three years. Treasury yields, which had eased overnight, pared their losses after the release of the unemployment claims report before yo-yoing. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.20% from 4.25% late Wednesday. It’s still well above its 4.08% level from late last week. A separate preliminary report said growth in U.S. business activity may have accelerated slightly last month, as strength for companies in services industries continue to make up for weakness in manufacturing. The report from S&amp;P Global also showed a recovery in confidence as companies anticipate greater stability and certainty after the upcoming presidential election. A third report, meanwhile, said sales of new homes were stronger last month than economists expected. In other dealings early Friday, benchmark U.S. crude added 10 cents to $70.29 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude, the international standard, rose 13 cents to $74.16 a barrel. The euro fell to $1.0821 from $1.0828. ___ AP Business Writer Stan Choe contributed.	https://apnews.com/article/stocks-markets-rates-japan-a41eeb280a3fa7cc5aaa042023f560ef	2024-10-24T19:32:47-07:00	
An Israeli airstrike on a journalist compound kills 3 TV staffers, Lebanon's state news says	BEIRUT (AP) — An Israeli airstrike on a compound housing journalists in southeast Lebanon has killed three media staffers, Lebanon’s state-run National News Agency said Friday. Local news station Al Jadeed aired footage from the scene — a collection of chalets that had been rented by various media outlets — showing collapsed buildings and cars marked PRESS covered in dust and rubble. The Israeli army did not issue a warning prior to the strike. The Beirut-based pan-Arab Al-Mayadeen TV said two of its staffers — camera operator Ghassan Najar and broadcast technician Mohammed Rida — were among the journalists killed early Friday. Al-Manar TV of Lebanon’s Hezbollah group said its camera operator Wissam Qassim was also killed in the airstrike on the Hasbaya region. The Israeli military did not immediately comment on the strike. Ali Shoeib, Al-Manar’s well-known correspondent in south Lebanon, was seen in a video filming himself with a cellphone saying that the camera operator who had been working with him for months was killed. Shoeib said the Israeli military knew that the area that was struck housed journalists of different media organizations. 'We were reporting the news and showing the suffering of the victims and now we are the news and the victims of Israel’s crimes,' Shoeib added in the video aired on Al-Manar TV. The Hasbaya region has been spared much of the violence along the border and many of the journalists now staying there have moved from the nearby town of Marjayoun that has been subjected to sporadic strikes in recent weeks. Earlier in the week, a strike hit an office belonging to Al-Mayadeen on the outskirts of Beirut’s southern suburbs, according to Lebanon’s Health Ministry. Several journalists have been killed since exchange of fire began along the Lebanon-Israel border in early October last year. In November 2023, two journalists for Al-Mayadeen TV were killed in a drone strike. A month earlier, Israeli shelling in southern Lebanon killed Reuters videographer Issam Abdallah and wounded other journalists from France’s international news agency, Agence France-Presse, and Qatar’s Al-Jazeera TV. Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting another 250. Around 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, a third of whom are believed to be dead. Israel’s retaliatory offensive has killed over 42,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which does not say how many were combatants but says women and children make up more than half the fatalities. The Israeli military says it has killed over 17,000 fighters, without providing evidence. The Israeli campaign has since expanded to Lebanon, where Israel launched a ground invasion Oct. 1, after trading fire with the Hezbollah militant group for much of the past year. Lebanese health officials reported another day of intense airstrikes and shelling Thursday, which they said killed 19 people over 24 hours and raised the overall Lebanese death toll to 2,593 since October 2023.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-lebanon-hezbollah-iran-news-10-25-2024-0920f63542d158ad5999c481e421da00	2024-10-24T19:31:36-07:00	
AP Week in Pictures: Latin America and Caribbean	Oct. 18-24, 2024 Millions of Cubans were left without electricity for days after the nation’s energy grid went down when one of the island’s major power plants failed. The Amazon River naturally fluctuates during the dry and rainy seasons. But a dramatic drop has been evident since 2023. In Colombia, the river’s fall has isolated some Indigenous communities, prompting nonprofits and the government to deliver water and food to places that depend on rain and river water to survive. Hundreds of people turned out for the burial of Catholic priest Marcelo Pérez, an activist for Indigenous peoples and farm laborers who was killed in the southern Mexico State of Chiapas. The Rev. Pérez had worked to bring peace to the highlands and border regions of Chiapas, where two drug cartels are battling for control.

Georgia prepares for a divisive election which could determine its future in Europe	JAVAKHETI, Georgia (AP) — When Vahan Agayan goes to the polling station in Georgia’s parliamentary election Saturday, he says he and his wife will vote as directed to by officials of the ruling Georgian Dream party. Agayan has a sheep farm near the border with Armenia and Turkey, 135 kilometers (83 miles) west of — and a world away from — the Georgian capital, Tbilisi. There, tens of thousands of demonstrators marched in a pre-election demonstration in favor of joining the European Union. But in the mountainous Javakheti region, what Agayan wants most is stability. A few years ago, wolves got into his barn and killed half the sheep, almost destroying the livelihoods of dozens of families. For Agayan, the EU is far away; what matters are the local leaders who have the power to make or break small farmers like him. 'Most people' will vote for the regional lawmaker from Georgian Dream, he said. 'An old dog is always better than a new one,' he said, suggesting a change in power could be unpredictable. Many in this South Caucasus country of 3.7 million people believe the election will be the most important of their lives, a pivotal vote on the chance to join the European Union. It pits a coalition of opposition parties against Georgian Dream, which has governed in an increasingly authoritarian fashion since 2012. Polls indicate around 80% of Georgians favor joining the EU, and the constitution obliges leaders to pursue membership in both the bloc and NATO. In July, Brussels put Georgia’s bid for EU entry on hold indefinitely after Georgian Dream passed a 'foreign influence law,' modeled on similar legislation in Russia. It requires media, nongovernmental organizations and other nonprofit groups to register as 'pursuing the interests of a foreign power' if they receive more than 20% of their funding from abroad. Georgian Dream argues it is needed to curb harmful foreign actors trying to destabilize the country. Many journalists and activists say its true goal is to stigmatize them and restrict debate before the election. ------ This story, supported by the Pulitzer Center for Crisis Reporting, is part of an ongoing Associated Press series covering threats to democracy in Europe. ------ Georgia has long had an uneasy relationship with Russia. For most of the last century, it was ruled from Moscow until it gained independence in 1991, following the collapse of the Soviet Union. In 2008, Georgia fought and lost a brief war with Russia, which still occupies some of its territory. When Georgian Dream came to power in 2012, it vowed to restore civil rights and 'reset' relations with Moscow. The party — set up by Bidzina Ivanishvili, a shadowy billionaire who made his fortune in Russia — also promised to pursue EU membership. That reassured many Georgians who had seen 'with their own eyes,' the threat from Russia and looked to the West to protect them, said Natia Seskuria, executive director of the Regional Institute for Security Studies in Tbilisi. But then Georgian Dream started tracking toward Moscow: passing the foreign influence law despite mass protests, abstaining from international sanctions on Russia over its war in Ukraine, and severely curtailing LGBTQ+ rights. However, the party’s authoritarian swing cannot be explained by influence from Moscow alone, Seskuria said. Instead, she suggested, the purpose of the foreign influence law is also 'power preservation.' She indicated Georgian Dream’s leaders watched the Kremlin use new laws to successfully crack down on critics and decided to do the same. Some businesspeople who support Georgian Dream also have an interest in seeing the party reelected as they have profited from its tenure. At a pro-government rally in Tbilisi Wednesday, family members of people who were awarded plum jobs in railways and infrastructure were spotted in the crowd. Georgian Dream is conducting a 'hybrid war' against its citizens, said Zurab Chiaberashvili, foreign policy secretary from the United National Movement opposition party. Ahead of the election, campaign ads for the ruling party claimed a 'Global War Party' was seeking to influence the EU and the U.S., widen the conflict in Ukraine, and force Georgian Dream from power. Billboards also appeared, contrasting black-and-white images of destruction in Ukraine with colorful images of life in Georgia alongside the slogan, 'Say no to war — choose peace.' 'Everyone is afraid of war,' said Nairik Ukanyan, the owner of a village shop in the Javakheti region, which is populated by ethnic Armenians. Like Ukanyan, many people speak Armenian and Russian but limited Georgian. Ukanyan said he got his news about Georgia from Russian television, which says relations between the two countries are friendly. 'Why do we need a relationship with Europe?' he asked. Agayan, the sheep farmer, agreed: 'Even if I had 20 children, I would not send them to Europe.' The West, he said, is 'afraid of Russia and wants everyone to abandon it.' Georgian Dream appears to keeps a tight grip on power. Its officials paid several villagers about $110 each to persuade others to support the ruling party, Agayan said. But not every resident indicated they would back the party. 'I am a single mother and we are very poor,' said Gayane Batirova, 41. Her entire family previously voted for Georgian Dream, she explained. She had been told to vote for the party again but would not because it hadn’t improved her life. AP visited Georgian Dream’s local headquarters in Javakheti, but no one responded to requests for comment. In the town of Ninotsminda, office signs were displayed in Russian and an official said everyone was out 'on business' and unavailable for an interview. Back in Tbilisi, Georgian Dream lawmaker Maka Bochorishvili said the party's main goal is European integration based on 'peace and dignity,' alluding to the party’s conservative values. 'At stake is peace and stability in this country,' she said. But while Georgian Dream is telling voters it wants to join Europe, its shift toward adopting Russia-style laws has cost it support in the West. As well as the EU freezing membership talks, the U.K. suspended its security dialogue with Georgia and canceled other defense talks, concerned about threats to democracy. These moves are 'good news for Russia,' Seskuria said, because the Kremlin is 'inherently interested' in Georgia being cut off from the West, including the loss of financial support and through sanctions. Many Georgians fear if Georgian Dream is reelected, it could kill off aspirations to EU membership entirely. 'We are at a crossroads — either becoming a Russian puppet state or being independent and free,' said Tina Bezhanidze, 26. Wrapped in the Georgian flag, she was one of tens of thousands who joined a pro-EU demonstration in Tbilisi on Sunday. Bezhanidze, an economist, came to the demonstration with her parents and three younger sisters, in a show of cross-generational support for Georgia’s European ambitions. Even in remote Javakheti, not everyone thought aligning with Russia was a good idea. 'Of course we need the European Union,' said Eghsam Manasyan, who was collecting potatoes in her vegetable patch. She and her husband Artur told AP they wished there were more jobs in the region. 'All our lives we were with Russia and the Soviet Union,' Artur Manasyan said, adding that Georgia needs to 'look everywhere' for opportunities. 'We still don’t really know what Europe is,' he said. ------ Sophiko Megrelidze contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/georgia-russia-election-georgian-dream-opposition-7514f5b099c6442c72c43e550e851f10	2024-10-24T19:09:19-07:00	
Lithuania votes in the 2nd round of its parliamentary election, with change uncertain	VILNIUS, Lithuania (AP) — Lithuanians will vote Sunday in the second and final round of parliamentary elections, with the conservative governing party still in contention despite first-round gains for the left-leaning opposition. Strict COVID-19 measures during the pandemic, political scandals involving several key members of the Cabinet and an influx of migrants from neighboring Belarus have hurt the popularity of Prime Minister Ingrida Šimonytė’s government, which took office in 2020. The vote in Lithuania, which borders Russia’s Kaliningrad exclave to the west and Belarus to the east, comes at a time when Russia’s war in Ukraine is fueling greater fears about Moscow’s intentions, particularly in the strategically important Baltic region. It will set the political tone for the next four years, but despite a possible shift to the left analysts say there won't be significant change Lithuania's foreign policy. The European Union and NATO member is a staunch supporter of Ukraine. On Sunday, voters in dozens of electoral districts will choose between the two leading candidates from the first round and complete the new 141-seat parliament, known as the Seimas. The opposition Social Democrats, led by Vilija Blinkevičiūtė, came out of the first round with an edge two weeks ago, taking 20 of the first 70 seats to be decided. That put them two seats ahead of Šimonytė’s Homeland Union party. Blinkevičiūtė has said that she and the center-left Democratic Union, which took eight seats, would attempt to form a coalition together with a smaller third party. The three parties, which so far have 34 lawmakers in total, have said they would support each other’s candidates in the second round. But the center-left parties could lose their lead, and their ability to form a stable government could depend on a new party that many consider a pariah. The Nemuno Aušra party came in third in the first round, with 15 seats. Its leader Remigijus Žemaitaitis had to resign from parliament earlier this year for making antisemitic statements. A strong showing for Nemuno Aušra could open the way for the prime minister's party to form a minority government. 'Nobody can claim to have an obvious majority after the first round,' said Mažvydas Jastramskis, a political analyst at Vilnius University's institute of international relations and political science. Šimonytė’s Homeland Union won 18 seats in the first round and its coalition member, the Liberal Union, took eight. Both have several dozen candidates leading in run-offs, but they aren't in a position to win the 71 seats needed for a majority. Tensions in Lithuania's neighborhood are on voters' minds as well as domestic concerns. 'I voted for those who would never look east, I do not trust former communists and new populists,' Janina Kvietkauskiene, a retired librarian who cast her ballot in an early voting station in Vilnius, told The Associated Press. Most of the traditional parties said before the elections that they would not team up with Nemuno Aušra. The Social Democrats, for instance, have ruled out any alliance with Žemaitaitis’ party. Still, Nemuno Aušra announced this week that it would support the Social Democrats' Blinkevičiūtė in her bid to become prime minister. Jastramskis said it's unlikely that the three center-left parties will emerge with enough seats to form a stable new government alone. 'The one more likely option for the stable majority is if Nemuno Aušra joins the already announced three-party coalition,' Jastramskis said. 'But it may turn out as a major problem for the cabinet if the unacceptable rhetoric and actions continue'.	https://apnews.com/article/lithuania-parliamentary-election-new-government-95c7689b00bb041c895164ca3b470437	2024-10-24T19:07:37-07:00	
Tropical Storm Dana brings heavy rains and strong wind to India's eastern coast	NEW DELHI (AP) — Tropical Storm Dana brought strong winds and heavy rain to India's eastern coast Friday, uprooting trees and bringing a flood risk after nearly 600,000 people evacuated. The storm made landfall late Thursday night in Odisha state with maximum sustained winds of around 110 kph (68 mph) and gusts up to 120 kph (75 mph), according to the Indian Meteorological Department. Officials told the Press Trust of India news agency the storm would push further into northern Odisha and gradually weaken. The storm pounded some districts in Odisha and neighboring West Bengal state with heavy downpours as gusty winds brought down trees, local media reported. As of early Friday, there were no deaths nor any major damage reported. Nearly 600,000 people were evacuated from high-risk zones in Odisha earlier in the week, and teams of rescue and aid workers were deployed in preparation for the storm. Schools were closed, more than 200 trains were canceled and flights to and from the capital cities of Odisha and West Bengal were suspended. Authorities were on high alert for damage in three districts in Odisha, where the weather department forecast a sea surge of around 1 meter (yard), which could further flood low-lying areas. Climate scientists say severe storms are becoming more frequent in South Asia. Global warming driven by planet-heating gases has caused them to become more extreme and unpredictable. India’s eastern coasts have long been prone to cyclones, but the number of intense storms is increasing along the country’s coast. 2023 was India’s deadliest cyclone season in recent years, killing 523 people and costing an estimated $2.5 billion in damage.	https://apnews.com/article/tropical-storm-dana-cyclone-india-odisha-landfall-e5e35684a853b00df953798f715726ff	2024-10-24T18:45:25-07:00	
King Charles tells summit the past can't be changed as leaders ask Britain to reckon with slavery	WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — King Charles III told a summit of Commonwealth countries in Samoa on Friday that the past could not be changed as he indirectly acknowledged calls from some of Britain’s former colonies for a reckoning over its role in the trans-Atlantic slave trade. The British royal understood 'the most painful aspects of our past continue to resonate,' he told leaders in Apia. But Charles stopped short of mentioning financial reparations that some leaders at the event have urged and instead exhorted them to find the 'right language' and an understanding of history 'to guide us towards making the right choices in future where inequality exists.' 'None of us can change the past but we can commit with all our hearts to learning its lessons and to finding creative ways to right the inequalities that endure,' said Charles, who is attending his first Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting, or CHOGM, as Britain's head of state. His remarks at the summit's official opening ceremony echoed comments a day earlier by British Prime Minister Keir Starmer that the meeting should avoid becoming mired in the past and 'very, very long endless discussions about reparations.' The U.K. leader dismissed calls from Caribbean countries for leaders at the biennial event to explicitly discuss redress for Britain’s role in the slave trade and mention the matter in its final joint statement. But Britain's handling of its involvement in the trans-Atlantic slave trade is seen by many observers as a litmus test for the Commonwealth's adaptation to a modern-day world, as other European nations and some British institutions have started to own up to their role in the trade. 'I think the time has come for this to be taken seriously,' said Jacqueline McKenzie, a partner at London law firm Leigh Day. 'Nobody expects people to pay every single penny for what happened. But I think there needs to be negotiations.' Such a policy would be costly and divisive at home, McKenzie said. The U.K. has never formally apologized for its role in the trade, in which millions of African citizens were kidnapped and transported to plantations in the Caribbean and Americas over several centuries, enriching many individuals and companies. Studies estimate Britain would owe between hundreds of millions and trillions of dollars in compensation to descendants of slaves. The Bahamas Prime Minister Philip Davis on Thursday said he wanted a 'frank' discussion with Starmer about the matter and would seek mention of the reparations issue in the leaders' final statement at the event. All three candidates to be the next Commonwealth Secretary-General — from Gambia, Ghana and Lesotho — have endorsed policies of reparatory justice for slavery. Starmer said Thursday in remarks to reporters that the matter would not be on the summit’s agenda. But Commonwealth Secretary-General Patricia Scotland told The Associated Press in an interview that leaders 'will speak about absolutely anything they want to speak about' at an all-day private meeting scheduled for Saturday. King Charles said in Friday's speech that nothing would right inequality 'more decisively than to champion the principle that our Commonwealth is one of genuine opportunity for all.' The monarch urged leaders to 'choose within our Commonwealth family the language of community and respect, and reject the language of division.' He has expressed 'sorrow' over slavery at a CHOGM summit before, in 2022, and last year endorsed a probe into the monarchy’s ties to the industry. Charles — who is battling cancer — and his wife, Queen Camilla, will return to Britain tomorrow after visiting Samoa and Australia — where his presence prompted a lawmaker's protest over his country's colonial legacy. He acknowledged Friday that the Commonwealth had mattered 'a great deal' his late mother Queen Elizabeth II, who was seen as a unifying figure among the body's at times disparate and divergent states. The row over reparations threatened to overshadow a summit that Pacific leaders — and the Commonwealth secretariat — hoped would focus squarely on the ruinous effects of climate change. 'We are well past believing it is a problem for the future since it is already undermining the development we have long fought for,' the king said Friday. 'This year alone we have seen terrifying storms in the Caribbean, devastating flooding in East Africa and catastrophic wildfires in Canada. Lives, livelihood and human rights are at-risk across the Commonwealth.' Charles offered 'every encouragement for action with unequivocal determination to arrest rising temperatures' by cutting emissions, building resilience, and conserving and restoring nature on land and at sea, he said. Samoa is the first Pacific Island nation to host the event, and Prime Minister Fiamē Naomi Mata'afa said in a speech Friday that it was 'a great opportunity for all to experience our lived reality, especially with climate change,' which was 'the greatest threat to the survival and security of our Pacific people.'

‘US doesn’t see me as an American’: Thousands of adoptees live in limbo without citizenship	HENDERSON, Nev. (AP) — The 50-year-old newspaper was turning yellow and its edges fraying, so she had it laminated, not as a memento but as proof — America made a promise to her, and did not keep it. She pointed to the picture in the corner of her as a little girl in the rural Midwest, hugging the family Yorkshire terrier, with dark pigtails and brown eyes so round people called her Buttons. Next to her sit smiling, proud parents — her father an Air Force veteran who had survived a German prison camp in World War II and found her in an orphanage in Iran. She was a skinny, sickly 2-year-old; he and his wife decided in 1972 to take her home and make her their American daughter. They brought her to the United States on a tourist visa, which in the eyes of the government she soon overstayed as a toddler — and that is an offense that cannot be rectified. She is one of thousands of children adopted from abroad by American parents — many of them military service members — who were left without citizenship by loopholes in American law that Congress has been aware of for decades, yet remains unwilling to fix. She is technically living here illegally, and eligible for deportation. 'My dad died thinking, ‘I raised my daughter. I did my part,’ but not knowing it put me on a path of instability and fear,' she said. The Associated Press is using only her childhood nickname, Buttons, because of her legal status. 'Adoption tells you: You’re an American, this is your home. But the United States doesn’t see me as an American.' Every time she turns on the news, she hears former President Donald Trump, in his bid for reelection, promising to round up immigrants living illegally in the U.S. Now she lays awake at night, wondering what it would be like to be sent back to Iran. 'What is a detention camp even like?' she wondered. 'We have a plan, we won’t let that happen,' her friend Joy Alessi, a Korean adoptee, assured her. They have lawyers, media statemetns prepared, phone numbers of sympathetic congressmembers. But they slumped their shoulders — they know it could happen, because it already has. Out of the shadows These two women grew up in military families, and were taught to be grateful to the nation that celebrated saving them. Then one day, as adults, they walked into passport offices and learned the news that would unspool their lives. Their adoption paperwork, signed by judges and stamped by governments, declared they enjoyed all the privileges of being daughters of American families. But that was untrue in one critical respect: Adoption for decades did not automatically make children citizens. They both hid for years, thinking they were the only one who fell through the cracks. Then Trump stormed into politics in 2015 on a promise to rid America of undocumented immigrants. They weren’t citizens, so they couldn’t even vote to try to stop him. Each decided they had nothing left to lose, emerged and found each other. Other adoptees found them, too, and told stories of indignities endured by those not fully American — they can’t get jobs or driver’s licenses or passports, every interaction with the government is terrifying, some panic when there’s a knock on the door. No one knows how many of them there are — estimates range from 15,000 to 75,000. Many were adopted from South Korea, home to the world’s longest and largest adoption program, but they’d also been brought from Ethiopia, Romania, Belize, more than two dozen countries. They started the Adoptee Rights Campaign, and were joined by an unexpected coalition, from the Southern Baptist Convention to liberal immigration advocates, all baffled that the government let this linger. The Adoptee Rights Campaign has heard from people who’d been deported, some still living in hiding, others freshly discovering they’d never been made citizens. There is no government mechanism for alerting them. They find out by accident, when applying for passports or government benefits. One woman learned as a senior citizen, when she was denied the Social Security she’d paid into all her life. Buttons calls herself the group’s 'adoptee wrangler;' she was visiting Alessi in Nevada, sitting at her kitchen table, fielding inquiries and checking in on people. She’s 54 and has never been in trouble; she has a corporate job in health care, owns her own home in California. She was raised a Christian, so fears that deportation to Iran would be 'a death sentence.' Still legislators won’t help. She had hope. She’s lost that now. For a decade, legislation has been introduced over and over, it dies, and nothing happens. So she lugs around the laminated newspaper clipping, stacks of adoption files and court records as proof she’s supposed to be here. 'It’s hard to give hope,' she said, 'when I don’t feel like I have any left.' ‘One piece of paper can ruin your life’ Alessi anointed her friend Buttons 'an honorary Korean.' This problem they have both endured was born there, in Alessi’s motherland, and to her it represents the most glaring example of the neglectful system that brought them here. The international adoption industry grew out of the wreckage of the Korean War in the 1950s. Americans were desperate for babies — the domestic supply of adoptable children had plummeted — and South Korea wanted to rid itself of mouths of feed. Alessi was among this early wave of adoptees, taken from South Korea at 7 months old in 1967. The system focused on shipping children abroad as quickly as possible. Korea’s government, eager to curry favor with the U.S., did everything it could to speed up the process, including relaxing the obligation of agencies to ensure citizenship for adoptees. The adoption industry took the model created in South Korea into poor countries around the world, shipping babies in bulk to American families. South Korea has struggled to track the citizenship of children placed in U.S. homes, and the status of more than 17,550 remains unconfirmed, according to government data AP obtained. The Adoptee Rights Campaign used Korean figures to estimate up to 75,000 adoptees from all over the world could lack citizenship. But groups like the National Council for Adoption put the number somewhere between 15,000 and 18,000. The Korean adoption diaspora has been hit particularly hard — there are simply more of them. At least 11 adoptees have been deported to South Korea since 2002, where they don’t know the language or the culture. An adoptee named Phillip Clay, sent to the U.S. at 8 years old in 1983, was deported. He killed himself by jumping from an apartment building in Seoul in 2017 at 42 years old. Adam Crapser, adopted at 3 years old in 1979, was also deported to South Korea. The married father of two says he was abused and abandoned by two different adoptive families who never filed his citizenship papers. He got into trouble with the law — once for breaking into his adoptive parents’ home to retrieve the Bible that came with him from the orphanage. He sued his Korean adoption agency, Holt Children’s Services, and a court last year ordered the agency to pay him damages for failing to inform his adopters that they should take steps to secure his citizenship. For some adoptees, their status is fixable through the arduous naturalization process — they have to join the line as though they’d just arrived. It takes years, thousands of dollars, wasted days, routine rejections from immigration offices on technicalities, the wrong form, an errant typo. Alessi looked at a picture of herself standing in a high school gymnasium, finally being made an American citizen at 52. 'We welcome you!' she remembers the announcer saying, and the crowd cheered. But her body looks stiff, her mouth pursed. 'You don’t welcome us,' she thought that day in 2019. Her friend, the adoptee called Buttons, was at the ceremony crying, genuinely happy for her friend, but also devastated for herself. Alessi felt a sort of survivor’s guilt. 'You were sitting right there, and I felt so conflicted, so shameful,' Alessi told her. Because for some adoptees, there is no clear solution. The difference between them is what visa their adoptive parents brought them in on, and many chose the fastest route — like a tourist or medical visa — not imagining complications down the road. 'One piece of paper,' Buttons said, 'can ruin your life.' ‘A collective failure’ A quarter-century ago, the U.S. Congress recognized it had left adoptees in this legal limbo. By 2000, nearly 20,000 children were coming to America each year. But the U.S. had wedged foreign adoptions into a system created for domestic ones. State courts give adopted children new birth certificates that list their adoptive parents’ names, purporting to give them all the privileges of biological children. But state courts have no control over immigration. After the expensive, long process of adoption, parents were supposed to naturalize their adopted children, but some never did. Those early decades of adoption were a 'wild west,' said Greg Luce, a lawyer who has represented many non-citizen adoptees; there was no standardized procedure to help adoptive families. 'It’s a combination of adoption agencies that were neglectful, adoptive parents who should have known better, and the U.S. government that had lax oversight and a visa system that could allow this to happen,' Luce said. 'It’s a collective failure on the part of everyone who was involved except the adoptee. They were a child, and they’re the ones left holding the bag.' The U.S. is unique in this: No other nation that has taken in adopted children deprives them of citizenship. In 2000, Congress acknowledged that injustice and passed the Child Citizenship Act, conferring automatic citizenship to adopted children. But it was designed to streamline the process for adoptive parents, not to help adoptees, and so applied only to those younger than 18 when it took effect. Everyone born before the arbitrary date of Feb. 27, 1983, was not included. Hannah Daniel, director of public policy for the Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission, the lobbying arm of the Southern Baptist Convention, said lawmakers often find this situation hard to believe. 'I agree that it feels unbelievable,' she said. 'It’s the most classic example of wanting to bang your head against the wall, because how in the world have we not fixed this?' Adoption has been a rare issue championed by lawmakers on both sides of the aisle, a way of saving children by making them American. Many churches preach intercountry adoption as a Biblical calling. Daniel is part of a bipartisan coalition lobbying for a decade for a bill that extends citizenship to everyone legally adopted by American parents. The groups insist that families formed by adoption are due the same respect, the same rights, as biological ones, including equal treatment under the criminal justice system. But that argument has been consumed by the country’s hyper-partisan frenzy over immigration. Any bills offering paths to citizenship have stalled out. Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley, among those skeptical of the legislation, declined an interview. A spokesperson wrote in a statement that he is 'a longtime adoption advocate' but 'believes that any adult seeking U.S. citizenship should have their criminal records taken into consideration.' That is a sentiment that advocates of the bill say undermines the very meaning of adoption. If a foreign adopted sibling and a biological sibling commit a crime together, the biological child would pay their debt to society and move on. The adopted child might face a second, severe punishment: getting sent back to where the U.S. professed to have rescued them from. A bill is before Congress again now. But Daniel isn’t hopeful. 'In this day and age in Congress, if not doing anything is an option,' she said, 'that is the bet I’m going to take.' ‘The American dream’ Laura Lynn Davis called her representatives, her senators. She’s written to celebrities and talk show hosts, thinking surely someone would help. Mike Davis, her husband of 27 years, was adopted by a soldier, a Vietnam veteran stationed in Ethiopia, who met him there as a boy and brought him to the U.S. He was deported to Ethiopia two decades ago, and now lives in a room with a mud floor and running water only once a month and even when the tap works, it isn’t safe to drink. Davis, now 61, remembers his father telling him that everything would be OK because he was an American now. He pledged allegiance to the flag every morning and considered himself a happy military brat, moving around Army bases. 'I was living the American dream,' Davis said. He worked at a pizza shop through high school and when he graduated, he opened his own. In the 1990s, he was charged with possession of a firearm, marijuana and cocaine. He didn’t go to prison; he was sentenced to 120 days in a boot camp program. He found out he’d never been naturalized when he reported to his probation officer. Nothing happened for years. He married Laura Lynn, they had children to raise, and he pushed it to the back of his mind. Then one day in 2003, he closed his pizza shop and went to bed, someone banged on their door at 5 a.m. 'My kids were sleeping,' he said, 'When they woke up, their dad was gone.' He languished in a detention center for over a year, terrified, because he had the same perception of Ethiopia as every American: The State Department advises its citizens to not go there because of unpredictable violence, kidnappings, terrorism. Then officers took him to the airport and put him on a plane, he said. One officer felt sorry for him and gave him $20; Davis promised to pay him back when he returned to the U.S. He sold his wedding ring to pay rent, and that was the darkest moment. His adoptive father grew sicker, and Davis anguished over not being with him in the end. His wife sold their house and moved their family to be with him. But life was hard in Ethiopia: There were people with M16s on the street, they couldn’t work or speak the language. Laura Lynn lost 30 pounds. She and their children went home to Georgia. Mike was their breadwinner, and they struggled without him. They lived in cars and motels, but never blamed him. Laura Lynn kept all his things neatly packed and awaiting his return: clothes, sports memorabilia, his favorite music — on cassette tapes, a reminder of how the world changed since he left. He gets sick a lot as he’s getting older, she said, and can’t access medications in Ethiopia. He has five grandchildren he’s never met. His youngest son, Adam, 26 now, recently moved into his first apartment, and thought how nice it would be to have his father there to see it. Laura Lynn has more hope than she has in a long time, she said, because a group she never expected came to their aid: Koreans. They’ve offered advocacy and legal help. He’s being represented by groups like Asian Americans Advancing Justice and Adoptees for Justice. 'I pray we can make them see that he didn’t ask to come here, he was adopted and brought here. He became a really good man,' she said. 'He has a family who loves him and we’re ready for him to come back home to us.' ‘A spin of the roulette wheel’ Emily Howe, a lawyer in California, carries around a 5-inch binder, which she calls 'the simplified version' of the labyrinthine set of laws that dictate which adoptees have been able to become citizens and which have not. Howe was adopted from South Korea in 1984, barely young enough to be granted citizenship by the 2000 law. By a twist of luck and timing, this could have been her, she said. So she represents many adoptive families for free. 'It shouldn’t be a spin of the roulette wheel,' she said. She now asks every adoptee if they know their citizenship status. It gets complicated quickly; if they ask the government and find out they aren’t citizens, they tip off authorities to them living here illegally. Her clients are panicking about what will happen if Trump wins reelection. 'I’m terrified,' a mother named Debbie cried in Howe’s San Diego office. 'What if he gets back in? I’m hearing him talk about mass deportations.' Debbie and her husband, Paul, adopted two special-needs children from a Romanian orphanage in the 1990s, and they’ve been trying to make them citizens almost ever since. The Associated Press is using only the first names of the parents because they fear endangering their adopted children. The California couple watched a '20/20' television special about the plight of children there — they called them 'unsalvagables,' they didn’t learn to read, there wasn’t enough food. The couple was middle-class, with three biological children. But Debbie couldn’t sleep thinking about those kids, cold and hungry. So they refinanced their house to bring home two, a boy and a girl. 'We thought we had to get these children out of there. Then we’ll deal with what we need to deal with,' Debbie said. The boy was 10, and so small, just 40 pounds, that the school allowed him in kindergarten. The girl was 14 and legally blind, with limited vision in just one eye. They both had physical and cognitive impairments; the doctors believed the boy suffered fetal alcohol poisoning. The family was overwhelmed by their needs. Their new son was curious — in another life, he might have been an engineer, Debbie thinks. But in this one, they had to nail the front door shut because he’d wander out at night. He was fascinated by electricity, and couldn’t be left alone without fear he’d start a fire. Howe assures them they did everything they could. 'We thought we did it the right way, we tried to, I hope we did,' Debbie said. 'Maybe we were naive. Maybe there was something we missed.' They consulted with dozens of lawyers, who all said it couldn’t be fixed — it was a convoluted calculation of the children’s ages, how their birth certificates were written, their visas. They can’t tally how many thousands of dollars they’ve spent. 'It’s dumb, it’s outrageously dumb, it should not be this monstrous task,' Howe said. 'This could be fixed in a month if anyone had the political will to do it.' Their son, 43, doesn’t understand the situation he’s in. But their daughter understands. She’s a Special Olympian, now 46, with a stack of gold medals. She can’t compete in international competitions because she can’t get a passport. 'I want to be a citizen really bad,' their daughter said. 'I want to be here for a long, long time.' They've called their legislators. Debbie wept again and again: 'My adopted children deserve all the privileges of my birth children. They are no different in our eyes. Why are you looking at them differently?' Everyone told them not to worry because they aren’t the type of people on immigration’s radar. Then Trump’s administration terrified them. Debbie lay in bed, thinking her children couldn’t survive a detention camp. She imagined someone barging into their home and snatching them. It made her physically sick. Debbie and Paul are in their late 60s, and feel an urgent need to fix this. 'The clock is ticking,' Debbie said. 'I have zero regrets about adding these two to my family. But this country let them down, absolutely, without a doubt.' ‘It’s time for my country to fight for me' For most of her life, Joy Alessi was a proud patriot, who got teary-eyed when Garth Brooks sang about America. But patriotism is confusing for her now — as it is for many of the adoptees who’ve found themselves in this predicament. Alessi and Buttons hadn’t seen their friend and fellow adoptee, Leah Elmquist, since she became naturalized. 'Do you feel different? Do you feel like a citizen?' Alessi asked her, when they met for dinner at a Korean barbeque. Elmquist had always considered herself 'super-duper American.' She served in the Navy for 10 years; she was in a USAA commercial. That was all before she was actually made an American. She told Alessi she doesn’t feel any differently now. 'I felt like a citizen for the decade I was in the Navy. And I wasn’t one,' she said. Elmquist was adopted from South Korea as an infant in 1983, just six months too old to get citizenship by the 2000 legislation. She grew up in a white family in a Nebraska town with two stop lights. She can cite what her adoption decree declared her parents had done: they 'do hereby bestow upon said minor child equal rights, privileges and immunities with children born in lawful wedlock.' That was not true, but she only learned that later. 'That’s why I joined the military. I felt so lucky to be an American, ironically. I wanted to thank this country for raising me,' she said. 'I didn’t think about citizenship because I felt I was being more American than most Americans.' She excelled in the military, but wasn’t eligible for certain security clearances. She's wanted to serve as a linguist, but couldn't. After leaving, she laid low, terrified of deportation. When Trump won election in 2016, she felt a fear more intense than the night before she deployed to Iraq. Alessi pulled up a photo of Elmquist in 2019, standing behind a podium marked with the seal of the U.S. House of Representatives. Elmquist was wearing her military uniform, and Alessi recalled that the room went quiet, all you could hear was the 'click click click' of cameras. Elmquist remembered what she’d said: 'I fought for my country, now it’s time for my country to fight for me.' It didn’t. That session, the bill didn’t pass. Elmquist was rejected multiple times by immigration. Finally, she made it to an interview, and had to prove she could read and write English. Her interviewer was a veteran, like her, and said it seemed weird she was there. 'Tell me about it,' she remembers responding. She was naturalized in 2022, the day before her 40th birthday. She likes to look back at her picture on the front page of the local newspaper. 'I can see how happy I was,' she says. 'I almost cried.' 'I can imagine,' Buttons responded. She smiled, and wiped away a tear, imagining that one day maybe she’d feel that too. ___ AP researcher Rhonda Shafner contributed to this report. ___ This story is part of an ongoing investigation led by The Associated Press in collaboration with FRONTLINE (PBS).

Japan's ruling party may struggle in Sunday's vote, but its decades of dominance won't end	TOKYO (AP) — Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba ’s ruling party, dogged by corruption scandals and plunging support, faces its toughest challenge in more than a decade in Sunday’s parliamentary election. This could set up a very short-lived time in office for Ishiba, who only took power earlier this month. But even if he may have to take responsibility and step down as head of the party and prime minister, it won't cause his Liberal Democratic Party to fall from power. That's because the party, which has had a stranglehold on power since 1955, easily dominates a fractured, weak opposition, which has only ruled twice, and briefly, during that time. Analysts expect the opposition Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan to significantly gain ground, but not enough to change the government. 'I plan to vote, but the opposition won’t be my choice,' said Kanako Ojima, 48. 'I don’t think I want to let the opposition take the helm again. ... I think after all it is the LDP that has a long-term vision.' The LDP has built its juggernaut of support through a network of bureaucrats, businesses and regional leaders. While opposition parties have made inroads in cities, the LDP controls the countryside, funneling huge government subsidies to rural areas. Ishiba ordered Sunday's election on the day he took office, on Oct. 1, aiming to use his image as a reformer to shake off voter anger and shore up power. Analysts say the LDP is likely to lose a few dozen seats and may fail to reach the target Ishiba set for his ruling coalition. Even in a worst-case scenario, however, the LDP will still be the No. 1 party in the ruling bloc. Here's a look at how the LDP has dominated postwar Japanese politics and what virtual single-party rule means for Japan. The 1955 system The LDP was formed in 1955 by the merger of two major conservative parties: the Liberal Party and the Japan Democratic Party, just as leftwing groups formed the Socialist Party. They led Japan after the war, when conservatives in the U.S.-occupied country were looking to deter the spread of communism. The party's rule was only interrupted twice, from 1993-1994 and 2009-2012, both times following bribery scandals. Many credit the LDP with leading Japan's astonishing recovery after the war, when the nation became one of the world’s biggest economies through the 1980s. People became used to the LDP dominating the smaller and the main opposition Socialist Party, whose initial ambition to take power faded and was known as the perennial opposition. The LDP and the Socialists were part of a 1994-1998 trilateral ruling coalition until the LDP returned to a one-party reign. The Socialist Party has since renamed itself as the Social Democratic Party. Electoral reform The LDP’s loss to the short-lived eight-party coalition led by the Japan New Party after two high-profile bribery scandals led to political changes that set up a new electoral system that was supposed to promote two-party competition and eliminate pork barreling. The current electoral system combines single-seat districts with proportional representation. That means Liberal Democratic candidates only face opposition rivals, rather than competing against fellow party candidates. It has allowed the LDP to concentrate its political resources on one candidate per district. In traditional LDP strongholds, it has also helped powerful families to take control of electoral districts, funding and connections, with power usually passing to men. Women make up only 10% of the lower house. The LDP has set a goal to increase female candidates to 30% over the next decade. Factions LDP lawmakers are loosely connected by their support of conservative social values, strong defense policies and a desire to revise the U.S.-drafted war-renouncing constitution. Rather than ideological differences, LDP lawmakers until recently were divided among in-party factions competing for funding and connections that they need to keep winning elections and get favorable party and government posts. Factional power struggles have led to frequent changes of party leadership and a succession of short-lived prime ministers. Those government changes are meant to regenerate the party, according to Tomoaki Iwai, a Nihon University politics professor. This is what happened when Ishiba replaced his unpopular predecessor, Fumio Kishida, who resigned in the face of voter anger over a slush fund scandal. Kishida took leadership in the dissolution of most of the LDP factions and revised a political funding law, but voters and critics called the measures too lax. All but one of six factions no longer have formal structures, but party heavyweights like Kishida and their former faction members were part of a collective effort in backing Ishiba in the party leadership vote. Allies and opposition Support for the LDP is strong among older conservatives, especially in rural areas, but it is weaker in urban areas. That means the LDP relies on an alliance with the Komeito party, which is backed by a Buddhist group called Soka Gakkai that has several million members nationwide. The parties' partnership began in 1999 during a period of LDP struggles. The LDP also receives support from industry organizations, fisheries, agricultural cooperatives and religious groups. The main opposition is the liberal-leaning Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan, but the party has struggled to build momentum despite the LDP scandals. Its newly elected leader, centrist former Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda, is pushing a conservative shift for the party to attract swing voters, saying that 'a change of government is the most effective political reform.' Media analysts expect his CDPJ to significantly gain ground in Sunday's elections, but not enough to change the government. That's because the opposition groups are too fractured. The defunct Democratic Party of Japan, which Noda once led, toppled the LDP in 2009, but lasted only three years, struggling through the 2011 triple disaster of a massive earthquake, tsunami and nuclear meltdown in Fukushima. The DPJ’s inexperience and shaky handling of the crises disappointed the public and paved the way for the LDP’s big comeback in 2012. Since then the LDP has not faced serious challenges. LDP dominance is expected to last Unlike 2009, there is little voter interest in getting rid of the LDP. Taizo Yoshida, a 45-year-old office worker, said he doesn't want a change of government and hopes to see Ishiba push through reform. 'I don’t think the opposition has the ability to run the government,' he said, though he'd like to see a viable opposition in Japan. 'This party has more of a track record of getting things done,' Rintaro Nishimura, a political analyst at the Asia Group, a strategy and business advisory organization, said of the LDP. With younger people increasingly unhappy about the lack of LDP policies addressing their worries, there may be future changes, but not any time soon. 'There is still too much of uncertainty over what the opposition can do.'	https://apnews.com/article/japan-politics-ldp-election-ishiba-6698ca8ca03a4586929554c22427bfc6	2024-10-24T16:12:32-07:00	
Ship owner in Baltimore bridge collapse agrees to pay $102 million for cleanup	WASHINGTON (AP) — The owner and manager of the cargo ship that caused the deadly Baltimore bridge collapse have agreed to pay more than $102 million in cleanup costs to settle a lawsuit brought by the Justice Department, officials said Thursday. The settlement does not cover any damages for rebuilding the bridge, officials said in a news release announcing the agreement. That construction project could cost close to $2 billion. The state of Maryland has filed its own claim seeking those damages, among others. The settlement comes a month after the Justice Department sued the ship’s owner Grace Ocean Private Ltd. and manager Synergy Marine Group, both based in Singapore, seeking to recover funds from the cleanup. The Justice Department alleged that the electrical and mechanical systems on the ship, the Dali, were improperly maintained, causing it to lose power and veer off course before striking a support column on the Francis Scott Key Bridge in March. The ship was leaving Baltimore for Sri Lanka when its steering failed because of the power loss. Six men on a road crew, who were filling potholes during an overnight shift, fell to their deaths. Cleanup crews worked around the clock searching for bodies and removing thousands of tons of mangled steel and smashed concrete from the bottom of the Patapsco River. The Dali remained stuck amid the wreckage for almost two months, with collapsed steel trusses draped across the ship’s damaged bow. 'This resolution ensures that the costs of the federal government’s cleanup efforts in the Fort McHenry Channel are borne by Grace Ocean and Synergy and not the American taxpayer,' Principal Deputy Associate Attorney General Benjamin Mizer said in a statement. The collapse snarled commercial shipping traffic through the Port of Baltimore and put many local longshoremen out of work before the channel was fully opened in June. It interrupted East Coast shipping routes as the port is one of the busiest in the country, especially for cars and farm equipment. Grace Ocean and Synergy filed a court petition just days after the collapse seeking to limit their legal liability in what could become the most expensive marine casualty case in history. Court records show attorneys for both parties said in a joint filing Thursday that they had reached a settlement agreement and requested dismissal of the Justice Department’s claim, which sought $103 million in cleanup costs. The claim is one of many filed in an expansive liability case that will ultimately determine how much the ship’s owner and manager will owe for their role in causing the disaster. The other claims are still unresolved. They’ve been filed on behalf of the victims’ families, companies whose business has suffered as a result of the collapse, municipal entities and more. FBI agents boarded the ship in April amid a criminal investigation into the circumstances leading up to the collapse. When it was filed last month, the Justice Department civil claim provided the most detailed account yet of the cascading series of failures that left the Dali’s pilots and crew helpless in the face of looming disaster. The complaint pointed to 'excessive vibrations' on the ship that attorneys called a 'well-known cause of transformer and electrical failure.' Instead of dealing with the source of the excessive vibrations, crew members 'jury-rigged' the ship, the complaint alleged. It also noted cracked equipment in the engine room and pieces of cargo shaken loose. The ship’s electrical equipment was in such bad condition that an independent agency stopped further electrical testing because of safety concerns, according to the lawsuit.	https://apnews.com/article/baltimore-bridge-collapse-justice-department-4a3f064e4cfb433d4d142881decaaae0	2024-10-24T12:23:00-07:00	
Nevada lithium mine wins final approval despite potential harm to endangered wildflower	RENO, Nev. (AP) — For the first time under President Joe Biden, a federal permit for a new lithium-boron mine has been approved for a Nevada project essential to his clean energy agenda, despite conservationists' vows to sue over the plan they insist will drive an endangered wildflower to extinction. Ioneer Ltd.'s mine will help expedite production of a key mineral in the manufacture of batteries for electric vehicles at the center of Biden's push to cut greenhouse gas emissions, administration officials said Thursday in Reno. Acting Deputy Interior Secretary Laura Daniel-Davis said bolstering domestic lithium supplies is 'essential to advancing the clean energy transition and powering the economy of the future.' 'This project demonstrates how partnership and collaboration can effectively balance mineral production with the protection of vulnerable species and irreplaceable natural resources,' added Steve Feldgus, principal deputy assistant U.S. interior secretary for land and minerals management. In the works for nearly eight years, construction of the Rhyolite Ridge mine should start next year in the high desert halfway between Reno and Las Vegas, the Australia-based Ioneer said. Production is scheduled to begin in 2028 at the mine, which should produce enough lithium for 370,000 vehicles annually for more than two decades, officials said. It’s unique because it includes a chemical processing facility that will process the lithium on-site instead of having to ship it to China, then back to the U.S. Worldwide demand for lithium is projected to have grown six times by 2030 compared to 2020. The biggest producer of lithium in the world is China, which processes most lithium currently. 'I can say with absolute confidence there are few deposits in the world as impactful as Rhyolite Ridge,' Ioneer Executive Chairman James Calaway said. The Interior Department's Bureau of Land Management issued the permit after the Fish and Wildlife Service concluded — in consultation with the bureau required under the Endangered Species Act — that the mine would not jeopardize the survival of Tiehm's buckwheat. The service added the 6-inch-tall (15-centimeter-tall) wildflower with yellow and cream-colored blooms to the list of U.S. endangered species on Dec. 14, 2022, citing mining as the biggest threat to its survival. The bureau initiated the mine's permitting process five days later. The agencies say Ioneer's subsequent changes to the mine's footprint alleviated concerns about potential harm to the flower. Environmentalists said the mine's final approval was a politically motivated violation of multiple U.S. laws. An hour after the bureau posted its formal record of decision approving the permit, the Center for Biological Diversity sent Interior Secretary Deb Haaland a 60-day notice of the group's intent to sue under the Endangered Species Act. 'We need lithium for the energy transition, but it can’t come with a price tag of extinction,' said Patrick Donnelly, the center's Great Basin director. He said Biden's administration ' is abandoning its duty to protect endangered species like Tiehm’s buckwheat and it’s making a mockery of the Endangered Species Act.' Fewer than 30,000 of the plants remain in Nevada at the only place they're known to exist in the world across eight sub-populations that combined cover 10 acres (4 hectares) — an area equal to the size of about eight football fields. USFWS said the project — including the infrastructure and waste rock dump — will come within 15 feet (5 meters) of the buckwheat and result in the loss of some of its designated critical habitat that is home to neighboring bees and other pollinators integral to its reproduction. But the service said the operation will cause no direct disturbance to individual plants and that reclamation, mitigation and monitoring promised in the blueprint should provide necessary protections for it to coexist with the open pit mine deeper than the length of a football field. 'I don’t think the mine at all will lead to the extinction of Tiehm’s buckwheat,' Ioneer CEO Bernard Rowe said Thursday. 'If anything, I think we now are going to be part of the solution because we are going to continue providing significant resources ... to ensure it doesn’t become extinct.' Construction of the mine is expected to employ about 500 workers, with about 350 full-time employees when the mine is fully operational — a boon for tiny Esmeralda County with a population of about 1,000. Esmeralda County Commissioner Ralph Keys said the rural county that's now the least populous in Nevada was its most populated during the gold and silver boom in the late 1800s. 'This is going to put us back on the map,' he said Thursday. Opponents of the project say it’s the latest example of Biden’s administration running roughshod over U.S. protections for native wildlife, rare species and sacred tribal lands in the name of slowing climate change by reducing reliance on fossil fuels and bolstering national security by easing reliance on foreign sources of critical minerals. Daniel-Davis denied environmentalists’ claims that the administration is rushing to develop so-called 'green energy' projects at the expense of increased risk to troubled species. 'The urgency of climate change and the need to move to a clean energy economy has been critical to everything we have worked on since day one in the Biden-Harris administration,' she said. 'Does that make us look at projects like this or others that would support transition to a clean energy economy differently? I have to say categorically, no.' Nevada is home to the only existing lithium mine in the U.S. Another is currently under construction near the Oregon line 220 miles (354 kilometers) north of Reno — Lithium Americas' Thacker Pass mine.	https://apnews.com/article/lithium-mine-endangered-flower-nevada-biden-ioneer-a943364661c24a928d590eb17b00a92b	2024-10-24T08:46:17-07:00	
A car bomb explodes outside a police station in western Mexico, wounding 3 officers	ACAMBARO, Mexico (AP) — A car bomb left outside a police station in the town of Acambaro in western Mexico wounded three people, prosecutors in the violence-wracked state of Guanajuato said Thursday. They said another explosion, apparently a second car bomb, occurred in the nearby town of Jerecuaro. Although nobody was wounded, the force of that second blast was enough to blow the tile roof off a building, blacken the facades of surrounding stores and set alight a police patrol pickup truck. The near-simultaneous attacks in two different towns located about a half-hour away from each other suggested the involvement of drug cartels that have been fighting bloody turf battles for years in Guanajuato. Despite the violence, newly inaugurated President Claudia Sheinbaum pledged to continue the 'hugs, not bullets' approach of her predecessor. Sheinbaum said Thursday she has ordered the army 'not to have confrontations' with the cartels. 'We are not going to return to a war against the narcos,' Sheinbaum said. But it takes two to tango, and her administration already appears to be locked in a war-like situation with the cartels in several states, whether she likes it or not, just three weeks after she took office. The car bomb in Acambaro was sizable enough to toss parts of the burnt-out car across a tree-lined median strip in the street outside the police station, according to photos distributed by the municipal police. The powerful blast apparently blew out the windows and doors of nearby homes. It was the most serious car-bomb attack against authorities in Mexico since June 2023, when a cartel used a car bomb to kill a National Guard officer in the nearby city of Celaya. In July 2023, a drug cartel in the neighboring state of Jalisco set off a coordinated series of seven roadway bombs that killed four police officers and two civilians. The improvised explosive devices, or IEDs, had apparently been planted in holes dug in the roadway. The use of car bombs, improvised explosive devices and bomb-dropping drones illustrate the increasingly open, military-style challenge posed by the country’s drug cartels. Sheinbaum has pledged to continue the policy of her predecessor and mentor, former president Andrés Manuel López Obrador, of avoiding confrontations with drug cartels. Before he left office on Sept. 30, López Obrador publicly appealed to the gangs to keep violence down, and offered training programs aimed at reducing the number of young recruits for the cartels. The policy did not result in any significant reduction in Mexico’s historically high levels of homicides. Sheinbaum faces a big surge in violence simultaneously in the northern state of Sinaloa, the southern state of Chiapas, and in Guanajuato, the state that has had the highest number of homicides in Mexico. Sheinbaum, who took office Oct. 1, has said she will make reducing violence in Guanajuato a priority, and said the attacks Thursday were being investigated. But David Saucedo, a security analyst based in Guanajuato, said the government has failed to recognize the scope of the problem. Sheinbaum and other officials almost always respond to the violence with stock phrases like 'investigations are being carried out' or 'the problem is being addressed.' 'In the federal and state governments, there is a resistance to talking about narco terrorism, because they think it will create a bad image for the country,' Saucedo said. 'The truth is that Mexico already has a bad image regarding crime and violence.' The problem is becoming more acute for the Mexican government, as drug cartels and violence in Mexico have become an issue in the upcoming U.S. presidential election. 'There are voices within the government who think that talking about narco terrorism would add fuel to conservative sectors in the United States who want to send the U.S. army to fight the cartels,' he said. Saucedo said the Santa Rosa de Lima cartel — which has spent years fighting the Jalisco cartel for control of the state — is probably behind Thursday’s blasts. 'Although these attacks in Acambaro and Jerecuaro are part of a local (cartel) strategy, they are also intended as a message from the criminal gangs to the president and the governor, that they will continue in the battle and will continue fighting for Guanajuato,' he noted. The attacks appeared to specifically target police offices or vehicles. Officials are loath to acknowledge the war-like situation in some Mexican cities, because they can offer few solutions: their own policies have weakened local police forces and the government now relies almost exclusively on the military. That has brought predictable accusations of human rights abuses by soldiers. Mexican army troops shot to death six migrants from at least four countries in the southern state of Chiapas on Oct. 1, the same day Sheinbaum took office. Guanajuato state Gov. Libia Garcia said Thursday on social media that she had ordered a land and air search for the suspects, and wrote 'our municipal governments are not alone, the entire force of the government is involved in the work to restore peace to Guanajuato.' But only days before, officials fired the entire municipal force in the nearby city of Celaya, the city where more police have died fighting organized crime than any other in the nation. ____ Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america	https://apnews.com/article/mexico-drugs-war-car-bomb-guanajato-sheinbaum-2af81dc58b803db44c167cdf14e0f7fb	2024-10-24T08:00:47-07:00	
Canada will reduce immigration targets as Trudeau acknowledges his policy failed	TORONTO (AP) — Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Thursday that Canada will significantly reduce the number of new immigrants it allows into the country after acknowledging that his government failed to get the balance right coming out of the pandemic. Trudeau's Liberal government was criticized for its plan to allow 500,000 new permanent residents into the country in each of the next two years. On Thursday, he said next year’s target will now be 395,000 new permanent residents and that the figure will drop to 380,000 in 2026 and 365,000 in 2027. 'In the tumultuous times as we emerged from the pandemic, between addressing labor needs and maintaining population growth, we didn't get the balance right,' Trudeau said. 'Immigration is essential for Canada's future, but it must be controlled and it must be sustainable.' Trudeau, who is facing calls from within his own party not to seek a fourth term, has endured mounting criticism over his immigration policies and the negative impact that population growth has had on housing affordability. He said his government will reduce the number of immigrants Canada brings in over the next three years, and that this will freeze population growth over the next two years. Canada reached 41 million people in April. The population was 37.5 million in 2019. 'Even Justin Trudeau wants to close Canada’s Borders,' Donald Trump wrote Thursday on social media while arguing for tougher border measures in the U.S. Trudeau said Canada needs to stabilize its population growth to allow all levels of government to make necessary changes to health care, housing and social services so that it can accommodate more people in the future. Trudeau also blamed others. 'Far too many corporations have chosen to abuse our temporary measures, exploiting foreign workers while refusing to hire Canadians for a fair wage,' Trudeau said. 'All while under the watch of provinces, some colleges and universities are bringing in more international students than communities can accommodate, treating them as an expendable means to line their own pockets. That’s unacceptable, and it needs to change.' Immigration Minister Marc Miller said the lower immigration numbers will help with the country's housing shortage. He also acknowledged the change in public opinion about immigration. 'That volume that we have put forward is of concern,' Miller said. Miller said the government sees the pressures facing Canadians, and that it must adapt its policies accordingly. 'We are an open country, but not everyone can come to this country,' he said, noting that Canada will continue to welcome outsiders and that the government's immigration targets remain ambitious. Trudeau's government has long touted Canada's immigration policy and how Canada is better than peer countries in welcoming newcomers and integrating them into the economy. Pierre Poilievre, the leader of the opposition Conservative Party, accused Trudeau of destroying the national consensus on immigration. 'He has destroyed our immigration system through his own personal incompetence and destroyed 150 years of common sense consensus with the Liberals and Conservatives on that subject,' Poilievre said. 'He cannot fix what he broke on immigration and housing or anything else because he is busy fighting his own caucus,' he added. Poilievre was referring to calls by some lawmakers from Trudeau's own party to not run for a fourth term. Those calls represent one of the biggest tests of Trudeau's political career, but he said Thursday that he intends to stay on through the next election. Nelson Wiseman, professor emeritus of political science at the University of Toronto, said the Trudeau government messed up badly on immigration. 'The government’s logic — to grow the economy and sustain an aging Canadian population by bringing in more young immigrants — was sound. But Ottawa has little control over meeting the housing, health, education, and other welfare needs of residents, whether they are citizens or immigrants,' Wiseman said. 'These are all provincial government responsibilities, and there was little cooperation or coordination between the two levels of government,' he said. A certain percentage of Canadians have always been xenophobic, but much less so than in some other countries, Wiseman said. 'Many Canadians have turned against the recent growing immigrant and temporary worker/student influx because of the growing housing, health, education, and other welfare challenges. Ottawa has read the polls and is responding accordingly,' he said.	https://apnews.com/article/canada-immigration-reduction-trudeau-dabd4a6248929285f90a5e95aeb06763	2024-10-24T07:53:19-07:00	
Canada's Trudeau vows to lead his Liberal Party into the next election	TORONTO (AP) — Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Thursday that he will lead his Liberal Party into the next election, dismissing a request by some party members to not run for a fourth term. Trudeau met with his Liberal members of Parliament for three hours Wednesday, where he learned that more than 20 lawmakers from his party signed a letter asking him to step down before the next election. He said there were 'robust conversations' ongoing about the best way forward, but 'that will happen with me as leader going into the next election.' No Canadian prime minister in more than a century has won four straight terms. Trudeau's Cabinet ministers have said he has the support of the vast majority of the 153 Liberal Party members of the House of Commons. Sean Casey, one of the Liberal lawmakers who signed the letter asking Trudeau to step down, said he was disappointed Trudeau didn't take the time to reflect but said he now considers the matter done and he's moving on. Casey said Trudeau listened but he wasn't swayed. 'This was a decision he had every right to make and he made it,' Casey told reporters. 'I did my job in voicing what I was hearing from constituents and now I have to direct my energy to winning my seat and not internal party matters. As far as I'm concerned it is closed.' Casey said he wouldn’t call it delusional but said Trudeau 'is seeing something I don’t see, that my constituents don’t see.' The Liberals trail the Conservatives by 38% to 25% in the latest Nanos poll. The poll of 1,037 respondents has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points. The Liberals recently suffered upsets in special elections for seats representing two districts in Toronto and Montreal that the party has held for years, raising doubts about Trudeau’s leadership. The federal election could come anytime between this fall and next October. The Liberals must rely on the support of at least one major party in Parliament, as they don’t hold an outright majority themselves. The leader of the opposition Bloc Québécois has said his party will work with the Conservatives and the New Democratic Party, of NDP, to bring down the Liberals and force an election if the government doesn’t boost pensions. Nelson Wiseman, professor emeritus at the University of Toronto, said pressure is building on Trudeau but that some of his unhappy lawmakers don't have much power to force him out. 'Trudeau holds all the cards. It is up to him if he wants to stay. The Liberal Party revised its rules in 2016 so that the party leader is immune to any challenge to his leadership so long as he is prime minister,' said Nelson Wiseman, professor emeritus at the University of Toronto. Trudeau channeled the star power of his father in 2015 when he reasserted the country’s liberal identity after almost 10 years of Conservative Party rule. But the son of late Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau is now in trouble. Canadians have been frustrated by the rising cost of living and other issues like immigration increases following the country's emergence from the COVID-19 pandemic.	https://apnews.com/article/trudeau-canada-election-a4c5859fa028aefdcffd0e74ddc9fffa	2024-10-24T07:18:00-07:00	
Google's partnership with AI startup Anthropic faces a UK competition investigation	LONDON (AP) — Britain’s competition watchdog said Thursday it's opening a formal investigation into Google’s partnership with artificial intelligence startup Anthropic. The Competition and Markets Authority said it has 'sufficient information' to launch an initial probe after it sought input earlier this year on whether the deal would stifle competition. The CMA has until Dec. 19 to decide whether to approve the deal or escalate its investigation. 'Google is committed to building the most open and innovative AI ecosystem in the world,' the company said. 'Anthropic is free to use multiple cloud providers and does, and we don’t demand exclusive tech rights.' San Francisco-based Anthropic was founded in 2021 by siblings Dario and Daniela Amodei, who previously worked at ChatGPT maker OpenAI. The company focused heavily on increasing the safety and reliability of AI models. Google reportedly agreed last year to make a multibillion-dollar investment in Anthropic. The U.K. regulator has been scrutinizing a raft of AI deals as investment money floods into the industry to capitalize on the artificial intelligence boom. Last month it cleared Anthropic's $4 billion deal with Amazon and it has also signed off on Microsoft's deals with two other AI startups, Inflection and Mistral.	https://apnews.com/article/uk-google-anthropic-competition-artificial-intelligence-ai-262eb88fb1db92eae68b6b2f158229a9	2024-10-24T06:23:10-07:00	
Britain's leaders likely to face slavery reparations questions at a summit of former colonies	WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — Britain's leaders will likely face uncomfortable questions about reparations for the trans-Atlantic slave trade at a summit of nations it once colonized, after Caribbean leaders said they would thrust the matter into the spotlight at the event in Samoa. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer had said that compensation for slavery wasn't on the agenda at this week's biennial Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting, or CHOGM, in the Samoan capital, Apia. But the issue threatens to boil over anyway, presaging an uneasy summit for Starmer and Britain’s King Charles III, who is battling cancer but is also attending. The Commonwealth group of 56 nations has 'taken on issues other people have always run away from' before, the organization’s Secretary-General Patricia Scotland told The Associated Press on Thursday when asked if financial reparations would feature in talks. She didn't confirm BBC reports that a draft text of the statement to be issued by leaders after meetings on Friday and Saturday includes an acknowledgement of calls for 'reparatory justice' over the slave trade. The text of the statement could change before its release, and British officials reportedly vetoed a plan for a separate declaration on reparations, the BBC said. Caribbean and African leaders have led the push to address the reparations issue. The summit should involve 'a ‘come to Jesus’ moment where we truly look at one another in the eye and say, ‘look, this is what happened,'' Bahamas Prime Minister Philip Davis told Politico on Thursday. Davis confirmed that he is among the leaders who want their final joint communique to mention reparations and who hope to have a 'frank' discussion of the matter with Starmer. A handful of nations have apologized for their role in slavery, including the Netherlands. The U.K. has never formally apologized for its role in the trans-Atlantic slave trade, which enriched many individuals and companies. Britain outlawed the slave trade in 1807 but did not legislate to emancipate slaves in its territories until 1833. A growing list of British institutions, including the Church of England, have begun to own up to their historic involvement in slavery. The British government had said reparations would not be on the Commonwealth summit agenda, though it acknowledged Thursday that the issue might be mentioned in the final communique. Starmer said he wanted the summit to focus on the future, not the past, telling reporters as he arrived in Samoa that Commonwealth members had divulged to him they were 'facing real challenges on things like climate in the here and now.' He said he would rather focus on those matters than 'what will end up being very, very long endless discussions about reparations on the past.' 'The Commonwealth countries are looking forward to talking about things which concern them and they’re interested in,' said Scotland, the secretary-general. 'So this is Keir’s first CHOGM, and I know they’re going to love him.' Starmer isn't the only one who might have preferred to keep the matter off the agenda. The presence of King Charles could prompt uneasy questions — as it did in Australia — about the role of the British crown in the histories and aspirations of its former territories. Charles and his eldest son, Prince William, have expressed their sorrow over slavery, but they haven’t acknowledged the crown’s connections to the trade, although the king last year endorsed a probe into the monarchy’s ties to the industry. Studies and analysts have estimated the total that Britain could owe the descendants of millions of people whose slave labor funded the nation for centuries to be in the hundreds of billions or even trillions of dollars. At the this week's gathering, political leaders will head on a retreat for hours of free-ranging discussions. Other matters are high on the agenda, too. Leaders are expected agree on a commitment to establishing permanent ocean boundaries, and Davis, of the Bahamas, said poor countries will also seek reparations for increasing extreme weather events from polluters such as Britain. 'The most important thing to know is that the Commonwealth heads will speak about absolutely anything they want to speak about when they go on the retreat,' Scotland said. Jacqueline McKenzie, a partner at London law firm Leigh Day who is working on the reparations issue, said its inclusion on the CHOGM leaders’ communique would be 'hugely significant.' 'I think the time has come for this to be taken seriously. I’m not surprised at the response of the British government … because I think reparations is going to be hugely divisive in the U.K.,' she said. 'Nobody expects people to pay every single penny for what happened. But I think there needs to be negotiations,' said McKenzie. 'It has to be on the agenda.' Starmer, she added, was 'going to have to face it.' The 75-year-old Commonwealth has a collective population of 2.7 billion people and a disparate range of member states — including some that don't have historical ties to Britain. Observers will be assessing whether Charles can unify their purpose as his mother, the late Queen Elizabeth II, once did. 'The Commonwealth, I think he knows, was one of the most important things that his mother did,' said Anna Whitelock, professor of history of the monarchy at City, University of London. 'Not only keeping this Commonwealth of countries together, but actually retaining a sort of spirit of community and cooperation and relevance in a world where there’s so many other power blocs and challenges.' ___ Lawless reported from London.	https://apnews.com/article/britain-commonwealth-summit-slavery-reparations-be23cf856970878f82a2a7237ccf3b62	2024-10-24T06:22:40-07:00	
Gangs in Haiti open fire and hit a UN helicopter midair as violence surges	PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) — Gangs on Thursday opened fire and hit a U.N. helicopter, forcing it to land in Port-au-Prince in the latest attack in Haiti's capital as violence surges once again. No one was injured as several rounds of gunfire hit the helicopter that was carrying three crew members and 15 passengers, according to a U.N. source who was not authorized to confirm the incident. The helicopter, which had departed from Port-au-Prince before it was attacked, landed safely, the source said. The attack comes five months after Haiti's main international airport reopened following coordinated gang attacks that forced it to close for nearly three months. The violence has spilled to nearby areas including Arcahaie, where some 50 suspected gang members died this week after attacking the coastal town located just northwest of the capital. Among the dead are at least a dozen gunmen who drowned after their boat capsized, a government official said Thursday. While the majority were killed by police, a group of gunmen drowned on Wednesday after their boat hit the reef as they ferried ammunition to gangs attacking the town of Arcahaie, said Wilner Réné from Haiti’s Civil Protection Agency. He told Radio Caraïbes that the attack began on Monday, with gunmen burning homes and cars across Arcahaie. When the gangs ran out of ammunition, they hid in nearby areas and were ferreted out by residents and police, he said. The attack is still ongoing, and Réné warned that officers on the scene urgently need reinforcements from soldiers and special police units. The attack is blamed on a gang coalition called Viv Ansanm, which also has targeted communities in Port-au-Prince in recent days. Those attacks have displaced more than 10,000 people in the capital in just one week, according to a report released Thursday by the U.N.'s International Organization for Migration. More than half of those left homeless crowded into 14 makeshift shelters, including schools. The remainder are temporarily staying with relatives. The spike in gang violence comes just months after a U.N.-backed mission led by Kenyan police began with the aim of quelling a surge in violence from gangs, who control more than 80% of Port-au-Prince. More than 700,000 people have been left homeless, and thousands have been killed. The U.S. government and top Haitian officials have warned that the Kenyan-led mission lacks personnel and funding and have asked that it be replaced with a U.N.-peacekeeping mission. ___ Coto reported from San Juan, Puerto Rico ____ Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america	https://apnews.com/article/haiti-gang-violence-boat-ammunition-viv-ansamn-c6f18eca38ec60a727b8d33308d8e1ef	2024-10-24T06:21:12-07:00	
Mozambique's ruling party candidate declared winner of presidential election as rigging claims swirl	MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) — Mozambique's ruling party candidate Daniel Chapo was declared the winner of the country's presidential election Thursday as the opposition claimed the vote was rigged and one party said it would challenge the result in court. According to the national election commission, Chapo won with 70,67% of the national vote, followed by independent candidate Venancio Mondlane with 20,32% of the vote. The candidate of the opposition party Renamo, Ossufo Momade, came third with 5,81% of the total votes. The results of the Oct. 9 election mean the governing Front for the Liberation of Mozambique party, or Frelimo, has extended its 49 years in power since the southern African country gained independence from Portugal in 1975. It then fought a bloody 15-year civil war against rebel group Renamo, which later became the main opposition party and also contested this election. Speaking shortly after the results were announced, Chapo told supporters he condemned the recent killings of two opposition figures. He also criticized the strikes called by the opposition to protest what it claimed was systematic deceit. Police quelled the demonstrations this week, dispersing them by firing teargas. 'As the Frelimo party, we want to once again reiterate our repudiation of the murders of Elvino Dias and Paulo Guambe as well as other citizens physically affected in this ongoing process of demonstrations,' said Chapo. Dias, a lawyer and advisor to opposition presidential candidate Mondlane, was killed when gunmen riddled his car with bullets in the port capital of Maputo last Friday. Guambe, the party spokesperson, was also in the car and was killed. Chapo promised to 'try to do better for the Mozambican people,' regardless of race, religion or political affiliation. Lutero Simango of the opposition Mozambique Democratic Movement, who got just over 3% of the vote, on Thursday disputed the election outcome and said his party would challenge the results in court. 'We from the MDM will be on the side of the people, of electoral justice, and will combat all manipulations, which is why we will combine legal and political action so that the results reflect the will of the voters,' he said. Despite the confirmation of the results by the election commission, the Constitutional Council will have the final say after it considers any appeals filed by the opposition. Chapo will face immediate challenges including an extremist organization affiliated to the Islamic State group that has launched attacks on communities in the northern province of Cabo Delgado since 2017. It has carried out several beheadings. Around 600,000 of the 1.3 million people who fled the province since 2017 have since returned home, many to shattered communities where houses, markets, churches, schools and health facilities have been destroyed, the United Nations said earlier this year. Mozambique also faces high levels of unemployment and hunger, exacerbated by El Nino-induced severe drought. According to the U.N. World Food Program, 1.3 million people face severe food shortages. Frelimo has often been accused of rigging elections, which it has consistently denied. Current President Filipe Nyusi of Frelimo is stepping down after serving the maximum two terms allowed. The EU’s observer mission said this week that some of its election observers had been prevented from monitoring counting in some areas and there was an 'unjustified alteration' of results at some polling stations. Independent political analyst Onisio Buanaissa said it was in the best interest of the country for the opposition to accept the election results as announced by the electoral commission. 'You may not be satisfied with the result, but you need to respect that it is the majority. This is the very logic of liberal democracies,' he said. ___ Follow AP’s Africa coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/africa	https://apnews.com/article/mozambique-election-results-daniel-chapo-rigging-c92d818ecdbe6e4ba22256bfad9eecd1	2024-10-24T05:46:30-07:00	
A lawmaker from the far-right Freedom Party is elected as speaker of Austria's parliament	VIENNA (AP) — A lawmaker from the far-right Freedom Party was elected Thursday as the new speaker of Austria's parliament, weeks after the party won a national election for the first time. Walter Rosenkranz becomes the first member of the Freedom Party to be elected as speaker, one of the country's highest-ranking positions in protocol terms. It has traditionally been taken by the strongest party. Rosenkranz, a lawyer and former leader of his party's parliamentary group who most recently served as a member of the Austrian Ombudsman Board, won the support of 100 of the 183 lawmakers in the new parliament's inaugural session. No other party fielded a candidate but dozens of votes went to other lawmakers. While a majority of lawmakers stuck to tradition in making the 62-year-old Rosenkranz speaker, the Freedom Party isn't likely to be part of the next government. On Tuesday, President Alexander Van der Bellen dispensed with a tradition of giving the first-placed party's leader the task of forming a new administration after the Sept. 29 parliamentary election produced a stalemate. Instead, he asked incumbent Chancellor Karl Nehammer to do so. Whoever leads the next government will need to build a coalition to have a parliamentary majority. But Nehammer’s conservative Austrian People’s Party has said it wouldn’t work with the Freedom Party under its leader, Herbert Kickl. The other three parties in the new parliament said they wouldn’t work with the Freedom Party at all. And Kickl said the Freedom Party would only go into government with him as chancellor. Nehammer says he will try to form a three-party coalition with the center-left Social Democrats and one of two smaller parties, the liberal Neos or the environmentalist Greens. Rosenkranz was the Freedom Party's candidate in the 2022 presidential election, finishing a distant second behind Van der Bellen.	https://apnews.com/article/austria-far-right-parliament-speaker-rosenkranz-ab1d84ab7f022fe226b006e0479027e0	2024-10-24T05:22:38-07:00	
EU Commission chief urges North Macedonia's political parties to cooperate on accession push	SKOPJE, North Macedonia (AP) — European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen praised North Macedonia’s reform efforts Thursday, but stressed the need for progress on constitutional changes if the country was to make progress with its bid to join the EU. North Macedonia's dispute with neighbor and EU member Bulgaria has delayed its EU accession process. The previous center-left government agreed to add a reference to a Bulgarian ethnic minority in the constitution to break the impasse, but lacked the parliamentary majority to enact the change. Prime Minister Hristijan Mickoski’s new conservative government maintains it will only amend the constitution if Bulgaria first approves North Macedonia’s EU membership without additional conditions. 'We are almost there, but we know it's about the constitutional change that your country has committed to,' von der Leyen told a joint conference with Mickoski in Skopje, while on a six-nation tour of the region. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and fears of broader instability in Europe have added urgency to EU accession bids by Balkan countries seeking entry. The EU started membership talks with North Macedonia and Albania in 2022, and the bloc recently pushed ahead with Albania’s accession process independently, departing from the previous approach of moving both countries forward together. Von der Leyen urged cross-party support in North Macedonia for the constitutional amendment. Her regional tour continues with visits to Bosnia Herzegovina, Kosovo, Serbia and Montenegro as the EU seeks to reassure Western Balkan nations of their membership prospects.	https://apnews.com/article/eu-north-macedonia-balkans-accession-skopje-mickoski-cac7185cc5640ff89f567d4d5973857c	2024-10-24T05:12:34-07:00	
World on pace for significantly more warming without immediate climate action, report warns	The world is on a path to get 1.8 degrees Celsius (3.2 Fahrenheit) warmer than it is now, but could trim half a degree of that projected future heating if countries do everything they promise to fight climate change, a United Nations report said Thursday. But it still won't be near enough to curb warming's worst impacts such as nastier heat waves, wildfires, storms and droughts, the report said. Under every scenario but the 'most optimistic' with the biggest cuts in fossil fuels burning, the chance of curbing warming so it stays within the internationally agreed-upon limit 'would be virtually zero,' the United Nations Environment Programme's annual Emissions Gap Report said. The goal, set in the 2015 Paris Agreement, is to limit human-caused warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) since pre-industrial times. The report said that since the mid-1800s, the world has already heated up by 1.3 degrees Celsius (2.3 degrees Fahrenheit), up from previous estimates of 1.1 or 1.2 degrees because it includes the record heat last year. Instead the world is on pace to hit 3.1 degrees Celsius (5.6 degrees Fahrenheit) since pre-industrial times. But if nations somehow do all of what they promised in targets they submitted to the United Nations that warming could be limited to 2.6 degrees Celsius (4.7 degrees Fahrenheit), the report said. In that super-stringent cuts scenario where nations have zero net carbon emissions after mid-century, there's a 23% chance of keeping warming at or below the 1.5 degrees goal. It's far more likely that even that optimistic scenario will keep warming to 1.9 degrees above pre-industrial times, the report said. 'The main message is that action right now and right here before 2030 is critical if we want to lower the temperature,' said report main editor Anne Olhoff, an economist and chief climate advisor to the UNEP Copenhagen Climate Centre. 'It is now or never really if we want to keep 1.5 alive.' Without swift and dramatic emission cuts 'on a scale and pace never seen before,' UNEP Director Inger Andersen said 'the 1.5 degree C goal will soon be dead and (the less stringent Paris goal of) well below 2 degrees C will take its place in the intensive care unit.' Olhoff said Earth's on a trajectory to slam the door on 1.5 sometime in 2029. 'Winning slowly is the same as losing when it comes to climate change,' said author Neil Grant of Climate Analytics. 'And so I think we are at risk of a lost decade.' One of the problems is that even though nations pledged climate action in their targets submitted as part of the Paris Agreement, there's a big gap between what they said they will do and what they are doing based on their existing policies, report authors said. The world's 20 richest countries — which are responsible for 77% of the carbon pollution in the air — are falling short of their stated emission-cutting goals, with only 11 meeting their individual targets, the report said. Emission cuts strong enough to limit warming to the 1.5 degree goal are more than technically and economically possible, the report found. They just aren't being proposed or done. The report 'shows that yet again governments are sleepwalking towards climate chaos,' said climate scientist Bill Hare, CEO of Climate Analytics, who wasn't part of the report. Another outside scientist, Johan Rockstrom, director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, said the report confirms his worst concerns: 'We are not making progress and are now following a 3.1 degree path, which is, with next to zero uncertainty, a path to disaster.' Both the 3.1 degree and 2.6 degree calculations are a tenth of a degree Celsius warmer than last year’s version of the UN report, which experts said is within the margin of uncertainty. Mostly the problem is 'there's one year less time to cut emissions and avoid climate catastrophe,' said MIT's John Sterman, who models different warming scenarios based on emissions and countries policies. 'Catastrophe is a strong word and I don't use it lightly,' he said, citing the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's latest report saying 3 degrees of warming would trigger severe and irreversible damage. The report focuses on what's called an emissions gap. It calculates a budget of how many billions of tons of greenhouse gases — mostly carbon dioxide and methane — the world can spew and stay under 1.5 degrees, 1.8 degrees and 2 degrees of warming since pre-industrial times. It then figures how much annual emissions have to be slashed by 2030 to keep at those levels. To keep at or below 1.5 degrees, the world must slash emissions by 42%, and to keep at or below 2 degrees, the cut has to be 28%, the report, named, 'No more hot air... please !' said. In 2023, the world spewed 57.1 billion metric tons (62.9 billion U.S. tons) of greenhouse gases, the report said. That’s 1,810 metric tons (1,995 U.S. tons) of heat-trapping gases a second. 'There is a direct link between increasing emissions and increasingly frequent and intense climate disasters,' United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in a video messaged released with the report. 'We're playing with fire, but there can be no more playing for time. We're out of time.' __ Read more of AP’s climate coverage at http://www.apnews.com/climate-and-environment ___ Follow Seth Borenstein on X at @borenbears ______ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

IMF chief warns that world risks falling into slow-growth rut and urges China to enact reforms	WASHINGTON (AP) — The world economy, buffeted by conflict and growing geopolitical rivalries, is in danger of getting stuck in a slow-growth, high-debt rut, the head of the International Monetary Fund warned Thursday. She also urged Chinese leaders to take more decisive action to jump-start their country's sluggish economy or risk seeing economic growth plummet. 'These are anxious times,’’ the fund’s managing director, Kristalina Georgieva, told reporters during the fall meetings of the IMF and its sister agency, the World Bank. The IMF forecasts that the global economy will expand this year at what Georgieva called an 'anemic'' 3.2%. Global trade is lackluster at a time of conflict and growing geopolitical tension — including frosty relations the world's two largest economies, the United States and China. 'Trade is no more a powerful engine of growth,'' she said. 'We live in a more fragmented global economy.' At the same time, many countries are struggling with debts they took on to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. The IMF expects government debts worldwide to to top $100 trillion this year. That would equal to 93% of global economic output — a share that is expected to approach 100% by 2030. 'The global economy is in danger of getting stuck on a low growth, high debt path,'' Georgieva said. 'That means lower income and fewer jobs.'' Still, the economic backdrop isn't entirely bleak. The IMF says the world has made considerable progress to rein in inflation that surged in 2021 and 2022 as economies roared back with unexpected strength from pandemic lockdowns. She credited higher interest rates engineered by the Federal Reserve and other central banks and the easing of backlogs at factories, ports and freight yards that had caused shortages, delays and higher prices. In wealthy countries, the fund expects inflation to drop next year to the 2% sought by central banks. And price pressures have eased without sending the world into a recession. 'For most of the world, a soft landing is in sight,’’ Georgieva said. But many people are still struggling with high prices and economic uncertainty. World leaders are telling her that their economies are relatively healthy — but ordinary 'people are not feeling good about their economic prospects.’’ The IMF, a 190-nation lending organization, works to promote economic growth and financial stability and reduce global poverty. In its latest World Economic Outlook report, issued Tuesday, the fund forecast that the once high-flying Chinese economy would grow just 4.8% this year and 4.5% in 2025, down from 5.2% in 2023. Georgieva urged the Chinese government to shift away from dependence on exports and toward more reliance on spending by consumers, which she called a 'more reliable'' engine of growth. Taking 'decisive action'' to reverse a collapse in the Chinese property market, she said, would boost consumers' confidence and willingness to spend. 'If China doesn’t move, potential growth can slow down to way below 4%,'' she said.	https://apnews.com/article/imf-world-economy-debt-inflation-32b7b5fe50176a680a380835e7113723	2024-10-24T04:51:05-07:00	
The Latest: Harris and Trump focus on closing messages with rallies in Georgia, Nevada, Arizona	Former President Donald Trump will be holding rallies in Tempe, Arizona, and Las Vegas on Thursday. Meanwhile, Vice President Kamala Harris will be holding a rally Thursday night in the Atlanta suburbs with former President Barack Obama and musician Bruce Springsteen. Follow the AP’s Election 2024 coverage at: https://apnews.com/hub/election-2024. Here’s the latest: President Biden will meet with labor leaders in Pittsburgh on Saturday to help shore up their critical support for Harris in Pennsylvania Biden will meet with local leadership of the Laborers’ International Union of North America, and he’ll be joined by President Brent Booker. Biden, who has said he’s the most pro-union president in history, walked the picket line with the United Auto Workers and his administration worked most recently to prevent the dock workers strike. Biden has been calling local union workers in the critical battleground state to push for continued mobilization on behalf of his vice president, the Democratic nominee. Beyoncé, whose ‘Freedom’ is Harris’ campaign anthem, is expected at the Democrat’s Texas rally on Friday Beyoncé is expected to appear Friday in her hometown of Houston at a rally for Vice President Kamala Harris, according to three people familiar with the matter. Harris’ presidential campaign has taken on Beyonce’s 2016 track 'Freedom' as its anthem, and the singer’s planned appearance brings a high level of star power to what’s become a key theme of the Democratic nominee’s bid: freedom. Harris headed to the reliably Republican state just 10 days before Election Day in an effort to refocus her campaign against former President Donald Trump on reproductive care. The three people weren’t authorized to publicly discuss the matter and spoke on condition of anonymity. The Harris campaign did not immediately comment. ▶ Read more about Beyoncé at Harris’ rally With two women running, the New Hampshire governor’s race is both close and personal One of the nation’s most competitive gubernatorial races has also become intensely personal. None of the nation’s 12 female governors are up for reelection, but five women are running as major party gubernatorial nominees in four states. Two of them are in New Hampshire, where Republican Kelly Ayotte and Democrat Joyce Craig are competing to succeed Gov. Chris Sununu, a Republican who’s not seeking a fifth two-year term. While voters and the candidates themselves say their gender is a nonissue in a state with a history of electing women to top offices, it has influenced their approaches to the topic of abortion and reproductive health care. Both candidates have produced television ads in which they describe having miscarriages after medical appointments during which no fetal heartbeats were detected. ▶ Read more about the New Hampshire governor’s race Trump claims he is ‘maybe more conservative than any human being that’s ever lived’ The comment during an interview with conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt came after Hewitt gave the Republican former president a chance to claim the moderate mantle in the closing days of the 2024 campaign, an opening Trump swiftly closed. 'You’re not a particularly conservative. You’re not as conservative as Ronald Reagan. And you’ve tried to make that point. You’re kind of a moderate Republican, aren’t you?' Hewitt asked. 'I’m very, very conservative,' Trump said. 'Maybe more conservative than any human being that’s ever lived.' One of the primary criticisms of Trump when he entered political life in 2015, especially from conservative Republicans, was that he wasn’t a true conservative. Trump had been a registered Democrat during portions of his business career in New York and received considerable coverage at the outset of his successful 2016 campaign for being a moderate Republican, something his primary opponents like Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio used against him. Trump says he watched Harris’ Wednesday night town hall on CNN Speaking during a Thursday morning interview with conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt, Trump called the vice president’s performance 'an embarrassment.' 'I watched her charade story last night on CNN,' Trump said during the friendly interview. 'It was an embarrassment that she was running for president, representing a major party.' The town hall with CNN was meant to replace a second debate between Trump and Harris. After one debate with Harris, the former president declined to participate in another debate and did not accept CNN’s invitation for a town hall. Harris used the forum to lambast Trump before an audience of undecided voters in Pennsylvania. She agreed — twice — that Trump was a fascist, echoing the criticism of Trump’s longest-serving chief of staff, and said if Trump is elected again, he would be 'a president who admires dictators and is a fascist.' Trump returned to the town hall later in the interview, saying Harris was 'like a child almost.' The RNC is rebuilding its legal operation after Trump allies’ failed effort to undo the 2020 race The last time Donald Trump ran for president, the lawyers most directly involved in his efforts to overturn the election wound up sanctioned, criminally prosecuted or even sued for millions of dollars. This time around, Republican party leaders are working to present a more organized, skilled legal operation even as Trump continues to deny he lost the 2020 election and sows doubt about the integrity of the upcoming one. 'It has been very important to make sure that in every aspect, we are going to have a fully professional operation,' RNC Chairman Michael Whatley told The Associated Press. As Republicans and Democrats fight in court over election rules, the Trump team finds itself under a particularly intense microscope given the aftermath of the 2020 race when meritless legal efforts challenging the results were repeatedly rejected by judges appointed by presidents of both political parties. ▶ Read more about the Republican legal operation Republican former Rep. Fred Upton of Michigan has endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris’ presidential bid His endorsement on Thursday marks another cross-party backing for the Democratic presidential nominee, who’s campaigned this week with Liz Cheney, the GOP former Wyoming congresswoman. Both Upton and Cheney were among the House Republicans who voted to impeach Donald Trump after a mob of his supporters stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Upton, who represented West Michigan and served in Congress for 36 years, said in a statement that Trump is 'unfit to serve as commander in chief again.' Upton said he has already cast his ballot for Harris. 'Time and time again respected senior national Republicans have urged our former president to focus on governing rather than personal attacks, mistruths, and continued false 2020 election claims,' said Upton. 'Instead of heeding that advice, we see unhinged behavior not acceptable in most forums almost daily.'	https://apnews.com/article/kamala-harris-donald-trump-election-2024-93ab2993b8d713375eefb6fd32440d7f	2024-10-24T04:46:08-07:00	
In Colombia, Amazon River's extreme drought falls hard on Indigenous communities	LETICIA, Colombia (AP) — Marciano Flores stood knee-deep in the Amazon River with the rest of his crew, ready to haul in a giant net as a man in a canoe circled in an attempt to drive fish their way. At 69, after a life of working the river, Flores can tell at a glance just the right spots to seek a catch he can sell at the market. But standing here a year ago would have been impossible, with the river far above his head. Flores has never seen the Amazon so low, and the men’s net came up empty before they relocated downriver and caught a few small fish. A declining catch is forcing him and his fellow fishermen to search farther and farther down the river each day, and costing him more in fuel too. 'The drought has hit me hard,' said Flores, of the Cocama Indigenous community. 'When the water's low, the fish die, so there's nothing to get.' The Amazon River naturally fluctuates during the dry and rainy seasons. But since last year a dramatic drop has been evident, most critical in Brazil. Now the phenomenon is spreading into other Amazon nations, wreaking havoc on local economies and food supplies. In Colombia, the river's fall has isolated some rural Indigenous communities, prompting nonprofits and the government to deliver water and food to places that depend on rain and river water to survive. In some communities, it's an arduous hourlong walk along the dried-up areas to get basic supplies. In other areas, schoolchildren have to walk two hours to get to their classes as boats are unable to drop them close by. Water levels decreased between 80% and 90% in the past few months, Colombia’s National Unit for Disaster Risk Management said last month. 'I've been very concerned, particularly for the Indigenous communities that are affected the most because all the food has already run out,' said Álvaro Sarmiento, head of operations for the Colombian Civil Defense in the Amazonas province at Leticia's port. 'For Indigenous people, fishing is their main source of food.' __ EDITOR’S NOTE: This is part of a series on how tribes and Indigenous communities are coping with and combating climate change. ___ Large patches of sandy areas can be seen where the river has receded. Evidence of how dramatically the water has fallen can be seen along banks where the earth has cracked under the heat, with large parts collapsing into what's left of the river. In some areas, white marks high on tree trunks show where the water used to be. 'In the 35 years I’ve been in the Amazon, it's the first time I’ve seen it this low,' said Jugalvis Valencia, 61, a boat tour guide. He worries that a repeat drought next year will dry up some parts of the river completely. 'If we have a similar summer next year, it’s possible that (the river) will get cut off and we’ll be stuck in Leticia,' he said. Communities in need of resources, water In a community called La Playa on the outskirts of Leticia, Ermencida Miranda runs a small store out of her wooden home propped on stilts, selling things like cleaning supplies and Peruvian, Colombian and Brazilian foods in this area where the three countries come together. And Miranda worries about access to water. 'In all the communities ... we are suffering because of the water, because it's not raining, the drought is really severe,' said Miranda, 48, who came from Putumayo eight years ago in search of better economic opportunities. 'We bathe in the river water, but for cooking and drinking we have to wait for rainwater and when there's none, we have to buy water from Leticia. Imagine that!' said Miranda, of the Tikuna people. Some 32 kilometers (about 20 miles) down the river is the Indigenous reserve of Santa Sofia, a community of about 2,400 made up of five different Indigenous groups, where locals waited in the shade of mango trees for the arrival of supplies from a nonprofit organization. Last year, the river came right up to the mango trees, but now the water is so low it takes a five-minute walk down a dry, cracked mud path. The nonprofit delivered food supplies like lentils, rice and cooking oil, as well as three large cisterns that can be used to catch and store rainwater. Locals shouldered the heavy white bags of supplies to carry them back to their homes, and men teamed up to move the bulky cisterns. 'It's been hard for us to get food, and to take our crops for sale to Leticia because of the drought,' said Santa Sofia resident Elder Kawache, 47. Access to drinking water has been the most difficult part of the drought for the community since the local well also dried up, Kawache, from the Cocama community, said. Colombia's environment ministry didn't respond to a request for comment on the drought. The National Unit for Disaster Risk Management said this month it will deliver motorized pumps and hoses for water supply to isolated territories and that a contract for the exploration of underground water sources will be initiated. It has said it is sending humanitarian assistance kits with drinking water and nonperishable food for the communities. Peru announced a state of emergency and said it would deliver medicines and chlorinated water to communities near the river. Brazilian authorities have been distributing potable water and water purification systems and the government says it will make advance payments to those eligible for monthly welfare payments for poor families in affected areas. The river has risen slightly in some places in recent days, but after back-to-back and increasingly severe droughts, locals worry about next year. At her homemade store, Miranda has seen no evidence of help from the government. She'd love to see an elevated tank filled with water so people don't have to 'suffer so much in carrying water' during the summer. 'If someone could help us to get water, it would be a happiness and a change to life, wouldn’t it? Because water is very important for us.' — Follow Steven Grattan on X: @sjgrattan — The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Train carrying at least 50 people derails on Norway's north coast, killing at least 1 person	COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) — At least one person was killed and four people injured when a train running along Norway’s northern coast derailed Thursday with at least 50 people on board, Norwegian media reported. Initial reports suggested that people with minor injuries were found at the scene. THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP’s earlier story follows below. COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) — Train operator SJ said 90 tickets for the train had been sold but it could not immediately say how many people were on board. Police spokesman Kenneth Lauritsen told the newspaper Dagbladet that one person had died in the derailment. Five or six people were injured. Police earlier had told Norwegian news agency NTB that people with minor injuries were found at the scene. They were alerted to the derailment at 1238 GMT. Police told NTB that a rock slide likely caused the derailment. The VG newspaper carried a photo of a huge rock on the track that had smashed into a train carriage. The Arctic Circle Express was on its way from Trondheim to the northern town of Bodoe. NTB, citing the Joint Rescue Coordination Center for northern Norway, said there were 'between 50 and 70 people on board the train.' 'We think all the passengers are out. But we are doublechecking the train as we do not have a passenger list,' police spokesman Bent Are Eilertsen told Norwegian broadcaster TV 2. One of the passengers, Ingvart Strand Mølster, told Norwegian broadcaster NRK that 'a rock has hit the train.' Strand Mølster said no one in his train carriage was hurt, with the exception of one person who suffered a minor ankle injury. Another passenger told the local newspaper Avisa Nordland that people were evacuated out through the windows. NRK posted a video of the train which had left its mountainside tracks, crashing through trees and down onto the road, which was closed to traffic in the wake of the derailment. Photos on Norwegian media showed the locomotive and what appeared to be at least two passenger cars. The derailment happened near Bodoe, just north of the Arctic Circle.	https://apnews.com/article/norway-train-derails-bodoe-arctic-express-rescue-69eb40aaabbe0d658c6b8083144a6355	2024-10-24T04:14:26-07:00	
Israeli strike on Gaza shelter kills 17 as Blinken says cease-fire talks will resume	DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — An Israeli strike on a school where displaced people were sheltering in the central Gaza Strip killed at least 17 people on Thursday, nearly all women and children, Palestinian medical officials said. The strike came as U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Israel had accomplished its objective of 'effectively dismantling' Hamas, and that negotiations over a cease-fire and the release of dozens of Israeli hostages would resume in the coming days. Another 42 people were wounded in the strike in the built-up Nuseirat refugee camp, according to the Awda Hospital, which received the casualties. Among the dead were 13 children under the age of 18 and three women, according to the hospital's records. The Israeli military said it targeted Hamas militants inside the school, without providing evidence. Israel has carried out several strikes on schools-turned-shelters in recent months, saying it precisely targets militants hiding out among civilians. The strikes often kill women and children. Blinken, speaking to reporters in Qatar, which has served as a key mediator between Israel and Hamas, said negotiators would reconvene 'in the coming days.' 'What we really have to determine is whether Hamas is prepared to engage,' he said on his 11th visit to the region since the start of the war, The United States hopes to renew the negotiations after Israeli forces killed top Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar in Gaza last week, but neither side has shown any sign of moderating its demands from months of negotiations that sputtered to a halt over the summer. Blinken also announced an additional $135 million in U.S. aid to the Palestinians, while again urging Israel to allow more assistance to enter the territory. Health workers in besieged northern Gaza meanwhile warned of a catastrophic situation there, where Israel has been waging an air and ground offensive for more than two weeks. Hospital director in northern Gaza says supplies are running out Hundreds of people have been killed and tens of thousands have fled their homes in northern Gaza in recent days. The military says it is battling Hamas fighters who regrouped in the north, which was one of the first targets of the ground offensive at the start of the war. Dr. Hossam Abu Safiyeh, the director of the Kamal Adwan Hospital in the north, said in a video message released Wednesday that some 150 wounded people were being treated there, including 14 children in intensive care or the neonatal department. 'There is a very large number of wounded people, and we lose at least one person every hour because of the lack of medical supplies and medical staff,' he said. 'Our ambulances can’t transfer wounded people,' he said. 'Those who can arrive by themselves to the hospital receive care, but those who don’t just die in the streets.' Footage shared with The Associated Press shows medical staff tending to premature babies and several older children in hospital beds, some with severe burns. One child is seen attached to a breathing machine, with bandages on her face and flies hovering over her. 'We are providing the bare minimum to patients. Everyone is paying the price of what is happening now in northern Gaza,' Abu Safiyeh said. Kamal Adwan is one of three hospitals in the north left largely inaccessible because of the fighting. The war has gutted the health system across Gaza, with only 16 of 39 hospitals even partially functioning, according to the World Health Organization. First responders halt operations after saying Israel fired on them The Civil Defense, first responders who operate under the Hamas-run government, said they had suspended operations in the north. They said Israeli forces fired on one of their teams in the town of Beit Lahiya after ordering them to relocate to the Indonesian Hospital, where troops are stationed. Three Civil Defense members were wounded in the strike, and a firetruck was destroyed, it said. It said another five of its personnel were detained by Israeli forces at the hospital. 'As a result, we declare that Civil Defense operations in the northern Gaza Strip have been completely halted, leaving these areas without any firefighting, rescue, or emergency medical services,' it said in a statement. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military on the allegations. The war began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting another 250. Around 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, a third of whom are believed to be dead. Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed over 42,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not say how many were combatants but says women and children make up more than half the fatalities. The Israeli military says it has killed over 17,000 fighters, without providing evidence. The war has displaced around 90% of Gaza's population of 2.3 million, often multiple times. Hundreds of thousands of people are crammed into tent camps along the coast after entire neighborhoods in many areas were pounded to rubble. Months of cease-fire negotiations brokered by the United States, Egypt and Qatar sputtered to a halt over the summer. The war has meanwhile expanded to Lebanon, where Israel launched a ground invasion more than three weeks ago after trading fire with the Hezbollah militant group for much of the past year. ___ Amiri reported from Doha, Qatar, and Khaled reported from Cairo.

Pope Francis denounces a world 'losing its heart' in 4th encyclical of his papacy	VATICAN CITY (AP) — Pope Francis issued the fourth encyclical of his papacy on Thursday, denouncing a world that 'is losing its heart' during times of global turmoil marked by 'wars, socio-economic disparities and the uses of technology that threaten our humanity.' The document titled 'Dilexit Nos,' Latin for 'He Loves Us,' was issued to coincide with the 350th anniversary of St. Margaret Mary Alocoque's first apparition, which helped spread devotion to the Sacred Heart of Jesus revealing his love of humanity. The social encyclical appeals to the faithful to 'meditate' on Jesus’ love in a world in which consumerism and algorithms obscure humanity. It is his fourth encyclical, the best-known of which to date is the 2015 'Laudato Si,' or 'Praised Be,' which cast care for the environment in moral terms. In 'Dilexit Nos,' the pontiff did not cite specific examples of global turmoil in the 220-paragraph document issued in eight languages, although he frequently refers to conflicts from Ukraine to Gaza in homilies, weekly prayers and global travels. Francis often asks for prayers for the 'martyred' people of Ukraine and most recently cited 'inhumane attacks' in Gaza. In the Middle East conflict, he has tended to take a balanced line, often mentioning Israel and the hostages still held by Hamas alongside the suffering of the Palestinians. In the document, the pontiff said the failure to 'feel that something is intolerable' in the suffering on both sides of conflict 'is a sign of a world that has grown heartless.' 'When we witness the outbreak of new wars, with the complicity, tolerance or indifference of other countries, or petty power struggles over partisan interests, we may be tempted to conclude that our world is losing its heart,’’ he wrote. The pope warned that consumer-driven societies 'dominated by the hectic pace and bombarded by technology,' risked interfering with the possibility of engaging with an 'interior life.' He noted that algorithms have revealed that 'our thoughts and will are much more ‘uniform’ than we had previously thought. They are easily predictable and thus capable of being manipulated.' In an era of artificial intelligence, 'we cannot forget that poetry and love are necessary to save our humanity,’’ he wrote. Vatican encyclicals are the most authoritative form of papal teaching and traditionally take their titles from the first two words of the document. Mons. Bruno Forte, a theologian who is archbishop of the Italian diocese of Chiet-Vasto, said the 'Dilexit Nos' encyclical 'can be truly considered as a summary of everything that Pope Francis has said and wishes to say to our brothers in humanity. He says, ‘God loves you and has shown you in the best way, through Jesus.’' Forte said the document should not be viewed as 'just a spiritual refuge,' but as a proposal of 'love, mutual reception and forgiveness.'	https://apnews.com/article/pope-encyclical-global-conflicts-consumerism-algorithms-love-c9099f3cd0e69b793b4d53eda47c4123	2024-10-24T01:06:09-07:00	
Putin presides over BRICS summit seeking to expand Russia's clout	KAZAN, Russia (AP) — Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday presided at the closing session of a summit of the BRICS bloc of developing economies, praising its role as a counterbalance to what he called the West's 'perverse methods.' The three-day summit in the city of Kazan covered the deepening of financial cooperation, including the development of alternatives to Western-dominated payment systems, efforts to settle regional conflicts and expansion of the BRICS group of nations. The alliance that initially included Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa when it was founded in 2009 has expanded to embrace Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia. Turkey, Azerbaijan and Malaysia have formally applied to become members, and several other countries have expressed interest in joining. The summit was attended by leaders or representatives of 36 countries, highlighting the failure of U.S.-led efforts to isolate Russia over its actions in Ukraine. The Kremlin touted the summit as 'the largest foreign policy event ever held' by Russia. Speaking at what was dubbed the 'BRICS Plus' session, which included countries that are considering joining the bloc, Putin accused the West of trying to stem the growing power of the Global South with 'illegal unilateral sanctions, blatant protectionism, manipulation of currency and stock markets, and relentless foreign influence ostensibly promoting democracy, human rights, and the climate change agenda.' 'Such perverse methods and approaches -– to put it bluntly -– lead to the emergence of new conflicts and the aggravation of old disagreements,' Putin said. 'One example of this is Ukraine, which is being used to create critical threats to Russia’s security, while ignoring our vital interests, our just concerns, and the infringement of the rights of Russian-speaking people.' Russia has specifically pushed for the creation of a new payment system that would offer an alternative to the global bank messaging network SWIFT and allow Moscow to dodge Western sanctions and trade with partners. In a joint declaration Wednesday, participants voiced concern about 'the disruptive effect of unlawful unilateral coercive measures, including illegal sanctions' and reiterated their commitment to enhancing financial cooperation within BRICS. They noted the benefits of 'faster, low-cost, more efficient, transparent, safe and inclusive cross-border payment instruments built upon the principle of minimizing trade barriers and non-discriminatory access.' China's President Xi Jinping has emphasized the bloc’s role in ensuring global security. Xi noted that China and Brazil have put forward a peace plan for Ukraine and sought to rally broader international support for it. Ukraine has rejected the proposal. 'We should promote the de-escalation of the situation as soon as possible and pave the way for a political settlement,' Xi said Thursday. Putin and Xi had announced a 'no-limits' partnership weeks before Russia sent troops into Ukraine in 2022. They already met twice earlier this year, in Beijing in May and at a Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit in Kazakhstan in July. Russia’s cooperation with India also has flourished as New Delhi sees Moscow as a time-tested partner since the Cold War despite Russia’s close ties with India’s rival, China. While Western allies want New Delhi to be more active in persuading Moscow to end the fighting in Ukraine, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has avoided condemning Russia while emphasizing a peaceful settlement. Putin, who held a series of bilateral meetings on the summit's sidelines, was set to meet Thursday with U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, who is making his first visit to Russia in more than two years. Guterres’s trip to Kazan drew an angry reaction from Kyiv. Addressing the BRICS Plus session, Guterres urged an immediate end to the fighting in Gaza, Lebanon, Ukraine and Sudan. 'We need peace in Ukraine, a just peace in line with the U.N. Charter, international law and General Assembly resolutions,' he said. Russia's Kremlin-controlled media touted the summit as a massive policy coup that left the West fearing the loss of its global clout. State TV shows and news bulletins underscored that BRICS countries account for about half the world's population comprising the 'global majority' and challenging Western 'hegemony.' TV hosts elaborately quoted Western media reports saying that the summit highlighted the failure to isolate Moscow. 'The West, the U.S., Washington, Brussels, London ended up isolating themselves,' said Yevgeny Popov, host of a popular political talk show on state channel Rossiya 1.	https://apnews.com/article/russia-putin-brics-summit-china-india-31a4a4af22e9475aee322f2045701fc6	2024-10-24T00:21:59-07:00	
Well-known Cambodian investigative journalist released on bail	TA KHMAU, Cambodia (AP) — A Cambodian investigative reporter who was charged with a criminal offense after exposing online scams and corruption was released on bail Thursday. Mech Dara told reporters from a car outside the Kandal Provincial Prison complex, south of the capital Phnom Penh, that he had a small health problem. He looked tired and deathly pale as he spoke, saying 'I thank you every one for helping me, supporting me.' The freelance journalist was released at his lawyer's request in the Phnom Penh Municipal Court. Mech Dara told reporters that he still would need to fight the case in court in the future. He put his hands together in a salute and said he had not decided what to do next and refused to answer questions about whether he would resume working as an investigative journalist. On Wednesday, a government-allied media outlet, Fresh News, showed a video in which Mech Dara, wearing an orange prison uniform, apologized to Prime Minister Hun Manet and former Prime Minister Hun Sen, who is now president of the Senate. In a minutelong clip, Dara admitted he posted five incidents of false information in the past that were harmful to Cambodia and its leaders and he promised not to post false information in the future. The charge against Mech Dara, incitement to commit a felony or cause social disorder, carries a potential penalty of six months to two years in prison. His arrest on Sept. 30 had been condemned by journalists who worked with him as well as by international press freedom and rights groups. About four dozen Cambodian media organizations and civil society groups issued a joint statement calling for his immediate release and to 'stop all forms of harassment against media organizations and journalists.' The U.S. State Department also said it was 'deeply troubled' by his arrest. It noted he had been honored with its Trafficking in Persons Report Hero award last year for his work.	https://apnews.com/article/cambodia-investigative-journalist-mech-dara-press-freedom-8f831d5bbfea20a0fdb7a7cfa4ac78e4	2024-10-23T23:23:27-07:00	
Seoul vows response as North Korean troops head to Ukraine	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea's president said Thursday his government 'won’t sit idle' as North Korea allegedly sends troops to support Russia’s war on Ukraine, as he met with the leader of Poland to discuss expanding defense cooperation amid the ongoing conflict. The meeting between South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol and Polish President Andrzej Duda came a day after U.S. and South Korean officials said they believe around 3,000 North Korean troops have been deployed to Russia and are training at several locations. South Korea’s spy agency told lawmakers that North Korea likely aims to send a total of 10,000 troops to Russia by the end of the year. Both Moscow and Pyongyang have denied the presence of North Korean troops. 'We agreed that North Korea’s troop deployment to Russia, which is in direct violation of the U.N. charter and U.N. Security Council resolutions, is a provocation that threatens global security,' Yoon said after the summit. Yoon said South Korea will work with allies and partners to prepare countermeasures that could be rolled out in stages depending on the degree of military cooperation between Pyongyang and Moscow. Yoon’s office said earlier this week that South Korea is considering various diplomatic, economic and military options, including supplying Ukraine with both defensive and offensive weapons systems. South Korea, a growing arms exporter, has provided humanitarian aid and other non-lethal support to Ukraine and supported U.S.-led economic sanctions against Moscow. But Seoul hasn’t directly provided Ukraine with arms, citing a long-standing policy of not supplying weapons to countries actively engaged in conflict. Tensions on the Korean Peninsula have worsened since 2022 after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un used Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as a distraction to accelerate the growth of his nuclear weapons and missile program. Seoul also worries as experts say the North may seek major technology transfers in return for sending troops, including Russian know-how on intercontinental ballistic missiles and submarines that would advance the threat posed by Kim’s nuclear arsenal. During their summit, Yoon and Duda agreed to 'actively support' additional deliveries of South Korean military equipment to Poland, including a new deal for Korean K-2 tanks the governments hope to finalize within this year, Yoon’s office said. Poland has signed a series of arms deals with South Korea in the last two years to acquire tanks, howitzers and missile launchers in an effort to bolster its military capabilities following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.	https://apnews.com/article/south-korea-poland-yoon-duda-north-korea-russia-troop-deployment-2435e6ab2b795edf5b7dd233b93b69dd	2024-10-23T22:58:51-07:00	
Climate-threatened Pacific Islands criticize Australia at Commonwealth meeting	APIA, Samoa (AP) — Several Pacific island nations singled out Australia to do more to phase out fossil fuel exports during the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting which opened in Samoa on Thursday. Tuvalu’s Prime Minister, Feleti Teo, alongside senior officials from Vanuatu and Fiji, backed a new report from the Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty Initiative, which highlights the significant role Australia, Canada and the U.K. play in global emissions. The report said that fossil fuels extracted in the three nations were responsible for 60% of emissions generated by such extraction across Commonwealth countries since 1990, even though they represent only 6% of the Commonwealth’s population. The report’s findings also point to a 'stark imbalance in fossil fuel extraction' and criticize the contradictions between the climate pledges made by these countries and their ongoing efforts to expand fossil fuel production, especially in Australia and Canada. Pacific leaders have long warned that continued fossil fuel reliance threatens the very existence of their nations, many of which consist of low-lying islands that could be partly or wholly submerged by rising sea levels. Teo, who earlier this year ratified a treaty with Australia to strengthen migration and security ties between the two countries as well as climate change mitigation, intensified his calls for Australia to phase out fossil fuel production, warning that current policies by major polluters amount to a 'death sentence' for his nation. 'My view of that commitment is that Australia … is highly morally obliged to ensure that whatever action it does will not compromise the commitment it has provided in terms of climate impact,' Teo said at a press conference in Apia, the capital of Samoa. 'On that platform I’m hoping we’ll be able to leverage Australia’s support and hopefully that will translate into reducing emission levels.' Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong, who is also in Samoa, said Australia is tackling the 'big task' of transitioning its economy to net zero emissions, but cannot be held responsible for emissions from coal and gas exported to other countries. Wong said that the 'vast majority' of new coal-fired power plants are being built in China and other developing nations. 'Australia has to reduce its emissions, but the whole world — if we are going to combat sea level rise, temperature rising — the whole world will have to peak and reduce emissions,' she said on Thursday. It’s the first time a Pacific Island has hosted the biennial leaders’ summit and climate change is expected to occupy much of the summit’s agenda. More than half of the Commonwealth’s members are small countries like Samoa, many of them island nations among the world’s most imperiled by rising seas.	https://apnews.com/article/commonwealth-heads-of-government-meeting-samoa-climate-australia-charles-8bcc1ad88de45d9d8b266d929af5d261	2024-10-23T22:37:31-07:00	
Turkey strikes Kurdish militant targets in Syria and Iraq for a second day	ANKARA, Turkey (AP) — Turkey struck suspected Kurdish militant targets in Syria and Iraq for a second day on Thursday following an attack on the premises of a key defense company which killed at least five people, the state-run news agency reported. The National Intelligence Organization targeted numerous 'strategic locations' used by the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, PKK, or by Syrian Kurdish militia that are affiliated with the militants, the Anadolu Agency reported. The targets included military, intelligence, energy and infrastructure facilities and ammunition depots, the report said. A security official said armed drones were used in Thursday’s strikes. On Wednesday, Turkey's air force carried out airstrikes against similar targets in northern Syria and northern Iraq, hours after government officials blamed the deadly attack at the headquarters of the aerospace and defense company TUSAS, on the PKK. More than 30 targets were destroyed in the aerial offensive, the defense ministry said. The assailants — a man and a woman — arrived at the TUSAS premises in the outskirts of Ankara in a taxi they commandeered after killing its driver, reports said. Armed with assault riffles, they set off explosives and opened fire, killing four people at TUSAS, including a security personnel and a mechanical engineer. Security teams were dispatched as soon as the attack started at around 3:30 pm, the interior minister said. The two assailants were also killed and more than 20 people were injured in the attack. There was no immediate statement from the PKK on the attack or the Turkish airstrikes. In Syria, the main U.S.-backed force said Turkish strikes in the north of the country killed 12 civilians and wounded 25. The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces said Turkish warplanes and drones struck bakeries, power stations, oil facilities and local police checkpoints. TUSAS designs, manufactures and assembles civilian and military aircraft, unmanned aerial vehicles and other defense industry and space systems. Its defense systems have been credited as key to Turkey gaining an upper hand in its fight against Kurdish militants. The attack occurred a day after the leader of Turkey’s far-right nationalist party that’s allied with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan raised the possibility that the PKK’s imprisoned leader could be granted parole if he renounces violence and disbands his organization. Abdullah Ocalan’s group has been fighting for autonomy in southeast Turkey in a conflict that has killed tens of thousands of people since the 1980s. It is considered a terrorist group by Turkey and its Western allies. __ Associated Press writer Bassem Mroue contributed from Beirut.	https://apnews.com/article/turkey-strikes-pkk-targets-syria-iraq-8b8c5e09716e2d3e3a29809b4082854d	2024-10-23T22:18:35-07:00

Stock market today: Wall Street finishes mixed after Tesla soars and IBM slumps	NEW YORK (AP) — Wall Street drifted to a mixed finish Thursday after Tesla surged to one of the best days in its history, while IBM slumped to its worst in six months. The S&amp;P 500 rose 0.2% to break its first three-day losing streak since early September. It bounced between losses and gains through the day, and it was roughly evenly split between stocks rising and falling. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 140 points, or 0.3%, while the Nasdaq composite rose 0.8%. Tesla led the market with a jump of 21.9% after the electric-vehicle maker reported better profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. An optimistic CEO Elon Musk also predicted 20% to 30% sales growth next year, though its revenue for the latest quarter fell short of analysts’ forecasts. It was the best day for Tesla’s stock since 2013. UPS climbed 5.3% after likewise topping analysts’ forecasts for profit. The package-delivery company’s finances can offer a window into the strength of the economy because of how many different types of customers it serves, and its revenue edged past expectations. ServiceNow, whose platform helps companies automate and connect processes, was another one of the strongest forces pushing upward the S&amp;P 500. It rose 5.4% after delivering stronger profit and revenue than expected, driven by interest by customers to incorporate artificial-intelligence technology. Such gains helped to offset a drop of 6.2% for IBM, which reported revenue for the latest quarter that fell just short of analysts’ expectations. It was the single biggest reason the Dow dragged behind other indexes. Boeing was another weight and sank 1.2% after its machinists voted to continue their strike, which has crippled aircraft production. More than 60% of union members who voted on the proposed contract rejected it, keeping them on the picket lines six weeks into their strike. Union Pacific dropped 4.4% after the railroad reported slightly weaker profit and revenue than expected. All told, the S&amp;P 500 rose 12.44 points to 5,809.86. The Dow dropped 140.59 to 42,374.36, and the Nasdaq composite rose 138.83 to 18,415.49. Stocks have broadly regressed this week after the S&amp;P 500 and Dow both set records at the end of last week. They’ve been hurt by rising Treasury yields in the bond market, which can make investors less willing to pay high prices for stocks. Critics had already been saying beforehand that stocks looked too expensive given how much faster their prices have risen than corporate profits. Yields have climbed as report after report has shown the U.S. economy remains stronger than expected. That’s good news for Wall Street, because it bolsters hopes the economy can escape from the worst inflation in generations without the painful recession that many had worried was inevitable. But it’s also forcing traders to ratchet back forecasts for how deeply the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates, now that it’s just as focused on keeping the economy humming as getting inflation lower. With bets diminishing on how much the Fed will ultimately cut its overnight interest rate, Treasury yields have also been given back some of their earlier declines. A report on unemployment claims Thursday offered a mixed picture on the job market. It said fewer workers applied for unemployment benefits last week, which can be a signal of relatively low layoffs. But it also said the total number of those collecting benefits rose to its highest level in almost three years. Altogether, the numbers show a slowing economy, 'but there is no sign of a crash in employment or a surge of layoffs in these data,' according to Carl Weinberg and Rubeela Farooqi at High Frequency Economics. Treasury yields, which had eased overnight, pared their losses after the release of the unemployment claims report before yo-yoing. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.20% from 4.25% late Wednesday. It’s still well above its 4.08% level from late last week. A separate preliminary report said growth in U.S. business activity may have accelerated slightly last month, as strength for companies in services industries continue to make up for weakness in manufacturing. The report from S&amp;P Global also showed a recovery in confidence as companies anticipate greater stability and certainty after the upcoming presidential election. A third report, meanwhile, said sales of new homes were stronger last month than economists expected. In stock markets abroad, indexes were modestly higher in Europe after finishing mixed in Asia. ___ AP Business Writers Matt Ott and Elaine Kurtenbach contributed.	https://apnews.com/article/stocks-markets-rates-bonds-dollar-81c830cd6d465440f3d8f4bfc12d7487	2024-10-23T19:45:25-07:00	
A melodic greeting between women in Burundi is at risk of being lost	NGOZI, Burundi (AP) — The hug between the two women looked like it would last forever. A spirited 85-year-old had embraced a younger woman she hadn’t seen for months, and she chanted a number of questions in the peculiar yodeling routine of her ancestors. How are you? How is your husband? How are the kids? How are your cows? Are you on good terms with your neighbors? And so on. Prudencienne Namukobwa paused in the melody to allow the younger woman's rhythmic affirmation, a pattern she has mastered over the decades. 'Ego,' Emelyne Nzeyimana replied over and over in the local Kirundi language. 'Yes.' A group of neighbors watched in amazement. Many were seeing their first performance of the traditional form of musical greeting, known to Burundians as akazehe. It is performed exclusively by women on a range of occasions. But akazehe is fading, despite its unique status in this central African country that is better known for its world-famous percussionists. That's according to cultural officials, teachers and others who say the practice is worth preserving. They cited the threat from public health measures that discourage unnecessary contact during disease outbreaks, in addition to the perceived failure to promote akazehe among school-going youth. Among young Burundians, it is hard to find people who know what akazehe means and even harder to find someone who can perform it. 'At a certain time, unfortunately, it was abandoned,' said Sandrine Kitonze, a culture advisor in the office of the governor of Ngozi province. She said akazehe and its minutes-long embrace 'made you feel that the person who greets you loves you.' Some academics have noted akazehe’s potential role in fostering social cohesion in Burundi, which is now largely peaceful after a period of deadly civil war followed by political instability. Annonciate Baragahorana, a teacher in the province of Bujumbura, which includes the commercial capital, told The Associated Press that while she was not born in a place where akazehe was widely practiced, she was astonished as a young girl when women embraced and addressed her in the polyphonic way during visits to other regions. 'The women who often did this lived in the central plateau provinces. When we went there during the holidays, a woman from the interior of the country kissed you strongly while wishing you wonders and she hugged you for a long time,' she said with a chuckle. 'I wanted her to finish quickly, even if it was sweet words to hear.' Baragahorana said she feared 'tenderness in social relationships will disappear' among Burundians amid threats from contagious diseases such as COVID-19 and Mpox. 'People greet each other from a distance for fear of contaminating each other,' she said. 'This will contribute enormously to the demise of akazehe.' In Ngozi, a hilly province in Burundi’s north, akazehe remains familiar to some locals, and women such as Namukobwa are impressive at performing it. She lives in a decaying house set in the side of a verdant hill. One recent morning, she was sitting on a mat outside when she glimpsed Nzeyimana, the visiting daughter of a former neighbor. She overcame her bad hip to rise and welcome the woman, whom she addressed as if she were her biological daughter. 'I felt that the first love she had when I was just a girl is kept until now,' said Nzeyimana, a broadcaster in Ngozi. 'This means that I am still her daughter.' Akazehe can seem like a race to perfect accord, a search for harmony, in the interwoven vocalizations. While most questions are routine, some can be unexpected. Nzeyimana said afterward that she had been anxious over possibly facing a question for which she was not ready with a positive response. There was none. Serena Facci, an Italian scholar at the University of Rome Tor Vergata who has written about akazehe, said that even by 1993, when she went to Burundi for research in ethnomusicology, 'this beautiful female greeting wasn't very common in the ordinary life.' Its continuing disappearance could be due to changing lifestyles, she said. A custom such as akazehe should be preserved at all costs because of its role in protecting families, said Isaac Nikobiba, an anthropologist in Bujumbura. Among communities that practiced it, women could alert mother figures to any turbulence at home, triggering supportive measures from the extended family, he said. Nikobiba called the potential disappearance of akazehe symptomatic of wider cultural losses stemming from modernization. 'Normally, before starting a home in traditional Burundi, the girl would first receive advice from her paternal aunt who would tell her, ‘I will come to greet you after a certain time. If you notice an anomaly in the home, you will have to tell me everything,’' he said. 'In short, if she does not find someone to whom she can confide her marital intimacies, she spends all the time in a very bad psychological atmosphere.' Floride Ntakirutimana was among the small group of women who gathered to witness the spectacle of Namukobwa greeting Nzeyimana. She said she grew up in a farming community where no mother could perform akazehe, and only heard of it through radio programs. The exchange she watched left her feeling she wanted to learn akazehe herself. 'I feel better, and I saw that it was good,' Ntakirutimana said. ___ The Associated Press receives financial support for global health and development coverage in Africa from the Gates Foundation.

Massive displacement from Israel-Hezbollah war transforms Beirut’s famed commercial street	BEIRUT (AP) — Inside what was once one of Beirut’s oldest and best-known cinemas, dozens of Lebanese, Palestinians and Syrians displaced by the Israel-Hezbollah war spend their time following the news on their phones, cooking, chatting and walking around to pass the time. Outside on Hamra Street, once a thriving economic hub, sidewalks are filled with displaced people, and hotels and apartments are crammed with those seeking shelter. Cafes and restaurants are overflowing. In some ways, the massive displacement of hundreds of thousands of people from south Lebanon, the eastern Bekaa Valley and Beirut’s southern suburbs has provided a boost for this commercial district after years of decline as a result of Lebanon’s economic crisis. But it is not the revival many had hoped for. 'The displacement revived Hamra Street in a wrong way,' said the manager of a four-star hotel on the boulevard, who requested anonymity to speak candidly about the problems the influx has caused for the neighborhood. For three weeks after the war intensified in mid-September, his hotel enjoyed full occupancy. Today, it stands at about 65% capacity — still good for this time of year — after some left for cheaper rented apartments. But, he said, the flow of displaced people has also brought chaos. Traffic congestion, double parking and motorcycles and scooters scattered on sidewalks has become the norm, making it difficult for pedestrians to walk. Tensions regularly erupt between displaced people and the district’s residents, he said. Hamra Street has long been a bellwether for Lebanon’s turbulent politics. During the country's heyday in the 1960s and early 1970s, it represented everything that was glamorous, filled with Lebanon’s top movie houses and theaters, cafes frequented by intellectuals and artists, and ritzy shops. Over the past decades, the street has witnessed rises and falls depending on the situation in the small Mediterranean nation that has been marred by repeated bouts of instability, including a 15-year civil war that ended in 1990. In 1982, Israeli tanks rolled down Hamra Street after Israel invaded the country, reaching all the way to west Beirut. In recent years, the district was transformed by an influx of Syrian refugees fleeing the war in the neighboring nation, and businesses were hammered by the country’s financial collapse, which began in 2019. Israel dramatically escalated its attacks on parts of Lebanon on Sept. 23, killing nearly 500 people and wounding 1,600 in one day after nearly a year of skirmishes along the Lebanon-Israel border between Israeli troops and the militant Hezbollah group. The intensified attacks sparked an exodus of people fleeing the bombardment, including many who slept in public squares, on beaches or pavements around Beirut. More than 2,574 people have been killed in Lebanon and over 12,000 wounded in the past year of war, according to the country's Health Ministry, and around 1.2 million people are displaced. Many have flooded Hamra, a cosmopolitan and diverse area, with some moving in with relatives or friends and others headed to hotels and schools turned into shelters. In recent days several empty buildings were stormed by displaced people, who were forced to leave by security forces after confrontations that sometimes turned violent. Mohamad Rayes, a member of the Hamra Traders Association, said before the influx of displaced people, some businesses were planning to close because of financial difficulties. 'It is something that cannot be imagined,' Rayes said about the flow of displaced people boosting commerce in Hamra in ways unseen in years. He said some traders even doubled prices because of high demand. At a cellular shop, Farouk Fahmy said during the first two weeks his sales increased 70%, with people who fled their homes mostly buying chargers and internet data to follow the news. 'The market is stagnant again now,' Fahmy said. Since many fled their homes with few belongings, men's and women's underwear and pajama sales grew by 300% at the small boutique business owned by Hani, who declined to give his full name for safety reasons. The 60-year-old movie theatre, Le Colisee, a landmark on Hamra Street, had been closed for more than two decades until earlier this year when Lebanese actor Kassem Istanbouli, founder of the Lebanese National Theater, took over and began renovating it. With the massive tide of displacement, he transformed it into a shelter for families who fled their homes in south Lebanon. Istanbouli, who has theaters in the southern port city of Tyre and the northern city of Tripoli, Lebanon’s second-largest, has turned all three into shelters where people, no matter their nationality, can take refuge. This week, displaced people in the Beirut movie theater sat on thin mattresses on its red carpeting, checking their phones and reading. Some were helping with the theater's renovation work. Among them was Abdul-Rahman Mansour, a Syrian citizen, along with his three brothers and their Palestinian-Lebanese mother, Joumana Hanafi. Mansour said they fled Tyre after a rocket attack near their home, taking shelter at a school in the coastal city of Sidon, where they were allowed to stay since their mother is a Lebanese citizen. When the shelter’s management found out that Mansour and his brothers were Syrian they had to leave because only Lebanese citizens were allowed. With no place to stay, they returned to Tyre. 'We slept for a night in Tyre, but I hope you never witness such a night,' Hanafi said of the intensity of the bombardment. She said one of her sons knew Istanbouli and contacted him. 'We told him, ‘Before anything, we are Syrians.’ He said, ‘It is a shame that you have to say that.’' Istanbouli spends hours a day at his theaters in Beirut and Tripoli to be close to the displaced people sheltering there. 'Normally people used to come here to watch a movie. Today we are all at the theater and the movie is being played outside,' Istanbouli said of the ongoing war.	https://apnews.com/article/lebanon-israel-hezbollah-displaced-hamra-beirut-582c617d6d3b8639c8c8ddec4a6916b7	2024-10-23T19:17:01-07:00	
The Paris conference for Lebanon raises $1 billion in pledges for humanitarian and military support	PARIS (AP) — An international conference for Lebanon in Paris on Thursday raised $1 billion in pledges for humanitarian aid and military support to help the country where war between Hezbollah militants and Israel has displaced a million people, killed over 2,500, and deepened an economic crisis, French organizers said. In his closing speech, France's foreign minister Jean-Noël Barrot said : 'We have collectively raised $800 million in humanitarian aid and $200 million for the security forces, that’s about $1 billion.' The Paris conference gathered over 70 nations and international organizations. French President Emmanuel Macron had called on participants to bring 'massive aid' to support the country, as France promised $100 million. 'We’re up to the challenge,' Barrot said. The United States pledged to provide about $300 million, he added. Germany pledged a total of 96 million euros in humanitarian aid to both Lebanon and neighboring Syria, also deeply affected by escalating violence in the Middle East. Italy announced this week an additional 10 million euros ($10.8 million) in aid for Lebanon. The United Nations had previously estimated the urgent humanitarian needs in Lebanon to be $426 million. However, experts warn that delivering aid could be challenging as Lebanon’s growing dependence on informal and cash economy increases lack of transparency and corruption risks. Strengthening Lebanon’s armed forces The Paris conference also aimed at coordinating international support to strengthen Lebanon’s armed forces so they can deploy in the country’s south as part of a potential deal to end the war. Such a deal could see Hezbollah withdraw its forces from the border. This support to the Lebanese military includes 'helping with health care, fuel, small equipment, but also supporting the plan to recruit at least 6,000 additional soldiers and to enable the deployment of at least 8,000 additional soldiers in the south,' Macron said. Paris also seeks to help restore Lebanon's sovereignty and strengthen its institutions. The country, where Hezbollah effectively operates as a state within a state, has been without a president for two years while political factions fail to agree on a new one. U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres, in a pre-recorded video, called on Lebanon’s leaders 'to take decisive action to ensure the proper functioning of state institutions in order to meet the country’s urgent political and security challenges.' Lebanese prime mister urges international action Acting Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati urged the international community to take action. 'The devastating impact of this war on our nation cannot be overstated, and it has left a trail of destruction and misery in its wake. The Israelis' aggression has not only caused immense human suffering and loss of lives, but also inflicted severe damage to the country’s infrastructure, economy and social fabric,' Mikati said Thursday in Paris. In Lebanon, an Israeli airstrike killed early Thursday three Lebanese soldiers, including an officer, as they were evacuating wounded people in southern Lebanon. The Lebanese army said Israeli forces have targeted it on eight occasions since an all-out war broke out between Israel and Hezbollah in September. The Israeli army apologized for a strike on Sunday that it said mistakenly killed three soldiers, and on Wednesday said it was looking into whether 'a number of soldiers of the Lebanese army were accidentally harmed' after it targeted what it says was Hezbollah infrastructure. Israel in the past month has launched a major aerial bombardment and ground invasion of Lebanon as it says it's targeting Hezbollah, with strikes hitting the capital, Beirut, and elsewhere. The International Organization for Migration has said about 800,000 people are displaced, with many now in overcrowded shelters, while others have fled across the border into Syria. Mikati on Thursday estimated the number of displaced people is over 1.4 million, including 500,000 children. A government ill-prepared to deal with the crisis The cash-strapped Lebanese government is ill-prepared to deal with the crisis or the increased demands on its health system. Several have been evacuated because of nearby airstrikes and fears that they might be targeted. Lebanon's army has been hit hard by five years of economic crisis. It has an aging arsenal and no air defenses, leaving it in no position to defend against Israeli incursions or confront Hezbollah. The Lebanese army has about 80,000 troops, around 5,000 of them deployed in the south. Hezbollah has more than 100,000 fighters, according to the militant group’s late leader, Hassan Nasrallah. The militant group's arsenal, built with support from Iran, is more advanced. Supporting U.N. peacekeeping forces Conference participants discussed how to support the 10,500-soldier-strong U.N. peacekeeping mission, UNIFIL. European nations including France, Italy and Spain provide a third of its troops. Italy, which has over 1,000 troops in UNIFIL, is pushing for the peacekeeping force to be strengthened to 'be able to face the new situation' on the ground, an Italian diplomat said, speaking anonymously to discuss ongoing talks. Guterres said Thursday that 'attacks on U.N. peacekeepers are totally unacceptable and are contrary to international law, contrary to international humanitarian law and may constitute a war crime.' France’s historic links with Lebanon, a former colony, and its influential diplomacy give Paris momentum to coordinate 'a proper response to the massive challenge that the war in Lebanon now poses,' said Middle East expert Rym Montaz, editor-in-chief of Carnegie Europe’s blog Strategic Europe. 'What we do know is that without a strengthened Lebanese armed forces and UNIFIL, there can be no sustainable peace and stability at the border between Lebanon and Israel,' Montaz said. 'As such, the French efforts are important and crucial for the way forward.' ___ AP writers Geir Moulson in Berlin, Germany and Abby Sewell in Beirut, Lebanon, contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/middle-east-lebanon-conference-paris-humanitarian-aid-30a97f88d2ec8dc138385d18a31dbb69	2024-10-23T19:15:58-07:00	
Tropical storm battering Philippines leaves at least 24 people dead in flooding and landslides	MANILA, Philippines (AP) — Widespread flooding and landslides set off by a tropical storm in the northeastern Philippines on Thursday left at least 24 people dead, swept away cars and prompted authorities to scramble for motorboats to rescue trapped villagers, some on roofs. The government shut down schools and offices — except those urgently needed for disaster response — for the second day on the entire main island of Luzon to protect millions of people after Tropical Storm Trami slammed into the country’s northeastern province of Isabela after midnight. The storm was blowing over Aguinaldo town in the mountain province of Ifugao after dawn with sustained winds up to 95 kph (59 mph) and gusts up to 160 kph (99 mph). It was blowing westward and was forecast to enter the South China Sea later on Thursday, according to state forecasters. At least 24 people died, mostly due to drowning in the hard-hit Bicol region and nearby Quezon province but the toll was expected to rise as towns and villages isolated by flooding and roads blocked by landslides and toppled trees manage to send out reports, police and provincial officials said. Most of the storm deaths were reported in the six-province Bicol region, southeast of Manila, where at least 20 people died, including 7 residents in Naga city, which was inundated by flash floods as Trami was approaching Tuesday, dumping more than two months’ worth of rainfall in just 24 hours at high tide, regional police chief Brig. Gen. Andre Dizon and other officials said. While thousands of villagers, who were trapped in floodwaters, have been rescued by government forces, many more needed to be saved Thursday in the Bicol region, including some on roofs. About 1,500 police officers have been deployed for disaster-mitigation work, Dizon said. 'We can’t rescue them all at once because there are so many and we need additional motorboats,' Dizon told The Associated Press by telephone. 'We’re looking for ways to deliver food and water to those who were trapped but could not be evacuated right away.' Flash floods swept away and submerged cars in some parts of Naga city while mudflows from Mayon, one of the country’s 24 active volcanoes, in nearby Albay province, engulfed several vehicles, Dizon said. Stormy weather remained in the region, hampering relief efforts, officials said. The government’s disaster-mitigation agency said more than 2 million people were affected by the storm, including 75,400 villagers who were displaced from their homes and are sheltering on safer ground. About 20 storms and typhoons batter the Philippines each year. In 2013, Typhoon Haiyan, one of the strongest recorded tropical cyclones in the world, left more than 7,300 people dead or missing and flattened entire villages.	https://apnews.com/article/tropical-storm-trami-philippines-85a28c058b1f4685033ab02d34782acf	2024-10-23T17:45:24-07:00	
Trash carried by a North Korean balloon again falls on the presidential compound in Seoul	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — Trash carried by a North Korean balloon fell on the presidential compound in central Seoul on Thursday, officials said, the second such case in recent months that raise concerns about the vulnerability of key South Korean sites during potential North Korean aggression. The incident comes after the rival Koreas ramped up threats and rhetoric against each other over North Korea’s claims that South Korea flew drones over its capital Pyongyang to scatter propaganda leaflets this month. South Korea’s presidential security service said in a statement that one of the balloons floated by North Korea burst over the South Korean presidential compound on Thursday morning, dropping rubbish on the ground. No dangerous items were found. North Korea has sent trash-carrying balloons into South Korea since late May in a resumption of a Cold War-style psychological campaign. The trash that fell on the South Korean presidential compound in July contained no dangerous material and no one was hurt. It wasn’t immediately known whether South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol was at the compound during the latest incident. His schedule showed he was due to meet with visiting Polish President Andrzej Duda at his office later Thursday. South Korea’s Dong-A Ilbo newspaper reported earlier Thursday on its website that North Korea’s latest balloons contained propaganda leaflets criticizing Yoon and his wife Kim Keon Hee along with trash. The newspapers said the leaflets were scattered in areas in Seoul’s Yongsan district, where Yoon’s presidential office is located, and noted that North Korea has recently begun using GPS technology to drop balloons more accurately in intended locations. The South Korean presidential security service didn't immediately confirm the report. Experts say North Korea likely lacks sophisticated technology to drop balloons on specific targets. 'Whether the balloons have GPS or not, it’s all about launching them in large numbers and hitting the right altitude based on wind direction and speed, so that they can ride those winds to travel,' Lee Choon Geun, an honorary research fellow at South Korea’s Science and Technology Policy Institute, said. 'While some media are saying the accuracy of the balloons has improved, that improved accuracy isn’t because they equipped them with some sort of guidance system, but rather because it’s the season when winds blow southward,' Lee said. North Korea has earlier accused South Korea of infiltrating drones to drop propaganda leaflets over Pyongyang three times this month and threatened military responses if it happened again. South Korea has refused to confirm whether it sent drones but warned that North Korea would face the end of its regime if the safety of South Korean citizens is threatened. North Korea said its balloon activities were response to South Korean activists launching anti-Pyongyang leaflets via their own balloons. South Korea responded by restarting propaganda loudspeaker broadcasts at border areas, prompting North Korea to turn on their own frontline loudspeakers. The Koreas' Cold War-style campaigns come as North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has increased the pace of his weapons tests and expanded military cooperation with Russia. U.S. and South Korean officials said Wednesday that 3,000 North Korean troops have been deployed to Russia and are training at several locations. South Korean officials say North Korea eventually aims to send a total of 10,000 troops to Russia to support its war efforts in Ukraine. South Korea is concerned that Russia may reward North Korea by giving it sophisticated technologies that could improve the North's nuclear and missile programs that target South Korea and its allies.	https://apnews.com/article/koreas-tensions-trash-balloon-presidential-compound-3ab04d8a582e1760d01c2783c2d50b30	2024-10-23T15:29:19-07:00	
Israel accuses 6 Al Jazeera journalists in Gaza of being Palestinian militants	RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) — The Israeli army on Wednesday accused six Al Jazeera journalists covering the war in Gaza of also being current or former paid fighters for Palestinian militant groups. Al Jazeera rejected the claims. Israel cited documents it purportedly found in Gaza, and other intelligence it gathered, in making the accusations against the journalists, all of whom are Palestinian men. It said four are or have been affiliated with Hamas, and two with Palestinian Islamic Jihad. Al Jazeera said the accusations were 'fabricated' and 'part of a wider pattern of hostility' toward the pan-Arab network. It said the claims were 'a blatant attempt to silence the few remaining journalists in the region, thereby obscuring the harsh realities of the war from audiences worldwide.' The Associated Press has been unable to independently verify the authenticity of the documents Israel posted online to support its claims. Al Jazeera is based in the energy-rich nation of Qatar, where many senior Hamas officials are based. The Gulf Arab country, which funds Al Jazeera, also has been a key player in Gaza cease-fire negotiations, along with the U.S. and Egypt. Al Jazeera journalists Anas al-Sharif, Hossam Shabat, Ismael Abu Omar, and Talal Arrouki were accused by Israel of ties to Hamas. Ashraf Saraj and Alaa Salameh were accused of ties to Islamic Jihad. The men have held various roles, according to documents Israel cited -- sniper, infantry soldier, fighter, captain, training coordinator and 'propaganda.' The Committee to Protect Journalists released a statement on Wednesday that was critical of Israel, which it said 'has repeatedly made similar unproven claims without producing credible evidence.' In July, after an Israeli airstrike in Gaza City killed two Al Jazeera journalists, including Ismail Al Ghoul, Israel 'produced a similar document, which contained contradictory information, showing that Al Ghoul, born in 1997, received a Hamas military ranking in 2007 – when he would have been 10 years old,' the committee said in its statement. Militants from Hamas and Islamic Jihad led last year's attack on Israel that killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took some 250 hostages into Gaza. They have been fighting alongside each other against Israeli troops in Gaza for the past year. In January, Israel detailed allegations against 12 employees of a United Nations agency that it says were involved in the Hamas attack on Israel last year that ignited the war in Gaza. The U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, or UNRWA, subsequently fired at least 21 staffers for their roles in the attack. UNRWA has been the main supplier of food, water and shelter to civilians in Gaza during the war. Four Al Jazeera journalists have been killed by Israeli strikes in Gaza over the past 12 months, according to the network. Several of the dead later have been accused by Israel of being members of either Hamas or Islamic Jihad, accusations rejected by the Qatari outlet. In May, after an Israeli court ordered the closure of Al Jazeera's operations and broadcasts within Israel, police raided a hotel room in East Jerusalem from where the network had been broadcasting live images. It was the first time Israel had ever shuttered a foreign news outlet. Four months later, Israel raided Al Jazeera's office in the Palestinian-governed West Bank city of Ramallah, shutting down the bureau there. Several of those named by Israel on Wednesday, including al-Sharif, have become mainstay figures of the outlet's 24-hour live coverage of Gaza. They have acquired celebrity-like status among Palestinians and in other countries across the Middle East. Al Jazeera is one of a handful of news organizations still broadcasting daily from the besieged enclave. The documents and intelligence Israel released Wednesday purportedly show the rank, role, enlistment date, and battalion of each of the six Al Jazeera journalists. At least 128 journalists have been killed in Gaza, the West Bank, Israel, and Lebanon since last October, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. They include 123 Palestinians, two Israelis and three Lebanese. Israel has killed more than 42,000 Palestinians in Gaza since the war began, according to the local health ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and militants but says more than half of the dead are women and children. Even before the war, tensions between Al Jazeera and Israel ran high. Israeli forces shot and killed Shireen Abu Akleh, a Palestinian-American journalist, in May 2022 as she reported on a story in the West Bank. Israel isn't the only critic of Al Jazeera. The U.S. singled out the broadcaster during its occupation of Iraq after its 2003 invasion toppled dictator Saddam Hussein, and for airing videos of the late al-Qaida chief Osama bin Laden, who orchestrated the Sept. 11, 2001 attack against the U.S. Al Jazeera has been closed or blocked by other governments in the Middle East. In 2013, Egyptian authorities seeking to crush mass protests against President Mohammed Morsi raided a luxury hotel used by Al Jazeera. ___ Gambrell reported from Dubai, United Arab Emirates.	https://apnews.com/article/al-jazeera-journalists-hamas-islamic-jihad-israel-983215f9904bffa7f3d5518235e19e86	2024-10-23T12:54:25-07:00	
Some Liberal lawmakers ask Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau not to run for a fourth term	TORONTO (AP) — Some lawmakers in Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's own Liberal Party asked the leader not to run for a fourth term Wednesday, handing him one of the biggest tests of his political career. Three Liberal members of Parliament said they were among a total of 20 plus lawmakers from the party to have signed a letter asking Trudeau to step down before the next election. There are 153 Liberals in Canada's House of Commons. 'He has to start listening, listening to the people,' said Ken McDonald, a Liberal Member of Parliament from Newfoundland who said he signed the letter, which has not been made public. McDonald, who is not running again, said some of his colleagues who plan on running are nervous because of poor polling numbers. Also stating publicly that they had signed the letter were Wayne Long of New Brunswick and Sean Casey of Prince Edward Island. Trudeau, who previously has said he plans to run again, met with Liberal lawmakers for three hours on Wednesday. 'The Liberal party is strong and united,' a smiling Trudeau said to reporters after the meeting ended. Liberals later applauded loudly for Trudeau when he addressed the House of Commons. Trudeau thanked them. His Cabinet ministers have supported him publicly. 'There is what would you call some palace drama going on right now. And that takes us away from the number one job, which is focusing on Canadians,' said Employment Minister Randy Boissonnault, a Liberal Party member. Immigration Minister Marc Miller, also a Liberal and a close friend of Trudeau, said Tuesday that anonymous griping about the prime minister was 'garbage,' but he softened his language on Wednesday as he left the meeting early. 'This is something that I think has been simmering for some time and it's important for people to get it out,' Miller said. 'What happened in there, although it will remain confidential, is really about Members of Parliament telling the prime minister the truth whether he likes to hear it or not.' Charles Sousa, a member of Parliament for a suburban Toronto area, said Trudeau is reflecting. 'Trudeau made it very clear that he feels he’s the right choice but he appreciates all of what is being said,' Sousa said. 'I respect his decision, whatever that may be.' Ontario Liberal lawmaker John McKay called the meeting a candid conversation and said it was up to Trudeau whether he would remain leader. Trudeau's Liberals recently suffered upsets in special elections in two districts in Toronto and Montreal that the party has held for years, raising doubts about Trudeau’s leadership. The federal election could come any time between this fall and October 2025. The Liberals must rely on the support of at least one major party in Parliament as they don't have the majority of seats. The opposition leader of the Bloc Québécois has said his party will work with the Conservatives and the New Democratic Party, of NDP, to bring the Liberals down and force an election if the government doesn’t boost pensions for seniors. Tall and trim, Trudeau channeled the star power of his father in 2015 when he reasserted the country’s liberal identity in 2015 after almost 10 years of Conservative rule. But the son of late Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau is now in trouble. Canadians have been frustrated by the cost of living coming out of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Liberals trail the opposition Conservatives 38% to 25% in the latest Nanos poll. The poll of 1,037 respondents has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points. 'The electoral prospects of the Liberals with Justin Trudeau at the helm look bleak,' said Daniel Béland, a politics professor at McGill University in Montreal. Trudeau’s legacy includes opening the doors wide to immigration. He also legalized cannabis and brought in a carbon tax intended to fight climate change. 'He saved the Liberals back in 2015 but, over time, he’s become a huge liability for them,' Béland said.	https://apnews.com/article/trudeau-canada-revolt-election-d60161f9b6e83e97864e9d78623e2260	2024-10-23T09:46:33-07:00	
Officials say North Korea has sent troops to Russia. What would that mean for the war with Ukraine?	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — U.S. and South Korean officials said Wednesday that there’s evidence North Korea has dispatched troops to Russia in a potential escalation of the nearly 3-year-old war with Ukraine. If the soldiers' goal is fighting with Russia in Ukraine, it would be the first time a third country puts boots on the ground in the war. Other countries on both sides of the divide have sent military aid, including weapons and training: Iran has supplied Russia with drones, and Western nations have provided Ukraine with modern weapons and financial and humanitarian assistance. South Korea’s spy chief told lawmakers that 3,000 North Korean troops are being trained to use equipment including drones before being they're sent to fight in Ukraine. U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin told reporters during a visit to Rome that 'we are seeing evidence that there are North Korean troops' that have gone to Russia. 'What exactly they’re doing — left to be seen,' Austin said. Neither Austin nor South Korean National Intelligence Service Director Cho Tae-yong provided details about how they knew about the North Korean troops, and many questions remain about the impact of North Korea’s participation. What do we know about the North Koreans? Ukraine’s Military Intelligence Directorate head, Kyrylo Budanov, told the online military news outlet 'The War Zone' on Tuesday that North Korean troops were arriving in Russia’s Kursk region as early as Wednesday to help Russian troops fight off a Ukrainian border incursion. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told reporters on Monday that North Korean officers and technical personnel have already been spotted in Russian-occupied territories. He did not specify when. 'I believe they sent officers first to assess the situation before deploying troops,' Zelenskyy said. He has cautioned that the participation of a third country could escalate the conflict into a 'world war' and Austin said that it would be a 'very, very serious issue' if Pyongyang indeed did join the war on Russia’s side. What is Ukraine doing? Ukraine is preparing as though combating North Korea in its territory will be inevitable. An injection of 10,000 North Korean troops, which is what both Ukrainian and South Korean intelligence have claimed, 'could significantly destabilize Ukraine’s defense there and greatly accelerate the advancement of Russian forces,' said Glib Voloskyi, an analyst from a Ukrainian think tank, Come Back Alive Initiatives Center. Ukraine’s 'I Want to Live' project, a hotline encouraging Russian soldiers to surrender, published a video in Korean on Wednesday calling for North Korean soldiers to give up. 'We call for the soldiers of the Korean People’s Army, who were sent to help the Putin regime. You should not die senselessly on someone else’s land. There is no need to repeat the fate of hundreds of thousands of Russian soldiers who will never return home!' How is the West reacting? Zelenskyy told reporters Monday that the European Union and the U.S. have been cautious in publicly addressing North Korean troops fighting alongside Russia – describing their reactions as 'very restrained.' German and U.K. officials also weighed in, with South Korea hinting that it could support Ukraine with military weapons in the event of North Korea’s confirmed involvement. 'We don’t even know whether we are talking about 1,500 or 12,000 or which kind of soldiers are coming to Russia and to fight where and against,' German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius said. 'It’s a kind of escalation and it shows us a very important, a very important aspect. International conflicts are approaching very rapidly.' U.K. Defense Secretary John Healey said there was 'not just a concern about the potential for an escalation of conflict in Europe. There is an indivisible link with security concerns in the Indo-Pacific as well.' Why does Russia need North Korea? North Korea and Russia, both in separate confrontations with the West, have deepened their military cooperation in the last two years. In June, they signed a defense deal requiring both countries to provide military assistance if the other is attacked. For analysts, the introduction of troops would be a sign that the war isn’t going as Russia planned. 'I think Ukraine is wearing down the Russian army as we talk. You don’t get thousands of soldiers from North Korea if your war is going well,' said Justin Crump, a former British tank commander who heads Sibylline, a strategic advisory firm. 'You don’t require them'. North Korea has already sent over 13,000 containers of artillery, missiles and other conventional arms to Russia since August 2023 to replenish its dwindling weapons stockpiles. Those missiles are being actively used against Ukrainian targets, officials in Kyiv say. —— Associated Press reporters Hanna Arhirova and Illia Novikov contributed.

EU stays on the sidelines over migrant deal between Italy and Albania	TIRANA, Albania (AP) — A top European Union official on Wednesday refused to be drawn on an opinion of an agreement between Italy and Albania to process some migrants in centers set up in the tiny Western Balkan country, saying only that it was being closely monitored. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said that 'from the very beginning on we have been very clear that we are monitoring the development related to this agreement very closely.' Under a five-year deal signed last November by Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni and her Albanian counterpart, Edi Rama, up to 3,000 migrants picked up by the Italian coast guard in international waters each month will be sheltered in Albania. Their asylum requests will be processed there. Italy has agreed to welcome those migrants who are granted asylum, while those whose applications are rejected face deportation directly from Albania. The first 12 migrants sheltered last week in Albanian centers were brought back to Italy three days later, following a ruling by Rome judges, who rejected their detention, arguing that their countries of origin — Bangladesh and Egypt — were not safe enough for them to be sent back. Italy’s far-right government on Monday approved a new decree aimed at overcoming judicial hurdles that risked derailing a controversial migration deal with Albania. Under the new decree — which is effective immediately — the government shortened the list of countries considered 'safe' by law, meaning that Rome can repatriate to those countries migrants who didn’t win asylum using a fast-track procedure. The court ruling was an early stumbling block to the five-year deal between Italy and Albania. Italian Premier Minister Giorgia Meloni has strongly pushed the deal, defending it as a new 'model' to handle illegal migration. In a letter to EU leaders last December, a month after the deal was signed in Rome, von der Leyen praised 'important initiatives' on restricting migration by some of the bloc’s 27 member countries, including 'the operational arrangement between Italy and Albania.' 'This serves as an example of out-of-the-box thinking, based on fair sharing of responsibilities with third countries in line with obligations under EU and international law,' she wrote. Von der Leyen was in Tirana on Monday as part of a regional tour to reassure the Western Balkan countries that the enlargement of the trade bloc remained one of its priorities. She only said that the Italy-Albania deal was 'a bilateral agreement' which the EU would not comment on but only monitor. Human rights groups and NGOs active in the Mediterranean have slammed the agreement as a dangerous precedent which conflicts with international laws. ___ Follow Llazar Semini at https://x.com/lsemini ___ Follow AP’s global migration coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/migration	https://apnews.com/article/albania-italy-migrants-centers-eu-vdl-tirana-e81b9b8d2ca65f62621216f79375d40c	2024-10-23T09:08:30-07:00	
Israeli weapon seen in rare AP photos of Beirut airstrike appears to be a powerful smart bomb	JERUSALEM (AP) — In all but the blink of an eye, an Associated Press photographer's camera captured the moments that a battleship-gray Israeli bomb plummeted toward a Beirut building before detonating to bring the tower down. The airstrike came 40 minutes after Israel warned people to evacuate two buildings in the area that it said were located near Hezbollah warehouses and assets. The site was not far from where a spokesperson for the militant group had just briefed journalists. It was a rare glimpse into the use of one of the most powerful bombs in Israel's arsenal. What kind of weapon was it? An examination by independent arms researchers suggests the weapon was a guided bomb, also known as a smart bomb, launched from an Israeli jet. The tail fin and nose sections indicate this was a 2,000-pound warhead fitted with an Israeli-made guidance kit known as SPICE, according to Richard Weir, a senior conflict, crisis and arms researcher at Human Rights Watch. SPICE — Smart, Precise-Impact and Cost-Effective — guidance systems are made by Israel’s government-owned Rafael Advanced Defense Systems. They are attached to a standard unguided bomb to direct the weapon to its target. Minutes before the strike brought down the building, there were two smaller strikes on it, in what Israel’s military often refers to as a 'knock on the roof' warning strike, according to AP journalists at the scene. The practice has been observed in Israel's military campaign in Gaza; there, over 40,000 have been killed, according to local officials who don't distinguish between civilian and combatant deaths, in one of the most destructive conflicts in recent history. The Israeli military declined to comment about the type of weapon used. Why does Israel use this type of bomb? Rafael advertises SPICE kits as being able to operate day or night, through bad weather, and in areas jammed against GPS. It says the weapons offer 'high lethality and low collateral damage' and 'pinpoint hit accuracy.' It also keeps the attacking aircraft out of harm's way. The 2,000-pound version can be launched as far as 60 kilometers (37 miles) from its target. Rafael also makes smaller versions. Once released by an attacking Israeli warplane such as an American-made F-15 or F-16, the bomb glides toward its target, adjusting course using movable fins. Joseph Dempsey, a defense and military analyst at the International Institute of Strategic Studies, agreed the photos indicated the weapon was a 2,000-pound SPICE bomb. He said the guidance system is thought to rely on GPS and what are known as electro-optical guidance systems, which use cameras or sensors to zero in on the bomb's target. The destructive nature of the weapon comes down to many factors, including the size of the warhead and the way it is fused. 'This was clearly a delayed action fuse. It buried down into the ground (and) detonated, which has the effect of limiting the fragmentation and blast damage of this particular strike,' Weir said. That explains why the destruction was limited almost entirely to the targeted building. People standing a few hundred meters away felt little to nothing from the blast and didn't see much fragmentation. Where is this bomb made? The answer isn't straightforward. 'The guidance kits for the SPICE 2000 are manufactured by Rafael in Israel, though the level of reliance on foreign sub-components is unclear,' Dempsey said. In 2019, Rafael and U.S. defense contractor Lockheed Martin signed a deal to work together to build and sell SPICE guidance kits in the U.S. At the time, the companies said production of over 60 percent of the SPICE system was spread across eight U.S. states. In late October 2023, weeks after Hamas’ deadly Oct. 7 attack, the U.S. State Department issued a letter approving the export of additional SPICE bomb assemblies to Israel. That letter, first reported by The New York Times, notified Congress that Rafael USA, an American subsidiary of the Israeli defense company, was seeking the $320 million shipment. That request was an amendment to an earlier $403 million license in 2020. The explosive warhead is a basic bomb, in this case likely a 2,000-pound MK-84 style explosive, where the nose and tail section have been swapped out for the guidance system. The U.S. earlier this year paused shipments of those powerful bombs to Israel because of concerns over civilian casualties, though Israel is believed to still have supplies in stock. It is difficult to know for sure where the bomb part was produced. Israel relies on the U.S. for supplies of MK-84 bombs, but it and other countries also produce similar weapons. Determining that with certainty would require recovering remnants with markings on them, Weir said. __ Associated Press journalist Sarah El Deeb contributed from Beirut.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-lebanon-war-bomb-building-photos-beirut-c911be38a0ade1b96b4397ff496208e8	2024-10-23T08:58:39-07:00	
Sweeping blackouts in Cuba raise the question: Why has the island's solar buildout been so slow?	HAVANA (AP) — Cuba’s large-scale blackouts that left 10 million people without power this month may not have happened if the government had built out more solar power to boost its failing electric grid as promised, some experts say. In a nation with plentiful sunshine, Cuban officials have long had the opportunity to encourage solar power as one solution to national energy problems. But October’s sweeping outages — the island’s worst power failure in years — show little progress has been made. 'If you had extensive buildout of solar, solar farms, residential solar and storage, for the most part, you could avoid the problems they have,' said Dan Whittle, associate vice president of the resilient Caribbean practice at the Environmental Defense Fund, an advocacy group. 'But they haven’t really built the policies to get there.' Cuban officials blame the blackouts on the U.S. trade embargo and other sanctions, the pandemic's effect on tourism, and emigration all inhibiting Cuba's economy. But experts say the government hasn’t updated its internal policies regarding foreign ownership and private financing, especially for critical solar projects, and are still focused on petroleum fuels. That's despite the fact that as part of the 2015 Paris Agreement, the Cuban government committed to 37% of its power coming from renewable energy by 2030, an ambitious increase from an initial 24% target. John Kavulich, president of U.S.-Cuba Trade and Economic Council Inc., said there was much hope in the business community two years ago when the U.S. changed policies enabling U.S. investment in private Cuban companies. But the Cuban government has failed to issue regulations necessary to allow the money to start flowing to the private sector, he said. 'So all of this investment and financing, not just from the U.S. but from other countries ... that are ready to take a chance in Cuba, sit idle, and that is hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars,' he said. The share of Cuba's electricity that comes from renewable sources like solar and burning sugar cane waste has increased only slightly, from 3.8% in 2012 to 5% as of 2022, according to research from the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia Law School and EDF. That's a very small change during a time when solar and wind have ramped up sharply globally and costs have come down. Nearly all of the country's power — 95% — comes from burning fossil fuels. Much of that is from burning crude oil, a particularly polluting form of generation. One of Cuba's biggest trading partners, China, makes 80% of the world's solar panels, according to the energy data and analytics firm Wood Mackenzie, and they are inexpensive. China committed in March to building 92 solar farms on the island that are expected to add more than 2,000 megawatts of energy, and reports in June said China donated three solar parks expected to add 1,000 more. But that trade relationship has not yet led to a buildout that would at least keep the lights on during the day. The whole country had only 252 megawatts of solar power at the end of 2022. Kavulich said even China has its limits. The view of China's private sector, he said, is that Cuba 'seems to make no effort whatsoever to pay money that it owes.' 'The Cuban utility is the only buyer and it’s a risky investment,' said Whittle. European leaders tell him they 'just can’t in good faith encourage businesses in their countries to invest in Cuba.' Cuban officials acknowledged in recent days that more widespread solar power would have helped alleviate some of the misery from the recent outages. The minister of energy and head of the nation's electric utility encouraged Cubans to buy rooftop solar systems paired with batteries, instead of the gas and diesel generators purchased by Cubans who can afford them. 'We are thinking about' some regulations that would stimulate these solar purchases, the chief of the nation’s electric utility, Alfredo López, said. Cuba has struggled with frequent power outages for decades. Besides the U.S. economic embargo, officials have cited aging and insufficiently maintained power plants, increased demand for air conditioning and a lack of fuel for the lack of electricity. The nation relies on imported fuel to meet electric needs, including from oil-rich ally Venezuela, Mexico and Russia. This month’s crisis, which shut down institutions including schools, closed gas stations and left people cooking their food on wood stoves on the streets, began with one of the island’s major power plants failing. Human-driven climate change has contributed to extreme weather events that also regularly affect Cuba’s electrical grid. Desperation over the inability to carry out basic activities has sparked recent street protests. Whittle noted the country has no shortage of good climate scientists. Korey Silverman-Roati, senior fellow of carbon management and negative emissions at the Sabin Center, said the Cuban government is trying. 'There certainly has been a will and attempts to build out renewable energy infrastructure,' he said. 'It just hasn’t happened.' On the island, technicians are working to install 26 solar projects in different provinces, López told official media last week. Installations will ramp up fivefold over the next decade, said Lídice Vaillant, head of the Photovoltaic Research Laboratory at the University of Havana. Besides the strong sunlight, there is another way that Cuba is a good candidate for solar. A significant share of its electricity comes from smaller power plants distributed around the country. Solar could be added or switched out in those locations. But it hasn't happened yet. 'There is still sort of this, I think, this lingering belief at the highest levels of government that, you know, fossil fuels is really the best solution,' Whittle said. ___ Rodriguez reported from Havana, St. John from Detroit and Lobet from New York. ___ Read more of AP’s climate coverage at http://www.apnews.com/climate-and-environment ___ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Efforts by Russia, Iran and China to sway US voters may escalate, new Microsoft report says	NEW YORK (AP) — Foreign adversaries have shown continued determination to influence the U.S. election –- and there are signs their activity will intensify as Election Day nears, Microsoft said in a report Wednesday. Russian operatives are doubling down on fake videos to smear Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign, while Chinese-linked social media campaigns are maligning down-ballot candidates who are critical of China, the company’s threat intelligence arm said Wednesday. Meanwhile, Iranian actors who allegedly sent emails aimed at intimidating U.S. voters in 2020 have been surveying election-related websites and major media outlets, raising concerns they could be preparing for another scheme this year, the tech giant said. The report serves as a warning – building on others from U.S. intelligence officials – that as the nation enters this critical final stretch and begins counting ballots, the worst influence efforts may be yet to come. U.S. officials say they remain confident that election infrastructure is secure enough to withstand any attacks from American adversaries. Still, in a tight election, foreign efforts to influence voters are raising concern. Microsoft noted that some of the disinformation campaigns it tracks received little authentic engagement from U.S. audiences, but others have been amplified by unwitting Americans, exposing thousands to foreign propaganda in the final weeks of voting. Russia, China and Iran have all rejected claims that they are seeking to meddle with the U.S. election. 'The presidential elections are the United States’ domestic affairs. China has no intention and will not interfere in the US election,' the Chinese Embassy said in a statement. 'Having already unequivocally and repeatedly announced, Iran neither has any motive nor intent to interfere in the U.S. election; and, it therefore categorically repudiates such accusations,' read a statement from Iran's mission to the United Nations. A message left with the Russian Embassy was not immediately returned on Wednesday. The report reveals an expanding landscape of coordinated campaigns to advance adversaries’ priorities as global wars and economic concerns raise the stakes for the U.S. election around the world. It details a trend also seen in the 2016 and 2020 elections of foreign actors covertly fomenting discord among American voters, furthering a divide in the electorate that has left the nation almost evenly split just 13 days before voting concludes. 'History has shown that the ability of foreign actors to rapidly distribute deceptive content can significantly impact public perception and electoral outcomes,' Clint Watts, general manager of the Microsoft Threat Analysis Center, said in a news release. 'With a particular focus on the 48 hours before and after Election Day, voters, government institutions, candidates and parties must remain vigilant to deceptive and suspicious activity online.' The report adds to previous findings from Microsoft and U.S. intelligence that suggest the Kremlin is committed to lambasting Harris’ character online, a sign of its preference for another Donald Trump presidency. Russian actors have spent recent months churning out both AI-generated content and more rudimentary spoofs and staged videos spreading disinformation about Harris, Microsoft’s analysts found. Among the fake videos were a staged clip of a park ranger impersonator claiming Harris killed an endangered rhinoceros in Zambia, as well as a video sharing baseless allegations about her running mate Tim Walz, which U.S. intelligence officials also attributed to Russia this week. Morgan Finkelstein, national security spokeswoman for the Harris campaign, condemned Russia's efforts. Another Russian influence actor has been producing fake election-related videos spoofing American organizations from Fox News to the FBI and Wired magazine, according to the report. China over the last several months has focused on down-ballot races, and on general efforts to sow distrust and democratic dissatisfaction. A Chinese influence actor widely known as Spamouflage has been using fake social media users to attack down-ballot Republicans who have publicly denounced China, according to Microsoft’s analysts. Candidates targeted have included Rep. Barry Moore of Alabama, Sen. Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, and Rep. Michael McCaul of Texas, all of whom are running for reelection, the report said. The group also has attacked Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida. All four politicians sent emailed statements condemning China's aggression against American political candidates and its efforts to weaken democracy. In its statement, the Chinese embassy said U.S. officials, politicians and media 'have accused China of using news websites and social media accounts to spread so-called disinformation in the US. Such allegations are full of malicious speculations against China, which China firmly opposes.' Iran, which has spent the 2024 campaign going after Trump with disinformation as well as hacking into the former president’s campaign, hasn’t been stymied by ongoing tension in the Middle East, according to the Microsoft report. Quite the opposite, groups linked to Iran have weaponized divided opinions on the Israel-Hamas War to influence American voters, the analysts found. For example, an Iranian operated persona took to Telegram and X to call on Americans to sit out the elections due to the candidates’ support for Israel. Microsoft's report also said it observed an Iranian group compromising an account of a notable Republican politician who had a different account targeted in June. The company would not name the individual but said it was the same person who it had referenced in August as a 'former presidential candidate.' The report also warned that the same Iranian group that allegedly posed as members of the far-right Proud Boys in intimidating emails to voters in 2020 has been scouting swing-state election-related websites and media outlets in recent months. The behavior could 'suggest preparations for more direct influence operations as Election Day nears,' Watts said. Iran's mission to the United Nations said in a statement that the allegations in the report 'are fundamentally unfounded, and wholly inadmissible.' Even as Russia, China and Iran try to influence voters, intelligence officials said Tuesday there is still no indication they are plotting significant attacks on election infrastructure as a way to disrupt the outcome. If they tried, improvements to election security means there is no way they could alter the results, Jen Easterly, director of the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, told The Associated Press earlier this month. Intelligence officials on Tuesday also warned that Russia and Iran may try to encourage violent protests in the U.S. after next month’s election, setting the stage for potential complications in the post-election period. ___ The Associated Press receives support from several private foundations to enhance its explanatory coverage of elections and democracy.

An attack on a Turkish defense company that kills 5 people is blamed on Kurdish militants	ANKARA, Turkey (AP) — Suspected Kurdish militants set off explosives and opened fire Wednesday at Turkey's state-run aerospace and defense company TUSAS, killing five people and wounding more than a dozen, the interior minister said. The two attackers — a man and a woman — also were killed, Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya said. Yerlikaya said the militant Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK, is suspected of being behind the attack but cautioned that the process of identifying the assailants continued. Defense Minister Yasar Guler also pointed the finger at the PKK. 'We give these PKK scoundrels the punishment they deserve every time. But they never come to their senses,' Guler said. 'We will pursue them until the last terrorist is eliminated.' The Islamic State group and leftist extremists have also carried out past attacks in Turkey. 'I condemn this heinous terrorist attack,' Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said during a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin on the sidelines of a BRICS meeting in Russia. Putin offered condolences. A U.S. Embassy statement said Washington 'strongly condemns today’s terrorist attack.' TUSAS designs, manufactures and assembles civilian and military aircraft, unmanned aerial vehicles and other defense industry and space systems. Its UAVs have been instrumental in Turkey gaining an upper hand in its fight against Kurdish militants both on its own territory and across the border in Iraq. The attack occurred a day after the leader of Turkey’s far-right nationalist party that's allied with Erdogan raised the possibility that the PKK's imprisoned leader could be granted parole if he renounces violence and disbands his organization. Abdullah Ocalan's group has been fighting for autonomy in southeast Turkey in a conflict that has killed tens of thousands of people since the 1980s. It is considered a terrorist group by Turkey and its Western allies. The country's pro-Kurdish political party, which also condemned the attack, noted that it had occurred at a time when the possibility of a dialogue to end the conflict had emerged. Turkish media said the assailants arrived Wednesday at an entry to the TUSAS complex in a taxi. The assailants, carrying assault weapons, detonated an explosive device next to the taxi, causing panic and allowing them to enter. The taxi driver was among the dead, according to HaberTurk television. Orhan Akdundar, a brother of one the TUSAS employees, was among relatives waiting outside the complex for news of their loved ones. 'I called my brother who was inside and said, ‘What happened?’ He said a bomb had exploded and said that gunshots continued for a very long time,' Akdundar said. 'There was a huge commotion. The gendarmerie, special forces and other security forces were all here. There were lots of ambulances. Then the phones shut off and I wasn’t able to establish communication.' An unidentified TUSAS employee shouted: 'We will work harder and produce more in defiance of the traitors' as he and other colleagues were being evacuated from the premises, according to a video aired by HaberTurk. Security camera images, aired on television, showed a man in plainclothes carrying a backpack and holding an assault rifle. The interior minister said security teams were dispatched as soon as the attack started at around 3:30 p.m. Multiple gunshots were heard after security forces entered the site, the DHA news agency and other media reported. Helicopters were seen flying above the premises. Authorities issued a temporary blackout on the coverage of the attack and went on to throttle access to social media websites. Vice President Cevdet Yilmaz said the target of the attack was Turkey's 'success in the defense industry.' The Iraqi embassy in Ankara issued a statement condemning the attack. It said the embassy 'affirms Iraq’s firm position in rejecting terrorism and extremism in all its forms and manifestations, and expresses the solidarity of Iraq’s government and people, with the government and people of the Republic of Turkey.' Earlier this year, Iraq announced a ban on the PKK. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the United Nations 'stands in solidarity' with the people and government of Turkey, according to U.N. deputy spokesman Farhan Haq. Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis also denounced the attack. 'Our thoughts and heartfelt condolences go out to the families of the victims,' he said on X. ___ Associated Press writer Robert Badendieck in Hamburg, Germany, contributed.	https://apnews.com/article/turkey-explosion-aerospace-company-413fbeb21e1fa86ea1ecd52a19079e67	2024-10-23T04:08:23-07:00	
An anti-whaling activist will stay in detention in Greenland	COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) — A court in Greenland on Wednesday once again decided to extend the custody of anti-whaling campaigner Paul Watson till Nov. 13 while Denmark considers a Japanese extradition request. It was unclear when Denmark will decide whether or not to send him to Japan, which does not have an extradition treaty with the Scandinavian country. Watson, a 73-year-old Canadian-American citizen, is a former head of the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society. Its direct action tactics, including high-seas confrontations with whaling vessels, have drawn support from A-list celebrities and were featured in the reality television series 'Whale Wars.' Watson was arrested on July 21 when his ship docked in Nuuk, Greenland’s capital and a Greenland court repeatedly has approved his detention while Danish authorities look into his possible extradition to Japan, where he faces up to 15 years in prison, according to the Captain Paul Watson Foundation. Greenland is an autonomous territory of Denmark and handles police and justice matters. Japan’s coast guard sought his arrest over an encounter with a Japanese whaling research ship in 2010. He was accused of obstructing the crew’s official duties by ordering the captain of his ship to throw explosives at the whaling ship. Prosecutor Mariam Khalil said that there still was a flight risk and an extension of the custody was needed, the Greenland newspaper Sermitsiaq said. Last week, Sea Shepherd France said Watson had asked France’s president for political asylum. It said a letter from Watson had been delivered to President Emmanuel Macron, who previously expressed his support for Watson and emphasized the importance of the case to environmental advocacy and human rights. Whale meat is an element of Japanese food culture, and the Japanese government says it supports the sustainable use of whales. Watson, who left Sea Shepherd in 2022, was also a leading member of Greenpeace, but left in 1977 amid disagreements over his aggressive tactics and set up the more action-oriented organization. The group has waged aggressive campaigns to protect whales, dolphins and other marine animals.	https://apnews.com/article/watson-greenland-japan-whaling-18d2ed38a37251919ced724c7c37ae6b	2024-10-23T03:04:34-07:00	
Fallout from 2023 Hamas attack lingers as Jews worldwide prepare for a holiday meant for joy	NEW YORK (AP) — Customarily, Simchat Torah is one of the most joyous days of the Jewish calendar, highlighted by exuberant dancing around a Torah. Jewish leaders say the joy will return during this week's celebrations, even as Jews recall that last year's Simchat Torah overlapped with Oct. 7, the day some 1,200 people were killed and 250 kidnapped in the Hamas attack on Israel. Rabbi Rick Jacobs, president of Union for Reform Judaism, reflected on the inevitably that the celebrations coming on Wednesday and Thursday will include 'an overlay of pain and loss and mourning.' 'Do we dance again? Has enough time passed?' asked Jacobs, whose organization represents more than 800 Reform synagogues in North America. 'I’m of a mind that we must dance,' he said. 'There’s something defiant about dancing with the Torahs and not conceding Jewish life to those who hate us ... Jewish life cannot be put on pause.' Simchat Torah marks the conclusion of the annual cycle of public Torah readings, and the start of a new one. The highlight is the hakafot, during which participants march and dance around a Torah scroll. 'This holiday is characterized by utterly unbridled joy,' says the Hasidic organization Chabad-Lubavitch. 'There are times for mourning and times for celebration and joy, and this is one of those times of joy,' said Rabbi Motti Seligson, a Chabad spokesman. 'That's the way we celebrate the lives that are lost. It's the way we lean into who we are. We don't let others define who we are.' Reflections of a rabbi whose family was shattered by violence Among those sounding the call for joy was Rabbi Leo Dee, an educator living in the Israeli settlement of Efrat in the West Bank. His wife and two of his daughters were killed during Passover in April 2023 in an attack by Palestinian militants. Writing in The Jewish Chronicle, a London-based newspaper, Dee said rabbis worldwide were wondering how to celebrate Simchat Torah this year. 'On the one hand it is a festival, a day when it is forbidden to give eulogies and to mourn,' Dee wrote. 'On the other hand, it is the anniversary of the most tragic attack against humanity since the Holocaust. Can we dance again? Can we celebrate again? How should we respect the victims? His answer: 'Let’s make this Simchat Torah a day of true joy, a day of supporting Israel in the most tangible way possible, by promoting immigration to the most incredible country with the most impressive people and the brightest future.' In the U.S., some Jews commented on the element of sadness that will accompany some of the celebrations. 'The singing and dancing will never ever be the same as prior to October 7th, 2023. It will be tinged with a bit of sad reflection and daunting memory,' wrote Chaim Botwinick, a Florida-based executive coach and educational consultant, in a blog post contributed to The Times of Israel. 'But the one lesson that remains in my heart and soul forever is that we must never ever give up hope,' he added. 'We must continue to dance — even as we cry.' Should the children shout for joy as the grown-ups weep? Similar sentiments were expressed by Rabbi Avi Killip, executive vice president at the Hadar Institute, a Jewish education center in New York. 'There will be shouts of joy from our children as they dance and celebrate the sweetness of Torah, and there will be cries of sorrow from the elders who saw something that cannot ever be forgotten,' Killip wrote in an opinion piece for eJewish Philanthropy. 'But of course it won’t be that simple.' 'This first year, we can and probably should let our weeping overtake the sounds of the joy of the children. That is appropriate. This year we need to allow the tears to flow,' she wrote. 'In future years there will be more and more children who weren’t there, who didn’t see, and who I pray will someday bring an unbridled joy back to this holiday of Simchat Torah.' Rabbi Moshe Hauer, executive vice president of the Orthodox Union, said the commemorations in Orthodox synagogues affiliated with the union would be 'intimately Jewish. They will be just for us.' 'We will celebrate in a manner that will connect us deeply to the events and challenges of this past year, and to specifically celebrate the gift of Torah,' he said via email. 'Carrying our children on our shoulders and Torah scrolls in our arms, we will sing and dance in joyous celebration of the values that define us, reinforcing our national mission to do good, to be good, to study and live by God’s word, and to bring light to the world.' ___ Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

Hungary's Orbán claims the EU seeks to topple his government as his hostility toward it grows	BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) — Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán claimed in a speech on Wednesday that the European Union seeks to topple his government and install a puppet regime in the Central European country, an escalation of open hostility toward the bloc by the member considered Russia's closest ally. Speaking before thousands of supporters in Budapest, Orbán was marking Hungary’s national holiday commemorating a 1956 armed uprising against Soviet repression that began in the capital and spread across the country before being crushed by the Red Army. Orbán has often used the holiday, which looms large in Hungarians' memory as a freedom fight against foreign domination, to draw parallels between past occupying forces like the Soviet Union and Ottoman Empire and the EU of today. 'Independent Hungarian politics are unacceptable to Brussels,' Orbán told the crowd, referring to the EU headquarters in Belgium. 'That is why they announced in Brussels that they will get rid of Hungary’s national government. They also announced that they wanted to hang a Brussels puppet government around the country’s neck.' Orbán gave no evidence to support his claims. There was no immediate public reaction from Brussels. 'Do we bow to foreign will, this time to the will of Brussels, or do we resist it?' Orbán continued. 'I propose that our answer be as clear and unambiguous as it was in 1956.' The EU has withheld billions in financial support from Hungary over its alleged breaches of rule of law, while some of the bloc’s lawmakers have repeatedly proposed stripping Hungary of its voting rights over democratic backsliding. The EU parliament declared in 2022 that Hungary can no longer be considered a democracy. Hungary's leader has clashed with the bloc especially over the war in Ukraine. Hungary has routinely blocked, delayed or watered down EU efforts to extend assistance to Ukraine and sanction Russia, and taken an adversarial posture toward Kyiv while growing closer to Moscow. Orbán has broken with other EU leaders by arguing for an immediate cease-fire and peace talks in Ukraine, leading critics to suggest that he is advocating for Russian interests and turning his back on his EU and NATO partners. 'The Brussels bureaucrats have led the West into a hopeless war,' said Orbán, who is widely seen as Russian President Vladimir Putin’s closest ally in the EU. 'In their minds, dizzy with the hope of victory, this war is the war of the West against Russia ... Now they want to openly push the entire European Union into the war in Ukraine.' He claimed, without providing evidence, that the EU plans to allow Ukrainian soldiers to station in Hungary after a future victory 'to guarantee the security of the whole of Europe.' He added: 'We Hungarians would wake up one morning to find that Slavic soldiers from the east were again stationed on the territory of Hungary. We do not want that, but the pressure from Brussels is getting stronger every day.' Orbán's speech came at a particularly difficult time for his right-wing populist government, which has gone through a dip in support amid a sputtering economy, a series of scandals and the emergence of a popular new opposition challenger, Péter Magyar and his Tisza party. As polls show that Orbán’s Fidesz party is neck and neck with Tisza, and with national elections on the horizon in 2026, the prime minister was seeking to shore up support among his base. Opposition challenger Magyar and his party planned a commemoration march in Budapest later on Wednesday. Magyar has accused Orbán of dishonoring the memory of the some 3,000 Hungarians that died during the 1956 revolution. It was the first time in three years that Orbán delivered his commemoration speech in the capital, preferring to address select groups of supporters in more conservative towns in Hungary’s countryside.	https://apnews.com/article/hungary-orban-eu-government-speech-d9d73c58566a6a3fbafaa77f4d702bec	2024-10-23T02:29:58-07:00	
Israeli strikes pound Lebanese coastal city after residents evacuate	TYRE, Lebanon (AP) — Israeli jets struck multiple buildings in Lebanon's southern coastal city of Tyre on Wednesday, sending large clouds of black smoke into the air. The state-run National News Agency reported that an Israeli strike on the nearby town of Maarakeh killed three people. There were no reports of casualties in Tyre, where the Israeli military had issued evacuation warnings prior to the strikes. Lebanon's Hezbollah militant group meanwhile fired another barrage of rockets into Israel, including two that set off air raid sirens in Tel Aviv before being intercepted. A cloud of smoke could be seen in the sky from the hotel where U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken was staying on his latest visit to the region to try to renew cease-fire talks. Hezbollah began firing rockets, missiles and drones into Israel, drawing retaliatory airstrikes, after Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023 attack out of Gaza triggered the war there. All-out war erupted in Lebanon last month, and Israeli strikes killed Hezbollah's top leader, Hassan Nasrallah, and most of his senior commanders. Israeli ground forces invaded southern Lebanon at the beginning of October. The Israeli military said Tuesday that one of its airstrikes in recent weeks killed Hashem Safieddine, a senior Hezbollah leader and cleric who was widely expected to succeed Nasrallah. Tyre, a provincial capital, had largely been spared in the Israel-Hezbollah war, but strikes in an around the city have intensified recently. The 2,500-year-old city, about 80 kilometers (50 miles) south of Beirut, is known for its pristine beaches, ancient harbor and imposing Roman ruins and hippodrome, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It is among Lebanon’s largest cities and a vibrant metropolis popular with tourists. The buildings struck on Wednesday were between several heritage sites, including the hippodrome and a cluster of seaside sites associated with the ancient Phoenicians and the Crusaders. The Israeli military issued evacuation warnings a couple hours prior for dozens of buildings in the heart of the city. It told residents to move north of the Awali River, dozens of kilometers (miles) to the north. Avichay Adraee, an Israeli military spokesman, said on the platform X that there were Hezbollah assets in the area of the evacuation warning, without elaborating or providing evidence. The city is in southern Lebanon, where the Shiite Muslim Hezbollah has a strong presence, and its legislators are members of the group or its allies. But Tyre is also home to civilians with no ties to the group, including a sizable Christian community. First responders from Lebanon’s Civil Defense used loudspeakers to warn residents to evacuate the area and helped older adults and others who had difficulty leaving. Ali Safieddine, the head of the Civil Defense, told The Associated Press there were no casualties. Dr. Wissam Ghazal, a health official in Tyre, said the strikes hit six buildings, flattening four of them, around 2 1/2 hours after the evacuation warnings. People displaced by the strikes could be seen in parks and sitting on the sides of nearby roads. Over 2,500 people have been killed in Lebanon since the conflict began late last year, according to Lebanon's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants. Over a million people have fled their homes since September. On the Israeli side, attacks have killed around 60 people, half of them soldiers. Near-daily rocket barrages have emptied out communities across northern Israel, displacing some 60,000 people. In recent weeks Hezbollah has extended its range, launching scores of rockets every day and regularly targeting the northern Israeli city of Haifa. Most of the projectiles are intercepted or fall in open areas. ___ Chehayeb reported from Beirut. ___ Follow AP’s war coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war	https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-lebanon-hezbollah-10-23-2024-31162ca16468bc22cf0696535ea3f3f8	2024-10-23T02:25:11-07:00	
Hong Kong discovers dinosaur fossils for the first time	HONG KONG (AP) — Officials in Hong Kong said Wednesday they have discovered dinosaur fossils in the city for the first time on a remote, uninhabited island that's part of a geopark. Experts have initially confirmed the fossils were part of a large dinosaur from the Cretaceous period, about 145 million to 66 million years ago, the government said in a statement. They will need to conduct further studies to confirm the species of the dinosaur. Experts speculate that the dinosaur was likely buried by sand and gravel after its death before it was later washed to the surface by a large flood, and subsequently buried again at the discovery site, it said. The government said the conservation department in March informed its Antiquities and Monuments Office about a sedimentary rock containing substances suspected to be vertebrate fossils. The rock was found on Port Island in the Hong Kong UNESCO Global Geopark in the city's northeastern waters. The government said it commissioned mainland Chinese experts to conduct field investigations. Port Island is closed to the public from Wednesday until further notice to facilitate future investigations and excavations. The fossils will be on display at the Hong Kong Heritage Discovery Centre in Tsim Sha Tsui, one of the city's popular shopping districts, starting on Friday. The government is also planning to open a temporary workshop for the public to observe experts' preparation of fossil specimens by the end of 2024.	https://apnews.com/article/hong-kong-dinosaur-fossil-first-time-49c18b71950542d2d82b95ae71c5dbb7	2024-10-23T02:13:20-07:00	
Britain and Germany sign defense pact to counter Russia's growing threat	LONDON (AP) — German submarine-hunting planes will patrol the North Atlantic from a base in Scotland under a new Britain-Germany defense pact sealed in response to the growing threat from Russia. Defense ministers from Britain and Germany signed the agreement in London on Wednesday in what officials call the first such defense pact between the two NATO member countries to boost European security amid rising Russian aggression. The deal comes as the war launched by Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 grinds on, and with Ukraine and its European allies anxious about the outcome of November's U.S. presidential election. U.K. Defense Secretary John Healey said the need for Europe to bolster its own security, and for the U.K. to play a bigger role in NATO, 'is the driving force behind our NATO-first U.K. defense strategy, (and) behind our reset of U.K. relations with Europe.' 'In a more dangerous world, allies are our strategic strength and we must do more together,' Healey said at a news conference in London alongside German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius. Under the deal, German submarine hunter aircraft are expected to operate 'periodically' from a Scottish military base to patrol the North Atlantic. The allies will work closer together to protect vital underwater cables in the North Sea. The two countries say they will also cooperate to prioritize developing long-range strike weapons that can travel farther than the U.K.'s existing Storm Shadow missiles. German defense giant Rheinmetall is also expected to open a factory producing artillery gun barrels using British steel. Officials say the pact will mean British and German forces committed to NATO in Estonia and Lithuania will exercise and operate together more closely, ensuring that 'land forces on NATO’s eastern flank remain a strong deterrent and are ready to fight and win if required.' Britain and Germany are also expected to collaborate on developing new land-based and aerial drones. 'We must not take security in Europe for granted,'' Pistorius said. 'Russia is waging war against Ukraine, it is increasing its weapons production immensely and has repeatedly launched hybrid attacks on our partners in eastern Europe. 'With the Trinity House Agreement, we are showing that the NATO allies have recognized what these times require and are determined to improve their deterrence and defense capabilities.'	https://apnews.com/article/uk-germany-defense-pact-russia-nato-97d1ad3a8c60d1611581ddc942f4d302	2024-10-23T02:03:53-07:00	
US and Cyprus launch a strategic dialogue to bolster security	NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) — U.S. and Cypriot officials on Wednesday launched a strategic dialogue they said would bolster security and stability in a crisis-wracked region through initiatives including counterterrorism training of personnel from Middle Eastern countries and fighting sanctions evasion. 'It is a big moment in the relationship between our countries and to be part of this feels like being part of an historic occasion,' U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs James O’Brien said at a news conference. Cyprus’ clear policy shift toward deepening U.S. relations after decades of walking a tightrope between Washington and Moscow gained added steam after Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine. The U.S. official pointed to a U.S.-funded center on the island nation under the acronym CYCLOPS that trains personnel from Cyprus and neighboring countries on maritime and cybersecurity as well as counterterrorism techniques. Cyprus' Foreign Minister Constantinos Kombos said his government remains committed to a partnership between local law enforcement, the U.S. Department of Justice and the FBI in combating illicit finance and the evasion of sanctions against Russia and other countries. The FBI is helping train Cypriot police in identifying and prosecuting cases of illegal financing and attempts to evade U.S., European Union and U.N. sanctions imposed on any third country. 'It’s dealing with crises like we see from the instability in the region,' O’Brien said. 'It’s law enforcement cooperation on the sanctions enforcement and other cooperation so that we keep our people safe.' Kombos said the start of the dialogue affords Cyprus the opportunity to demonstrate that it's a credible strategic partner to the U.S. regarding humanitarian initiatives including the establishment earlier this year of a Cyprus-Gaza maritime corridor for the shipborne delivery of humanitarian aid to the Palestinian territory. Last month, Cyprus and the U.S. signed a defense cooperation framework agreement that outlines ways the two countries can enhance their response to regional humanitarian crises and security concerns.	https://apnews.com/article/cyprus-us-security-dialogue-bc23f9304fab58c425b4fddc44e45db4	2024-10-23T01:47:57-07:00	
A Brazilian artist uses ash and mud for a massive Sao Paulo mural lamenting climate disasters	SAO PAULO (AP) — Brazilian artist Mundano on Wednesday is presenting a massive street mural in Sao Paulo that uses ash from wildfires and mud from floods to highlight extreme weather events wreaking devastation across the country — as well as their causes. Over 30 meters (98.4 feet) high and 48 meters (157.5 feet) wide, the mural depicts deforestation and severe drought in the Amazon rainforest with its parched brown earth and gray tree stumps. It features Indigenous activist Alessandra Korap wearing a crown of flowers and holding a sign that says: 'Stop the destruction #keepyourpromise.' It is a call to the Minnesota-based soy giant Cargill, according to Mundano. Soy farming is one of the biggest drivers of deforestation in the Amazon. Cargill says on its website that it will eliminate deforestation from its supply chain in Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay by 2025. Mundano is seeking to hold them to account. 'We are tired of being a country, a continent where we and the natural resources we have here are exploited. ... We have to regenerate our planet instead of destroying it,' Mundano said in an interview on Tuesday. Cargill did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday morning. Over the past few months, uncontrolled human-caused wildfires have ravaged protected areas in the Amazon, the vast Cerrado savanna and the world’s largest tropical wetland area, the Pantanal. Those blazes have spread smoke over a vast expanse, choking residents of some cities. Drought has caused a critical situation nationwide, and forecasts indicate it will persist in much of the country through at least the rest of the month, according to a Sunday report from Cemaden, Brazil’s disaster warning center. Climate change — primarily caused by the burning of fossil fuels such as oil, gas and coal — leads to frequent and more extreme alterations in weather patterns. The depth of the Amazon’s Negro River was 12.46 meters (41 feet) on Tuesday, a slight increase from 10 days earlier, when it registered its lowest level since measurements started 122 years ago. Tuesday’s depth was still around 6 meters (20 feet) less than usual for the same date in prior years, according to data from the Manaus port. Rivers in Brazil ’s Amazon always rise and fall with its rainy and dry seasons. But the dry season this year has been much worse than usual. Earlier this year, an unprecedented flood in the southern state of Rio Grande do Sul killed more than 180 people, affected over 2 million people and destroyed urban communities. Mundano, who calls himself an 'artivist,' used mud from that flood collected by activist group Movement of People Affected by Dams in the mural, as well as ashes from the Amazon, the Atlantic Forest, the Pantanal and the Cerrado. He also used earth thrown away in dumpsters in Sao Paulo and clay collected from the Sawre Muybu Indigenous land in the Amazon, from where Korap hails. 'From floods to droughts, everything is connected!' Mundano said in an Instagram post on Tuesday, accompanied by a video showing the mural in Sao Paulo, which the artist said was his biggest ever. Three years ago, Mundano employed ash from the Amazon to create a similar mural in Sao Paulo. That work depicted a firefighter standing amid deforested areas and featured a cattle ranch as well as trucks loaded with logs. ___ Hughes reported from Rio de Janeiro.	https://apnews.com/article/brazil-amazon-drought-mural-art-sao-paulo-9a0f30cc9fd703c96666ee364c284287	2024-10-23T00:32:01-07:00	
Financial cooperation and BRICS expansion are on the table as Putin hosts Global South leaders	KAZAN, Russia (AP) — Russia’s President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday hosted China’s Xi Jinping, India’s Narendra Modi and other world leaders at a summit of the BRICS bloc of developing economies, part of the Kremlin's efforts to challenge Western global clout. Speaking at the start of Wednesday's BRICS meeting, Putin named the deepening of cooperation in the financial sector as part of its agenda. He said participants were also set to discuss a range of international issues including the settlement of regional conflicts, along with the expansion of the BRICS group of countries. 'BRICS strategy on the global arena conforms with the strivings of the main part of the global community, the so-called global majority,' Putin said. The alliance that initially included Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa has expanded to embrace Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia. Turkey, Azerbaijan and Malaysia have formally applied to become members, and several others have expressed interest in joining. The three-day summit in the city of Kazan was attended by 36 countries, highlighting the failure of U.S.-led efforts to isolate Russia over its actions in Ukraine. The Kremlin touted the summit as 'the largest foreign policy event ever held' by Russia. The Kremlin has cast BRICS as a counterbalance to the Western-dominated global order and redoubled its efforts to court the countries of the Global South after sending troops into Ukraine in February 2022. Russia has specifically pushed for the creation of a new payment system that would offer an alternative to the global bank messaging network SWIFT and allow Moscow to dodge Western sanctions and trade with partners. Speaking at the summit, Putin also proposed creating a new BRICS investment platform, saying that it could 'become a powerful tool for supporting our economies, and would also provide financial resources to countries of the Global South and East.' The Russian leader and Xi had announced a 'no-limits' partnership weeks before Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022. They already met twice earlier this year, in Beijing in May and at a Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit in Kazakhstan in July. On Wednesday, Xi emphasized the bloc’s role in ensuring global security and emphasized the need to avoid an escalation of the Ukrainian conflict. China and Brazil have put forward a peace plan that Ukraine has rejected. Putin on Tuesday described the relations between Moscow and Beijing as 'one of the main stabilizing factors on the world arena.' He vowed to 'expand coordination on all multilateral forums for the sake of global stability and a fair world order.' Russia’s cooperation with India has also flourished as New Delhi sees Moscow as a time-tested partner since Cold War times despite Russia’s close ties with India’s main rival, China. Western allies want India to be more active in persuading Moscow to end the fighting in Ukraine, but Modi has avoided condemning Russia while emphasizing a peaceful settlement. 'We support dialogue and diplomacy, not war,' Modi said during Wednesday's BRICS meeting in remarks carried by the Indian foreign ministry. Modi's visit to the summit marked his second trip to Russia in three months. 'As a diverse and inclusive platform, BRICS can play a positive role in all areas,' Modi said. Putin is also set to meet Thursday with United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, who has repeatedly criticized Moscow's actions in Ukraine and is making his first visit to Russia in more than two years. Guterres's trip to Kazan has drawn an angry reaction from Kyiv. 'This is a wrong choice that does not advance the cause of peace,' Ukraine's Foreign Ministry said on X, adding that 'it only damages the U.N.’s reputation.' Farhan Haq, deputy spokesman for Guterres, responded to the Ukrainian criticism by saying that the visit is 'a standard practice in attending meetings of organizations with large numbers of important member states, such as the G7 and the G20.' 'There’s a meeting with great importance for the work of the United Nations, with the BRICS countries representing about half the world’s population,' Haq said. Putin is expected to hold more than a dozen bilateral meetings on the sidelines of the summit.	https://apnews.com/article/russia-putin-brics-summit-china-india-d672be9b1ec2ffd0fba608e8a6aca790	2024-10-23T00:10:32-07:00	
US defense chief Austin says there’s evidence North Korea has sent troops to Russia	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said Wednesday there is evidence that North Korea has sent troops to Russia, as South Korea's spy chief told lawmakers that 3,000 North Korean troops are in the country receiving training on drones and other equipment before being deployed to battlefields in Ukraine. Speaking to reporters during a visit to Rome, Austin said 'What exactly they are doing? Left to be seen. These are things that we need to sort out,' according to a video posted by the Washington Post. If the troops join the war in Ukraine on Russia’s side, it will be 'a very, very serious issue,' Austin said, adding it would have an impact in Europe and in the Indo-Pacific region. South Korean intelligence first publicized reports that the Russian navy had taken 1,500 North Korean special warfare troops to Russia this month, while Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had earlier said his government had intelligence that 10,000 North Korea soldiers were being prepared to join the invading Russian forces. The U.S. and NATO had not previously formally confirmed North Korea’s reported troop dispatch, but have warned of the danger of such a development if true. Russia and North Korea have so far denied the troop movements. South Korean National Intelligence Service Director Cho Tae-yong told lawmakers Wednesday that another 1,500 North Korean troops have entered Russia, according to lawmaker Park Sunwon, who attended a closed-door briefing by Cho. Cho told lawmakers that his agency assessed that North Korea aims to deploy a total of 10,000 troops to Russia by December, Park told reporters. Park cited Cho as saying the 3,000 North Korean soldiers sent to Russia have been split among multiple military bases and are in training. Cho told lawmakers that NIS believes they have yet to be deployed in battle, according to Park. Speaking jointly with Park about the NIS briefing, lawmaker Lee Seong Kweun said that the NIS found that the Russian military is now teaching those North Korean soldiers how to use military equipment such as drones. Lee cited the NIS chief as saying Russian instructors have high opinions of the morale and physical strength of the North Korean soldiers but think they will eventually suffer a heavy causalities because they lack an understanding of modern warfare. Lee, citing Cho, said Russia is recruiting a large number of interpreters. Lee said NIS has detected signs that North Korea is relocating family members of soldiers chosen to be sent to Russia to special sites to isolate them. The NIS chief told lawmakers that North Korea hasn't disclosed its troop dispatch to its own people. But there are rumors that the news is spreading to local residents, including those whose loved ones have been assigned Russian tours, Lee said, citing the NIS. Ukraine’s Military Intelligence Directorate head, Kyrylo Budanov, told the online military news outlet The War Zone that North Korean troops will arrive to Russia's Kursk region today to help Russian troops fighting off a Ukrainian incursion. North Korea and Russia, embroiled in separate confrontations with the West, have been sharply boosting their cooperation in the past two years. In June, they signed a major defense deal requiring both countries to use all available means to provide immediate military assistance if either is attacked. The NIS said last week that North Korea had sent more than 13,000 containers of artillery, missiles and other conventional arms to Russia since August 2023 to replenish its dwindling weapons stockpiles. Reports that the North is sending troops to Russia stoked security jitters in South Korea. South Korean officials worry that Russia may reward North Korea by giving it sophisticated weapons technologies that could boost the North’s nuclear and missile programs that target South Korea. South Korea said Tuesday it would consider supplying weapons to Ukraine in response to the North's reported troop dispatch. South Korea has shipped humanitarian and financial support to Ukraine, but it has so far avoided directly supplying arms to Ukraine in line with its policy of not supplying weapons to countries actively engaged in conflicts. North Korea has 1.2 million troops, one of the largest standing armies in the world, but it hasn’t fought in large-scale conflicts since the 1950-53 Korean War. Many experts question how much North Korean troops would help Russia, citing a shortage of battle experience. They say North Korea wants to get Russian economic support and its help to modernize the North's outdated conventional weapons systems as well as its high-tech weapons technology transfers. ___ Associated Press writer Illia Novikov in Kyiv, Ukraine contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/north-korea-russia-troops-ukraine-b664f8c1164e9ef859b7a618ffa92140	2024-10-23T00:00:48-07:00	
Blinken urges Israel to seek enduring deal, as officials say a limited cease-fire has been discussed	TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Wednesday that Israel needs to pursue an 'enduring strategic success' in Gaza after its tactical victories against Hamas, urging it to seek a deal that would end the war and bring back dozens of hostages. He spoke before traveling from Israel to Saudi Arabia on his 11th visit to the region since the war began. Air raid sirens sounded in Tel Aviv shortly before his departure as Israel intercepted two projectiles fired from Lebanon — the latest in Israel's war with Hezbollah — and a puff of smoke could be seen in the sky from Blinken's hotel. 'Israel has achieved most of the strategic objectives when it comes to Gaza,' Blinken told reporters before boarding his plane. 'Now is the time to turn those successes into an enduring strategic success.' 'There really are two things left to do: Get the hostages home and bring the war to an end with an understanding of what will follow,' he said. Meanwhile, officials with the U.S., Israel and Egypt confirmed that a proposal for a limited cease-fire and hostage release has been discussed in recent days. No sign of a breakthrough after killing of Hamas leader The United States sees a new opportunity to revive cease-fire efforts after the killing of top Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar by Israeli forces in Gaza last week. But there’s no indication that the warring parties have modified their demands since talks stalled over the summer. There was also no immediate sign of a breakthrough after Blinken met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other top Israeli officials on Tuesday. Israel blamed the failure of talks on Sinwar's hard-line stance, but Hamas says its demands for a lasting cease-fire, full Israeli withdrawal and the release of a large number of Palestinian prisoners have not changed. Hamas blamed the failure of the talks on Israel's demand for a lasting military presence in parts of Gaza. Talk of a more limited cease-fire and hostage release Egypt has suggested the possibility of a short pause in fighting in which Hamas would release a handful of hostages and humanitarian aid deliveries would be increased, especially in northern Gaza, an Egyptian official told The Associated Press. The official, who was not authorized to brief media and spoke on condition of anonymity, said Egypt and fellow mediator Qatar had discussed the idea with the United States but it was not yet a firm proposal. A senior State Department official confirmed that a proposal for a limited hostage release has been discussed in recent days but that no determination had been made, even after Blinken's meetings with Israeli officials and families of the hostages on Tuesday. An Israeli official said Israel's Security Cabinet had discussed an Egyptian initiative centered on a 12-day cease-fire and the release of six hostages. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the closed-door talks. There was no immediate comment from Hamas, which has rejected such ideas in the past, saying it is intent on ending the war. It is still holding around 100 hostages captured in its Oct. 7, 2023, attack that triggered the war, around a third of whom are believed to be dead. Israel is warned on aid during offensive in northern Gaza Israel has dramatically reduced the amount of humanitarian aid allowed into Gaza as it wages another major operation in the territory's hard-hit north. Blinken reiterated a warning that hindering humanitarian aid could force the U.S. to scale back the crucial military support it has provided to Israel since the war began. 'There’s progress made, which is good, but more progress needs to be made,' he told reporters, without elaborating. The U.N. humanitarian office says Israel has severely restricted aid operations since the start of its offensive in Jabaliya, a densely populated urban refugee camp in northern Gaza dating back to the 1948 war surrounding Israel's creation. It said one critical mission, to rescue around 40 people trapped in the rubble in Jabaliya, had been repeatedly denied since Friday. Northern Gaza, including Gaza City, was the first target of Israel's ground operation and has been encircled by Israeli forces since late last year. Most of the population heeded Israeli evacuation warnings early in the war, but an estimated 400,000 people have stayed. The U.N. estimates that 60,000 people have been displaced within northern Gaza since the start of the operation in Jabaliya, the latest in a series of mass displacements. The north has been more heavily destroyed than other areas of Gaza, with entire neighborhoods obliterated. Israel has prevented Palestinians who fled the north from returning to their homes, a key demand from Hamas in the cease-fire talks. US urges Israel to distance itself from ‘Generals’ Plan' for Gaza The renewed offensive in the north has raised fears among Palestinians that Israel intends to implement a plan proposed by former generals in which civilians would be ordered to leave the north and anyone remaining would be starved out or killed. Far-right ministers in Netanyahu's Cabinet say Israel should remain in Gaza and re-establish Jewish settlements there. Blinken said the U.S. officials 'fully reject' any Israeli reoccupation of Gaza and that it was not the policy of the Israeli government. The State Department official said Blinken questioned Netanyahu and members of his government about the so-called Generals' Plan. The Israelis denied having such a plan and said the perception of it was damaging, the official said. The official said the Americans pressed the Israelis to publicly distance themselves from it. Hamas-led militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted another 250 when they stormed into southern Israel a year ago. Israel’s offensive has killed over 42,000 Palestinians, according to local health officials, who don’t distinguish combatants from civilians but say more than half the dead are women and children. It has displaced around 90% of Gaza’s population of 2.3 million, forcing hundreds of thousands into squalid tent camps. ___ Magdy reported from Cairo.

Fresh tension grips Bangladesh as student protesters demand president's resignation	DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) — Political tension in Bangladesh grew Wednesday after a leading student group called for the country’s figurehead president to resign over his comments that appeared to call into question former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's resignation in August. The interim government was expected to hold a Cabinet meeting to discuss the issue Thursday, while student protesters accused President Mohammed Shahabuddin of collaborating with Hasina’s 'fascist' regime. The Anti-Discrimination Student Movement set a two-day deadline for Shahabuddin to step down. Hundreds of protesters rallied in the capital, Dhaka, on Tuesday and into Wednesday while others attempted to storm the presidential palace. Police and witnesses said security officials used stun grenades to disperse people. Shahabuddin told a Bengali-language newspaper earlier this week that he had not seen Hasina’s resignation letter as she fled to India in August during a student-led uprising. An interim government led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus took power and formed a government after Hasina stepped down on Aug. 5. Shahabuddin told the Manab Zamin daily that he only heard about Hasina’s resignation but had not seen the letter, saying he tried to collect it 'many times but failed.' He added: 'Maybe she did not have the time.' The statement infuriated the Yunus-led government and student activists. It contradicted Shahabuddin's address to the nation on Aug. 5, when he said he had received the letter. Under Bangladesh’s constitution, an elected prime minister must submit his or her resignation in writing to the president. Shahabuddin was appointed to the post by parliament after Hasina was elected prime minister for a fourth consecutive term in January. Shahabuddin dissolved parliament before the interim government took power on Aug. 8. Asif Nazrul, the country’s law adviser, recently accused Shahabuddin of spreading falsehoods and questioned if he was fit to remain in office. Experts said the resignation or removal of the president could create a constitutional vacuum. Under the constitution, only parliament can impeach the president. A senior leader of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, which is led by Hasina's main rival and former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, met with Yunus on Wednesday. 'If the associates of the fallen autocracy attempt to create any constitutional and political crisis, the pro-democracy and agitating political parties and different organizations will deal with it unitedly,' Nazrul Islam Khan, a standing committee member of the party, told reporters. Also on Wednesday, the Ministry of Home Affairs in a notice banned the Bangladesh Chhatra League, an influential student wing of Hasina’s Bangladesh Awami League party, with immediate effect, saying the government made the decision following the country’s Anti-Terrorism Act. The notice said the government has evidence that the 76-year-old student body has been involved in 'subversive' activities against the state since Hasina stepped down. It did not share the evidence. The decision came a day after the Anti-Discrimination Student Movement issued a seven-day ultimatum to the government to ban the group. Hasina is now in India, but the Yunus-led government has said it would seek her expatriation to try her for alleged crimes against humanity.	https://apnews.com/article/bangladesh-president-resignation-muhammad-yunus-sheikh-hasina-b65b740b014f12aff2d7043650e6f7b2	2024-10-22T22:52:10-07:00	
Sensational mass trial shines a dark light on rape culture in France	AVIGNON, France (AP) — They are, on the face of it, the most ordinary of men. Yet they’re all on trial charged with rape. Fathers, grandfathers, husbands, workers and retirees — 50 in all — accused of taking turns on the drugged and inert body of Gisèle Pelicot while her husband recorded the horror for his swelling private video library. The harrowing and unprecedented trial in France is exposing how pornography, chatrooms and men’s disdain for or hazy understanding of consent is fueling rape culture. The horror isn’t simply that Dominique Pelicot, in his own words, arranged for men to rape his wife, it’s that he also had no difficulty finding dozens of them to take part. Among the nearly two dozen defendants who testified during the trial's first seven weeks was Ahmed T. — French defendants’ full last names are generally withheld until conviction. The married plumber with three kids and five grandchildren said he wasn’t particularly alarmed that Pelicot wasn't moving when he visited her and her now-ex-husband's house in the small Provence town of Mazan in 2019. It reminded him of porn he had watched featuring women who 'pretend to be asleep and don’t react,' he said. Like him, many other defendants told the court that they couldn’t have imagined that Dominique Pelicot was drugging his wife, and that they were told she was a willing participant acting out a kinky fantasy. Dominique Pelicot denied this, telling the court his co-defendants knew exactly what the situation was. Céline Piques, a spokesperson of the feminist group Osez le Féminisme!, or Dare Feminism! said she's convinced that many of the men on trial were inspired or perverted by porn, including videos found on popular websites. Although some sites have started cracking down on search terms such as 'unconscious,' hundreds of videos of men having sex with seemingly passed out women can be found online, she said. Piques was particularly struck by the testimony of a tech expert at the trial who had found the search terms 'asleep porn' on Dominique Pelicot's computer. Last year, French authorities registered 114,000 victims of sexual violence, including more than 25,000 reported rapes. But experts say most rapes go unreported due to a lack of tangible evidence: About 80% of women don’t press charges, and 80% of the ones who do see their case dropped before it is investigated. In stark contrast, the trial of Dominique Pelicot and his 50 co-defendants has been unique in its scope, nature and openness to the public at the victim’s insistence. After a store security guard caught Pelicot shooting video up unsuspecting women’s skirts in 2020, police searched his home and found thousands of pornographic photos and videos on his phone, laptop and USB stick. Dominique Pelicot later said he had recorded and stored the sexual encounters of each of his guests, and neatly organized them in separate files. Among those he had over was Mahdi D., who testified that when he left home on the night of Oct. 5, 2018, he didn’t intend to rape anyone. 'I thought she was asleep,' the 36-year-old transportation worker told the panel of five judges, referring to Gisèle Pelicot, who has attended nearly every day of the trial and has become a hero to many sexual abuse victims for insisting that it be public. 'I grant you that you did not leave with the intention of raping anyone,' the prosecutor told him. 'But there in the room, it was you.' Like a few of the other men accused of raping Pelicot between 2011 and 2020, Mahdi D. acknowledged almost all of the facts presented against him. And he expressed remorse, telling the judges, 'She is a victim. We can’t imagine what she went through. She was destroyed.' But he wouldn’t call it rape, even if admitting that it was might get him a lighter sentence. That led prosecutors to ask the court to screen the graphic videos of Mahdi D.'s visit to the Pelicot home. In June, authorities took down the chatroom where they say Dominique Pelicot and his co-defendants met. Since the trial started on Sept. 2, it has resonated far beyond the Avignon courtroom's walls, sparking protests in French cities big and small and inspiring a steady flow of opinion pieces and open letters penned by journalists, philosophers and activists. It has also drawn curious visitors to the city in southeastern France, such as Florence Nack, her husband and 23-year-old daughter, who made the trip from Switzerland to witness the 'historical trial.' Nack, who noted that she, too, was a victim of sexual violence, said she was disturbed by the testimony of 43-year-old trucker Cyprien C., a defendant who spoke that day in court. Asked by the head judge, Roger Arata, whether he recognized the facts, Cyprien C. answered that he 'did not contest the sexual act.' 'And the rape?' Arata pressed. The defendant stood silently before eventually responding, 'I can’t answer.' Arata then began to describe what was on the videos implicating him. They are only shown as a last resource and on a case-by-case basis. But for many in the courtroom, such detailed descriptions can last several minutes and be just as heavy as watching them. Gisèle Pelicot, who is in her early 70s, has chosen to remain in the courtroom while the videos are shown. Unable to watch, she usually closes her eyes, stares at the floor, or buries her face in her hands. Experts and groups working to combat sexual violence say the defendants’ unwillingness or inability to admit to rape speaks loudly to taboos and stereotypes that persist in French society. For Magali Lafourcade, a judge and general secretary of the National Consultative Commission of Human Rights who isn’t involved in the trial, popular culture has given people the wrong idea about what rapists look like and how they operate. 'It’s the idea of a hooded man with a knife whom you don’t know and is waiting for you in a place that is not a private place,' she said, noting that this 'is miles away from the sociological, criminological reality of rape.' Two-thirds of rapes take place at private homes, and in a vast majority of cases, victims know their rapists, Lafourcade said. It can be difficult at times to reconcile the facts with the personalities of the accused — described by loved ones as loving, generous and considerate companions, brothers and fathers. Cyril B.’s tearful older sister told the court: 'It’s my brother, I love him. He’s not a mean person.' His partner described him as 'kind, his heart on his sleeve and full of attention.' She insisted that he isn’t 'macho' and that he had never forced her to do anything sexually that she wasn’t comfortable with. Although Lafourcade does not believe 'all men are rapists,' as some have concluded the trial shows, she said that unlike the #MeToo accusations that have ensnared French celebrities, the Pelicot case 'makes us understand that in fact rapists could be everyone.' 'For once, they’re not monsters — they’re not serial killers on the margin of society. They are men who resemble those we love,' she said. 'In this sense, there is something revolutionary.'	https://apnews.com/article/france-pelicot-trial-rape-culture-b846c0258e90daed7989693ef308547c	2024-10-22T22:13:42-07:00	
Middle East latest: Sirens sound across Tel Aviv as projectiles are intercepted near Blinken's hotel	Air raid sirens echoed across Tel Aviv on Wednesday as United States Secretary of State Antony Blinken prepared to end a visit. Smoke, apparently from an intercepted projectile, could be seen in the sky above the hotel where Blinken was staying. Blinken urged Israel to use its recent tactical victories against Hamas to seek a war-ending deal and bring back dozens of hostages, before leaving Wednesday for Saudi Arabia as part of his 11th visit to the region since the start of the Israel-Hamas war. Both sides appear to be dug in. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has pledged to annihilate Hamas and recover dozens of hostages held by the group. Hamas says it will only release the captives in return for a lasting cease-fire, a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and the release of Palestinian prisoners. On Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas-led militants blew holes in Israel’s security fence and stormed in, killing some 1,200 people — mostly civilians — and abducting another 250. Israel’s offensive in Gaza has killed over 42,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities, who do not differentiate between militants and civilians. The war has destroyed large areas of Gaza and displaced about 90% of its population of 2.3 million people. On Wednesday, the World Health Organization postponed the third phase of a polio vaccine campaign in the besieged Gaza Strip, saying the current conditions made it 'impossible for families to safely bring their children for vaccination.' ___ Here's the latest: Blinken to meet with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman RIYADH, Saudi Arabia — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is set to meet Wednesday with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in Riyadh as tensions in the region continue to intensify with no breakthrough on a ceasefire deal. The meeting is one of many Blinken will have with Arab officials in the next few days as the U.S. struggles to achieve some sort of progress just two weeks before the presidential election and in the final stretch of President Joe Biden’s administration. The two are expected to discuss the growing concerns over humanitarian aide for Gaza as well as a post-war plan for Palestinians. Multiple buildings in Lebanon hit i n coastal city hit in airstrike TYRE, Lebanon — Israeli jets struck multiple buildings in the coastal city of Tyre on Wednesday, sending large clouds of black smoke into the air. The state-run National News Agency reported that an Israeli strike on the nearby town of Maarakeh killed three people. There were no immediate reports of casualties in Tyre. Tyre, a provincial capital, had largely been spared in the Israel-Hezbollah war that erupted last month after nearly a year of escalating tensions, but strikes in and around the city have intensified recently. The Israeli military issued evacuation warnings a few hours prior for dozens of buildings in the heart of the coastal city. It told residents to move north of the Awali River, dozens of kilometers (miles) to the north. The buildings are surrounded by ancient historical sites and beach resorts. Avichay Adraee, an Israeli military spokesman, said on the platform X that there were Hezbollah assets in the area of the evacuation warning, without elaborating or providing evidence. First responders from Lebanon’s Civil Defense used loudspeakers to warn residents to evacuate the area and helped older adults and others who had difficulty leaving. World Health Organization postpones third phase of polio vaccination campaign DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — The World Health Organization on Wednesday said it and other aid agencies had to postpone the third phase of a polio vaccine campaign in the besieged Gaza Strip due to the ongoing war there. The WHO issued a statement saying the decision was made in concert with UNICEF, the United Nations' Palestinian aid agency UNRWA, Palestinian officials and others after the inoculations were to begin Wednesday. 'The current conditions, including ongoing attacks on civilian infrastructure continue to jeopardize people’s safety and movement in northern Gaza, making it impossible for families to safely bring their children for vaccination, and health workers to operate,' a WHO statement said. It added: 'Given that the area currently approved for temporary humanitarian pauses was substantially reduced — now limited only to Gaza City, a significant decrease from the first round — many children in northern Gaza would have missed out on the polio vaccine dose.' The WHO said this phase of the vaccinations aimed to vaccinate over 119,000 children across northern Gaza. The campaign began in September after Gaza reported its first polio case in 25 years. Health officials have expressed alarm about disease outbreaks as uncollected garbage piles up and the bombing of critical infrastructure sends putrid water flowing through the streets. Polio is spread through fecal matter. Widespread hunger has left people even more vulnerable to illness. Germany's foreign minister calls for a diplomatic solution to fighting on her visit to Beirut BERLIN — German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock has called for a diplomatic solution to the conflict between Hezbollah and Israel. Baerbock, upon her arrival Wednesday in Beirut, said that 'we must now work with our partners in the USA, Europe and the Arab world to find a viable diplomatic solution that safeguards the legitimate security interests of both Israel and Lebanon.' The foreign minister warned that 'a complete destabilization of the country would be fatal for the most religiously diverse society of all states in the Middle East and also for the entire region.' She also asked all parties involved in the conflict to protect the United Nations peacekeeper troops stationed in the Israeli-Lebanese border region. Baerbock is on her 12th visit to the region since Hamas’ attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. The 5 Nordic countries are ‘deeply concerned’ about legislation that would prevent UNRWA from operating COPENHAGEN, Denmark — The five Nordic countries said Wednesday that they are 'deeply concerned' by bills introduced to Israel's parliament that, if passed, would prevent the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees from operating in the West Bank, east Jerusalem and Gaza. In early October, an Israeli parliamentary committee approved two bills that would sever Israeli government ties with UNRWA, ban UNRWA activity on Israel territory and strip it of legal immunities. The bills passed preliminary approvals by a large margin but must pass several more readings before they become law. A joint letter signed by the foreign ministers of Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden said that if the U.N. body 'would no longer be able to exercise its core tasks' it could further destabilize the situation in the region, 'and may fundamentally jeopardize the prospects for a two-state solution.' In the letter, they 'strongly urge Israel to ensure continued and unhindered humanitarian access' to Palestinian refugees for UNRWA. Blinken urges Israel to end war as he leaves for Saudi Arabia TEL AVIV, Israel — Secretary of State Antony Blinken says Israel needs to pursue an 'enduring strategic success' after its recent tactical victories against Hamas, urging it to seek a deal to end the war and bring back dozens of hostages. He spoke to reporters Wednesday before traveling from Israel to Saudi Arabia on his 11th visit to the region since Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack triggered the war in Gaza. The United States hopes to revive cease-fire efforts after the killing of top Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar in an Israeli military operation in Gaza the previous week. But there’s no indication that either of the warring parties have modified their demands since the talks stalled over the summer. Hamas has said its demands have not changed following Sinwar’s death. Blinken, who met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other top officials Tuesday, said he had pressed Israel to allow more humanitarian aid into Gaza and reiterated his warning that the failure to do so could lead to a reduction in U.S. military aid. 'There’s progress made, which is good, but more progress needs to be made,' on that front, he said. Sirens sound across Tel Aviv as projectiles are intercepted near Blinken's hotel TEL AVIV, Israel — Air raid sirens echoed across Tel Aviv on Wednesday as U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken prepared to depart from his hotel to the airport. The Israeli military said it intercepted two projectiles fired from Lebanon. There were no immediate reports of casualties or damage. Smoke, apparently from one of the interceptions, could be seen in the sky above the hotel where Blinken was staying. He is on his 11th visit to the region since the outbreak of the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, hoping to renew cease-fire efforts after the killing of top Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-hezbollah-mideast-latest-23-october-2024-7069fe55933f3be5ea43a0ef09fc6a0f	2024-10-22T21:54:42-07:00	
Villagers are wary of plans to dam a river to ensure Panama Canal's water supply	EL JOBO, Panama (AP) — A long, wooden boat puttered down the Indio River’s chocolate waters carrying Ana María Antonio and a colleague from the Panama Canal Authority on a mission to hear directly from villagers who could be affected by plans to dam the river. The canal forms the backbone of Panama’s economy, and the proposed dam would secure the water needed to ensure the canal’s uninterrupted operation at a time of increasingly erratic weather. It also would flood villages, where about 2,000 people would need to be relocated and where there is opposition to the plan, and curb the flow of the river to other communities downstream. Those living downstream know the mega-project will substantially alter the river, but they hope it will bring jobs, potable water, electricity and roads to their remote communities and not just leave them impoverished. 'We, as the Panama Canal, understand that many of these areas have been abandoned in terms of basic services,' Antonio said. The canal The Panama Canal was completed in 1914 and generates about a quarter of the government's budget. Last year, the canal authority reduced the number of ships that could cross daily by about 20% because rains hadn’t replenished the reservoirs used to operate the locks, which need about 50 million gallons of fresh water for each ship. It led to shipping delays, and in some cases companies looking for alternatives. By the time restrictions were lifted this month, demand had fallen. To avoid a repeat due to drought exacerbated by climate change, the plan to dam the Indio River was revived. It received a boost this summer with a ruling from Panama’s Supreme Court. For years, Panama has wanted to build another reservoir to supplement the main supply of water from Lake Gatun — a large manmade lake and part of the canal’s route — but a 2006 regulation prohibited the canal from expansion outside its traditional watershed. The Supreme Court’s decision allowed a re-interpretation of the boundaries. The Indio runs roughly parallel to the canal, through the isthmus. The new reservoir on the Indio would sit southwest of Lake Gatun and supplement the water from there and what comes from the much smaller Alhajuela Lake to the east. The Indio reservoir would allow an estimated 12 to 13 additional canal crossings each day. The reservoirs also provide water to the more than 2 million people — half the country’s population — living in the capital. The river Monkeys screeched in the thick jungle lining the Indio on an August morning. The boat weaved around submerged logs below concrete and rough timber houses high on the banks. Locals passed in other boats, the main means of transportation for the area. At the town of El Jobo, Antonio and her colleague carefully climbed the muddy incline from the river to a room belonging to the local Catholic parish, decorated with flowers and bunches of green bananas. Inside, residents from El Jobo and Guayabalito, two communities that won't be flooded, took their seats. The canal authority has held dozens of such outreach meetings in the watershed. The canal representatives hung posters with maps and photos showing the Indio’s watershed. They talked about the proposed project, the Supreme Court’s recent decision, a rough timeline. Antonio said that canal officials are talking to affected residents to figure out their needs, especially if they are from the 37 tiny villages where residents would have to be relocated. Canal authorities have said the Indio is not the only solution they’re considering, but just days earlier canal administrator Ricaurte Catín Vásquez said it would be the most efficient option, because it has been studied for at least 40 years. That’s nearly as long as Jeronima Figueroa, 60, has lived along the Indio in El Jobo. Besides being the area’s critical transportation link, the Indio provides water for drinking, washing clothes and watering their crops, she said. 'That river is our highway and our everything,' she said. The dam's effect on the river's flow was top of mind for the assembled residents, along with why the reservoir is needed, what would the water be used for, which communities would have to relocate, how property titles would be handled, would the construction pollute the river. Puria Nuñez of El Jobo summed up the fears: 'Our river isn’t going to be the same Indio River.' Progress Kenny Alexander Macero, a 21-year-old father who raises livestock in Guayabalito, said it was clear to him that the reservoir would make the canal a lot of money, but he wanted to see it spur real change for his family and others in the area. 'I’m not against the project, it’s going to generate a lot of work for people who need it, but you should be sincere in saying that ‘we’re going to bring projects to the communities that live in that area,’' he said. 'We want highways. Don’t try to fool us.' One complication was that while the canal authorities would be in charge of the reservoir project, the federal government would have to carry out the region's major development projects. And the feds weren’t in the room. The project is not a guarantee of other benefits. There are communities along Lake Gatun that don’t have potable water. Gilberto Toro, a community development consultant not involved in the canal project, said that the canal administration is actually more trusted by people than Panama’s federal government, because it hasn’t been enmeshed in as many scandals. 'Everybody knows that the canal projects come with a seal of guarantee,' Toro said. 'So a lot of people want to negotiate with the canal in some way because they know what they’re going to offer isn’t going to be trinkets.' Figueroa expressed similar faith in the canal administrators, but said that residents would need to monitor them closely to avoid being overlooked. 'We can’t keep living far behind like this,' she said. 'We don’t have electricity, water, healthcare and education.' Next steps President José Raúl Mulino has said a decision about the Indio River project would come next year. The canal administration ultimately will decide, but the project would require coordination with the federal government. No public vote is necessary, but the canal administrator has said they are looking to arrive at a public consensus. Opposition has emerged, not surprisingly, in communities that would be flooded. Among those is Limon, where the canal representatives parked their car and boarded a boat to El Jobo. It’s where the reservoir’s dam would be constructed. The highway only arrived there two years ago and the community still has many needs. Olegario Hernández has had a sign out in front of his home in Limon for the past year that says: 'No to the reservoirs.' The 86-year-old farmer was born there and raised his six children there. His children all left the area in search of opportunities, but Hernández wants to stay. 'We don’t need to leave,' Hernández said, but the canal administration 'wants to kick us out.'	https://apnews.com/article/panama-canal-indio-river-dam-villagers-6f10f8a297f93a93bc610efd4fc639ff	2024-10-22T20:04:05-07:00	
Asian stocks are mixed following a quiet day on Wall Street	HONG KONG (AP) — Asian stocks were mixed on Wednesday under pressure from a rising U.S. dollar and the uncertainties over the U.S. election. U.S. futures and oil prices fell due to escalating geopolitical tensions after Israel announced that an airstrike outside Beirut earlier this month killed a Hezbollah official who had been expected to succeed the group’s longtime leader after he died in an Israeli strike last month. In Asia, Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 slipped 0.3% to 38,300.81 as the dollar rose against the Japanese yen. Tokyo Metro Co.’s stock surged 43% during its trading debut on early Wednesday. The company raised 348.6 billion yen ($2.3 billion) in its initial public offering, making it Japan’s largest IPO since SoftBank Corp. went public in 2018. Chinese markets rose for a second day after the central bank cut its one-year and five-year Loan Prime Rates on Monday. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng added 1.7% to 20,841.73, and the Shanghai Composite gained 0.8% to 3,311.87. State media have reported that a state-backed think tank has proposed issuing 2 trillion yuan ($281 billion) in special government bonds to create a market stabilization fund aiming to further ease the hidden debt pressures and inject confidence into the market. 'Yet, despite the bold proposal, there’s a sense that Beijing remains in reactionary mode, playing catch-up rather than getting ahead of the game,' Stephen Innes, managing partner at SPI Asset Management, said in a commentary. Elsewhere, Australia’s S&amp;P/ASX 200 was almost unchanged at 8,207.20. South Korea’s Kospi was 1.3% higher at 2,594.23. Taiwan's Taiex slipped 0.8%, while the Sensex in India gained 0.2%. On Tuesday, the S&amp;P 500 edged down less than 0.1% to 5,851.20. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped less than 0.1% to 42,924.89. The Nasdaq composite rose 0.2% to 18,573.13. Stocks have slowed their record-breaking momentum this week under increasing pressure from rising Treasury yields in the bond market. The yield on the 10-year Treasury held steady at 4.20%, where it was late Monday. That’s well above the 4.08% level it was at just on Friday. Higher yields for Treasurys can make investors less willing to pay high prices for stocks, which critics say already look too expensive. Treasury yields have been climbing following a raft of reports showing the U.S. economy remains stronger than expected. That’s good news for Wall Street, because it bolsters hopes that the economy can escape from the worst inflation in generations without the painful recession that many had worried was inevitable. 'What appears to be unfolding before our eyes is a soft-landing scenario only the most optimistic dream of,' according to Gregory Daco, EY chief economist. But it also is forcing traders on Wall Street to ratchet back expectations for how much the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates. The central bank has made the drastic shift to lowering interest rates in hopes of keeping the economy strong, but a more resilient-than-expected economy wouldn’t need as much help. Traders are now largely expecting the Fed to cut its main interest rate by half a percentage point more through the end of the year, according to data from CME Group. A month ago, some of those same traders were betting on the federal funds rate ending the year as much as half a percentage point lower than that. In energy trading, benchmark U.S. crude shed 10 cents to $71.64 a barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, fell 9 cents to $75.95 a barrel. In currency trading, the U.S. dollar rose to 152.00 Japanese yen from 151.03 yen. The euro fell to $1.0802 from $1.0803. ___ AP Business Writer Stan Choe contributed.	https://apnews.com/article/stock-markets-rates-tokyo-yen-acd1c0b379dbe53978f2e3e6d05e588e	2024-10-22T19:45:07-07:00	
With or without the far right in power, Austria's links with Russia cause concern among allies	VIENNA (AP) — Tens of thousands of devastated Swifties trading friendship bracelets, wearing sparkly dresses and singing songs in the streets of Vienna. Workers taking down the Taylor Swift stage inside an empty stadium. This was the scene at the beginning of August in the Austrian capital after organizers abruptly canceled Swift’s three shows over threats of an attack by Islamic State group militants. Intelligence-sharing was instrumental in preventing a tragedy, Austrian and U.S. officials said. But it relies on mutual trust — confidence that secrets will not fall into the wrong hands or be leaked to hostile governments. Austria’s Western allies have grown increasingly worried about this possibility in recent weeks. The country’s political parties have maintained an openness to Russia for decades — part of a traditional foreign policy of neutrality — but none more so than the far-right Freedom Party, which secured the largest share of the vote in last month’s national elections. If the Freedom Party is part of Austria’s next government, some analysts warn that intelligence-sharing could be drastically restricted, if not stopped altogether. For now, the center-right People’s Party has a mandate to form a governing coalition. Negotiations will be held in the weeks and months ahead without the Freedom Party since the conservatives and all other parties have ruled out governing with the far right. But if those negotiations fail, the Freedom Party will be waiting in the wings. ____ This story, supported by the Pulitzer Center for Crisis Reporting, is part of an ongoing Associated Press series covering threats to democracy in Europe. ____ Austrian and U.S. officials confirmed that intelligence-sharing was instrumental in preventing a tragedy. But that kind of exchange of information relies on mutual trust – confidence that secrets will not fall into the wrong hands or be leaked to hostile governments. In the case of the U.S. and most of the EU, those hostile governments include Russia. In February 2018, when Freedom Party leader Herbert Kickl was interior minister, several foreign intelligence services cut Austria out from intelligence sharing as a result of a police raid that his ministry ordered on its own domestic intelligence agency. The raid, which was ruled illegal by an Austrian court in August 2018,shocked the country. It prompted a parliamentary inquiry and led to the agency being shut down. A Russian role? It is still unclear if or to what extent Russia could have pulled the strings. Beate Meinl-Reisinger, who heads the liberal Neos party in Austria, told a news conference in May that Kickl and the Freedom Party in 2018 either knowingly agreed to work for Russia’s interests or acted as 'useful idiots.' The parliamentary inquiry found that senior officials at the Ministry of Interior, at the time headed by Kickl, played an active role by using accusations against senior government and intelligence officials in an anonymous dossier to push prosecutors to sign off on the raid. Kickl has denied any wrongdoing. The accusations in the dossier, including corruption, the mishandling of sensitive data and sexual harassment, went up in smoke, but after four years of investigation, it’s still not clear who compiled and leaked the document. Austrian media report that investigators are pursuing whether Egisto Ott, a disgruntled former intelligence official suspected of spying for Russia, may have compiled the dossier in an effort to undermine the intelligence service, possibly because of his own frustrations with the agency. Green Party lawmaker David Stögmüller said that by pushing for the raid, the Freedom Party 'wanted to smash the domestic intelligence agency and create something new with faces close to their own party.' The party’s alleged attempts to reshape the domestic intelligence agency were only disrupted after its then-leader was forced to resign after being caught on video apparently offering public contracts in return for campaign donations The raid’s repercussions are still being felt. German lawmakers have said their government should review its cooperation with Austria if the Freedom Party is part of the new government. 'In light of the massive danger posed by Russia to peace and stability in Europe, we cannot allow relevant information to be handed over directly to Russia,' Konstantin Kuhle from the liberal FDP and a member of the intelligence oversight committee in the German parliament told German newspaper Handelsblatt earlier this month. 'Should the far-right Freedom Party become part of the next government and be given control over the intelligence agencies again, the trust of foreign intelligence services will certainly be up for debate again,' said Thomas Riegler, an espionage expert affiliated with the Austrian Center for Intelligence, Propaganda and Security Studies. Among the items seized in the illegal 2018 raid was a copy of the so-called Neptune Database — a hard drive containing sensitive information shared by foreign intelligence agencies with Austria. 'The mistrust foreign partners have of the Freedom Party is rooted in the party’s relationship with Russia,' Rieger said. The Freedom Party calls for an end to sanctions against Russia. It is critical of Western military aid to Ukraine, and signed a friendship agreement in 2016 with Putin’s United Russia Party that it now claims has expired. But the Freedom Party is not the only one to have enabled Russian influence. Mainstream parties have also played their part, at the risk of undermining Austrian and European security. This has a lot to do with Austria’s post-war history. Austria, which was annexed by Nazi Germany in the run-up to World War II, declared neutrality after the war under pressure from Western allies and the Soviet Union. It sought a role as a mediator between East and West, developing ties with Moscow that outlasted the Cold War. 'Austria’s neutrality, the many international organizations in Vienna, its geostrategic location and lenient espionage laws all have turned Austria into a hotbed for Russian and other espionage,' Riegler said. Espionage is only explicitly banned if directed against Austria itself, not if it targets other countries or international organizations. Since 2020, 11 Russian diplomats suspected of spying have been told to leave Austria. In contrast, Germany closed down four out of five Russian consulates last year. As of March 2024, Russia had 142 diplomats and 116 administrative and technical personnel accredited in Austria. Approximately 25% are likely spies, said an Austrian intelligence official, who requested anonymity to discuss the sensitive topic. The true number is likely higher: it may include diplomats’ relatives and employees of semi-official institutions such as schools, airlines offices or media organizations, the official added. 'The reluctance of the Austrian Foreign Ministry to expel more Russian diplomats is a scandal and poses a security risk for the country,' said Stephanie Krisper, whose NEOS party champions a tougher stance towards Russia. Austria’s foreign ministry says the number of Russian diplomats expelled is 'in the median of the European field.' In a written response to The Associated Press, Foreign Minister Alexander Schallenberg said: 'My position is very clear: International law is the basis of my actions. As the first Austrian Foreign Minister ever, I have not shied away from taking appropriate measures and expelled diplomats whenever it is brought to my attention that they have engaged in acts incompatible with their diplomatic status.' But in its 2023 annual report, Austria’s domestic intelligence agency DSN emphasized the danger of Russian and other espionage. Radar and satellite installations on the roofs of Russian diplomatic representations in Vienna are used for gathering intelligence on European NATO states, it said, thereby leading to a 'loss of reputation' for Austria. 'Austria lets espionage happen on its soil that is directed against the security interests and values of European and other partner states,' said a senior European diplomat who requested anonymity to discuss the sensitive topic. Given the historical connections between Austria and Russia, the situation is unlikely to change much, no matter who is in the next government, the diplomat said.	https://apnews.com/article/austria-democracy-freedom-party-russia-kickl-espionage-a8e5e67808ad691d09e03fba10bacc4d	2024-10-22T19:05:31-07:00	
How a nearly extinct crocodile species returned from the brink in Cambodia	PHNOM TAMAO, Cambodia (AP) — A tiny snout poked out to widen the crack of the slowly shattering eggshell. The Siamese crocodile was taking its time, lagging others that had already wriggled out, chirping, into the sand. Adults can be up to 4 meters (13 feet) long and weigh up to 350 kilogram (770 pounds). They have few natural predators. But these hatchlings — each roughly the size of a New York hotdog — are vulnerable and their chorus of shrill calls was a signal for mothers to protect them and for stragglers to catch up. Hor Vichet, a zookeeper at the nonprofit Fauna and Flora's breeding center for the critically endangered reptiles in Cambodia’s Phnom Tamao, broke the rest of the shell. 'It's time to go into the world,' he said. Siamese crocodiles are making an unlikely comeback. Once widespread across Southeast Asia, demand for leather made from their skins decimated wild populations in the last century. Thousands were hunted or captured for breeding at farms. By the late nineties, they were thought to be extinct. But a 2000 survey in the Cardamom Mountains in western Cambodia found a vestige of a wild population. These misty rainforests were among the last strongholds of Khmer Rouge guerrillas who fought the government until 1999. That, combined with the reverence of local Indigenous communities saved this lingering enclave of crocodiles. But they were still too few and too scattered to recover the population. Conservationists realized that saving the species would require captive breeding of purebred, fertile crocodiles. The crocodile farmers who had nearly hunted the species to extinction now play a vital role in that effort. Today there are about 1,000 Siamese crocodiles in the wild, roughly 400 in Cambodia and the rest scattered in Vietnam, Laos, Thailand and Indonesia. Protecting the reptile also requires safeguarding its habitat in the Cardamom Mountains -– a diverse ecosystem that is one of the last surviving rainforests in Southeast Asia. It stretches over an area larger than Denmark, helping to trap earth-warming greenhouse gases from the atmosphere. The efforts are finally paying off: The first crocodiles were reintroduced into the wild in 2012 and they have begun breeding in the wild: over a hundred eggs were discovered in the forests in July, the most so far. 'We are still far from being able to say the species is in a good place,' admitted Pablo Sinovas of Fauna and Flora. 'But it is making progress.' The conservationists faced big challenges when they began their project in 2011. There were over 1.5 million crocodiles languishing in farms across Cambodia, Thailand and Vietnam, but few were purebreds. Farmers had bred Siamese crocodiles with larger, more aggressive species to get skins with textures demanded by fashion brands. Releasing those hybrids into the wild might hasten the disappearance of the purebred species. It also could pose a threat to people. Evidence of Cambodian reverence for Siamese crocodiles lives on in toothy carvings on the walls of the Bayon temple in the country’s Angkor Wat temple complex, but the hybrids are not the same animals. 'That would be a problem since some of these species are aggressive to humans. And you don’t want them in the wild,' he said. So the experts scoured through crocodile farms across Cambodia, working with farmers and scientists to find purebreds. The few that were eventually identified were brought to the wildlife center at Phnom Tamao to breed in captivity. Their eggs were were incubated artificially and the first group of 18 purebred young crocodiles was released in the Cardamom Mountains, laying the foundation for resurrecting the species. Crocodiles are social species and once together, they 'find their own hierarchy,' said Iri Gill, who manages cold-blooded animals at the Chester Zoo in the U.K., which supports the breeding program. After the breeding season, females lay eggs which are then kept in an artificial incubator where humidity and temperatures are monitored carefully to replicate the conditions of a nest in the wild. 'That is the key stage to hatch those juveniles out and raise them to a strong age before their release,' said Gill. A similar captive breeding program was also instrumental in bringing back crocodile populations in India, after they were nearly wiped out by the early 1970s, said Yashendu Joshi, a crocodile researcher at the Indian nonprofit Centre for Wildlife Studies. In the wild, fewer than 1 in 20 crocodile hatchlings make it to adulthood. Their chances of survival increase exponentially if they're released after they grow to a meter (3.4 feet) long. 'That’s why these captive breeding programs have been working across the world,' he said. Today, demand for crocodile leather has diminished and many of the farms had been losing money since the pandemic, said crocodile farmer Ry Lean. Dozens of large crocodiles bask in pens around the home where the 73-year-old lives with her extended family. Her shop sells souvenirs like crocodile skulls stacked in shelves like books, glass cases overflowing with canines, mounds of crocodile jerky and lacquered bodies of baby crocodiles drying in the sun. But tourism has dwindled since the pandemic and rising fish prices make it harder to feed the reptiles, Lean said. 'I am stuck with this business and the crocodiles,' she said, adding that a large crocodile used to fetch up to $1,500. Now she’d be lucky to get $150. Conservationists still scout the farms searching for purebred Siamese crocodiles. They are also working to protect the habitats where the purebred juveniles are released. In 2001-23, Cambodia lost nearly a third of its tree cover, according to Global Forest Watch — a platform run by the non-profit World Resources Institute. The Siamese crocodile’s role as a flagship species — chosen to represent an environmental cause similar to giant pandas in China and tigers in India — helps the cause of protecting the Cardamom Mountains, said Sinovas of Fauna and Flora. It makes no sense to release crocodiles into habitats that cannot support them, he said. 'Protecting habitat is the most important part of this whole project,' he said. ___ Associated Press journalist Sopheng Cheang contributed to this report. ___ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Tropical storm swamps Philippine provinces in widespread flooding and trap people, some on roofs	MANILA, Philippines (AP) — Torrential rain set off by an approaching tropical storm swamped eastern Philippine cities and towns overnight in widespread flooding that trapped people, some on their roofs, and sparked frantic appeals for rescue boats and trucks, officials said Wednesday. The government shut down public schools and government offices, except those urgently needed for disaster response, on the entire main island of Luzon to protect millions of people as Tropical Storm Trami blew closer from the Pacific. The storm was about 310 kilometers (193 miles) east of Baler in the northeastern province of Aurora with sustained winds of 85 kilometers (53 miles) per hour and gusts to 105 kph (65 mph). It was forecast to hit Aurora’s coast Wednesday night. Thousands of villagers have evacuated to emergency shelters in northeastern provinces, and storm warnings were raised in more than two dozen northern and central provinces, including in the densely populated capital of Manila. No fatalities or major injuries have been reported. President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. cancelled all his appointments Wednesday 'to focus on coordinating the government’s comprehensive search and rescue and relief efforts' and would convene an emergency meeting at military headquarters to discuss disaster-mitigation efforts, Communications Secretary Cesar Chavez said. 'People have been stuck on roofs of their houses for several hours now,' former Vice President Leni Robredo, who lives in the northeastern city of Naga, said in a post on Facebook early Wednesday. 'Many of our rescue trucks have stalled due to the floods.' Robredo expressed hopes the flooding would ease at low tide Wednesday morning. Coast guard personnel have been rescuing residents in flooded villages in the eastern provinces of Sorsogon, Albay, Camarines Sur, Catanduanes and outlying regions since Tuesday, but provincial authorities said the number of rescue boats and personnel was not enough. Thousands of passengers and cargo workers were stranded in several seaports after the coast guard said it suspended inter-island ferry services and barred fishing boats from venturing into the increasingly rough seas. 'We need national intervention,' Rep. Luis Raymund Villafuerte of Camarines Sur province told DZRH radio network, saying his flood-prone province has about 50 rescue boats but needs about 200 due to the widespread appeals from villagers to be rescued. Thousands of villagers were evacuated from low-lying communities and landslide-prone areas starting two days ago in Camarines Sur but many more were asking for help. 'Last night, my phone was filled with nonstop calls and text messages from people pleading 'Help us, rescue us,’' Villafuerte said. 'It’s sad when you feel helpless because of this deluge of problems.' In nearby Quezon province, Governor Angelina Tan said floods in some areas reach up to 3 meters (nearly 10 feet) and at least 8,000 villagers have evacuated from low-lying communities. About 20 storms and typhoons batter the Philippines each year. The archipelago also lies in the 'Pacific Ring of Fire,' a region along most of the Pacific Ocean rim where many volcanic eruptions and earthquakes occur, making the Southeast Asian nation one of the world’s most disaster-prone. In 2013, Typhoon Haiyan, one of the strongest recorded tropical cyclones in the world, left more than 7,300 people dead or missing, flattened entire villages, swept ships inland and displaced more than 5 million in the central Philippines.	https://apnews.com/article/philippines-tropical-storm-trami-floods-5a5d3261a0646aa2c233cc63b27e46c4	2024-10-22T16:56:40-07:00

Canadian Cabinet voices support for Trudeau as some Liberals prepare to confront him	TORONTO (AP) — Canada's deputy prime minister said she believes Justin Trudeau has the support of a majority of Liberals in Parliament as some prepare to confront him Wednesday in the hopes of convincing him to step down. Chrystia Freeland and other Cabinet members voiced support for the prime minister on Tuesday ahead of a broader meeting with colleagues. A number of Liberals have signed a letter hoping to persuade Trudeau to step down before the next election. It was unclear how many signed. 'The vast majority of Liberal Members of Parliament support the prime minister, support him as leader of our government, support him as leader of our party and support him as the guy who is going to lead us into the next election,' Freeland said. Freeland said she is more confident of that after meetings in the last 36 hours. The Liberal recently suffered upsets in special elections in districts the party has held for years, raising doubts about Trudeau’s leadership. Losing a district in Canada’s largest city of Toronto, a traditional Liberal stronghold, does not bode well. A number of Liberal lawmakers have said they will not run again. Trudeau has said he will lead the party into the election, which come any time between this fall and October, 2025. His Liberal party must rely on the support of at least one major party in Parliament as the Liberals do not have the majority in the House of Commons. The opposition leader of the Bloc Québécois said his party will work with the Conservatives and NDP parties to bring the Liberals down and force an election if the government doesn't boost old age security payments for seniors. 'The whole story is now: what will Justin Trudeau, superstar, do in the coming days,' Bloc Leader Yves-François Blanchet said. Trudeau's Liberals have been in power since 2015 but Canadians have been frustrated by the cost of living coming out of the COVID-19 pandemic. Trudeau reasserted the country’s liberal identity in 2015 after almost 10 years of Conservative rule. His legacy includes opening the doors wide to immigration. He also legalized cannabis and brought in a carbon tax to fight climate change. 'Anybody who has ever bet against Justin Trudeau is sorry they made that bet the next day,' said Employment Minister Randy Boissonnault. Some Cabinet ministers acknowledged some colleagues don't agree. 'Any time there are voices of dissent we have to deal with them, we have to listen to them carefully,' Labor Minister Stephen MacKinnon said. 'We have to deal with them and present a unified face to Canadians.' Opposition Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre goaded the prime minister about the potential revolt. 'The reality is he can’t administer the government because he’s too busy fighting for his job after nine years,' Poilievre said. Nelson Wiseman, professor emeritus at the University of Toronto, said the shelf life of Canadian prime ministers has been about a decade for the past 75 years. 'Trudeau’s time is up. Scandals over the years have tarnished his image. He deflects or evades rather than answering straight-forward questions. There is a popular appetite for change. Most Canadians have tuned him out,' he said. 'He is the reason why the Liberals went from the wilderness to power in 2015, but it is no longer 2015.' Trudeau’s father, Pierre Trudeau, swept to power in 1968 on a wave of 'Trudeaumania' and led Canada for almost 16 years.	https://apnews.com/article/trudeau-cabinet-liberal-leadership-election-e7a8fc0be9647d887154c4e748aaf8e9	2024-10-22T13:09:39-07:00	
Desperation amid search for survivors of an airstrike on a crowded area near major Beirut hospital	BEIRUT (AP) — Nearly 16 hours after an Israeli airstrike hit across the street from Beirut’s main public hospital, rescuers were still removing debris Tuesday from the overcrowded slum area. An excavator was digging at one of the destroyed buildings, picking out twisted metal and bricks in search for bodies. Residents standing on mounds of debris said an entire family remained missing under the rubble. Mohammad Ibrahim, a Sudanese national, came looking for his brother. 'His mobile phone is still ringing. We are trying to search for him,' he said. 'I don’t know if he is dead or alive.' Hours later, health officials said five bodies had been recovered from under the rubble. At least 18 people were killed, including four children, and at least 60 wounded in the strike that also caused damage across the street at the Rafik Hariri University Hospital, the capital’s main public medical facility. Jihad Saadeh, director of the Rafik Hariri Hospital, said the strike broke several glass windows and the solar panels of the medical facility, which continued to operate despite the damage and the panic. None of the staff was injured. Saadeh said the hospital received no warning of the impending strike, just a few meters (yards) across the street. Neither did the residents of the slum area, where several buildings were crammed and which houses several migrant workers as well as working class Lebanese. The Israeli military said it struck a Hezbollah target, without elaborating. It added had not targeted the hospital itself. It was hard for rescue equipment to reach the area of clustered settlements and dusty narrow roads. Nizar, one of the rescuers, said he had been at the site of the explosion since Monday night. 'It was too dark and there was so much panic,' he said, giving only his first name in line with the rescue team’s regulations. 'People didn’t understand yet what had happened.' The overcrowded slum was covered in debris, furniture and remains of life poking out of the twisted metal and broken bricks. Residents who survived the massive explosion were still in shock, some still searching through the debris with their hands for their relatives or what is left of their lives. Gunmen stood guard at the site. The Lebanese Civil Defense said Tuesday five buildings were destroyed and 12 sustained severe damage. The dead included one Sudanese and at least one Syrian. 'This is a very crowded area; buildings are very close. The destruction is massive,' Nizar said, explaining that the scale of the damage made their rescue effort harder. Across the street, the hospital was still treating a few of the injured. The morgue had received 13 bodies. Hussein al-Ali, a nurse who was there when the attack happened, said it took him a few minutes to realize it was not the hospital that was hit. Dust and smoke covered the hospital lobby. The glass in the dialysis unit, the pharmacy and other rooms in the hospital was shattered. The false roof fell over his and his colleagues' heads. 'We were terrified. This is a crime,' said al-Ali. 'It felt like judgement day.' It took only minutes for the injured from across the street to start streaming in. Al-Ali said he had little time to breathe or reassure his terrified colleagues and the rattled patients. 'Staff and patients thought the strike was here. We fled outside as the injured were coming in,' he said. And when he was done admitting the injured, 'we came out to carry our (killed) neighbors. They are our neighbors.' Ola Eid survived the strike. She helped dig out her neighbors’ children from under the rubble, before realizing she herself was injured. 'The problem is we didn’t feel it. They didn’t inform us. We heard they want to strike al-Sahel hospital,' said Eid, bandaged and still in shock sitting at the hospital gate. Israel had hinted another hospital miles away could possibly be a target, alleging it is housing tunnels used by the Hezbollah militant group. Eid, an actress, said she was playing with her neighbor’s kids when the first explosion hit. It knocked her to the floor and scattered the candy she was handing out to the kids. She stood up, not believing she was still alive, to find her neighbor’s kid soaked in blood. One was killed immediately; the other remained in intensive care. 'I looked ahead and saw the kids torn apart and hurt,' she said. 'The gas canisters were on fire. I didn’t know what to do — put out the fire or remove the kids.'	https://apnews.com/article/lebanon-strike-hospital-israel-rescue-survivors-rubble-da09186fc06d734e0457e6c099f3d992	2024-10-22T10:07:23-07:00	
Mexico announces food and agriculture plan that could take the country back to the 1980s	MEXICO CITY (AP) — Mexico’s new president announced a new agriculture plan Tuesday that could make the country’s food production and distribution look a lot more like it did in the 1980s, when meals in Mexico were dominated by tortillas, beans, instant coffee and cheap hot chocolate. Four decades ago, the ingredients for those meals were often bought at government stores that stocked a few basic goods. President Claudia Sheinbaum pledged Tuesday to revive those often shabby, limited government stores and continue efforts to achieve 'food sovereignty.' 'It is about producing what we eat,' Sheinbaum said of her policy, whose main focus will be on increasing bean and corn production. Sheinbaum appears to have a deep interest in boosting beans. On Monday, she said, 'It is much better to eat a bean taco than a bag of potato chips.' Agriculture Secretary Julio Berdegué said the focus would be on guaranteeing prices for farmers who grow corn used for tortillas and lowering tortilla prices by 10%, after prices jumped a couple of years ago. The government aims to boost bean production by about 30% in six years to replace imports of beans, and will set up research centers to supply higher-yielding bean seeds. 'Self-sufficiency in beans is a goal the president has set for us,' Berdegué said. The government will also focus on supporting coffee production, but mainly for instant coffee, which it claims is used by 84% of Mexican households. The plan will also seek to support cocoa production, but mainly for powdered baking and hot chocolate, not fine chocolate bars. The policies appear to run counter to market trends and what Mexican food sales look like today, when consumption of most of the old basics has fallen. Most Mexicans today shop at modern grocery stores, and consumption of fresh ground coffee, not instant, has increased enormously, accompanied by a boom in specialized coffee chains and shops. Meanwhile, bean consumption has been dropping precipitously for decades in Mexico. According to the government's '2024 Agricultural Panorama' report, Mexicans consume only about 17 pounds (7.7 kilograms) of beans annually. That's less than half of the 35.2 pounds (16 kilograms) consumed per year in 1980. A combination of factors, including the time it takes to cook dried beans, may be behind this. Amanda Gálvez, a researcher at Mexico's National Autonomous University, wrote that 'we look down at beans because it is considered ‘the food of the poor,’ and we are making a serious mistake,' because beans are a good source of protein. However, the health benefits aren't clear: The most common bean recipe in Mexico — refried beans — often contains a considerable dose of lard. Tortilla consumption has also fallen from nearly 220 pounds (100 kilograms) per capita annually in 2000 to about 165 pounds (75 kilograms) in 2024. Consumers have increasingly taken to buying bread and other bakery products instead of tortillas. Apart from the challenge of trying to change consumer habits, the policy also runs counter to market trends. While some countries are trying to encourage high-value varietal and specialized chocolate strains, Mexico is focusing on the cheapest products. While chocolate was first exported to the rest of the world from Mexico, Mexico's own production has fallen dramatically because of plant diseases and a lack of investment. It dropped from almost 50,000 tons in 2003 to about 28,000 tons in 2022. And while most Mexican homes may have a jar of instant coffee in their cupboards, that's not where the tendency — or consumer spending — is headed. According to a Technavio industry report, instant products accounted for only about 37% of the sales value of coffee in Mexico. Sheinbaum's focus on self-sufficiency in oil, energy and foodstuffs is a holdover from her predecessor and political mentor, former President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, who left office on Sept. 30. López Obrador also appears to have passed on his nostalgia for a 1970s-style Mexico — including passenger rail service, state-owned industries, tight-knit families and small corner stores — to Sheinbaum.	https://apnews.com/article/mexico-food-agriculture-plan-beans-nostalgia-1e3bd9d5e1af9e57376d2509e90d1260	2024-10-22T10:00:28-07:00	
Cuba fights to come back from a nationwide blackout, then a storm that killed six	HAVANA (AP) — A small town in far eastern Cuba was recovering Tuesday from flooding that killed at least six people after Oscar crossed the island’s eastern coast as a tropical storm with winds and heavy rain. Cuba's capital was partially illuminated after a large-scale blackout generated a handful of protests and a stern government warning that any unrest would be punished. President Miguel Díaz-Canel said on state television that rescue and recovery work continued in the town of San Antonio del Sur and officials hadn't yet entered some flooded areas. People in Havana collected subsidized food Tuesday and said the country faced an intensive recovery period. 'There are lines everywhere you go,' city resident Carlos López said. 'You get to a place and there are obstacles and obstacles.' Tropical Storm Oscar disintegrated as it headed toward the Bahamas after making landfall in Cuba as a Category 1 hurricane. The remnants were expected to drop up to 4 inches (10 centimeters) of rain across the southeastern Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos Islands. Modesto Hernández, who lived in central Havana, said Tuesday that 'we don’t know anything about what is going on.' 'These problems need to be solved now,' he said. 'We are in bad shape.' Díaz-Canel warned on national television Sunday that 'we're not going to allow any vandalism, or let anyone disturb people's tranquility.' The prolonged nationwide blackout that followed a massive outage Thursday night was part of countrywide energy problems that led to the largest protests in Cuba in almost 30 years, in July 2021. Those were followed by smaller local protests in October 2022 and March 2024. All are part of a deep economic crisis that has prompted the exodus of more than half a million Cubans to the U.S., with thousands more heading to Europe. The Cuban government and its allies blame the United States' 62-year-old trade embargo on the island for its economic problems but White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Monday that the Cuban government’s 'long-term mismanagement of its economic policy and resources has certainly increased the hardship of people in Cuba.' Power remains relatively cheap but increasingly unavailable. The Cuban government on state television Monday night said that it’s producing 1300 megawatts when peak demand can hit 3 gigawatts. Authorities said by Monday afternoon that about 80 percent of Havana had intermittent power but people remained fearful. Energy Minister Vicente de la O Levy said in a news conference he hoped that more reliable electricity would be restored by Tuesday morning but classes remained closed through at least Thursday. He said that Oscar would bring 'an additional inconvenience' to Cuba's recovery since it would affect key Cuban power plants, such as Felton in the city of Holguín, and Renté in Santiago de Cuba. Many of Havana's 2 million people resorted to cooking with improvised wood stoves on the streets before their food went bad in refrigerators. People lined up to buy subsidized food and few gas stations were open. The failure of the Antonio Guiteras plant on Friday was the latest problem with energy distribution in a country where electricity has been restricted and rotated among different regions at different times. The blackout was considered to be Cuba’s worst since Hurricane Ian hit the island as a Category 3 storm in 2022 and damaged power installations. It took days for the government to fix them. Local authorities initially said the outage stemmed from increased demand from small- and medium-sized companies and residential air conditioners. Later, the blackout got worse because of breakdowns in old thermoelectric plants that haven’t been properly maintained, and the lack of fuel to operate some facilities. ___ Associated Press writer Josh Boak in Washington contributed to this report. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america	https://apnews.com/article/oscar-cuba-storm-caribbean-8c07aa1fe2b2b46dc9465a83acbaa745	2024-10-22T09:24:44-07:00	
The little airline that could — Lebanon's national carrier braves Israeli airstrikes	BEIRUT (AP) — Since Israel began bombarding Beirut's southern suburbs as part of its offensive against the Hezbollah militant group, Lebanon's national air carrier has become a local icon simply by continuing to do its job. Middle East Airlines is the only commercial airline still operating out of the Beirut airport, located on the coast next to the densely-populated suburbs where many of Hezbollah's operations are based. Unlike the bruising monthlong war between Israel and Hezbollah in 2006, in which an Israeli strike almost immediately took Lebanon's only commercial airport out of commission, it has not been targeted in the current conflict. Capt. Mohammed Aziz, adviser to MEA chairman Mohamad El-Hout, said the airline has received assurances that Israel won't target its planes or the airport as long as they are used solely for civilian purposes. The carrier conducts a risk assessment each day to determine if it's safe to fly, he said. 'As long as you see us operating, it means our threat assessment says that we can operate,' Aziz said. 'We will never jeopardize the life of anyone.' Still, the sight of jetliners rising and descending as fire and clouds of smoke blacken the Beirut skyline can be alarming. Some of the most dramatic images making the rounds on social media depicting jets landing in fiery hellscapes have been AI-generated. And, Aziz said, the plumes of smoke that appear in news footage are often farther away from the airport than they appear. Still, some strikes have landed too close for comfort. On Monday night, one hit the coastal area of Ouzai, about 200 meters (650 feet) from one of the runways. There were no planes in the area at the time. Since the escalation began, many embassies have chartered extra commercial flights to get their citizens out. Other flights have carried Lebanese citizens to nearby destinations like Turkey and Cyprus to wait out the conflict. The number of daily MEA flights ranges from 32 to 40 — not much below the usual number for this time of year, Aziz said. The difference: now the flights usually depart Beirut full and return two-thirds or three-quarters empty. While many Lebanese have fled, others continue to fly in and out for business or family reasons. Elie Obeid, a business consultant, was scheduled to fly to Brussels this month for a seminar. After his original flight on Turkish Airlines was canceled, he booked on MEA. As his return flight was landing Saturday, heavy airstrikes were underway in the surrounding area. Onboard, Obeid was unaware of what was happening until the plane landed and he opened his phone to a barrage of messages. He said he had mixed feelings about the experience. 'I do appreciate the fact that they are still flying, since that’s our only connection with the outer world currently,' he said. 'But at the same time it is very risky. We should have been told that strikes were happening, and maybe even they could have told the pilot to request to land in Cyprus for a while until the strikes ended.' John Cox, a U.S.-based former airline pilot who is now an aviation-safety consultant, said when there's a potential threat, it's the captain’s call whether or not to proceed, and it’s not unusual for passengers to be left in the dark. Telling them about a threat they can’t control 'doesn’t really do any good, and it stresses them out. So, I would be very hesitant to do that,' he said. But, he added, 'I’m not sure that I want to fly into an area of open conflict like that with passengers on board.' It is 'pretty unusual,' Cox said, for a commercial airline to decide that operating in an active war zone is an 'acceptable level of risk.' 'When you’re in an area with ongoing military operations there’s an awful lot of variables,' he said. 'Even just keeping the airplanes ... so that they’re not in the same airspace at the same time, that becomes very difficult.' Aziz said the airline is in 'continuous coordination' with the Lebanese government and security agencies, and attempts to mitigate the risk by spacing out flights so the airport is not too crowded at any given time. About 20% of its fleet is parked outside of Lebanon to reduce potential damage. They have also taken measures to adjust for the frequent GPS jamming that is used by Israel to ward off missile and drone attacks but also disrupts civilian navigation technology. Other airlines have different considerations, Aziz said. Their trips to Lebanon might be 'one flight out of 200 or 300 flights per day, so spending two or three hours a day just to make a risk assessment for one flight is a waste of time for them,' he said. 'But for us it’s a necessity, because if we don’t do it we’ll stop operation completely.' He added, 'It’s our duty, of course, to maintain this link between Lebanon and the outside world.' For many, having that link is a comfort — even if the journey might be harrowing. Marie-Jose Daoud, editor-in-chief of an online journalism platform, flew to Cyprus with her parents a few days after the massive strike in Beirut's southern suburbs that killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah. As they were waiting for their flight, she saw on the news that the Israeli military had issued evacuation notices for two areas close to the airport. Soon after, she heard the muffled sounds of airstrikes through the airport's soundproofed walls. As the plane took off, the crew and most of the passengers remained calm. One man pointed out the window to show his young son the smoke rising. The plane made it safely to Cyprus. Daoud said her parents want to return home despite the risks, so she is traveling back with them in a few days. She plans to leave again soon after, but she knows she can 'come back at a day's notice' if her family needs her. 'As long as the airport is open, I know that (MEA) are going to be flying,' she said.	https://apnews.com/article/lebanon-israel-hezbollah-middle-east-airlines-mea-4abfae7f6165b7b34083e2512272ce54	2024-10-22T09:09:52-07:00	
AP PHOTOS: Images capture exact moments an Israeli missile strikes building in Beirut	BEIRUT (AP) — Taking cover behind a large tree, an Associated Press photographer pointed his camera toward a Beirut apartment building the Israeli military warned was in its sights. When a missile plunged from the sky moments later, journalist and lens were perfectly positioned to document the trail of destruction — second by second, frame by frame. 'I heard the sound of the missile whistling, headed toward the building and then I started filming,' photographer Bilal Hussein said Tuesday, hours after Israeli forces launched the attack. The images Hussein captured of the projectile, frozen in mid-flight before obliterating the structure, provide a striking look at the speed, power and devastation of modern warfare. The strike on Tuesday came roughly 40 minutes after an Israeli military spokesman posted a warning in Arabic on social media, notifying people in and around a pair of buildings on Beirut’s southern outskirts that that they should evacuate the area. He did not explain why the buildings were being targeted, other than to say they were near 'interests and facilities' associated with the Hezbollah militant group. The warning prompted many people to flee the busy, densely populated neighborhood, even as others, including a few journalists, kept watch. By the time of the attack the building had been evacuated and there were no reports of casualties Tuesday. Minutes before the missile brought down the building, two smaller projectiles were fired at the roof in what Israel’s military often refers to as warning strikes, according to AP journalists at the scene. It is a practice Israel has followed in staging strikes in Gaza during past wars. When the primary missile hurtled toward the building Tuesday it was a blur, but Hussein’s camera provided witness. One picture showed the missile arching through the air. Another captured it a fragment of a second before it smashed through a lower-floor balcony. In the images that followed, a cloud of smoke and debris billowed outward as the building collapsed. Hussein, who has spent years covering conflicts in Iraq and Lebanon since joining the AP in 2004, says he has become accustomed to the sounds of explosions. The night before the building was destroyed, he filmed more than a dozen Israeli strikes nearby, 'I have the ability to control my reactions in critical moments and maintain stability as much as possible,' he said.	https://apnews.com/article/lebanon-beirut-israel-missile-41be424dcf3031457bd93acd0cb3389e	2024-10-22T09:08:04-07:00	
A UN report says it could take 350 years for Gaza to rebuild if it remains under a blockade	U.N. agencies have long warned that it could take decades to rebuild Gaza after Israel's offensive against Hamas, one of the deadliest and most destructive military campaigns since World War II. Now, more than a year into the war, a new report speaks in terms of centuries. The U.N. Conference on Trade and Development said in a report released Monday that if the war ends tomorrow and Gaza returns to the status quo before Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel, it could take 350 years for its battered economy to return to its precarious prewar level. Before the war, Gaza was under an Israeli and Egyptian blockade imposed after Hamas seized power in 2007. Four previous wars and divisions between Hamas and the Western-backed Palestinian Authority in the West Bank also took a toll on Gaza's economy. The current war has caused staggering destruction across the territory, with entire neighborhoods obliterated and roads and critical infrastructure in ruins. Mountains of rubble laced with decomposing bodies and unexploded ordnance would have to be cleared before rebuilding could begin. 'Once a ceasefire is reached, a return to the pre-October 2023 status quo would not put Gaza on the path needed for recovery and sustainable development,' the report said. 'If the 2007–2022 growth trend returns, with an average growth rate of 0.4 percent, it will take Gaza 350 years just to restore the GDP levels of 2022.' Even then, GDP per capita would decline 'continuously and precipitously' as the population grows, it said. Israeli officials did not respond to a request for comment on the report. 350 years is more of a calculation than a prediction Three hundred and fifty years is a long time. It would be as though England and the Netherlands were only now recovering from the wars they fought against each other in the late 1600s. Rami Alazzeh, author of the report, said he based the calculation on the decimation of the economy during the first seven months of the war, and how long it would take to restore it at the GDP growth rate Gaza averaged from 2007 until 2022. Gross domestic product, or GDP, is the sum total of all goods and services produced in a country or territory. 'The message is the recovery in Gaza depends on the conditions in which the recovery would happen,' he said. 'We’re not saying that it will take Gaza 350 years to recover because that means that Gaza will never recover.' At the end of January, the World Bank estimated $18.5 billion of damage — nearly the combined economic output of the West Bank and Gaza in 2022. That was before some intensely destructive Israeli ground operations, including in the southern border city of Rafah. A U.N. assessment in September based on satellite footage found roughly a quarter of all structures in Gaza had been destroyed or severely damaged. It said around 66% of structures, including more than 227,000 housing units, had sustained at least some damage. The Shelter Cluster, an international coalition of aid providers led by the Norwegian Refugee Council, calculated how long it would take to rebuild all the destroyed homes under what was known as the Gaza Reconstruction Mechanism. That process was established after the 2014 war to facilitate some reconstruction under heavy Israeli surveillance. It found that under that setup, it would take 40 years to rebuild all the homes. Even in best-case circumstances, recovery could take decades The report says that even under the most optimistic scenario, with a projected growth rate of 10%, Gaza’s recovery would still take decades. 'Assuming no military operation, and freedom of movement of goods and people and a significant level of investment, and population growth of 2.8 percent per year, UNCTAD estimates that Gaza’s GDP per capita will return to its 2022 level by 2050,' it said. A separate report released by the U.N. Development Program on Tuesday said that with major investment and the lifting of economic restrictions, the Palestinian economy as a whole, including the West Bank, could be back on track by 2034. In the absence of both, its predictions align with those of UNCTAD. The more positive scenarios appear unlikely. Hamas-led militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted another 250 when they stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. Around 100 captives are still inside Gaza, a third of whom are believed to be dead. Israel's offensive has killed over 42,000 Palestinians, according to local health officials, who don't distinguish combatants from civilians but say more than half the dead are women and children. It has displaced around 90% of Gaza's population of 2.3 million, forcing hundreds of thousands into squalid tent camps. Israel says the blockade is needed to prevent Hamas from importing arms and is unlikely to lift it as long as the group has a presence inside Gaza. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said Israel will maintain open-ended security control over the territory. Since May, Israel has controlled all of Gaza's border crossings. U.N. agencies and humanitarian groups say they have struggled to bring in food and emergency aid because of Israeli restrictions, ongoing fighting and the breakdown of law and order inside Gaza. There's also no indication that international donors are willing to fund the rebuilding of Gaza as long as it remains in the grip of war or under Israeli occupation. Arab Gulf states like Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have said they will only do so if there is a pathway to a Palestinian state, something to which Netanyahu is deeply opposed. Meanwhile, the war rages with no end in sight. This month, Israel launched another major operation in northern Gaza — the most heavily destroyed part of the territory — saying Hamas had regrouped there. 'Everybody now calls for a cease-fire, but people forget that once the cease-fire is done, the 2.2 million Palestinians will wake up having no homes, children having no schools, no universities, no hospitals, no roads,' Alazzeh said. All that will take a long time to rebuild, and could prove impossible under the blockade. 'If we go back to where it was before, and we shouldn’t go back to the way it was before,' he said, 'then I think it means that Gaza’s done.' ___ Follow AP’s Gaza coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war	https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-gaza-reconstruction-un-0ac47ddba7401e102b2bb95e85f3e105	2024-10-22T09:06:32-07:00	
Biden heaps praise on Slovenia PM for aiding release of Americans in major US-Russia prisoner swap	WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden heaped praise on Slovenian Prime Minister Robert Golob on Tuesday for his role in the recent seven-nation prisoner swap that freed Americans Evan Gershkovich, Alsu Kurmasheva and Paul Whelan from Russian prison. The deal, completed in August, was the largest U.S.-Russian prisoner swap in post-Soviet history, involving 24 people, many months of negotiations and concessions from other European countries — including Slovenia — that released Russians in their custody as part of the exchange. 'I want to thank you for your diplomacy and for your support and your leadership,' Biden said at the start of his Oval Office meeting with the Central European leader. 'You made it possible. That’s not hyperbole. You made it possible.' Slovenia agreed to the release of Artem Viktorovich Dultsev and Anna Valerevna Dultseva, two Russian spies who were living for years in the Slovenian capital Ljubljana while posing as Argentines operating a startup IT company and an online art gallery. The couple, who had two children, reportedly used Ljubljana as their base to travel to neighboring NATO and EU member states, relay orders from Moscow and bring cash to other Russian sleeper agents. They were arrested in 2022. Golob said the prisoner swap demonstrated that with a 'little help of true friends, nothing is impossible.' He is just the third Slovenian prime minister to be invited to Washington for a White House sit down with a president. Prime Minister Janez Jansa was the country's last prime minister to get a White House meeting with a U.S. president, when George W. Bush hosted him in 2006. (Prime Minister Borut Pahor visited the White House in February 2011 to meet then U.S. Vice-President Biden. During that visit President Barack Obama briefly joined both leaders.) Gershkovich, a Wall Street Journal reporter, had spent 16 months in a Russian prison; Kurmasheva, a Russian-American editor for Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, was also arrested last year; and Whelan, a former U.S. Marine, had been in Russian detention since his 2018 arrest. Russia convicted all three on what the White House rejected as trumped-up charges of espionage for Gershkovich and Whelan and spreading of false information for Kurmasheva. Kremlin critic Vladimir Kara Murza, an American green card holder who won a Pulitzer Prize while in Russian detention, was also released as part of the swap. Kara-Murza, 42, is a Russian politician, author and historian who has been imprisoned in Russia since April 2022. He was convicted of treason last year for denouncing the war in Ukraine. 'We made it clear to anyone who questions whether our allies matter,' Biden said. The two leaders' agenda included talks on the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East, energy security, and their countries' shared approach to the Western Balkans, according to the White House. Golob has also been an outspoken critic of Israel's handling of the war in Gaza. Last month, Golob in his address at the annual gathering of world leaders at the United Nations called on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government to 'stop the bloodshed.' 'Mr. Netanyahu, stop this war now,' he said, pounding the lectern for emphasis. The meeting with Golob comes on the heels of Biden's visit to Berlin last week that was made in part to thank German Chancellor Olaf Scholz for his country's cooperation in the prisoner swap. Scholz agreed to release Vadim Krasikov, a Russian who was convicted of the 2019 murder of a 40-year-old Georgian citizen and later claimed asylum in Germany.	https://apnews.com/article/biden-slovenia-prisoner-exchange-nato-2305a3f501b31c421333fa805cc20cdb	2024-10-22T07:53:59-07:00	
France defends restrictions on Israeli firms supplying Middle East wars and says it's not a boycott	PARIS (AP) — France's government on Tuesday defended its decision to bar Israeli companies supplying the wars in the Middle East from exhibiting at an upcoming trade fair outside Paris. Organizers of the Nov. 4-Nov. 7 naval defense exhibition, called Euronaval, posted on the event's website that Israeli firms can take part in the show and 'may have an exhibition stand, provided that their products are not used in military operations in Gaza and Lebanon.' The organizers attributed the restrictions to French government decisions taken earlier this month. Addressing parliament Tuesday, French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot said the policy doesn't amount to a boycott of Israeli firms. But he also said it would be 'incoherent' for France to allow the promotion of weapons used in the wars when Paris is also pushing for an immediate cease-fire in Gaza and Lebanon. 'Therefore, we have indicated to the Israeli authorities, with whom we communicate very regularly, that the participation in the form of stands by companies should respect this balance,' Barrot said. 'Also, companies whose equipment is not used in offensive actions in Gaza and Lebanon will naturally be able to have stands at the exhibition,' he said. In a post Sunday on X, Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz urged French President Emmanuel Macron to rescind the restrictions, calling them 'unacceptable' and 'anti-democratic.' 'France, as well as the entire Western world, should stand with us -- not against us,' Katz posted. Barrot reiterated that France supports Israel's right to defend itself. The minister cited, as an example, France's decision to continue exporting components that he said are used in Israel's 'Iron Dome' air-defense system. 'On the other hand, it would be incoherent to enable any promotion of weapons used in Gaza and Lebanon, which lead to unacceptable damage for the civilian populations, when this government and our country is calling for an immediate cease-fire,' the French minister said.	https://apnews.com/article/france-israel-euronaval-middle-east-wars-205705adbf8c2e94ea4092f0c85ef34e	2024-10-22T07:00:02-07:00	
Several casualties feared after a gasoline truck explodes by a highway near Uganda's capital	KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) — A Ugandan police spokesman says several people might be dead after a fuel truck exploded next to a highway in the East African country. Patrick Onyango said the truck had overturned after an accident and later exploded in a town just outside Kampala, the capital. A video shared online by an onlooker appeared to show people scooping up fuel from the truck, a dangerous scene that echoed a similar incident in Nigeria last week that killed more than 140 people, including children. People who rush to collect fuel from stricken trucks hope to sell it for money. There have been similar incidents over the years across East Africa. At least 62 people were killed in Tanzania in 2019 as they attempted to siphon fuel out of a damaged truck.	https://apnews.com/article/uganda-fuel-truck-explosion-ae9b329cbd20e0799fab949cf5e8aefe	2024-10-22T06:45:17-07:00	
EU observers flag irregularities and 'alteration of results' in Mozambique elections	JOHANNESBURG (AP) — European Union election observers have flagged irregularities in Mozambique's election as the country awaits the announcement of official results this week amid protests by opposition supporters and the recent killing of two prominent opposition figures. The EU observer mission said Tuesday that some of its 179 election observers deployed to the country had been prevented from observing tabulation processes in some districts, provinces and at national level. The mission also noted 'unjustified alteration' of election results at some polling stations. 'The EU EOM (election observer mission) has continued to observe the electoral process, although EU observers were prevented to observe tabulation processes in some districts and provinces, as well as at the national level. 'To date, the EU EOM has noted irregularities during counting and unjustified alteration of election results at polling station and district level,' chief observer Laura Ballarín said in a statement on Tuesday. Ballarin called on electoral bodies in the country to conduct the tabulation process in a transparent way to ensure the credibility of the election results. 'The publication of disaggregated results by polling stations is not only a matter of good practice, but also a strong safeguard for the integrity of results,' Ballarin said. Tensions around the country's election escalated after the killing of two prominent opposition figures last Friday, followed by protests by opposition supporters on Monday, which were quelled by police firing tear gas at protesters. Elvino Dias, a lawyer and adviser to opposition presidential candidate Venancio Mondlane, was killed when gunmen riddled his car with bullets in the capital, Maputo. Paulo Guambe, the spokesperson for the PODEMOS opposition party that is backing Mondlane, was also in the car and was killed. Mondlane this week called for nationwide protests, alleging that the governing Frelimo party was rigging the election and his supporters faced off with security forces, raising concerns about further election violence once official results have been released. The U.S State Department on Monday condemned the killing of both men and called for a thorough investigation, while urging those aggrieved by election results to file their complaints through official channels. 'We urge all state institutions, political leaders, citizens and stakeholders to resolve electoral disputes peacefully and lawfully, rejecting violence and inflammatory rhetoric. 'We also call on all Mozambicans to turn to peaceful means of filing electoral grievances and reject violence and violent rhetoric,' it said. The election results are expected to be announced this week before being validated by the country's Constitutional Council, which will validate them after handling all the disputes raised by political parties. The governing Frelimo party's candidate, David Chapo, is expected to succeed President Filipe Nyusi as the party leads the polls so far and is expected to extend its 49-year rule. ___ AP Africa news: https://apnews.com/hub/africa	https://apnews.com/article/mozambique-election-irregularities-results-protest-killings-50ea2d587e563dece5454253547897d4	2024-10-22T06:30:02-07:00	
Poland alleges Russian sabotage and is closing one of Moscow's consulates	WARSAW, Poland (AP) — Poland’s foreign minister said Tuesday that he is ordering the closure of one of three Russian consulates in the country in response to acts of sabotage including arson attacks that he said were sponsored by Moscow. Radek Sikorski demanded that Russia stop what he called hybrid war actions against Poland and its Western allies, warning that Poland reserves the right 'to take further decisive action' if they don't stop. 'As the minister of foreign affairs, I have information that the Russian Federation is behind attempts at sabotage, both in Poland and in allied countries,' Sikorski told reporters in Warsaw. He said he was withdrawing consent for the Russian Consulate in Poznan, and that its personnel would be unwelcome in Poland. Russia also has consulates in Gdansk and Krakow. Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova promised 'a painful response to yet another hostile act' in comments to state news agency RIA Novosti. Sikorski cited the arrest in January of a Ukrainian citizen who he said admitted that Russian agents told him to carry out an arson attack in the city of Wroclaw. The attack was foiled, and the 51-year-old man, identified only as Serhii S., is awaiting a court trial. Sikorski alleged that about 20 such sabotage suspects are under investigation in Poland, and that he has knowledge of other such arson plans in allied countries. 'Putin must be deterred,' the foreign minister said in an interview Monday on the private TVN broadcaster. 'We have other such arson attacks all over Europe, all over Europe, and we know about the Russian plans for further arson attacks.' The pro-European Union government in Warsaw says Russia is pursuing acts of hybrid war against Poland and other Western countries in retaliation for their support for Poland's neighbor Ukraine in its struggle against Russia’s invasion. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine	https://apnews.com/article/poland-russia-ukraine-hybrid-war-sabotage-66a7c9c683e00f08dc46e4178776d7b9	2024-10-22T06:28:08-07:00	
Black motorist fatally shot by London police officer in 2022 was a member of a violent gang	LONDON (AP) — A Black motorist killed by a London police marksman who was acquitted of murder this week was a member of a violent gang and allegedly shot a rival a week earlier, according to court records that were allowed to be published Tuesday. Jurors were not told about Chris Kaba’s gang ties during the trial that ended with Sgt. Martyn Blake being found not guilty Monday in the Central Criminal Court. Kaba, 24, was shot on Sept. 5, 2022, after ramming police vehicles during a traffic stop. Police did not know who was driving the vehicle, but it was an Audi Q8 that had been used as a getaway car in an unsolved shooting a night earlier. Blake fired a single round through the windshield of the Audi because he said he thought fellow officers’ lives were in danger. Kaba was found to be unarmed. Prosecutors defended their decision to charge Blake in an exceptionally rare case against a British police officer for a death in the line of duty. They argued at trial that Blake misjudged the risk to his colleagues, exaggerated the threat after the shooting and aimed for Kaba’s head. Blake denied those assertions. A judge had said the details of Kaba's criminal record and alleged involvement in other shootings were irrelevant for jurors to consider in determining whether Blake used unreasonable force. Justice James Goss ordered news media not to report any of those details. Following the trial, the news media challenged Goss' order, and he lifted the restrictions on the information that had emerged during earlier proceedings. The Metropolitan Police supported the release of the information to remove any 'misleading impression' about Kaba's character in the hopes it could quell violence toward officers, particularly on Saturday when an annual demonstration is held in London by family members of people who have died in police custody. 'If the information in relation to Mr. Kaba’s character is shared with the public, those who would seek to provoke anti-police violence would gain less support and the overall likelihood of disorder and the risk to public safety would reduce,' Deputy Assistant Commissioner Stuart Cundy said in a court statement. Kaba’s mother, Helen Lumuanganu, had asked the court not to release the details until an inquest could be held into her son’s death, which could take years. Dozens of demonstrators held a peaceful protest Monday night outside the Old Bailey courthouse where the trial was held, chanting for justice for Kaba. 'Despite this verdict, we won’t be silenced,' his family said in a statement. 'We are deeply grateful to everyone who stood by us and fought for justice. We will continue fighting for Chris, for justice, and for real change. Chris’ life mattered, and nothing can take that away from us.' Information from previous trials indicated Kaba had shot a gang rival on the dance floor of a nightclub on Aug. 30 and then chased the victim outside and shot him again before fleeing. The victim, who was hit twice in the leg, survived. The vehicle he was driving on the night he was killed had been used to drive him to the club that night and was also linked to another shooting in May. Kaba had convictions for fighting and possessing a knife and had served several stints behind bars, including a four-year sentence in 2017 for possessing an imitation firearm. Kaba, who had been a rapper and was about to become a father, was facing a possible court order aimed at curbing gang behavior at the time of his death. Fatal shootings by police in the U.K. are rare. In the year to March 2023, officers in England and Wales who are authorized to carry a gun fired their weapons at people 10 times and killed three, according to official statistics. The shooting renewed racism allegations against the Met police, also known as Scotland Yard, as it had been trying to restore confidence following a series of scandals and an independent review that found it mired in sexism, homophobia and institutional racism. The decision to charge Blake created a backlash from some of his specially trained firearms colleagues who refused to carry their weapons in a show of solidarity. The Met was briefly forced to call on neighboring departments and the military for backup. The union representing Met police officers applauded the decision to lift the reporting restrictions on Kaba's gang involvement and said Blake never should have faced trial.	https://apnews.com/article/london-police-acquitted-black-motorist-8e1242c9be7543f0c41d4efc8c62dc13	2024-10-22T06:01:21-07:00	
FBI says it's investigating leak of secret documents on Israel's possible attack plans	WASHINGTON (AP) — The FBI said Tuesday that it is investigating the unauthorized release of classified documents on Israel’s preparation for a potential retaliatory attack on Iran. White House national security spokesman John Kirby said Monday that the Biden administration is still not certain if the classified information was leaked or hacked but that officials don’t have any indication at this point of 'additional documents like this finding their way into the public domain.' The Associated Press reported Saturday that U.S. officials were investigating the release. The FBI confirmed the investigation for the first time on Tuesday and said in a statement that it is 'working closely with our partners in the Department of Defense and Intelligence Community.' It did not comment further. The documents are attributed to the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency and National Security Agency and note that Israel is still moving military assets in place to conduct a military strike in response to Iran’s blistering ballistic missile attack on Oct. 1. They were shareable within the 'Five Eyes,' an intelligence alliance comprised of the U.S., Great Britain, Canada, New Zealand and Australia. Marked top secret, the documents first appeared online Friday on the Telegram messaging app and quickly spread among Telegram channels popular with Iranians.	https://apnews.com/article/fbi-israel-classified-documents-iran-c12111c65413a132ee3301684825259a	2024-10-22T05:10:15-07:00	
Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny's posthumous memoir is a testament to resilience	NEW YORK (AP) — In a memoir released eight months after he died in prison, Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny never loses faith that his cause is worth suffering for while also acknowledging he wished he could have written a very different book. 'There is a mishmash of bits and pieces, a traditional narrative followed by a prison diary,' Navalny writes in 'Patriot,' which was published Tuesday, and is, indeed, a traditional narrative followed by a prison diary. 'I so much do not want my book to be yet another prison diary. Personally I find them interesting to read, but as a genre — enough is surely enough.' The final 200 pages of Navalny's 479-page book do, in some ways, have the characteristics of other prison diaries or of such classic Russian literature as Alexander Solzhenitsyn's 'One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich.' He tracks the boredom, isolation, exhaustion, suffering and absurdity of prison life, while working in asides about everything from 19th century French literature to Billie Eilish. But 'Patriot' also reads as a testament to a famed dissident's extraordinary battle against despair as the Russian authorities gradually increase their crackdown against him, and even shares advice on how to confront the worst and still not lose hope. 'The important thing is not to torment yourself with anger, hatred, fantasies of revenge, but to move instantly to acceptance. That can be hard,' he writes. 'The process going on in your head is by no means straightforward, but if you find yourself in a bad situation, you should try this. It works, as long as you think everything through seriously.' In recent years, Navalny had become an international symbol of resistance. A lawyer by training, he started out as an anti-corruption campaigner, but soon turned into a politician with aspirations for public office and eventually became the main challenger to Russia’s longtime president, Vladimir Putin. Navalny’s widow, Yulia Navalnaya, oversaw the book’s completion. In a promotional interview for 'Patriot,' she told the BBC that she would run for president if she ever returned to Russia -– an unlikely move with Putin in power, Navalnaya acknowledged. She has been arrested in absentia in Russia on charges of involvement with an extremist group. Putin 'needs to be in a Russian prison, to feel everything what not just my husband, but all the prisoners in Russia' feel, Navalnaya said during an interview on CBS' '60 Minutes.' Navalnaya has vowed to continue her late husband’s fight. She has recorded regular video addresses to her supporters and has been meeting with Western leaders and top officials, advocating for Russians who oppose Putin and his war in Ukraine. She had two children with her husband, who in his book writes of his immediate attraction to her and their enduring bond, praising Navalnaya as a soulmate who 'could discuss the most difficult matters with me without a lot of drama and hand-wringing.' During the first section of his book, Navalny reflects on the fall of the Soviet Union, his disenchantment with 1990s Russian leader Boris Yeltsin, his early crusades against corruption, his entry into public life, and his discovery that he did not need to look far for a politician 'who would undertake all sorts of needed, interesting projects and cooperate directly with the Russian people.' 'I wanted and waited, and one day I realized I could be that person myself,' he wrote. His vision of a 'beautiful Russia of the future,' where leaders are freely and fairly elected, official corruption is tamed, and democratic institutions work -– as well as his strong charisma and sardonic humor -– earned him widespread support across the country's 11 time zones. He had young, energetic activists by his side — a team that resembled 'a fancy startup' rather than a clandestine revolutionary operation, according to his memoir. 'From the outside we looked like a bunch of Moscow hipsters,' he writes, and together they put out colorful, professionally produced videos exposing official corruption. Those garnered millions of views on YouTube and prompted mass rallies even as the authorities cracked down harder on dissent. The authorities responded to Navalny’s growing popularity by levying multiple charges against him, his allies and even family members. They jailed him often and shut down his entire political infrastructure -– the Foundation for Fighting Corruption he started in 2011 and a network of several dozen regional offices. In 2020, Navalny survived a nerve agent poisoning he blamed on the Kremlin, which denied involvement. He describes it in great detail in the very beginning of the book, recounting, 'This is too much, and I'm about to die.' His family and allies fought for him to be airlifted to Germany for treatment, and after recovering there for five months, he returned to Russia, only to be arrested and sent to prison, where he would spend the last three years of his life. In the memoir, Navalny recalls telling his wife while still hospitalized in Berlin that 'of course' he will go back to Russia. The pressure on him continued behind bars, intensifying after Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022 and ratcheted its clampdown on dissent to unprecedented levels. In messages he was able to get out of prison, Navalny described harrowing conditions of solitary confinement, where he was placed for months on end for various minor infractions prison officials relentlessly accused him of, sleep deprivation, meager diet and lack of medical help. In October 2023, three of his lawyers were arrested and two more were put on a wanted list. In December 2023, the authorities transferred Navalny to a penal colony of the highest security level in the Russian penitentiary system in a remote town above the Arctic Circle. In February 2024, 47-year-old Navalny suddenly died there; the circumstances and the cause of his death still remain a mystery. Yulia Navalnaya and his allies say the Kremlin killed him, while the authorities argue that Navalny died of 'natural causes,' but wouldn’t reveal any details of what happened. Tens of thousands of Russians attended his funeral on the outskirts of Moscow in March in a rare show of defiance in a country where any street rally or even single pickets often result in immediate arrests and prison. For days afterward, people brought flowers to the grave, and a handful even came Tuesday. 'I dream of as many people as possible reading this book, because it seems to me that everyone will learn something new about Alexei. (Everyone) will laugh and cry a bit. He was so cool: strong and brave, kind and funny. The best. And the dearest,' Yulia Navalnaya said on X. Navalny's team has said the book will be available in Russian, the language he wrote it in, but shipping to his homeland and its neighbor Belarus won't be possible 'as we cannot guarantee delivery and the absence of problems at customs.' The Kremlin and Russian state media ignored the release, much as they ignored many other developments related to Navalny, whose name Putin and other top officials almost never uttered in public. —- Litvinova reported from Tallinn, Estonia.	https://apnews.com/article/navalny-memoir-putin-russia-opposition-patriot-8e12b158f1ae44e8274eebbdad194847	2024-10-22T04:08:30-07:00	
IMF's view: The global fight against high inflation is 'almost won'	WASHINGTON (AP) — The global war against inflation has largely been won — and at surprisingly little cost to economic growth, the International Monetary Fund declared Tuesday. In its latest assessment of the global economy, the IMF predicted that worldwide inflation will cool from 6.7% last year to 5.8% this year and to 4.3% in 2025. It estimates that inflation will fall even faster in the world’s wealthy countries, from 4.6% last year to 2.6% this year and 2% — the target range for most major central banks — in 2025. The slowdown in inflation, after years of crushing price increases in the aftermath of the pandemic, led the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank to cut interest rates this year after they had aggressively raised them to try to tame inflation. 'The battle against inflation is almost won,″ Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, the IMF's chief economist, told reporters Tuesday. 'In most countries, inflation is hovering close to central bank targets.″ Inflation had accelerated when the world economy recovered with unexpected speed from the COVID-19 recession, leaving factories, freight yards, ports and businesses overwhelmed with customer orders and creating shortages, delays and higher prices. The high borrowing rates engineered by major central banks, along with the end of supply chain logjams, brought inflation dramatically down from the four-decade highs it hit in mid-2022. And to the surprise of forecasters, the economy — especially the largest, in the United States — continued to grow and employers kept hiring despite higher borrowing costs. 'The decline in inflation without a global recession is a major achievement,'' Gourinchas wrote in a blog post that accompanied the IMF's latest World Economic Outlook. The IMF, a 190-nation lending organization, works to promote economic growth and financial stability and reduce global poverty. On Tuesday, besides sketching a milder inflation outlook, it upgraded its economic expectations for the United States this year, while lowering its estimates for growth in Europe and China. The IMF left its forecast for global growth unchanged at a relatively lackluster 3.2% for 2024. The IMF expects the U.S. economy to expand 2.8% this year, down slightly from 2.9% in 2023 but an improvement on the 2.6% it had forecast for 2024 back in July. Growth in the United States has been led by strong consumer spending, fueled by healthy gains in inflation-adjusted wages. Next year, though, the IMF expects the U.S. economy to decelerate to 2.2% growth. With a new presidential administration and Congress in place, the IMF envisions the nation's job market losing some momentum in 2025 as the government begins seeking to curb huge budget deficits by slowing spending, raising taxes or some combination of both. The IMF expects China's economic growth to slow from 5.2% last year to 4.8% this year and 4.5% in 2025. The world’s No. 2 economy has been hobbled by a collapse in its housing market and by weak consumer confidence — problems only partly offset by strong exports. The 20 European countries that share the euro currency are collectively expected to eke out 0.8% growth this year, twice the 2023 expansion of 0.4% but a slight downgrade from the 0.9% the IMF had forecast three months ago for 2024. The German economy, hurt by a slump in manufacturing and real estate, isn’t expected to grow at all this year. Now that interest rates are coming down and likely to aid the world’s economies, the IMF warned, the need to contain enormous government deficits will likely put a brake on growth. The overall world economy is expected to grow 3.2% in both 2024 and 2025, down a tick from 3.3% last year. That’s an unimpressive standard: From 2000 through 2019, before the pandemic upended economic activity, global growth had averaged 3.8% a year. The IMF also continues to express concern that geopolitical tension, including antagonism between the United States and China, could make world trade less efficient. The concern is that more countries would increasingly do business with their allies instead of seeking the lowest-priced or best-made foreign goods. Still, global trade, measured by volume, is expected to grow 3.1% this year and 3.4% in 2025, improving on 2023’s anemic 0.8% increase. Gourinchas also suggested that economic growth could end up being weaker than expected if countries take steps to reduce immigration, which has helped ease labor shortages in the United States and other advanced economies. And he said armed conflicts, like those in Ukraine and the Middle East, could also threaten the economic outlook. India’s economy is expected to 7% this year and 6.5% in 2025. While still strong, that pace would be down from 8.2% growth last year, a result of consumers slowing their spending after a post-pandemic boom. The IMF predicts that Japan’s economy, hurt by production problems in the auto industry and a slowdown in tourism, will expand by a meager 0.3% this year before accelerating to 1.1% growth in 2025. The United Kingdom is projected to register 1.1% growth this year, up from a dismal 0.3% in 2023, with falling interest rates helping spur stronger consumer spending.	https://apnews.com/article/imf-global-economy-inflation-growth-federal-reserve-715442446ade21f91548095ed46ba312	2024-10-22T04:02:21-07:00

Follow the AP’s Election 2024 coverage at: https://apnews.com/hub/election-2024. Here’s the latest: Trump again rails against green power sources He claimed that switching to all-electric trucks would require rebuilding every one of the country’s bridges and that solar fields kill rabbits. He says he recently saw a a solar field 'that looked like it took up half the desert.' 'It’s all steel and glass and wires. And it looks like hell,' he said. 'You see rabbits, they get caught in it.' Trump often rails against wind power, saying the turbines 'kill all the birds' and confuse whales. He’s been more complimentary of electric cars since he received the backing of Tesla CEO Elon Musk. But he is criticizing their range and weight at an event with Latino supporters Tuesday, claiming the nation would need to rebuild every one of its bridges if truck fleets swap diesel for electric vehicles to handle the extra weight. Trump criticized the Biden administration for the leak of secret documents detailing Israel’s preparation for a potential retaliatory attack on Iran He called it a 'bad thing.' 'Can you imagine somebody doing that? That’s the enemy. I guess that maybe is the enemy from within,' he said, repeating the phrase he’s used in recent speeches to refer to Democratic lawmakers such as U.S. Reps. Nancy Pelosi and Adam Schiff. 'We just can’t stand for this incompetence anymore.' The FBI said Tuesday that it’s investigating the unauthorized release of these documents. At his event, Trump compliments Goya, the largest, Hispanic-owned food company in the country The company’s CEO, Bob Unanue, is a vocal supporter. 'It’s actually quite good out of the can,' Trump says of the company known for its beans and other products. 'I eat it whenever I can,' he claims.

'This is not what you want.' Trump’s jabs come after Harris tried to cast him as 'exhausted' after he pulled out of several interviews — though Trump has had a busy schedule of interviews with conservative outlets and podcasts. Trump will be speaking to Hispanic voters and leaders in a smaller gathering at Trump National Doral Miami In the opening remarks, notable Florida Republicans including Miami Mayor Francis Suarez and U.S. Sen. Rick Scott proclaimed Trump’s record in supporting the Hispanic community during his previous term. Suarez was one of three Florida Republicans running for president in the earlier campaign cycle, but despite running against Trump, the mayor endorsed the former president in March. Suarez said that under Trump’s term, Hispanics experienced the lowest unemployment and the biggest reduction in poverty. Scott, who’s running for reelection, emphasized Trump would be the best to handle Latin American conflicts and fight against dictatorial regimes, where the families of many voters in the crowd escaped from. Miami is home to one of the largest Hispanic communities in the country, with about 70% of Miami-Dade County’s population identifying as Hispanic according to 2023 Census data. Trump is starting his day at a roundtable with Latino leaders at his Doral golf club in Florida It’s a beautiful day in Miami, with blue skies framing the property’s many palm trees. US Sen. Rick Scott spoke to a crowd of about 100 Hispanic voters at the Trump National Doral Miami Scott’s main message to Hispanic voters was that under Trump’s presidency, Hispanic voters were better off, because the border was more secure and inflation was lower. Scott is saying Harris’ policy will institute price controls, which is socialism. He said her administration would raise taxes. 'The Hispanic vote is the deciding factor. If you want someone to fight for Latin America, Trump’s going to do it,' Scott said. Those early Zoom meetings got people fired up for Harris. Now they’re trying to get them to vote When Joe Biden dropped out of the presidential race and Kamala Harris jumped in, a cascade of Zoom meetings with hundreds of thousands of participants popped up seemingly out of nowhere and helped propel her to the Democratic nomination. Now organizers are trying to turn that burst of digital enthusiasm into traditional get-out-the-vote efforts like phone banking and door knocking. They’ve created a loose constellation of volunteer networks operating independently of the Harris campaign, all geared toward marshaling local or online communities behind the vice president. People are sending postcards, texting friends, canvassing battleground states, making friendship bracelets with campaign messages, and sometimes surprising themselves by getting involved in ways they’ve never done before. The question is whether the Zoom meetings that drew so much attention during the summer — for Black women, Black men, white women, white dudes, cat ladies, Taylor Swift fans and more — will turn out to be a short-lived phenomenon or a powerful catalyst for Harris to beat Republican nominee Donald Trump. ▶ Read more about Zoom organizing by Democrats. With less than two weeks before Election Day, Kamala Harris is heading Friday to the reliably red state of Texas But she’s not necessarily trying to sway voters there. She’s trying to highlight a make-or-break issue for Democrats: abortion rights. Harris will seek to show how Texas’ restrictive abortion ban is creating increasing medical distress for women. During her campaign, the Democratic presidential nominee has often highlighted the increasingly perilous landscape for women since the fall of Roe, and she links it to Donald Trump, who appointed three of the Supreme Court justices who overturned the landmark abortion rights ruling. But it’s unusual for her to do it from a state she’s highly unlikely to win. Campaign officials say the plan is a nontraditional way to capture the attention of voters in battleground states who are inundated with campaign ads and run-of-the-mill campaign events. But Harris also thinks the issue is resonating for Republican voters, too, particularly women. In hard-fought Pennsylvania, fast-growing Hispanic communities present a test for Harris and Trump Pennsylvania is arguably the hardest fought of the battleground states and happens to have one of the fastest-growing Hispanic communities in the country, in what is known as the 222 Corridor, after the highway that connects small cities and towns west and north of Philadelphia. It’s fertile ground for both Democrats and Republicans to test their strength among Latinos in a state where small margins decide who gets 20 electoral votes. It’s a place where Democratic nominee Kamala Harris can prove that her party still commands a large share of the demographic’s support, and where Republican Donald Trump’s campaign has been working to gain ground. 'This is the epicenter for Latino voters in Pennsylvania,' said Victor Martinez, who is of Puerto Rican descent and lives in and broadcasts his show from Allentown. 'I like the fact that Kamala Harris has to keep sending people over here to listen to us and talk to us. I like it. I like the fact that JD Vance has to keep coming back. I like it, because that means that they have to pay attention to us.' Pennsylvania’s Latino eligible voter population has more than doubled since 2000 from 208,000 to 579,000, according to the Latino Data Hub from the University of California, Los Angeles’ Latino Policy &amp; Politics Institute. The population in cities like Allentown and Reading is now more than half Hispanic, with a majority being of Puerto Rican descent and a sizable portion of Dominican origin. ▶ Read more about the Latino vote in this election. Biden administration awards $428M to help hard-hit coal communities transition to clean energy The Biden-Harris administration is awarding $428 million for 14 clean-energy manufacturing projects in Pennsylvania and other states hit hard by the decline of the U.S. coal industry. One of the larger grants, $87 million, will go to a Pennsylvania company to make state-of-the-art linear generators at a plant outside Pittsburgh, a key battleground in the presidential election. Linear generators can use any fuel source to produce low-carbon power for utilities, data centers and industry. Mainspring Energy plans to use Energy Department funds to create enough electricity annually to power more than 40,000 homes. Harris, like Biden, has pledged to help workers displaced by the transition to clean energy, a key-issue in energy-rich Pennsylvania. Mideast conflict looms over US presidential race as Harris and Trump jostle for an edge Two weeks out from Election Day, the crisis in the Middle East is looming over the race for the White House, with one candidate struggling to find just the right words to navigate its difficult cross-currents and the other making bold pronouncements that the age-old conflict can quickly be set right. Vice President Kamala Harris has been painstakingly — and not always successfully — trying to balance talk of strong support for Israel with harsh condemnations of civilian casualties among Palestinians and others caught up in Israel’s wars against Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon. Former President Donald Trump, for his part, insists that none of this would have happened on his watch and that he can make it all go away if elected. Both of them are bidding for the votes of Arab and Muslim American voters and Jewish voters, particularly in extremely tight races in the battleground states of Michigan and Pennsylvania. ▶ Read more about the Mideast conflict’s role in the election. How Project 2025’s rightward vision became a flashpoint in this year’s election For the past year, Project 2025 has endured as a persistent force in the presidential election, its far-right proposals deployed by Democrats as shorthand for what Donald Trump would potentially do with a second term at the White House. Even though the former president’s campaign has vigorously distanced itself from Project 2025, the sweeping Heritage Foundation’s proposal to gut the federal workforce and dismantle federal agencies aligns closely with his vision. Project 2025’s architects come from the ranks of Trump’s administration and top Heritage officials have briefed Trump’s team about it. It’s rare for a complex 900-page policy book to figure so dominantly in a political campaign. But from its early start at a think tank, to its viral spread on social media, the rise and fall and potential rise again of Project 2025 shows the unexpected staying power of policy to light up an election year and threaten not only Trump atop the ticket but down-ballot Republicans in races for Congress. Through it all, Project 2025 hasn't gone away. It exists not only as a policy blueprint for the next administration, but as a database of some 20,000 job-seekers who could staff a Trump White House and administration and a still unreleased '180-day playbook' of actions a new president could employ on Day One. ▶ Read more about Project 2025. Early voting kicks off in battleground Wisconsin with push from Obama and Walz In-person early voting kicks off Tuesday across battleground Wisconsin, with former President Barack Obama and Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Walz hosting a rally in liberal Madison and Republicans holding events to encourage casting a ballot for Donald Trump before Election Day. Trump lost Wisconsin by just under 21,000 votes in 2020, an election that saw unprecedented early and absentee voting due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris are expecting another razor-thin margin in Wisconsin and both sides are pushing voters to cast their ballots early. Trump was highly critical of voting by mail in past elections, falsely claiming it was rife with fraud. But this election, he and his backers are embracing all forms of voting, including by mail and early in-person. Trump himself encouraged early voting at a rally in Dodge County, Wisconsin, earlier this month. ▶ Read more about early voting in Wisconsin.

About 140 Rohingya Muslims on wooden boat off Indonesia's coast as residents refuse to let them land	LABUHAN HAJI, Indonesia (AP) — About 140 weak and hungry Rohingya Muslims, mostly women and children, were on a wooden boat anchored about 1 mile (0.60 kilometers) off the coast of Indonesia’s northernmost province of Aceh on Tuesday, officials said, and local residents refused to allow them onto land. The blue-painted boat has been floating off the coast since Friday. Three Rohingya died during the nearly two-week-long trip from Cox’s Bazar in Bangladesh to the waters off Labuhan Haji in South Aceh district, local police said. Authorities have transferred 11 Rohingya to a government hospital since Sunday after their health worsened. 'Our community, the fishing community, refuses to let them land because of what happened in other places. They have caused unrest to local residents,' said Muhammad Jabal, the chief of the fishing community in South Aceh. A large banner hanging at the seaport read: 'The people of South Aceh Regency reject the arrival of Rohingya refugees in the South Aceh Regency area.' The group left Cox’s Bazar on Oct. 9, according to an Aceh police report, and intended to reach Malaysia. Some passengers on the boat had reportedly paid to be transported to other countries. Local residents have given the group food, Jabal said, and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has also provided them food. There were 216 people on board when the boat departed Bangladesh and 50 of them reportedly disembarked in Indonesia’s Riau province, according to police. Aceh police have arrested three suspects for alleged people smuggling. About 1 million of the predominately Muslim Rohingya live in Bangladesh as refugees from Myanmar. They include about 740,000 who fled a brutal counterinsurgency campaign in 2017 by Myanmar’s security forces, who were accused of committing mass rapes and killings. The Rohingya minority in Myanmar faces widespread discrimination. Most are denied citizenship. Indonesia, like Thailand and Malaysia, is not a signatory to the United Nations’ 1951 Refugee Convention and is not obligated to accept them. However, the country generally provides temporary shelter to refugees in distress. In March, Indonesian officials and local fishermen rescued 75 people from atop the overturned hull of a boat off the coast of Aceh. Another 67 passengers, including at least 28 children, had been killed when the boat capsized, according to the UNHCR. AP reported that the captain and crew had tortured women and girls before the the boat capsized. ___ Tarigan reported from Jakarta.	https://apnews.com/article/indonesia-aceh-rohingya-muslims-myanmar-refugees-e449e93984ea308c24efedb84be0f6e8	2024-10-22T03:06:34-07:00	
Lee Kuan Yew's youngest son says the UK has granted him asylum from persecution in Singapore	LONDON (AP) — Lee Hsien Yang, the estranged brother of former Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, said Tuesday that he is now a 'political refugee' after the U.K. government granted him asylum from what he described as persecution at home. The Lee brothers are the sons of Singapore's first prime minister Lee Kuan Yew, widely regarded as the city-state's modern founding father. They have been engaged in a public spat since 2017 over the late patriarch’s family home, and Lee Hsien Yang has accused Singapore's government of persecuting him, his wife and his son. In a Facebook post Tuesday, he said that he sought asylum protection in 2022 'as a last resort.' 'The Singapore government’s attacks against me are in the public record. They prosecuted my son, brought disciplinary proceedings against my wife, and launched a bogus police investigation that has dragged on for years,' he wrote. 'On the basis of these facts, the U.K. has determined that I face a well-founded risk of persecution and cannot safely return to Singapore.' 'I remain a Singapore citizen and hope that someday it will become safe to return home,' he added. The Guardian published an interview with Lee Hsien Yang on Tuesday in which he strongly criticized the Singapore government and alleged it facilitated money laundering. 'People need to look beyond Singapore’s bold, false assertions and see what the reality really is like,' he was quoted as saying. 'There is a need for the world to look more closely, to see Singapore’s role as that key facilitator for arms trades, for dirty money, for drug monies, crypto money.' The Singapore government said in a statement there was no basis to the allegations in the Guardian's report. The city-state has a 'robust system to deter and tackle money laundering and other illicit financial flows, which is consistent with international standards,' it said. 'In Singapore, no one is above the law. Anyone, including the offspring of the founding prime minister, Mr. Lee Kuan Yew, can be investigated and brought before the courts,' it added. Lee Hsien Yang and his sister, Lee Wei Ling, who died earlier this month, accuse their eldest brother of abusing his power to stop them from demolishing the family home according to the wishes of their father, who died in 2015 after leading Singapore with an iron grip for more than three decades. The family feud saw Lee Hsien Yang and his wife entangled in official investigations over allegations that the pair provided false evidence in judicial proceedings regarding Lee Kuan Yew's will. Lee Hsien Loong stepped down in May after two decades at the helm. He handed power to his deputy, Lawrence Wong, but still holds a Cabinet post as senior minister. Lee Hsien Yang joined the opposition party in the 2020 general elections, saying the governing party led then by his brother had 'lost its way.' The U.K. Home Office didn't immediately comment when asked about Lee Hsien Yang's asylum status. ___ Eileen Ng reported from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.	https://apnews.com/article/singapore-lee-hsien-yang-asylum-uk-d5bee7c0f88f23a1c041a1b2a0367ea5	2024-10-22T02:57:37-07:00	
Austria's chancellor asked to form new government after parties refuse to work with far-right leader	VIENNA (AP) — Austria's president on Tuesday tasked incumbent Chancellor Karl Nehammer with forming a new government after all other parties refused to work with the leader of the far-right Freedom Party, which last month won a national election for the first time. The Freedom Party finished first in the Sept. 29 election with 28.8% of the vote, ahead of Nehammer’s conservative Austrian People’s Party, which took 26.3%. The center-left Social Democrats were third with 21.1%. The outgoing governing coalition of Nehammer’s party and the environmentalist Greens lost its majority. Whoever leads the next government will need to build a coalition to have a parliamentary majority. But Nehammer's party has said it wouldn't work with the Freedom Party under its leader, Herbert Kickl. The other three parties in the new parliament said they wouldn't work with the Freedom Party at all. And Kickl said the Freedom Party would only go into government with him as chancellor. President Alexander Van der Bellen on Oct. 9 asked the leaders of the three biggest parties to hold talks on possible cooperation, dispensing with a tradition of giving the election winner the task of trying to form a new government. The party leaders reported back to him on Monday, and Van der Bellen said all had stuck to their positions. As a result, he said he was asking Nehammer to form a government and talk to the Social Democrats. There was no immediate public response from the chancellor or the far-right party.	https://apnews.com/article/austria-president-nehammer-chancellor-government-far-right-b7c91e9030d266d92f348f52acd9e5a8	2024-10-22T02:55:30-07:00	
Ukraine's Zelenskyy says only a US green light on a NATO invitation will sway a reluctant Germany	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukraine's president is hoping allies will take a more positive stance on his so-called victory plan after the U.S. election, but concedes that its key demand — an invitation to join NATO — is not welcome by some key Western partners, in particular Germany. Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Russia was also likely looking at the postelection scenario in the U.S. to assess the possibility of cease-fire talks with Ukraine. He assessed that if partial cease-fire deals could be reached over attacks on energy infrastructure and Black Sea shipping routes, it would signal the end of the 'hot phase' of the war. Zelenskyy spoke to journalists on Monday and his comments were embargoed until Tuesday. On NATO, Zelenskyy said France, Britain and Italy have shown signs of support. Germany has reservations, however, and Zelenskyy believes only a U.S. green light will convince Berlin to accept the idea. 'The German side is skeptical about our NATO membership — that’s a fact. I believe their stance is softer than it was before — this is also a fact. But when it comes to the invitation I’m talking about now, they are afraid of ... Russia’s reaction,' he said. 'I believe that their position will be influenced by a bigger alliance. A bigger alliance in supporting us — a confident 'Yes' from the United States.' Many significant issues will hinge on decisions taken following the fraught election period, the president said. 'After the elections, we hope for a more positive reaction from the US — not because of a change in the president, but because the focus of the United States is now on the elections, and I believe that any sharp statements from the U.S. today might be inappropriate or carry risks. I think they don’t want unnecessary risks,' he said.	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-nato-germany-zelenskyy-dea72695475ebcf3d5b22f3a9c8aecac	2024-10-22T02:36:48-07:00	
Switzerland to close 9 centers for asylum-seekers as fewer people arrive than expected	GENEVA (AP) — Swiss authorities said Tuesday they will shut nine temporary centers for asylum-seekers because the number of people seeking asylum recently has been below expectations. Switzerland has been building up refugee accommodation since 2022, putting in place 36 centers for asylum-seekers across the country. The State Secretariat for Migration said that just over half the places are currently occupied. It said that, unlike in previous years, there hasn't been a rise in new asylum-seekers in the summer and fall. In August, there were 23% fewer applications than a year earlier, and there was a 40% drop in September. 'The situation on the migration routes toward Western Europe does not point to a dramatic increase in the coming months,' the secretariat said in a statement. The nine centers being shut can accommodate 1,735 people. It said that, following their closure, the remaining ones will be able to put up about 7,000 people from March onward — a number that could be increased again if there is a sharp increase in new arrivals.	https://apnews.com/article/switzerland-migration-asylum-centers-closing-b8c1a396a28323196705ddd7f1cf26e9	2024-10-22T02:02:18-07:00	
Tunisia's president is inaugurated for a second term following a crackdown on his opponents	TUNIS, Tunisia (AP) — Tunisia's President Kais Saied has been inaugurated for a second term, following a monthslong crackdown and string of arrests against his political opponents. Weeks after winning re-election with a 90.7% share of the vote, the 66-year-old former law professor in his inauguration speech Monday called for a 'cultural revolution' to combat unemployment, fight terrorism and root out corruption. 'The aim is to build a country where everyone can live in dignity,' Saied said in a speech addressing members of Tunisia's parliament. Saied's Oct. 7 re-election came after a turbulent first term during which he suspended the country's parliament, rewrote its post-Arab Spring constitution and jailed dozens of his critics in politics, media, business and civil society. He has justified elements of the crackdown as necessary to fight corruption and enemies of the state, using populism to appeal to Tunisians disillusioned with the direction that those who preceded him took the country after nationwide protests led to the 2011 ouster of Zine El Abidine Ben Ali. He promised to target the 'thieves and traitors on the payroll of foreigners' and blamed 'counterrevolutionary forces' for obstructing his efforts to buoy Tunisia's struggling economy throughout his first term in office. 'The task was not easy. The dangers were great,' he said. 'The arms of the old regime were like vipers circulating everywhere. We could hear them hissing, even if we couldn’t see them.' Though Saied proclaimed a commitment to respecting freedoms, many journalists were prevented from covering his swearing-in on Monday, leading to a rebuke from the National Syndicate of Tunisian Journalists, which expressed 'its firm condemnation of the ongoing blackout policy and restrictions on journalistic work' in a news release on Monday.	https://apnews.com/article/tunisia-president-kais-saied-f911f1dfc86445ef8be157a3a792e1e2	2024-10-22T01:53:38-07:00	
Tropical Storm Oscar swirls toward the Bahamas after hitting Cuba as a hurricane	SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) — Tropical Storm Oscar chugged toward the Bahamas on Tuesday after making landfall in Cuba as a Category 1 hurricane, killing at least six people as it unleashed heavy rains on an island also hit by an unrelated massive power outage. Oscar was located 45 miles (75 kilometers) south-southeast of Long Island in the Bahamas on Tuesday morning. It had winds of 40 mph (65 kph) and was moving north-northeast at 12 mph (19 kph), according to the National Hurricane Center in Miami. 'Oscar is at best barely a tropical storm at this time,' the center said. It was expected to drop up to 5 inches (13 centimeters) of rain across the southeastern Bahamas, with up to 8 inches (20 centimeters) in isolated areas. A tropical storm warning was in effect for the central and southeastern Bahamas. The storm made history as the smallest recorded hurricane, with a wind field of only about 6 miles (10 kilometers) across. It caught many by surprise as it made landfall in Grand Inagua Island in the Bahamas on Saturday and a second landfall in eastern Cuba late Sunday. 'It’s not often we see a colossal failure in hurricane forecasting,' Michael Lowry, a hurricane specialist and storm surge expert, wrote in an analysis. He noted no models indicated Oscar would strengthen into a hurricane. Oscar dropped at least 15 inches (38 centimeters) of rain in parts of eastern Cuba on Monday, with forecasters warning of heavy flooding and possible landslides. The six deaths were reported in Guantánamo. The storm hit as Cuba struggles to recover from a massive blackout that sparked a handful of small protests and a stern government warning that any unrest will be punished. Oscar is the 15th named storm and 10th hurricane of the Atlantic hurricane season, which begins June 1 and ends Nov. 30. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicted an above-average Atlantic hurricane season this year because of record-warm ocean temperatures. It forecast 17 to 25 named storms before the season ends, with four to seven major hurricanes of Category 3 or higher. Meanwhile, Tropical Storm Kristy swirled over open waters in the Pacific Ocean. It was located 375 miles (605 kilometers) west-southwest of Acapulco, Mexico on Tuesday. It had maximum sustained winds of 50 mph (85 kph) and was moving west-northwest at 15 mph (24 kph). Kristy was expected to become a hurricane by Tuesday night.	https://apnews.com/article/tropical-storm-oscar-cuba-bahamas-hurricane-c61b9266c182c4ace4544d73b5cedd3a	2024-10-22T01:48:36-07:00	
India bringing in a new law to curb the menace of hoax bomb threat calls disrupting airlines flying	NEW DELHI (AP) — The Indian government plans a new law to punish those making hoax bomb threats against flights, which disrupt the schedules of airlines and cause massive inconvenience to thousands of passengers. In less than two weeks, more than 120 flights operated by Indian carriers have received bomb threats, the Press Trust of India news agency reported. Civil Aviation Minister K Rammohan said on Monday that the government is planning to introduce legislation that would put offenders on a no-fly list and amend the 1982 Civil Aviation Act so that they can be arrested and investigated without a court order. On Tuesday, IndiGo, a private Indian airline, said nine of its flights destined for Jeddah and Dammam in Saudi Arabia and some flights from Turkey had received such hoax calls. The flights were diverted to the nearest airports for security checks. 'We worked closely with the relevant authorities and followed standard operating procedures,' the airline said in a statement. The hoaxers have largely gone untraced so far. The Mumbai police said they detained a 17-year-old boy from eastern Chhattisgarh state on Wednesday for allegedly posting bomb threat messages on the social media of various airlines. Police officer Maneesh Kalwaniya said the boy's motive was to implicate another person involved in a business dispute with him. The Press Trust of India said 30 domestic and international flights operated by Indian airlines, including IndiGo, Vistara, and Air India, received bomb threats on Monday night alone. 'Even though bomb threats are hoaxes, things cannot be taken non-seriously,' Rammohan said.	https://apnews.com/article/india-bomb-threat-calls-airlines-ac9cf86f8f64b46a980596b52bc37569	2024-10-22T01:23:16-07:00	
South Korea warns it can send arms to Ukraine after reports of North's troops in Russia	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea warned Tuesday it could consider supplying weapons to Ukraine in response to North Korea allegedly dispatching troops to Russia, as both North Korea and Russia denied the movements. The South Korean statement is apparently meant to pressure Russia not to bring in North Korean troops in its war against Ukraine. South Korean officials worry that Russia may reward North Korea by giving it sophisticated weapons technologies that can boost the North’s nuclear and missile programs that target South Korea. In an emergency National Security Council meeting, top South Korean officials condemned North Korea’s alleged dispatch of troops as 'a grave security threat' to South Korea and the international community. They described North Korea as 'a criminal group' that forces its youths to serve as Russian mercenaries for an unjustifiable war, the South Korean presidential office said in a statement. The officials agreed to take phased countermeasures, linking the level of their responses to progress in Russian-North Korean military cooperation, according to the statement. Possible steps include diplomatic, economic and military options, and South Korea could consider sending both defensive and offensive weapons to Ukraine, a senior South Korean presidential official told reporters on condition of anonymity in a background briefing. The official said North Korea could attempt to get high-tech Russian technologies to perfect its nuclear missiles. The official said Russia's possible help for North Korea's efforts to modernize its outdated conventional weapons systems and acquire a space-based surveillance system would pose a serious security threat to South Korea as well. Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022, South Korea has joined U.S.-led sanctions against Moscow and shipped humanitarian and financial support to Kyiv. But it has avoided directly supplying arms to Ukraine in line with its policy of not supplying weapons to countries actively engaged in conflicts. South Korea’s spy agency said last week it had confirmed that North Korea sent 1,500 special operation forces to Russia this month. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said his government had intelligence that 10,000 North Korea soldiers were being prepared to join invading Russian forces. North Korea and Russia intensify cooperation North Korea and Russia have been sharply boosting their cooperation in the past two years. In June, they signed a major defense deal requiring both countries to use all available means to provide immediate military assistance if either is attacked. South Korea said at the time it would consider sending arms to Ukraine, a similar statement that it made Tuesday. South Korea's spy agency said that North Korea had sent more than 13,000 containers of artillery, missiles and other conventional arms to Russia since August 2023 to replenish its dwindling weapons stockpiles. North Korea and Russia have denied the North Korean troop deployment as well as the purported weapons transfer. At a U.N. Security Council meeting Monday, Russia’s U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia dismissed the South Korean assertion as well as Western allegations of Iran supplying Russia with missiles and China providing arms components. He accused the West of 'circulating scaremongering with Iranian, Chinese and Korean bogeymen, each one of which is more absurd than the one before.' At a separate U.N. committee meeting, a North Korean diplomat said his delegation feels no need to comment on the troop dispatch, calling it 'groundless, stereotype rumors aimed at smearing the image' of the North and undermining the legitimate cooperation between two sovereign states. Also Tuesday, the powerful sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un called South Korean and Ukraine governments 'lunatics' as she slammed them for making 'reckless remarks against nuclear weapons states.' The U.S. and NATO haven’t confirmed North Korea’s troop deployment, but they warned against the danger of such a development if true. U.S. deputy ambassador to the U.N. Robert Wood said that if true, the North Korean troop dispatch marks 'a dangerous and highly concerning development' and noted that the U.S. was 'consulting with our allies and partners on such a dramatic move.' __ Associated Press writer Kim Tong-hyung contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/north-korea-south-russia-troops-ukraine-3bf74624cfa6856edd4f15fb3992bfa0	2024-10-22T01:19:08-07:00	
A man who allegedly planned a bomb attack for the Islamic State group is indicted in Germany	BERLIN (AP) — German prosecutors said Tuesday they have filed an indictment against a man who allegedly joined the Islamic State group in Iraq and planned to carry out an attack in Germany on its behalf. The Iraqi national, identified only as Mahmoud A. in line with German privacy rules, was arrested in June in Esslingen, near Stuttgart. The federal prosecutor's office said he has now been formally charged at the state court in Stuttgart with membership in a foreign terrorist organization and preparing a serious act of violence. The suspect joined IS in Iraq in May 2016, and fought and carried out guard duties for the extremist group until October 2017, according to prosecutors. He then allegedly went to Turkey in consultation with IS, and continued to Germany in October 2022. From January onward, he planned a bomb attack, prosecutors said. After looking up how to make a bomb on the internet, he allegedly procured the necessary chemicals and components for an ignition device. He was arrested before he could carry out any plan for an attack.	https://apnews.com/article/germany-islamic-state-attack-suspect-indicted-d03a5b20ce0d104ede6b216eb37c3879	2024-10-22T00:57:49-07:00	
Putin hosts Global South leaders at BRICS summit meant to counterbalance Western clout	KAZAN, Russia (AP) — China’s Xi Jinping, India’s Narendra Modi and other global leaders arrived Tuesday in the Russian city of Kazan for a summit of the BRICS bloc of developing economies that the Kremlin hopes to turn into a rallying point for defying what some see as the Western liberal order. For Russian President Vladimir Putin, the three-day meeting also offers a powerful way to demonstrate the failure of U.S.-led efforts to isolate Russia over its actions in Ukraine. Kremlin foreign affairs adviser Yuri Ushakov touted the summit as 'the largest foreign policy event ever held' by Russia, with 36 countries attending and more than 20 of them represented by heads of state. The alliance that initially comprised Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa has expanded rapidly to embrace Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia. Turkey, Azerbaijan and Malaysia have formally applied to become members, and a few others have expressed interest in joining. Observers see the BRICS summit as part of the Kremlin's efforts to showcase support from the Global South amid spiraling tensions with the West and help expand economic and financial ties. Proposed projects include the creation of a new payment system that would offer an alternative to the global bank messaging network SWIFT and allow Moscow to dodge Western sanctions and trade with partners. Putin is set to hold about 20 bilateral meetings on the sidelines of the summit, including Tuesday's encounters with China’s Xi, India’s Modi and South African President Cyril Ramaphosa. The summit underlined the close relationship between Xi and Putin, who announced a 'no-limits' partnership weeks before Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022. They already have met at least twice this year, in Beijing in May and at a Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit in Kazakhstan in July. Russia’s cooperation with India has also flourished as New Delhi considers Moscow a time-tested partner since Cold War times despite Russia’s close ties with India’s main rival, China. Western allies want India to be more active in persuading Moscow to end the war in Ukraine, but Modi has avoided condemning Russia while emphasizing a peaceful settlement. Modi, who last visited Russia in July, said this visit reflects the close friendship between the countries. Speaking at the start of his meeting with Putin, he also reaffirmed New Delhi's push for peace in Ukraine. Putin hailed what he described as a 'privileged strategic partnership' between Russia and India. On Thursday, Putin is also set to meet with United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, who will be making his first visit to Russia in more than two years. Guterres has repeatedly criticized Russia’s actions in Ukraine.	https://apnews.com/article/russia-brics-summit-china-india-ukraine-war-39e90fce8443b922f4d224c65c2ec932	2024-10-22T00:33:12-07:00	
Blinken arrives in Israel as US looks to renew cease-fire efforts after the killing of Hamas leader	TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Secretary of State Antony Blinken arrived in Israel on Tuesday on his 11th visit to the region since the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war. The U.S. hopes to revive cease-fire efforts after the killing of top Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, but so far all the warring parties appear to be digging in. Israel is still at war with Hamas more than a year after the militant group’s Oct. 7 attack, and with Hezbollah in Lebanon, where it launched a ground invasion earlier this month. Israel is also expected to strike Iran in response to its ballistic missile attack on Oct. 1. Blinken landed just hours after Hezbollah launched a barrage of rockets into central Israel, setting off air raid sirens in the country’s most populated areas and its international airport, but causing no apparent damage or injuries. The Israeli military said it intercepted most of the five projectiles, with one landing in an open area. Another 15 projectiles were fired from Lebanon into northern Israel at around the same time, it said. Hospitals in Lebanon fear being targeted by Israel The death toll from Israeli airstrikes late Monday that destroyed several buildings facing one of Beirut’s main hospitals climbed to 13. Lebanon's Health Ministry said 57 others were wounded, including seven who were in critical condition. The Israeli military said it struck a Hezbollah target, without elaborating, and said that it had not targeted the hospital itself. Associated Press reporters visited the Rafik Hariri University Hospital, the country’s largest public hospital, on Tuesday. They saw broken windows in the hospital’s pharmacy and dialysis center, which was full of patients at the time. The force of the explosions also destroyed some of the hospital’s solar panels. Staff said that in the midst of their own panic, they had to deal with wounded patients streaming into the hospital in the aftermath of the strikes across the street. Staff at another Beirut hospital feared it would be targeted after Israel alleged that Hezbollah had stashed hundreds of millions of dollars in cash and gold in its basement, without providing evidence. The director of the Sahel General Hospital denied the allegations and invited journalists to visit the hospital and its two underground floors on Tuesday. AP reporters saw no sign of militants or anything out of the ordinary. The few remaining patients had been evacuated after the Israeli military's announcement the night before. The rest had left earlier because of repeated airstrikes in the surrounding neighborhood. 'We have been living in terror for the last 24 hours,' said hospital director Mazen Alame. 'There is nothing under the hospital.' Many in Lebanon fear Israel could target its hospitals in the same way it has raided medical facilities across Gaza. The Israeli military has accused Hamas and other militants of using hospitals for military purposes, allegations denied by medical staff. Hospitals can lose their protection under international law if they are used for military purposes. Blinken expected to focus on Gaza The State Department said ahead of the visit that Blinken would focus on ending the war in Gaza, securing the release of hostages held by Hamas and alleviating the suffering of Palestinian civilians. State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said Blinken would underscore the need for a dramatic increase in the amount of humanitarian aid reaching Gaza, something that Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin made clear in a letter to Israeli officials last week. That letter reminded Israel that the Biden administration could be forced by U.S. law to curtail some forms of military aid should the delivery of humanitarian aid continue to be hindered. Blinken's previous trips have yielded little in the way of ending hostilities, but he has managed to increase aid deliveries to Gaza in the past. The United States, Egypt and Qatar have brokered months of talks between Israel and Hamas, trying to strike a deal in which the militants would release dozens of hostages in return for an end to the war, a lasting cease-fire and the release of Palestinian prisoners. But both Israel and Hamas accused each other of making new and unacceptable demands over the summer, and the talks ground to a halt in August. Hamas says its demands have not changed following the killing of Sinwar. US and Iran both step up outreach ahead of expected Israeli strike Blinken is expected to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other top officials, and to visit a number of Arab countries, likely to include Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi has been criss-crossing the region in recent days to try and built support ahead of Israel’s threatened retaliatory strike. Speaking in Kuwait on Tuesday, he said Gulf Arab countries had assured him they would not allow their territory to be used for any Israeli strike. 'All the neighbors assured us that they will not allow their lands and air to be used against Iran,' Araghchi said, according to the state-run IRNA news agency. The Arab Gulf countries have not publicly offered such assurances. Gulf Arab nations like the UAE and Qatar host major military installations, and there are concerns that an all-out regional war could draw them in. Iran has repeatedly vowed to respond to any Israeli strike. War rages in Lebanon and northern Gaza The U.S. has also tried to broker a cease-fire between Israel and Hezbollah, but those efforts fell apart as tensions spiked last month with a series of Israeli strikes that killed the militant group’s top leader, Hassan Nasrallah, and most of his senior commanders. Israel is currently waging another major operation in already-devastated northern Gaza, which has killed hundreds of Palestinians over the last two weeks, according to local health authorities. In Lebanon, Israel has carried out waves of heavy airstrikes across southern Beirut and the country’s south and east, areas where Hezbollah has a strong presence. Hezbollah has fired hundreds of rockets, missiles and drones into Israel, including some that have reached the country’s populous center. Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking another 250 hostage. Around 100 of the captives are still held in Gaza, a third of whom are believed to be dead. Hezbollah began attacking Israel the day after the Hamas attack. Both groups are backed by Iran. Israel’s offensive has killed over 42,000 Palestinians in Gaza and wounded tens of thousands, according to local health authorities, who do not say how many were combatants but say more than half were women and children. It has also caused massive devastation across the territory and displaced around 90% of its population of 2.3 million. ___ El Deeb reported from Beirut.

2 transgender women stabbed to death at home in northwest Pakistan	PESHAWAR, Pakistan (AP) — Two men armed with daggers killed two transgender women at their home in conservative northwest Pakistan overnight before fleeing the scene, police said, a sign of increasing violence against trans people in the country. The killings happened Sunday night in Mardan, a city in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, local police chief Fahim Khan said. He said the motive behind the murders was unclear and officers are still investigating. Transgender people are often subjected to harassment, abuse and attacks in Muslim-majority Pakistan. They are also among the victims of so-called honor killings carried out by relatives to punish perceived sexual transgressions. Farzana Jan, President of the Trans Action rights group in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, said another nine trans people have been killed in gun attacks in the province since January. She said none of the attackers involved in the previous cases had been brought to justice, mainly because families pardoned the attackers or prosecutors did not pursue the cases seriously. The transgender community has threated to protest if the attackers are not arrested. 'We have given a three-day deadline to the police for arresting those behind the latest killings in Mardan,' Jan said. 'We will stage rallies if the killers of two members of our community are not arrested,' she said. There are no exact figures about the number of trans people in Pakistan, but Jan estimated that about 75,000 live in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Mardan is located about 50 kilometers (30 miles) east of Peshawar.	https://apnews.com/article/pakistan-trans-women-stabbed-killed-northwest-fe0eef893e486013d51cc5f470a6807e	2024-10-21T21:58:48-07:00	
Middle East latest: Over a dozen killed in Israeli strikes near one of Beirut's main hospitals	Israeli airstrikes in and around Beirut caused significant damage to the country's largest public hospital and killed more than a dozen people, Lebanese health officials said, as Hezbollah launched a barrage of rockets into central Israel hours before U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken arrived in the region. Lebanon's health ministry said that 60 others were wounded in airstrikes late Monday that destroyed several buildings facing the Rafik Hariri University Hospital, located on the outskirts of southern Beirut. The Israeli military said it struck a Hezbollah target, without elaborating, and that it had not targeted the hospital itself. The State Department said Blinken would focus on ending the war in Gaza, securing the release of hostages held by Hamas and alleviating the suffering of Palestinian civilians. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has pledged to annihilate Hamas and recover dozens of hostages held by the group. Hamas says it will only release the captives in return for a lasting cease-fire, a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and the release of Palestinian prisoners. On Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas-led militants blew holes in Israel’s security fence and stormed in, killing some 1,200 people — mostly civilians — and abducting another 250. Israel’s offensive in Gaza has killed over 42,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities, who do not differentiate between militants and civilians. The war has destroyed large areas of Gaza and displaced about 90% of its population of 2.3 million people. ___ Here's the latest: France's government defends decision to bar some Israeli companies from exhibiting at upcoming trade fair PARIS — France’s government is defending its decision to bar Israeli companies supplying the war in the Middle East from exhibiting at an upcoming trade fair outside Paris. Organizers of the Nov. 4-7 naval defense exhibition, called Euronaval, posted on the event’s website that Israeli firms can take part in the show and 'may have an exhibition stand, provided that their products are not used in military operations in Gaza and Lebanon.' Addressing parliament on Tuesday, French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot said the policy does not amount to a boycott of Israeli firms. But he also said it would be 'incoherent' for France to allow the promotion of weapons used in the war when Paris is also pushing for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and Lebanon. 'Therefore, we have indicated to the Israeli authorities, with whom we communicate very regularly, that the participation in the form of stands by companies should respect this balance,' Barrot said. In a Sunday post on the social platform X, Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz urged French President Emmanuel Macron to rescind the restrictions, calling them 'unacceptable' and 'anti-democratic.' Lebanon's health ministry says 63 people were killed and 234 wounded in past 24 hours BEIRUT — Lebanon’s health ministry said that 63 people were killed and 234 wounded in the past 24 hours, raising the total toll over the past year of conflict between Israel and Hezbollah to 2,546 killed and 11,862 wounded. Lebanon’s crisis response unit recorded 125 airstrikes and incidents of shelling in the past day, mostly concentrated in southern Lebanon and the Nabatiyeh province. Some 1,095 centers — including educational complexes, vocational institutes, universities, and other institutions — are currently sheltering 191,516 people, including 44,124 families, displaced by the Israeli offensive in Lebanon, the report said. Among these shelters, 908 have now reached full capacity. The fighting in Lebanon has driven 1.2 million people from their homes, including more than 400,000 children, according to the U.N. children’s agency. Despite a major border crossing between Lebanon and Syria being out of commission after Israel struck the road several times, crowds have continued to flow across the border seeking relative safety in Syria. Between Sept. 23 and Oct. 22, Lebanese General Security recorded 343,404 Syrian and 147,608 Lebanese citizens crossing into Syria, the report said. Yellen says the US is working to ‘ensure that legitimate aid flows reach Gaza,’ among other things WASHINGTON — The U.S. is working to 'ensure that legitimate aid flows reach Gaza,' as well as 'imposing sanctions on Israeli violent extremist settlers and pressing Israel to maintain vital correspondent banking relationships with Palestinian banks,' U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in a speech ahead of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank annual meetings this week. 'We look forward to the Israeli cabinet extending the waivers to preserve correspondent banking relationships for banks in the West Bank by the end of the month deadline to support economic stability in the West Bank,' she added. The agreement will expire on October 31, after Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich agreed to extend it for only three months during the summer. U.S. officials have warned that a failure to extend the banking relationship risks an economic collapse in the occupied West Bank and of the Palestinian Authority. Death toll from strike near Beirut hospital rises to 18 BEIRUT — The death toll from Israeli airstrikes late Monday that destroyed several buildings facing one of Beirut’s main hospitals climbed to 18. Lebanon’s health ministry said 60 others were wounded in the strikes, including seven who were in critical condition. Netanyahu's private residence was hit, damaged during weekend drone attack TEL AVIV, Israel — Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s private residence was hit and lightly damaged during a drone attack over the weekend, according to footage of the attack published by Israeli media on Tuesday. A photo of the attack showed damage to the bedroom window, which had a spiderweb of cracks and some burn marks. There were no injuries in the attack and neither Netanyahu nor his wife were in the home at the time of the attack. Earlier on Tuesday, Hezbollah’s chief spokesman took responsibility for the drone attack. 'The attempt by Iran’s proxy Hezbollah to assassinate the Prime Minister, it’s clearly a grave mistake,' said David Mencer, Israeli government spokesman. Israel’s military has at times struggled to intercept drones, which are smaller, fly more erratically and are harder to track and intercept. Last week, a Hezbollah drone attack on an army base in central Israel killed four soldiers and wounded 67 others, the deadliest strike by the militant group since Israel launched its ground invasion of Lebanon three weeks ago. Israeli airstrike levels building in southern Beirut suburb BEIRUT — An Israeli airstrike leveled a building in the southern Beirut suburb of Beirut on Tuesday. The strike came 40 minutes after Israeli military Arabic spokesperson Avichay Adraee issued a warning, claiming the two buildings targeted contained 'Hezbollah facilities.' The building stood in a heavily trafficked area across the street from a large park, which has become a refuge for many displaced families. It is also not far from the French ambassador’s residence. No immediate casualties were reported. The Israeli military did not have immediate comment about the target of the strike. At the time of the warning, Hezbollah’s chief spokesperson was holding a pre-scheduled press conference just a few hundred meters from the targeted area. The event was quickly cut short, with journalists and the spokesperson evacuating the location. The Israeli military did not have an immediate comment about the target of the strike. Amnesty International criticizes Israel's strikes on al-Qard al-Hassan JERUSALEM — Human rights group Amnesty International has criticized Israel’s targeting of branches of a Hezbollah-linked financial institution, saying the round of strikes this week 'likely violates international humanitarian law.' Amnesty said Tuesday the attack on al-Qard al-Hassan must be investigated as a war crime because financial institutions are considered civilian infrastructure under the laws of war unless they are being used for military purposes. 'Even if as the Israeli military alleges, the institution does provide financing to Hezbollah, it is not likely to meet the definition of a military objective, particularly for branches serving civilian customers,' said Erika Guevara Rosas, Amnesty’s senior director for research, advocacy, policy and campaigns. Israel’s strikes overnight Sunday into Monday hit at least 15 branches of al-Qard al-Hassan in Lebanon. Israel says the bank is used to fund attacks, and it issued evacuation warnings ahead of the strikes. Many ordinary Lebanese keep their savings at the financial institution. Hezbollah says it was behind drone attack on Netanyahu's house BEIRUT — Hezbollah’s chief spokesman says the group was behind the weekend drone attack that targeted Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s house without inflicting casualties. Mohammed Afif told reporters in Beirut Tuesday that if in the previous attack Netanyahu was not hurt, 'the coming days and nights and the (battle) fields are between us.' Afif was hinting that Hezbollah might carry out such attempts in the future. Afif said Hezbollah is fully responsible for the drone attack that targeted Netanyahu's house. He added that the group did it on its own. Netanyahu’s office said the drone on Saturday targeted his house in the Mediterranean coastal town of Caesarea. Neither he nor his wife was there. It wasn’t clear if the house was hit. Journalists taken on a tour of the Beirut hospital where Israel claimed Hezbollah stored cash and gold BEIRUT — An Associated Press team was among journalists taken on a tour inside a hospital in Beirut’s southern suburb where the Israeli army claimed without offering evidence that Hezbollah was storing hundreds of millions of dollars in cash and gold in tunnels underneath. The Sahel General Hospital had already been emptied of most patients and staff following intense bombardment of the area in recent days, and the few remaining ones were hastily evacuated late Monday after the Israeli claim. 'We have been living in terror for the last 24 hours,' hospital director Mazen Alame said Tuesday. 'There is nothing under the hospital.' Journalists were taken to the two floors under the hospital, the first of which had two rooms for surgeries and the other had oxygen bottles stored inside. The second floor included a morgue with six doors in one room and a giant water tank in another. Alame said the hospital has no affiliation with any political group or religious institution and has been working under the supervision of Lebanon’s health ministry since its founding. Israel has made similar claims about tunnels used by Hamas militants under hospitals in Gaza. Omar Mneimne, a doctor at the hospital’s emergency department, said he fears a repeat scenario in Lebanon. 'We fear that,' Mneimne said, adding that the international community should act to defend health facilities in Lebanon. 'It’s extremely hard. It’s very stressful for the community.' 7 Jerusalem residents arrested over an alleged Iranian-guided plot TEL AVIV, Israel — Israeli authorities said Tuesday they have arrested seven Jerusalem residents in connection with an alleged Iranian-guided plot to assassinate an Israeli scientist and mayor. It was the latest in a series of similar alleged spy rings foiled by Israel and blamed on Iran, highlighting the ongoing shadow war between the two countries even as their conflict has become more direct during the war in Gaza. A statement by Israel’s domestic security agency Shin Bet did not name the scientist or the mayor targeted. It said the seven people arrested were assigned various tasks as part of the alleged plot, including blowing up a police car and lobbing a grenade at a home. The Iranian agent promised the seven roughly $50,000 in exchange for the acts, the Shin Bet said. It said police found multiple credit cards, tens of thousands of shekels and a fake police car license plate. Those arrested were not identified but were from a predominantly Palestinian area of Jerusalem, the Shin Bet said. Tensions between Israel and Iran have soared since the killing in Tehran of Hamas’ leader Ismail Haniyeh — an attack blamed on Israel — and an Iranian missile attack on Israel earlier this month, for which Israel is expected to respond. Death toll from strike near Beirut hospital rises to 13 BEIRUT — The death toll from Israeli airstrikes that destroyed several buildings facing one of Beirut’s main hospitals late Monday has climbed to 13. Lebanon’s health ministry said 57 others were wounded in the strikes, including seven who were in critical condition. It said the airstrikes significantly damaged Rafik Hariri University Hospital, the country’s largest public hospital, located on the outskirts of southern Beirut. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military. State Department source says progress on day-after plan is key to US hopes for cease-fire TEL AVIV, Israel — The U.S. is making an eleventh hour effort to resuscitate aspects of the halted cease-fire deal between Israel and Hamas weeks before the presidential election and as Israel’s invasion of neighboring Lebanon intensifies, according to a senior U.S. State Department official. Since negotiations fell apart over the summer, Americans have focused on a postwar plan for Israel and Gaza. The State Department official, who spoke on condition of anonymity late Monday to preview Secretary of State Antony Blinken’s strategy, said stakeholders have reached consensus on some aspects of the so-called day-after plan and that the U.S. is hopeful the progress will bring the parties back to the table on a cease-fire. The official added that the decision to go to Israel before meeting with Arab partners was a shift in the U.S.'s negotiation strategy. The U.S. has long pushed for a postwar settlement in which a reformed Palestinian Authority would govern Gaza with help from Arab states and Saudi Arabia would normalize relations with Israel. Arab leaders insist such plans would depend on a pathway to Palestinian statehood, something to which Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is deeply opposed. He has ruled out any postwar role for the PA and says local Palestinians will administer Gaza, with Israel maintaining open-ended security control. Blinken also planned to reiterate concerns about the humanitarian aid crisis in Gaza that U.S. officials outlined in a recent letter to Israel, the official said. But the official said an anticipated Israeli retaliation against Iran is looming over the meeting, which will likely be the last time Blinken and Netanyahu meet before the U.S. presidential election. — By Farnoush Amiri Blinken arrives in Israel on mission to restart cease-fire talks U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken arrived in Israel on Tuesday on his 11th visit to the region since the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war, as the U.S. hopes to revive cease-fire efforts after the killing of top Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar. Blinken is expected to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other top officials. Following Israel, he’s expected to visit several Arab countries, likely to include Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. Here more here. Iran keeps up pressure as Israeli retaliation looms DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Iran said Tuesday that its Arab Gulf neighbors wouldn’t allow their territory to be used for an expected Israeli strike as the Islamic Republic once again vowed to respond to any attack. The comments from Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian and Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi come as speculation grows over how Israel will retaliate for Tehran’s Oct. 1 ballistic missile attack on Israel. Speaking in Kuwait as part of a Mideast tour, Araghchi insisted that Gulf Arab neighbors he’s spoken to wouldn’t allow their territory to be used. 'All the neighbors assured us that they will not allow their lands and air to be used against Iran,' Araghchi said, according to the state-run IRNA news agency. 'This is an expectation from all friendly and neighboring countries and we consider this a sign of friendship.' However, many Gulf Arab nations host major U.S. military installations, like Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, as a hedge against any possible attack by Iran. Washington also has based aircraft carriers around the region as tensions have persisted in the wake of Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel and the subsequent wars raging across the Mideast. Gulf Arab nations have not made any public pledges like those described by Araghchi. There have been tensions in the Persian Gulf and among Gulf Arab countries since Tehran launched a series of attacks targeting shipping in the region in 2019 over the U.S.'s unilateral withdrawal from Iran’s nuclear deal with world powers as well. Separately, Pezeshkian warned that Israel will face a 'corresponding answer' for any attack it carries out. Another Israeli strike hits Lebanon-Syria border crossing BEIRUT — Lebanon’s state news agency says another Israeli airstrike has targeted the country’s main border crossing with Syria, leaving a second large crater on the highway running through it. The National News Agency reported that the early Tuesday airstrike was closer to the Syrian side of the crossing, known as Jdeidet Yabous. Syrian TV also reported an airstrike in the border area. An Israeli airstrike on Oct. 5 blocked a highway and left a giant crater near the Lebanese side of the crossing, known as Masnaa, about 50 kilometers (30 miles) from Beirut. That strike prevented vehicles from going through the crossing, which tens of thousands of people have used to flee to Syria. People now have to cross by foot in or around the two large craters several kilometers (miles) away. The Israeli military has accused the Hezbollah militant group of using the Masnaa crossing to truck in military equipment from Syria. There was no immediate comment on the latest strike. Hezbollah fires rockets into central Israel TEL AVIV, Israel — Hezbollah launched a barrage of rockets into central Israel on Tuesday, setting off air raid sirens in the country’s most populated areas but causing no apparent damage or injuries. The Israeli military said five projectiles were fired from Lebanon into Israel and most were intercepted by Israel’s missile defense system. One landed in an open area. Israeli police said there were no reports of damage or injury following the salvo. The Israeli military said that at the same time, about 15 projectiles were fired from Lebanon into northern Israel. Earlier Tuesday, air raid sirens went off in the Israeli-occupied West Bank after a rocket was launched from Lebanon, the Israeli military said. Homes in the Palestinian village of Shuqba were damaged. The rocket fire came as Israel stepped up its strikes in Lebanon, targeting a Hezbollah-run financial institution, and as Israeli troops pushed ahead in their invasion of southern Lebanon.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-hezbollah-mideast-latest-22-october-2024-9fc49430fd9824a0143b3ba6dd0f0d6c	2024-10-21T21:01:20-07:00	
A Samoan village prepares to welcome King Charles but fears an uncertain future for its reef	SIUMU, Samoa (AP) — Under clear skies, shortly after sunrise in the beachside fishing village of Siumu, Samoa, on Tuesday a dozen men and children prepared their small boats for a day at sea. But underwater a mile off the coast, lay the hulking shape of a sunken New Zealand naval vessel them is forcing them to travel further away to fish than before. They had arrived home from Monday's trip just a few hours earlier. The village, festooned with Samoan and British flags, is bustling with preparations to host King Charles III and Queen Camilla when the royals arrive on Wednesday for a biennial meeting of leaders from 56 Commonwealth countries. It is the first time a Pacific Island nation has hosted the event. But Siumu was already busy. New Zealand and Samoan officials have been working along miles of the nearby coastline for weeks to monitor and curb environmental damage caused by the sinking of the HMNZS Manawanui, which ran aground on the reef, caught fire and sank earlier this month. The 75 people on board the specialist dive and hydrographic vessel — one of nine ships in New Zealand's navy — were all evacuated safely. Early fears of a catastrophic fuel spill were later quashed by officials who said oil had not gushed from the ship as it sank. But many who live in Siumu and surrounding villages are worried that damage to the reef from the wreck threatens their longer-term survival. 'I don’t know when it’s going to be good again and to back to the normal as we have before,' said Netina Malae, who has temporarily closed her small resort at nearby Tafitoala. The colorful fales, or huts, lining the beach sit empty. Recovery efforts on the reef have focused on removing three large shipping containers left after the sinking, one of them laden with food. New Zealand's military hoped to float the final one — which is empty and damaged — to shore on Tuesday, although winds and tides threatened to foil their efforts. Meanwhile, fishers who once spent their days where the boat foundered face longer and more expensive trips, they told The Associated Press. 'We doubled the amount of petrol to go far out to get fish,' said Faalogo Afereti Taliulu, citing advice from Samoa’s government that seafood from the area around the sunken ship should not be eaten. 'That’s why that’s our concern. It’s financially affecting us.' Taliulu and others from the village on Upolu, the largest island of Samoa, fish mostly for tuna. It is their biggest industry and a family affair. His cousin, Taula Fagatuai, said currents and tides meant the fishers were unsure if seafood they were catching further afield than the exclusion area was safe to eat. Repercussions for the fragile marine ecosystem of damage caused by the vessel, its anchor chain and shipping containers are not yet clear. 'That boat is going to be ruining our reef,' Fagatuai said. Some in Siumu and surrounding villages are urging New Zealand’s government to pay compensation for their lost earnings, but a swift resolution is unlikely. The cause of the ship’s sinking is unknown and a court of inquiry has been established to investigate the episode. How much fuel is seeping from the vessel is another contested matter. New Zealand’s Defense Minister Judith Collins said last week that a residual 'trickle' of diesel from the ship was evaporating quickly from the ocean's surface. She said the amount of fuel that had spilled into the ocean was less than what had been reported by Samoan officials and that much of what the ship was carrying burned out in the fire. Samoa's Prime Minister Fiame Naomi Mata’afa assured reporters last week that there was 'no evidence of any leaks' from the vessel's main tanks. But the amount of diesel that flowed from the ship as it sank is not known, Commodore Andrew Brown, the senior national representative for the New Zealand’s military in Samoa, told the AP on Tuesday. Retrieving the remaining fuel from the sunken vessel was 'a priority,' he added. There are not yet plans to raise the vessel from its resting place. The diesel sheen on the water surface and its movement in the currents is observed daily, Brown said. 'We’re also monitoring the coastline.' Officials from both countries have said there is no visible damage to Samoa's beaches or wildlife. But some in the surrounding villages, who say they have encountered oil in the water and seen it coating people or fish, are not reassured. 'My children went to the spot where they surf. And when they came back they said that everywhere there is oil,' Malae said. 'And then I touched their bodies -- slippery with the oil. So I’m sure that this oil was there.' The disaster unfolded as Samoa prepared to host the British royals — who will stay at a resort near Siumu's fishing village — and other world leaders at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting. Meetings among civil society leaders have already begun, with an official opening ceremony scheduled for Friday. But the uncertainty over the impact of the sunken ship has curtailed tourism opportunities during the event. Malae usually takes visitors out to sea on fishing or surfing trips or to spot turtles. Now, she said, 'it's all stopped.' ___ Graham-McLay reported from Wellington, New Zealand.	https://apnews.com/article/samoa-king-charles-zealand-navy-boat-sank-be10fb9b6d85ff74c25f07daaafa9198	2024-10-21T20:41:04-07:00	
Stock market today: Asian shares fall after Wall Street pulls back from its records	TOKYO (AP) — Asian shares outside of China declined in cautious trading Tuesday ahead of earnings reports both in the region and overseas, after Wall Street’s long, record-breaking rally ran out of steam. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 dove 1.1% to 38,496.44. Australia's S&amp;P/ASX 200 dropped 1.6% to 8,213.00, while South Korea's Kospi slipped nearly 1.0% to 2,579.56. Hong Kong's Hang Seng added 0.5% to 20,576.07 while the Shanghai Composite rose 0.5% to 3,285.49 following a cut to interest rates that took effect on Monday. On Wall Street, the S&amp;P 500 slipped 0.2% to 5,853.98, coming off a sixth straight winning week, its longest such streak of the year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0.8% from its own record that was likewise set on Friday, to 42,931.60. The Nasdaq composite rose 0.3% to 18,540.00. Real-estate stocks fell to the sharpest loss among the 11 sectors that make up the S&amp;P 500 index, while homebuilders Lennar and D.R. Horton both fell at least 4.3%. Home Depot’s 2.1% drop was one of the heaviest weights on the S&amp;P 500. The declines mean at least a pause in Wall Street’s rally to records, which was built in large part on optimism that the U.S. economy can make a perfect escape from the worst inflation in generations, one that ends without a painful recession that many investors had worried could be inevitable. With the Federal Reserve now cutting interest rates to keep the economy humming, optimists hope stocks can rise even further. But critics are warning stock prices look too expensive given they’ve climbed much faster than corporate profits. That puts pressure on companies to deliver growth in profits to justify their stock prices, and more than 100 companies in the S&amp;P 500 are scheduled to give details this week about their performances during the summer. That includes such heavyweights as AT&amp;T, Coca-Cola, IBM, General Motors and Tesla. Tesla slipped 0.8% ahead of its report. Its stock has been shaky recently, including a tumble after an update on its highly anticipated robotaxi included fewer details than investors were hoping for. Boeing is reporting its latest results on Wednesday. It rose 3.1% after reaching an agreement with the union representing its striking machinists on a contract proposal. The union’s members could vote Wednesday on the deal, which could end a costly walkout that has crippled production of airplanes for more than a month. Trump Media &amp; Technology Group rose 5.8% to top $31, continuing its strong run since it briefly dipped below $12 last month. The company behind former President Donald Trump’s Truth Social platform is still losing money, but its stock often moves more with his perceived chances of reelection than anything else. Markets appear to be rotating towards a possible Trump win, according to Michael Wilson and other strategists at Morgan Stanley. They point to how stocks of financial companies have helped to lead the market this month, and consumer companies that could be hurt by tariffs are lagging. Bond yields are also rising, along with some precious metals prices and cryptocurrencies. In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.19% from 4.08% late Friday. The Bank of Canada will also announce its latest decision on interest rates Wednesday, where it could cut by half a percentage point. In energy trading, benchmark U.S. crude lost 21 cents to $70.35 a barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, fell 18 cents to $74.11 a barrel. In currency trading, the U.S. dollar rose to 150.96 Japanese yen from 150.69 yen. The euro was unchanged at $1.0819. ___ AP Business Writer Stan Choe contributed.	https://apnews.com/article/stocks-markets-china-earnings-rates-0323c07ea21f8a000c26b9c7f2a6cb64	2024-10-21T19:42:44-07:00	
In annual religious pilgrimage, Panamanians crawl to reach the Black Christ of Portobelo	PORTOBELO, Panama (AP) — At dawn, pilgrims like Ernesto Troya undertook the hardest stretch of their journey to reach the statue of the Black Christ of Portobelo in Panama. Moved by faith, they crawled for several hours along the street toward the image of the saint. It is one of the most striking scenes to happen every year in the northern province of Colón. Every Oct. 21, the province celebrates the festival of the Black Christ of Portobelo. It is considered one of the largest Catholic pilgrimages in the Central American country and dates back centuries. Portobelo is a tourist destination that is part of Panama’s historical and cultural heritage. The city served as a port and trade center during the Spanish colonial times in the Caribbean Sea. According to some historians, legend has it that a fisherman found the statue of the Black Christ wrapped in a 'cayuco,' or wooden boat, off the coast of Portobelo on Oct. 21, 1658. When the Spaniards discovered the presence of the saint, they decided to move it to another country on the continent. However, every time the boat tried to set sail with the statue, a storm came and prevented it from leaving port. The settlers, many of them of slave and African descent, adopted the image as their patron saint. Thousands of pilgrims arrive at the church of San Felipe, which houses the Black Christ on an altar. After walking long distances in what is known as 'mandas' they give thanks for a favor or miracle granted. Many pilgrims like Troya, a 46-year-old security guard, made a dramatic final run through the streets of the town. Crawling to the image of the Christ, the pilgrimage usually causes cramps and knee injuries. 'If one gets on their knees with the faith one has (in the saint) everything will go well. With faith everything is possible,' said Troya.	https://apnews.com/article/panama-black-christ-pilgrimage-religion-portobelo-1394eb0de3ac6b6fe2d77f23e88505b3	2024-10-21T19:06:04-07:00	
China holds live-fire drills opposite Taiwan, a week after large-scale exercise	TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) — China is holding live-fire drills off the coast of its southern Fujian province facing Taiwan, just a week after a massive air-and-sea drill it described as punishment for Taiwan's president rejecting Beijing's claims of sovereignty. The live-fire drills were being held near the Pingtan islands, according to a notice from the Maritime Safety Administration. It warned ships to avoid the area. It did not offer additional details. Taiwan's Defense Ministry said China's drills were part of an annual exercise and it was tracking them. 'It cannot be ruled out that it is one of the ways to expand the deterrent effect in line with the dynamics in the Taiwan Strait,' the statement added. Taiwan is a self-ruled island that Beijing claims is part of China. Tensions around the issue have flared in recent years. China has increased its presence in the waters and skies around Taiwan. It now increasingly sends large numbers of warplanes and navy vessels to military exercises near Taiwan, and its coast guard carries out patrols. Last week, China held a one-day military exercise aimed at practicing the 'sealing off of key ports and key areas.' Taiwan counted a record one-day total of 153 aircraft, 14 navy vessels and 12 Chinese government ships. Taiwan's premier, Cho Jung-tai, called on China to stop its exercises aimed at Taiwan. 'Like all democratic countries in the world, we believe that China’s military exercises are a threat to regional peace and stability. Regardless of the scale of the exercise, China’s military exercises should not frequently approach Taiwan to make meaningless declarations,' he said. In response to Chinese moves, the U.S. has continued what it calls 'freedom of navigation' transits through the Taiwan Strait. On Sunday, the destroyer USS Higgins and the Canadian frigate HMCS Vancouver transited the narrow band of ocean that separates China and Taiwan. Germany sent two warships through the Taiwan Strait last month as it seeks to increase its defense engagement in the Asia-Pacific region. China has also exerted diplomatic pressure on Taiwan, poaching its allies. South Africa, which does not recognize Taiwan as a country, asked the island last week to move its liaison office outside the capital, Pretoria, as a concession to China. Taiwan on Monday said it would fight the request. —— AP senior video producer Johnson Lai contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/china-taiwan-live-fire-drills-4f7b62d187f68878acdacdd4d55fb891	2024-10-21T19:01:54-07:00	
King Charles III's Commonwealth visit to Samoa will highlight climate change ... and dance	LONDON (AP) — King Charles III should be prepared to dance when he visits Samoa this week. Freddie Tuilagi made sure of that when he visited St. James' Palace recently wearing nothing but a bark cloth wrap and a necklace historically worn by orator chiefs. Charles, in a blue suit and carefully knotted tie, grinned while gamely trying to follow along as Samoa’s honorary consul to the U.K. moved through the steps of a traditional dance. 'He loves it. He said he wants to learn the dance,' Tuilagi said afterward, showing off his moves once again. Tuilagi, who moved to Britain to play professional rugby, said the 75-year-old king can expect more of the same when he arrives in the South Pacific island nation on Wednesday. Villagers throughout the country of 220,000 people have taken steps to decorate and show how much they appreciate Charles’ visit, he said. Charles, the symbolic head of the Commonwealth, is traveling to Samoa for a meeting of top government officials from each of the 56 independent nations that make up the organization. At the top of the agenda is the fight against climate change, an issue Charles has championed for decades. The king can count on Samoans to be receptive. Its islands are at the forefront of the climate emergency, facing increasing threats from rising sea levels, warming ocean temperatures and more intense storms. The royal visit is attracting global media attention. Many Samoans hope that images of the king and Queen Camilla strolling on the islands’ breathtaking beaches will help attract European tourists and boost the economy. 'It’s an opportunity to showcase our culture, showcase our heritage and how ... proud (of) that we are as a country,’’ Tuilagi told The Associated Press. 'To host the king and the leaders of the Pacific, you know, the Commonwealth coming to Samoa is something special for us.’’ Before his Samoa trip, Charles visited Australia, where not everyone welcomed him. On Monday, Sen. Lidia Thorpe, shouted 'you are not my king,'' at a parliamentary reception for the king to protest the former British Empire's treatment of Indigenous peoples and to call on Australia to sever ties with the monarchy. But Samoa has a different relationship with the monarchy. Unlike Australia, Samoa is not one of the 14 independent countries outside the United Kingdom where the British monarch remains the head of state. Tuilagi said he hopes his demonstration of Samoan dance and song will help the king when he arrives. He particularly hoped that he would make an impression since he wore national dress, which includes leaving the shirt at home. Think joy. That's Tuilagi's point. 'It’s not every day the king will see a chief from Samoa topless ... at the palace,’’ he said, chuckling.	https://apnews.com/article/king-charles-samoa-commonwealth-dance-89b658cf3b0529b7a19c0361208a29c8	2024-10-21T18:27:27-07:00	
King Charles III ends first Australian visit by a reigning British monarch in 13 years	MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — King Charles III ends the first visit to Australia by a reigning British monarch in 13 years Tuesday with anti-monarchists hoping his journey is a step toward an Australian citizen becoming head of state. Controversy interrupted the visit on Monday when Indigenous independent senator Lidia Thorpe yelled at Charles during a reception that he was not her king and Australia was not his land. Esther Anatolitis, co-chair of the Australian Republic Movement, that campaigns for an Australian citizen to replace the British monarch as Australia’s head of state, said while thousands turned out to see the king and Queen Camilla at their public engagements, the numbers were larger when his mother Queen Elizabeth II first visited Australia 70 years ago. An estimated 75% of Australia’s population saw the queen in person during the first visit by a reigning British monarch in 1954. 'It’s understandable that Australians would be welcoming the king and queen, we also welcome them,' Anatolitis said. 'But it doesn’t make any sense to continue to have a head of state appointed by birth right from another country.' Anatolitis acknowledged that getting a majority of Australians in a majority of states to vote to change the constitution would be difficult. Australians haven’t changed their constitution since 1977. 'It’s tricky, isn’t it? We’ve got that hurdle, of course,' Anatolitis said. Constitutional lawyer Anne Twomey said an Australian republic was not something that Charles, 75, need worry about in his lifetime. She said the failure of a referendum last year to create an 'utterly innocuous' Indigenous representative body to advise government demonstrated the difficulty in changing Australia’s constitution. 'It’s just that on the whole people aren’t prepared to change the constitution,' Twomey said. 'So a republic, which would be a much more complex constitutional question than the one last year, would be far more vulnerable to a scare campaign and to opposition,' she said. 'So unless you had absolutely unanimous support across the board and a strong reason for doing it, it would fail,' she added. Philip Benwell, national chair of the Australian Monarchist League, which wants to maintain Australia’s constitutional link to Britain, said he was standing near Thorpe at the Canberra reception when she started yelling at the king and demanding a treaty with Indigenous Australians. 'I think she alienated a lot of sympathy. If anything, she’s helped to strengthen our support,' Benwell said. Thorpe has been criticized, including by some Indigenous leaders, for shouting at the king and failing to show respect. Thorpe was unrepentant. She rejected criticism that her aggressive approach toward the monarch was violent. 'I think what was unacceptable is the violence in that room, of the King of England praising himself, dripping in stolen wealth, that’s what’s violent,' Thorpe told Australian Broadcasting Corp. 'The violence is from the colonizer being in that room asserting his authority, being paid for by every taxpayer in this country.' Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese wants Australia to become a republic but has ruled out a referendum during his first three-year term. A vote remains a possibility if his center-left Labor Party wins elections due by May next year. Australians decided in a referendum in 1999 to retain Queen Elizabeth II as head of state. That result is widely regarded to have been the consequence of disagreement about how a president would be chosen rather than majority support for a monarch. Sydney University royal historian Cindy McCreery suspects Australia is not yet ready to make the change. 'There's interest in becoming a republic, but I think what we may forget is that logistically speaking we're not going to have a referendum on that issue any time soon,' McCreery said. 'I, as a historian, think that it's probably not realistic to expect a successful referendum on a republic until we've done more work on acknowledging our ... complicated history,' she said. 'Becoming a republic doesn't mean that we've somehow thrown off British colonialism. It hopefully has meant that we're engaging with our own history in an honest and thoughtful way,' she added. Charles and Camilla’s Tuesday began watching Indigenous dancers perform at a Sydney Indigenous community center. The couple used tongs to cook sausages at a community barbecue lunch at the central suburb of Parramatta and later shook the hands of well-wishers for the last time of their visit outside the Sydney Opera House. Their final engagement was an inspection of navy ships on Sydney Harbor in an event known as a fleet review. Charles's trip to Australia was scaled down because he is undergoing cancer treatment. He arrives in Samoa on Wednesday.	https://apnews.com/article/australia-king-charles-republic-monarchy-2bdb86c1e7e492f4447288efd84c74ed	2024-10-21T18:22:50-07:00	
Two plead guilty to murder of former Air India suspect Ripudaman Singh Mali	NEW WESTMINSTER, British Columbia (AP) — Two men accused of killing of former Air India bombing suspect Ripudaman Singh Malik have pleaded guilty to second-degree murder in a Canadian court. The courthouse in New Westminster, British Columbia, confirmed the pleas on Monday from Tanner Fox and Jose Lopez in the shooting death of Malik, who was acquitted in 2005 of the bombings that killed 331 people in 1985. Fox and Lopez, who were originally charged with first-degree murder, will next appear in court on Oct. 31 for sentencing. In a statement, Malik’s family said while the family is 'grateful' that Fox and Lopez were brought to justice, they are urging the two men to cooperate with police 'in bringing those that hired you to justice.' Malik, 75, was shot dead in his vehicle outside his business in Surrey, British Columbia, on July 14, 2022. He was a one-time supporter of the separatist Khalistan movement in India. Malik and a co-defendant were found not guilty of murder and conspiracy in the 1985 Air India bombings. A high-altitude bombing of one plane caused it to crash in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Ireland, killing all 329 passengers and crew. The terror attack was the worst act of mass murder in Canadian history. Roughly one hour later, a bomb destined for another Air India plane exploded prematurely at an airport in Japan, killing two baggage handlers. Inderjit Singh Reyat, the only man convicted in the bombings, testified for the prosecution at Malik and Bagri’s trial and was later convicted of perjury. The alleged suspects in the bombings were Sikhs in the Khalistan movement, an effort to create a separate homeland for Sikhs in India’s Punjab state. Police said before charging Fox and Lopez that people waited for hours in a vehicle for Malik before the shooting. Malik’s son, Jaspreet Singh Malik, has said family members had never heard of Fox or Lopez, and he did not know why anyone would kill his father. In the latest statement, the Malik family called the killing an assassination without identifying who they believe to be involved. 'Tanner Fox and Jose Lopez were hired to commit this murder,' the statement said. 'Until the parties responsible for hiring them and directing this assassination are brought to justice, the work remains incomplete. 'To Tanner Fox and Jose Lopez we say: You have taken a good first step in taking responsibility for your actions. Now take the next step and co-operate with the RCMP in bringing those that hired you to justice.' Earlier this month, Royal Canadian Mounted Commissioner Mike Duheme said the force had launched a special unit to investigate multiple cases of extortion, coercion and violence, including murders, linked to agents of the Indian government. Duheme said the RCMP were speaking out due to what it deemed as a serious threat to public safety. Canada expelled six Indian diplomats who police have named as persons of interest in the cases. They were not specific about which murders may be involved in the allegations. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told Parliament last year that there was credible intelligence linking India’s government to the murder of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a temple leader shot while in his truck in the parking lot of the gurdwara in Surrey, British Columbia. Four men have been charged in that murder. Police are alleging that diplomats used their position to collect information on Canadians within the Khalistan movement. Mounties alleged the diplomats passed the information on to criminal gangs who targeted individuals directly, allegations that India has denied. Court documents show both Fox and Lopez have previous criminal records.	https://apnews.com/article/air-india-bombing-suspect-murder-canada-98257bb3ff8522ee4aaa3901353eff3f	2024-10-21T17:21:22-07:00	
Peru’s ex-president Toledo gets more than 20 years in prison in case linked to corruption scandal	LIMA, Peru (AP) — Peru’s former President Alejandro Toledo on Monday was sentenced to 20 years and six months in prison in a case involving Brazilian construction giant Odebrecht, which became synonymous with corruption across Latin America, where it paid millions of dollars in bribes to government officials and others. Authorities accused Toledo of accepting $35 million in bribes from Odebrecht in exchange for allowing the construction of a highway in the South American country. The National Superior Court of Specialized Criminal Justice in the capital, Lima, imposed the sentence after years of legal wrangling, including a dispute over whether Toledo, who governed Peru from 2001 to 2006, could be extradited from the United States. Judge Inés Rojas said Toledo’s victims were Peruvians who 'trusted' him as their president. Rojas explained that in that role, Toledo was 'in charge of managing public finances' and responsible for 'protecting and ensuring the correct' use of resources. Instead, she said, he 'defrauded the state.' She added that Toledo 'had the duty to act with absolute neutrality, protect and preserve the assets of the state, avoiding their abuse or exploitation,' but he did not do so. Odebrecht, which built some of Latin America’s most crucial infrastructure projects, admitted to U.S. authorities in 2016 to having bought government contracts throughout the region with generous bribes. The investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice spun probes in several countries, including Mexico, Guatemala and Ecuador. In Peru, authorities accused Toledo and three other former presidents of receiving payments from the construction giant. They alleged Toledo received $35 million from Odebrecht in exchange for the contract to build 650 kilometers (403 miles) of a highway linking Brazil with southern Peru. That portion of the highway was initially estimated to cost $507 million, but Peru ended up paying $1.25 billion. Rojas at one point read parts of the testimony from Jorge Barata, a former Odebrecht executive in Peru, who told prosecutors that the former president called him up to three times after leaving office to demand that he be paid. Toledo lowered his gaze and looked at his hands as Rojas read the expletive-laden remarks that Barata recounted to prosecutors. Toledo has denied the accusations against him. His attorney, Roberto Siu, told reporters after the hearing that they will appeal the sentence. The former president on Monday frequently smirked, and at times laughed, particularly when the judge mentioned multimillion-dollar sums central to the case as well as when she struggled to read transcripts and other evidence in the case. Throughout the hearing, he also leaned to his right to speak with his attorney. In contrast, last week, he asked the court with a broken voice and his hands together, as if he were praying, to let him return home citing his age, cancer and heart problems. Toledo, 78, was first arrested in 2019 at his home in California, where he had been living since 2016, when he returned to Stanford University, his alma mater, as a visiting scholar to study education in Latin America. He was initially held in solitary confinement at a county jail east of San Francisco but was released to house arrest in 2020 because of the COVID-19 pandemic and his deteriorating mental health. He was extradited to Peru in 2022 after a court of appeals denied a challenge to his extradition and he surrendered to authorities. He has since remained under preventive detention. Rojas said Toledo will get credit for time served starting in April 2023. He will serve the remainder of his sentence at a prison on the outskirts of Lima that was built specifically to house former Peruvian presidents. Prosecutor José Domingo Pérez after the hearing described the sentence as 'historic' and said it shows Peruvians that 'crimes and corruption are punished.' Odebrecht rebranded as Novonor in 2020. ____ Garcia Cano reported from Mexico City. ____ Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america	https://apnews.com/article/peru-toledo-prison-sentence-odebrecht-5f23c3d8fd176dfc6ca8125e96b2e3ec	2024-10-21T14:11:02-07:00	
Hundreds mourn Catholic priest and Indigenous peace activist killed in southern Mexico	SAN ANDRES LARRAINZAR, Mexico (AP) — Hundreds gathered Monday to mourn Catholic priest Marcelo Pérez, an activist for Indigenous peoples and farm laborers who was killed in the southern Mexico state of Chiapas. It was a killing that many say was a tragedy foretold, in a state where drug cartels have caused thousands of people to flee their homes. Mourners gathered in San Andres Larrainzar, near the city of San Cristobal de las Casas, where Pérez was killed on Sunday. Pérez, a leading activist for peace in the violence-torn state, was from San Andrés Larrainzar. A mass in his honor Monday was held in Spanish and Tzotzil, the Indigenous language he spoke. Pérez, 50, had often received threats, but nonetheless continued to work as a peace activist. Human rights advocates said Pérez did not receive the government protection he needed. 'For years, we insisted that the Mexican government should address the threats and aggressions against him, but they never implemented measures to guarantee his life, security and well-being,' The Fray Bartolome de las Casas human rights center wrote. While there was no immediate information on the killers — President Claudia Sheinbaum only said that 'investigations are being carried out' — Rev. Pérez's peace and mediation efforts may have angered one of the two drug cartels that are currently fighting for control of Chiapas. The state is a lucrative route for smuggling both drugs and migrants. 'Father Marcelo Pérez was the subject of constant threats and aggressions on the part of organized crime groups,' according to the rights center, adding that his killing 'occurred in the context of a serious escalation of violence against the public in all the regions of Chiapas.' For at least the last two years, the Sinaloa and Jalisco cartels have been engaged in bloody turf battles that involve killing whole families, and forcing villagers to take sides in the dispute. Hundreds of Chiapas residents have had to flee to neighboring Guatemala for their own safety. 'They should look for an intelligent way to disarm those groups,' said Cardinal Felipe Arizmendi, who once served as the bishop for the area. 'They shouldn't wait for people to file complaints, and people are going to file complaints because their lives are at risk.' Together with continued drug violence in the northern state of Sinaloa, and the army killings of six migrants earlier this month, the killing of Pérez was another embarrassment for the government. Sheinbaum took office Oct. 1 and has pledged to follow the policy of her predecessor and mentor, former president Andrés Manuel López Obrador, of not confronting the drug cartels. The policy has failed to significantly reduce violence. 'This is a reflection of the whole country,' Cardinal Arizmendi said following the mass for Pérez. 'They shouldn't say everything is fine in Mexico. Please.' he continued. 'This strategy has not worked.' The state prosecutors’ office said Rev. Pérez was shot dead by two gunmen when he was in his van, just after he had finished celebrating Mass. He served in the community for two decades and was known as a negotiator in conflicts in a mountainous region of Chiapas where crime, violence and land disputes are rife. Pérez also led several marches against violence, which has brought him several death threats. The U.N. Human Rights Office said Pérez was the seventh human rights activist killed in Mexico so far in 2024. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america	https://apnews.com/article/mexico-violence-chiapas-priest-activist-killed-91babd8eb739a110888d69b5d1afef86	2024-10-21T13:34:30-07:00	
A New Zealand airport wants you to hug goodbye faster	WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — Emotional farewells are a common sight at airports, but travelers leaving the New Zealand city of Dunedin will have to be quick. A new three-minute time limit on goodbye hugs in the airport's drop-off area is intended to prevent lingering cuddles from causing traffic jams. 'Max hug time three minutes,' warn signs outside the terminal, adding that those seeking 'fonder farewells' should head to the airport’s parking lot instead. The cuddle cap was imposed in September to 'keep things moving smoothly' in the redesigned passenger drop-off area outside the airport, CEO Dan De Bono told The Associated Press on Tuesday. It was the airport’s way of reminding people that the zone was for 'quick farewells' only. The signs had polarized social media users, De Bono said. 'We were accused of breaching basic human rights and how dare we limit how long someone can have a hug for,' he said, adding that others had welcomed the change. The signs were meant as an alternative to those at other airports warning of wheel clamping or fines for drivers parked in drop-off areas. Some in Britain have imposed fees for all drop-offs — however brief. Dunedin's airport — a modest terminal serving a city of 135,000 people on New Zealand's South Island — preferred a 'quirky' approach, De Bono said. Three minutes was 'plenty of time to pull up, say farewell to your loved ones and move on,' he said. 'The time limit is really a nicer way of saying, you know, get on with it.' A 20-second hug is long enough to release the wellbeing-boosting hormones oxytocin and serotonin, De Bono said. Anything longer was 'really awkward.' But passengers need not worry unduly about enforcement. 'We do not have hug police,' De Bono said. Visitors might, however, be asked to move their lingering embraces to the parking lot, where they can cuddle free of charge for up to 15 minutes.	https://apnews.com/article/new-zealand-airport-goodbye-hugs-time-limit-d6176082ffb6ab66e8d2f05dd590b8aa	2024-10-21T13:23:53-07:00	
President Paul Biya returns to Cameroon amid rumors his health is failing	YAOUNDE, Cameroon (AP) — Cameroon’s President Paul Biya returned to his home country after weeks abroad amid rumors that his health is failing, a state-run television station reported Monday. The 91-year-old president of the West African country appeared on television at the airport in the capital Yaounde, shaking hands with officials next to his wife Chantal and greeted by a cheering crowd of supporters. 'Finally, this is not a phantom, it is President Paul Piya having a lengthy discussion with government officials,' a presenter from the state-run broadcaster Cameroon Radio Television (CRTV) said. Questions about Biya's health and whereabouts grew after he was last seen in public at the China-Africa summit in Beijing a month ago. Since then, he has not attended gatherings where he had been expected, including the United Nations General Assembly and the International Organization of La Francophonie summit in France. Biya, who is known for traveling often to Europe, is known to be sick but no details have been publicly shared. Biya is Africa’s second-longest-serving leader and Cameroon’s second president since independence in 1960. He has been in power since 1982. He is the only leader many in the country have ever known. His government faces various challenges, including the secessionist movement in Cameroon’s English-speaking provinces that has resulted in deadly clashes with security forces as well as Islamic extremist violence by the Boko Haram group based in neighboring Nigeria.	https://apnews.com/article/cameroon-president-biya-return-health-60c15abc848d5de766b72c1139d147f3	2024-10-21T10:41:44-07:00	
What is the Hezbollah-linked financial institution Israel is targeting in Lebanon?	BEIRUT (AP) — The Israeli military has carried out a wave of airstrikes targeting branches of a financial institution affiliated with Lebanon’s Hezbollah, saying the quasi-banking system is being used to fund the militant group's military wing. The strikes destroyed more than a dozen branches of al-Qard al-Hasan across Lebanon Sunday night, and came two weeks after an airstrike killed the man who many referred to as Hezbollah’s 'finance minister.' After assassinating most of Hezbollah’s top political and military commanders, including the group’s longtime leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, and pummeling its communities with devastating airstrikes, Israel says it is now going after the Shiite group’s funders and financial institutions in an attempt to further disrupt it and its base of support. Hezbollah started attacking Israeli military posts along the border with Lebanon a day after the Oct. 7, 2023, attack by Hamas on southern Israel that killed some 1,200 people and took about 250 hostage. Hezbollah said that by launching attacks along the Lebanon-Israel border it was backing up its Hamas allies in the Gaza Strip. What is al-Qard al-Hasan and who benefits from it? Al-Qard al-Hasan is officially a non-profit charity institution operating outside the Lebanese financial system, and one of the tools by which Hezbollah entrenches its support among the country’s Shiite population. In addition to its military wing, Hezbollah has branches that run schools, hospitals, low-price grocery stores, as well as al-Qard al-Hasan, from which hundreds of thousands of its supporters benefit. Israel says the institution finances arms purchases and is used to pay Hezbollah fighters. The U.S. Treasury has imposed sanctions on it since 2007, saying it is 'used by Hezbollah as a cover' to manage the militant group’s financial activities 'and gain access to the international financial system.' Founded four decades ago, soon after Hezbollah’s inception, the association, whose name in Arabic means 'the benevolent loan,' offers interest-free loans and allows people to deposit gold as collateral in return for the credit, enabling them to pay for school fees and weddings, buy a car or open a small business. People can also open savings accounts. Al-Qard al-Hasan has more than 30 branches around Lebanon. Following Lebanon’s 2019 financial collapse, the institution provided a lifeline for many Lebanese. Unlike banks around the country that imposed limits on how much people could withdraw from their bank accounts, people with deposits at al-Qard al-Hasan were still able to withdraw their cash. In 2021, the U.S. Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control imposed sanctions on seven individuals in connection with Hezbollah and al-Qard al-Hasan. A year later, the Biden administration slapped terrorism sanctions on two others, including al-Qard al-Hasan’s director, Adel Mansour, and two companies in Lebanon for providing Hezbollah with financial services. Mansour did not respond to messages left by The Associated Press for comment. After sanctions were imposed against him two years, he told the AP: 'I am proud and this is a medal of honor for me.' A senior official at the central bank in Beirut refused to comment about the Israeli targeting of al-Qard al-Hasan branches when contacted by the AP on Monday. David Asher, an expert on illicit financing who has worked at the U.S. Defense and State Departments and is now a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, said the Israeli attacks were 'a big deal.' 'Al-Qard al-Hasan is part of Hezbollah’s central financial unit,' which is akin to its treasury, he said. Faysal Abdul-Sater, a Lebanese political analyst who closely follows Hezbollah’s affairs, said the militant group is not funded through al-Qard al-Hasan. He said the money deposited at the institution belongs to individuals and companies, and the system benefits people with low incomes. 'This is a symbolic strike,' Abdul-Sater said about targeting al-Qard al-Hasan. How harmful are the Israeli strikes? The systematic destruction of al-Qard al-Hasan branches, coming after assassinations that took out almost all of Hezbollah’s top leadership and displaced hundreds of thousands of the group’s supporters, is bound to add to the chaos and fears within Hezbollah’s base of support. But experts say it is unlikely to harm Hezbollah's finances in and of itself. Al-Qard al-Hasan tried to reassure customers, saying in a statement late Sunday that it had evacuated all its branches and relocated gold and other deposits to safe areas. Lebanese economist Louis Hobeika said destroying al-Qard al-Hasan branches will have no effect on Hezbollah’s funding as its money comes from Iran and wealthy supporters around the world. The group's salaries are known to be paid in cash in dollars. 'As long as Iran and Hezbollah’s allies are funding the group it will not be affected,' Hobeika said, adding that the flow of 'bags of cash' from abroad will continue just like in the past. Lina Khatib, an associate fellow at Chatham House who focuses on the Middle East, said al-Qard al-Hasan customers still have faith that 'Hezbollah will be able to compensate them for their losses.' Khatib noted that al-Qard al-Hasan's operations, like those of any financial institution, are not limited to any physical assets the strikes targeted. A Lebanese woman who gave only her first name, Zahraa, for safety reasons, said she was in need of cash and deposited a gold necklace and several rings earlier this year in return for an $800 loan. The woman said she has been repaying it in $50 monthly installments. 'I don’t care whether I get the gold or not at a time when men are sacrificing their souls in south Lebanon,' Zahraa said referring to Hezbollah gunmen who are fighting invading Israeli forces. Who was the Hezbollah financier killed? Israel began going after Hezbollah's finances earlier this month, when an Israeli airstrike destroyed the top two floors of a south Beirut building, killing Mohammed Jaafar Qassir, who the U.S. Treasury and Israel accused of transferring hundreds of millions of dollars from Iran to Hezbollah over the years. The U.S. had offered $10 million for information leading to the disruption of the financial mechanisms of Hezbollah. The U.S. Treasury said Qassir provided funding for Hezbollah operations through a number of 'illegal smuggling and procurement activities and other criminal enterprises.' It added that Qassir was also a critical conduit for financial disbursements from the powerful Quds Force branch of Iran’s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard that are used to fund Hezbollah’s activities. The Israeli military said Qassir was in charge of Hezbollah’s Unit 4400, which ships weapons from Iran to Lebanon, and supervised Hezbollah’s development of precision-guided missiles. Hezbollah did not comment on Qassir’s killing. Days after Qassir was killed in Beirut, an airstrike in Damascus, Syria, blamed on Israel killed his brother Hasan, who was married to Nasrallah’s daughter, Zeinab. ____ Associated Press writers Adam Schreck in Jerusalem and Mohammad Zaatari in Sidon, Lebanon, contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/alqard-alhassan-hezbollah-lebanon-israel-airstrikes-67220b894b55500b0be799a0be4245c3	2024-10-21T08:40:11-07:00	
Finnish conductor and composer Segerstam will be honored with a tribute event after his funeral	HELSINKI (AP) — The prolific Finnish conductor and composer Leif Segerstam, who was one of the most colorful personalities in the Nordic country’s classical music scene, will be remembered in a tribute event at the Finnish National Opera following his funeral next month, his family said Monday. His son Jan Segerstam told The Associated Press that the Nov. 8 memorial for his father, who died in Helsinki on Oct. 9 at age 80 from complications following pneumonia, will showcase his musical history. He said it will include musical tributes for the artist who composed his first work at age 6 and was also a violinist. As a composer, Segerstam became known for creating 371 symphonies, which he claimed was a world record. The large number is partly explained by the brevity of many works. Even illness didn’t stop his composing. 'He was creating music at the hospital, together with visiting music friends, still a few days before his death,' his son said. The last symphony created by Segerstam premiered in Helsinki during his 80th birthday in March. In an interview by Finnish news agency STT to mark his birthday, he said conducting an orchestra supported his composer’s work, as it gives 'a deeper knowledge of the soul life of the tunes.' From 1963 on, he conducted a variety of orchestras in Europe, including the Finnish National Opera, the Royal Swedish Opera, the Deutsche Oper Berlin and the Vienna Radio Symphony Orchestra. He also guest-conducted for the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, the Los Angeles Philharmonic and the Toronto Symphony Orchestra. Born in the coastal city of Vaasa in western Finland, Segerstam was brought up in a musical family. He initially trained as a violinist and pianist and studied at the Sibelius Academy in Helsinki and The Juilliard School in New York. From 1997 until 2013, he was a professor of orchestra conducting at the Sibelius Academy, where his students included now-prominent Finnish and international conductors. 'Leif was a very colorful human being,' his son said. 'He was a peculiar person who lived through the feelings of his music. That was his context. For many people coming from a more conventional background, he seemed to be an eccentric.' Segerstam was married and divorced twice and is survived by five children from the two marriages.	https://apnews.com/article/leif-segerstam-finland-obituary-composer-music-4714857dddcf924bfb9f103312c879cc	2024-10-21T08:33:33-07:00	
Russia investigates the claimed shoot-down of a cargo jet in Sudan's Darfur region	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Sudan's paramilitary Rapid Support Forces said Monday they shot down a cargo jet in the country’s far western reaches of Darfur, a claim that Russian diplomats said they were trying to investigate in the war zone. Mobile phone footage showed what appeared to be a debris field with fighters from the paramilitary force, known as the RSF, showing off what appeared to be identity documents recovered from the crash. However, documents also shown in the footage from the crash site suggest the aircraft was affiliated with an airline previously linked to an effort by the United Arab Emirates to arm the RSF in the war, something that has been strenuously denied by the UAE despite evidence. A message from Russia's Embassy in Khartoum confirmed its diplomats were investigating the incident in Sudan's Malha region in northern Darfur near the border with Chad. The embassy's message said Russians may have been on board at the time. The RSF has been at war with the Sudanese army since April 2023.The paramilitary force claimed in a statement it shot down a 'foreign warplane' that had been aiding the Sudanese military. It alleged without providing evidence that the aircraft had been dropping 'barrel bombs' on civilians. 'All foreign mercenaries aboard the aircraft were eliminated in the operation,' the statement said. Mobile phone footage showed fighters among the burning wreckage, claiming they shot down the aircraft with a surface-to-air missile. Identity documents shown included a Russian passport and an ID that linked back to a UAE-based company, whose phone number was disconnected. A crumpled safety card, also purportedly from the aircraft, identified the plane as an Ilyushin Il-76 flown by New Way Cargo of Kyrgyzstan. Civil aviation officials in Kyrgyzstan did not respond to a request for comment late Monday. The group Conflict Observatory, which is funded by the U.S. State Department and has been monitoring the Sudan war, linked New Way Cargo's Ilyushin Il-76s to arming the RSF in a report this month. It said the airline had facilitated the UAE arms transfers through flights to Aéroport International Maréchal Idriss Deby in Amdjarass, Chad — flights the UAE has claimed have been for supporting a local hospital. Amdjarass is just across the border from Malha, where the shoot-down reportedly happened. 'The UAE has used the airport as a waypoint to facilitate weapons to the RSF,' the report said, noting that the Emirates offered a $1.5 billion loan to rapidly expand the airport. 'Absent evidence of a significant local humanitarian crisis and a lack of significant Sudanese refugees in the area casts significant doubt on the UAE’s claims that the airport construction is only for a hospital.' United Nations experts have said accusations that the UAE armed the RSF were 'credible.' Emirati officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment over the reported plane shoot-down. Sudan's war has killed over 24,000 people so far, according to the group Armed Conflict Location and Event Data, which has been monitoring the violence since the conflict's start. The Sudanese army has been pursuing an intensified offensive near Khartoum, while forces allied with it have been battling the RSF in Darfur. Sudan has been unstable since a popular uprising forced the removal of longtime dictator Omar al-Bashir in 2019. The short-lived transition to democracy was derailed when two generals, the army's chief Gen. Abdel-Fattah Burhan and Gen. Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo of the RSF, joined forces to lead a military coup in October 2021. They began battling each other in 2023. Al-Bashir faces charges at the International Criminal Court over carrying out a genocidal campaign in the early 2000s in Darfur with the Janjaweed, the precursor to the RSF. Rights groups and the U.N. say the RSF and allied Arab militias again are attacking ethnic African groups in the war. ___ Associated Press writer Samy Magdy in Cairo contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/sudan-cargo-jet-shot-down-russia-rsf-war-2ddf073f44918eacd3d09357f0d39529	2024-10-21T08:25:32-07:00	
Biden is 'deeply concerned' about the release of secret documents on Israel's possible attack plans	WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden is 'deeply concerned' about the unauthorized release of classified documents on Israel's preparation for a potential retaliatory attack on Iran, a White House spokesman said Monday. The Biden administration is still not certain if the classified information was leaked or hacked, White House national security spokesman John Kirby said. Officials don’t have any indication at this point of 'additional documents like this finding their way into the public domain,' he said. Kirby added that the Pentagon is investigating. U.S. officials on Saturday had confirmed an investigation by the administration. 'We’re deeply concerned, and the president remains deeply concerned about any leakage of classified information into the public domain. That is not supposed to happen, and it’s unacceptable when it does,' Kirby said. The documents are attributed to the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency and National Security Agency, and note that Israel was still moving military assets in place to conduct a military strike in response to Iran’s blistering ballistic missile attack on Oct. 1. They were sharable within the 'Five Eyes,' an intelligence alliance comprised of the U.S., Great Britain, Canada, New Zealand and Australia. Marked top secret, the documents first appeared online Friday on the Telegram messaging app and quickly spread among Telegram channels popular with Iranians. Analysts at the SITE Intelligence Group, a consultancy that monitors and analyzes online threats from extremist groups, tracked the release of the documents to a Telegram channel popular with Iran-backed militias. The channel contained posts from an anonymous user with a long history of posting other supposedly top-secret content who said they had access to the documents. The user also wrote that they had sold some of the material and provided it to the Iranian military. The Telegram channel identifies itself as being based in Tehran, Iran’s capital. It previously published memes featuring Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and material in support of Tehran’s self-described 'Axis of Resistance,' which includes Middle East militant groups armed by the Islamic Republic. One of the two documents resembled the style of other material from the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency leaked by Jack Teixeira, an Air National Guardsman who pleaded guilty in March to leaking highly classified military documents about Russia’s war on Ukraine and other national security secrets. The release comes at a pivotal time in the Middle East, as Israel considers its response to Iran's attack. The U.S. has urged Israel to take advantage of its elimination of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar and press for a cease-fire in Gaza and has likewise urgently cautioned Israel not to further expand military operations in the north in Lebanon and risk a wider regional war. However, Israel’s leadership has repeatedly stressed it will not let Iran’s missile attack go unanswered. The investigation into the release of the documents may take some time as authorities look for digital or physical clues that could reveal how the information got out, and what implications it may have for information management and intelligence sharing with U.S. allies, according to Gavin Wilde, a senior fellow in the Technology and International Affairs Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. 'I imagine they'll eventually get to the bottom of it,' said Wilde, who formerly worked on the National Security Council. 'The intelligence community has gotten a lot better at digital chain of custody — who has seen a particular document, how many times it's been shared, and with whom.' White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre on Monday declined to comment on what changes the government has made to better safeguard top secret information in the aftermath of the Discord leak. She added that Biden has 'complete confidence' in the Pentagon, Justice Department and intelligence community following the latest unauthorized disclosure. The nation's spy agencies have worked to bolster cybersecurity since the Discord leak and the conviction of former NSA contractor Reality Winner. Accounting for human behavior, however, can be a harder challenge, according to Shawnee Delaney, a former officer at the Defense Intelligence Agency who is now CEO of the Vaillance Group, a private threat analysis firm. 'Cybersecurity isn’t just a technological issue,' Delaney told The Associated Press. 'It’s a human one, and humans are wholly unpredictable.' Spokespeople for the Pentagon and the NSA said officials were aware of the incident but had no further comment.	https://apnews.com/article/united-states-israel-iran-classified-documents-5cc9b0f30b7119a039d122599bf0c285	2024-10-21T07:39:24-07:00	
Slovakia and former Czech leader settle lawsuit over collaboration with communist secret police	PRAGUE (AP) — Slovakia’s Interior Ministry agreed in a lawsuit settlement Monday that former former Czech populist Prime Minister Andrej Babis did not knowingly collaborate with communist-era secret police in what was then Czechoslovakia The ministry said it acknowledged that any interpretations of documents in the archives of the StB secret police agency that Babis was a secret agent were unjustified Babis welcomed the settlement of a case that dated to 2012. 'I had no doubt that I’d win the dispute,' he said. Babis, who was born in Slovakia, was originally suing the Institute for National Memory, which holds parts of his secret police files following the division of Czechoslovakia into the Czech Republic and Slovakia in 1993. In a decision published on Feb. 1, Slovakia’s Constitutional Court, the highest legal authority in the country, upheld the previous rulings by lower courts dismissing the case. Some of the files were destroyed, but the institute said those that still exist contain evidence that Babis was an agent under the code name 'Bures' from 1982. Babis vehemently denied that. The regional court in the capital, Bratislava, originally rejected the lawsuit in 2018, but the Constitutional Court ordered a retrial, saying the institute could not be sued and the respondent should be the Slovak Interior Ministry. The ministry said its decision was based on two legal analyses of the case. Babis, a billionaire, is currently in opposition after his populist ANO centrist movement lost the 2021 parliamentary election. He was running to become the Czech president in the election for the largely ceremonial post in January last year but lost to Petr Pavel, a retired army general.	https://apnews.com/article/slovakia-babis-secret-police-collaboration-case-df786bf38b9e0d0acd9e20c1aa9c6f0d	2024-10-21T07:33:20-07:00	
London police officer who fatally shot a Black motorist is acquitted of murder	LONDON (AP) — A London police officer who fatally shot a Black motorist two years ago was acquitted Monday of murder in a case that intensified mistrust of Britain's largest police force among many in the city’s Black communities. Metropolitan Police marksman Martyn Blake, 40, was cleared by a London jury in the death of Chris Kaba, who was unarmed but was driving a vehicle that had been involved in a shooting a day earlier. Kaba, 24, was shot in the head after the vehicle was boxed in by two police cars on a narrow residential street in the Streatham Hill neighborhood on Sept. 5, 2022. Blake fired a single round through the windshield of the Audi because he thought fellow officers’ lives were in danger when Kaba began ramming the police cars in an attempt to break free. A prosecutor said Blake misjudged the risk to his colleagues, exaggerated the threat in statements after the shooting and aimed for Kaba's head. Blake denied those assertions. The shooting renewed racism allegations against the Met police, also known as Scotland Yard, as it had been trying to restore confidence following a series of scandals and an independent review that found it mired in sexism, homophobia and institutional racism. The rare decision to prosecute Blake, who had been suspended, created a backlash from some of his specially trained firearms colleagues who refused to carry their weapons in a show of solidarity. The Met was briefly forced to call on neighboring departments and the military for backup. Fatal shootings by police in the U.K. are rare. In the year to March 2023, officers in England and Wales who are authorized to carry a gun fired their weapons at people 10 times and killed three, according to official statistics. Prosecutions of British officers for murder or manslaughter for actions performed on duty are exceptionally rare. Jurors in London's Central Criminal Court deliberated for about three hours before finding Blake not guilty. Blake let out a puff of relief as the verdict was read. Kaba’s family, seated in the courtroom, showed no visible reaction. The family later said they were devastated and would continue to fight for justice. 'The not guilty verdict leaves us with the deep pain of injustice adding to the unbearable sorrow we have felt since Chris was killed,' the family said in a statement issued by the justice advocacy group Inquest. 'Chris was stolen from us, and this decision shows his life — and many others like him — does not matter to the system. Our son deserved better.' Prosecutors said their thoughts were with the Kaba family, but they respected the jury’s decision. 'We recognize that firearms officers operate under enormous pressure, but it is our responsibility to put cases before a jury that meet our test for prosecution, and we are satisfied that test was met in this case,' Frank Ferguson, head of the Crown Prosecution Service Special Crime and Counter Terrorism Division said. Metropolitan Police Commissioner Mark Rowley said Blake paid 'a huge personal and professional sacrifice' for 'a split-second decision on what he believed was necessary to protect his colleagues and to protect London.' Defense lawyer Patrick Gibbs said during his closing argument that Blake was not a 'RoboCop with total vision and nanosecond reactions like a computer.' 'He is not a robot, he is a human being with a human brain who did this to the best of his ability,' Gibbs said. Another firearms officer said he would have taken the shot if Blake had not and another said he was fractions of a second from pulling the trigger.	https://apnews.com/article/london-police-officer-acquitted-shooting-black-man-4d0fb07a538bad09f14fc3b238d23f8a	2024-10-21T06:24:04-07:00	
Police in Mozambique fire tear gas at opposition politician as post-election tensions soar	MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) — Police in Mozambique fired tear gas at the country's leading opposition politician and supporters as he spoke with reporters Monday, forcing them to run for cover as the nation remains on edge following a disputed election and the slaying of two prominent opposition figures. Venancio Mondlane, the main challenger to the decades-long governing party in the Oct. 9 presidential election, was giving interviews on a road in the capital, Maputo, near the spot where his lawyer and a senior opposition party official were killed in their car by unidentified gunmen Friday night. Police officers fired tear gas in Mondlane's direction, according to a video posted on his Facebook page. The video shows Mondlane, aides, supporters and journalists running as tear gas canisters land around them. One journalist was injured, according to local media. Mondlane previously called for a nationwide shutdown and urged people to stay away from work on Monday in protest at what he and other parties have called fraudulent elections. He and some supporters had planned to gather near the site of the killings to protest. Police fired tear gas at protesters earlier in the day. The election is likely to see the ruling Front for the Liberation of Mozambique party, or Frelimo, extend its 49-year rule since the southern African country gained independence from Portugal in 1975. The final results are expected later this week, but official preliminary results show Frelimo candidate Daniel Chapo with a comfortable lead on Mondlane, who ran as an independent but was supported by the new Podesa opposition party. If he wins, Chapo would succeed President Filipe Nyusi, who has served the allowed two terms. The killings of the opposition figures heightened tensions following the election. Podesa said Mondlane’s lawyer and the party’s top spokesperson were chased down by gunmen in two vehicles who sprayed their car with bullets. The attack is widely viewed in Mozambique as politically motivated. Mondlane's lawyer, Elvino Dias, was closely involved in preparations to challenge the election results at the supreme electoral body. The European Union, which sent a team of election observers, called for an immediate investigation into the killings 'that will bring to justice those responsible for this outrageous crime.' The killings were also condemned by United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres. Frelimo has often been accused of rigging elections, which it has denied, while Mozambique's security forces have been criticized for clamping down on dissent and breaking up peaceful protests with deadly force. Mondlane told reporters that police had tried to keep him at his house and prevent him from joining the protests on Monday. 'The whole of last night, police cars were at my doorstep,' he said. 'I was trying to find other ways to leave the house without being noticed. I did. I won’t say how.' ___ AP Africa news: https://apnews.com/hub/africa	https://apnews.com/article/mozambique-election-protests-police-opposition-95f53c6b33b6685dc196e87d3baca5d8	2024-10-21T04:49:17-07:00	
Police in Haiti battle gang coalition trying to seize control of the entire capital	PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) — Police on Monday clashed with gunmen trying to take over one of the few communities in Haiti’s capital, Port-au-Prince, that is not controlled by gangs. Solino has been under attack since Thursday, with residents calling radio stations pleading for help as they fled their homes. Officers have seized control of several areas in Solino as they keep pursuing gang members, Haiti’s National Police said in a statement late Sunday. In a video posted on social media, gang members hoisted automatic weapons in the air and cheered as they claimed control over parts of Solino, warning that all those who are not part of a gang coalition known as 'Viv Ansanm' will be 'burned to ashes.' The coalition also has attacked other neighborhoods, including Tabarre 27, forcing hundreds of residents to flee in recent days. Gangs that control 80% of Port-au-Prince also have threatened journalists covering the most recent attacks, calling them out by name and ordering that they be killed. Viv Ansanm, which means 'Living Together,' formed in September 2023, creating a coalition between two large gang federations that were enemies. It was responsible for launching large-scale attacks on critical government infrastructure starting in February, eventually leading to the resignation of Prime Minister Ariel Henry. The coalition also has unified to fight a U.N.-backed mission led by Kenyan police to quell gang violence in Haiti that began earlier this year. After the coalition was formed, armed clashes between gangs fell by 78% from March to August, compared with the previous six months, according to a report published this month by ACLED, a U.S. nonprofit that collects data on violent conflicts worldwide. 'The consolidation of the Viv Ansanm alliance has enabled gangs to focus their resources on criminal activities and confrontations with security forces, rather than engaging in infighting,' it said. The report also warned that 'despite the volatile relationships among gang members, Viv Ansanm is likely to endure as long as it faces the shared threat of an international security force.'	https://apnews.com/article/haiti-gangs-violence-solino-un-mission-c6bea0069973d723d51d23cbd9110e49	2024-10-21T03:29:06-07:00	
The Latest: Trump heads to North Carolina while Harris stumps in the Midwest	With just over two weeks to go before the 2024 presidential election and the race in a dead heat, Donald Trump and Kamala Harris are hitting the campaign trail in strategic battleground states. Follow the AP’s Election 2024 coverage at: https://apnews.com/hub/election-2024. Here’s the latest: How does abortion translate? Ballot measures are a challenge for interpreters Reproductive rights measures are on the ballots in 10 states after heated debates over how to describe their impact on abortion — and that’s just in English. In 388 places across the U.S. where English isn’t the primary language among communities of voters, the federal Voting Rights Act requires that all elections information be made available in each community’s native language. Such translations are meant to help non-native English speakers understand what they’re voting for. But vague or technical terms can be challenging, even more so when it comes to Indigenous languages that have only limited written dictionaries. For example, there’s no single word for abortion in the native language of the Ute Mountain Ute tribe in Colorado’s Montezuma County. New York’s referendum doesn’t even use the word 'abortion,' making it all the more challenging to convey intent, advocates complain. And how exactly should the science of 'viability' in the Florida and Nevada measures be explained in the oral traditions of the Seminole and Shoshone tribes? The Navajo and Hopi tribes get more material translated than most, and they have more than enough voters to sway outcomes. ▶ Read more about translating ballot measures into other languages. Most voters think the economy is poor, but split on whether Trump or Harris can fix it: AP-NORC poll Voters remain largely divided over whether they prefer Republican Donald Trump or Democrat Kamala Harris to handle key economic issues, although Harris earns slightly better marks on elements such as taxes for the middle class, according to a new poll. A majority of registered voters in the survey by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research describe the economy as poor. About 7 in 10 say the nation is going in the wrong direction. But the findings reaffirm that Trump has lost what had been an advantage on the economy, which many voters say is the most important issue this election season above abortion, immigration, crime and foreign affairs. 'Do I trust Trump on the economy? No. I trust that he’ll give tax cuts to his buddies like Elon Musk,' said poll respondent Janice Tosto, a 59-year-old Philadelphia woman and self-described independent. An AP-NORC poll conducted in September found neither Harris nor Trump had a clear advantage on handling 'the economy and jobs.' But this poll asked more specific questions about whether voters trusted Trump or Harris to do a better job handling the cost of housing, jobs and unemployment, taxes on the middle class, the cost of groceries and gas, and tariffs. ▶ Read more about the poll. Trump takes questions at a barbershop in the Bronx Donald Trump went to a barbershop in the Bronx section of New York for a segment with commentator Lawrence Jones that aired Monday on 'Fox &amp; Friends.' He took questions from clients at the business about immigration, energy and taxes. The barbers wore a black shirt with the phrase 'Make Barbers Great Again.' One of the clients asked Trump if, once he generated enough revenue with some of his proposals, it would be possible to eliminate federal taxes. 'There is a way. There is a way,' Trump said, adding that in the 1890s, people did not have to pay income taxes. The business owner, who leases the building, told him his main challenge was paying for his energy bill, which had shot up from $2,100 to $15,000 in the last seven months. 'What?' Trump said. 'How many heads can you take care of? That’s a lot.' Trump asked how much average hair cuts cost and how much they had gone up. He was told they had gone up from a range between $12 and $15 to between $30 and $40. Toward the end of the visit, Trump told the men 'you guys are the same as me. It’s the same stuff. We were born the same way.' Some Jewish voters in presidential swing states reconsider their longtime devotion to Democrats For Rona Kaufman, the signs are everywhere that more Jews feel abandoned by the Democratic Party and may vote for Republican Donald Trump. It’s in her Facebook feed. It’s in the discomfort she observed during a question-and-answer at a recent Democratic Party campaign event in Pittsburgh. It’s in her own family. 'The family that is my generation and older generations, I don’t think anybody is voting for Harris, and we’ve never voted Republican, ever,' Kaufman, 49, said, referring to Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris. 'My sister has a Trump sign outside her house, and that is a huge shift.' How big a shift? Surveys continue to find that most Jewish voters still support the Democratic ticket, and Kaufman acknowledges that she’s an exception. Still, any shift could have enormous implications in Pennsylvania, where tens of thousands of votes decided the past two presidential elections. Many Jewish voters say the 2024 presidential election is like no other in memory, coming amid the growing fallout from Hamas’ brutal attack on Israelis last year. ▶ Read more about Jewish voters in this election.	https://apnews.com/article/kamala-harris-donald-trump-2024-6d5141e5ce6be797fc4d65ae9be34a65	2024-10-21T03:22:08-07:00	
Today in History: November 2, Truman defeats Dewey	Today is Saturday, Nov. 2, the 307th day of 2024. There are 59 days left in the year. Today in history: On Nov. 2, 1948, in one of the most unexpected results in U.S. election history, Democratic incumbent Harry S. Truman won the presidential election against the heavily favored Republican governor of New York, Thomas E. Dewey. Also on this date: In 1783, Gen. George Washington issued his Farewell Address to the Army. In 1861, during the Civil War, President Abraham Lincoln relieved Maj. Gen. John C. Fremont of his command of the Army’s Western Department, following Fremont’s unauthorized efforts to emancipate slaves in Missouri. In 1947, Howard Hughes piloted his Hughes H-4 Hercules, nicknamed the ‘Spruce Goose,’ on its one and only flight; a massive wooden seaplane with a wingspan longer than a football field, it remained airborne for 26 seconds.

Blinken heads to Mideast for 11th time since Gaza war; prospects for a truce remain uncertain	WASHINGTON (AP) — Secretary of State Antony Blinken is heading again to the Middle East, making his 11th trip to the region since the Gaza war erupted last year and as Israel steps up attacks against Hezbollah in Lebanon. The State Department said Blinken will depart on Monday for a weeklong trip to Israel and a number of Arab countries, on a visit that also comes as Israel weighs retaliation against Iran for ballistic missile attacks earlier this month. The trip had been expected after President Joe Biden said last week he would dispatch Blinken to the region following Israel’s killing of Hamas military chief Yahya Sinwar, a move that some believe could open a window for new talks on a cease-fire proposal that has been languishing for months. 'Throughout the region, Secretary Blinken will discuss the importance of bringing the war in Gaza to an end, securing the release of all hostages, and alleviating the suffering of the Palestinian people. He will continue discussions on post-conflict period planning and emphasize the need to chart a new path forward that enables Palestinians to rebuild their lives and realize their aspirations free from Hamas’ tyranny,' State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said in a statement. He said Blinken would also underscore the need for a dramatic increase in the amount of humanitarian aid reaching Gaza, something that Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin made clear in a letter to Israeli officials last week. That letter reminded Israel that the Biden administration could be forced by U.S. law to curtail some forms of military aid should the delivery of humanitarian assistance continue to be hindered. In addition to the conflict in Gaza, Blinken will also raise the importance the administration places on reaching a diplomatic resolution to the escalating conflict between Israel and Hezbollah in southern Lebanon and elsewhere. 'He will reaffirm the U.S. commitment to work with partners across the region to de-escalate tensions and provide lasting stability,' Miller said in the statement. Since the Hamas attacks in Israel on Oct. 7, 2023 and the Israeli response, Blinken has traveled to the Middle East 10 times seeking an end to the crisis. His previous trips have yielded little in the way of ending hostilities but he has managed to increase aid deliveries to Gaza in the past.	https://apnews.com/article/us-israel-gaza-lebanon-hamas-ba3c1e1eb131916818e62c81ead22f36	2024-10-21T01:29:54-07:00	
Lebanon assesses damage after Israel strikes Hezbollah-run financial institution	BEIRUT (AP) — Lebanese were surveying the damage on Monday after overnight Israeli strikes hit nearly a dozen branches of a Hezbollah-run financial institution that Israel says is used to fund attacks but where many ordinary people keep their savings. The strikes targeted Al-Qard Al-Hassan branches in the southern neighborhoods of Beirut, across southern Lebanon and in the eastern Bekaa Valley, where Hezbollah has a strong presence. One strike flattened a nine-story building in Beirut with a branch inside it. Smoke rose from several locations on Monday. The Israeli military issued evacuation warnings ahead of the strikes. There were no reports of casualties. Israel invaded Lebanon earlier this month, saying it aims to push Hezbollah from the border after more than a year of rocket, missile and drone attacks that began after Palestinian Hamas militants launched their surprise Oct. 7, 2023, attack into Israel from the Gaza Strip. Israeli airstrikes have pounded large areas of Lebanon for weeks, forcing over a million people to flee their homes. The United States is hoping to revive diplomatic efforts to resolve both conflicts after the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar in the Gaza Strip last week, but so far all sides appear to be digging in. Hezbollah-run lender filled gaps left by Lebanon's troubled banks The Arabic language spokesman for the Israeli military, Avichay Adraee, said warplanes targeted several locations 'used to store money for the military arm of Hezbollah,' including Al-Qard Al-Hassan, which he said finances arms purchases and is used to pay fighters. He said Hezbollah stores hundreds of millions of dollars in the branches, without providing evidence, and that the strikes were aimed at preventing the group from rearming. The institution has more than 30 branches across Lebanon. It tried to reassure customers, saying it had evacuated all branches and relocated gold and other deposits to safe areas. Many customers are civilians unaffiliated with Hezbollah. The registered nonprofit, sanctioned by the United States and Saudi Arabia, has long served as an alternative to Lebanon's banks, which have imposed restrictions in the face of a severe financial crisis that began in 2019. Bulldozers cleared mounds of rubble at the site of one strike. Clothes, furniture and the remains of a beauty salon were seen in the debris. Al-Qard al-Hassan documents were scattered across the area, but there was no sign of cash or other valuables. US envoy says UN resolution that ended past war is ‘no longer enough’ U.S. envoy Amos Hochstein, who has spent much of the past year trying to broker a cease-fire between Israel and Hezbollah, was back in Lebanon on Monday for talks with senior officials. He said U.N. Security Council Resolution 1701, which ended the 2006 war between Israel and Hezbollah, was 'no longer enough' to ensure peace and a new mechanism was needed to enforce it. The resolution called for Hezbollah to withdraw from the border with Israel and for U.N. peacekeepers and the Lebanese army to control southern Lebanon, without any Hezbollah or Israeli presence. Israel says the resolution was never implemented and that Hezbollah built up extensive military infrastructure right up to the border. Lebanon has long accused Israel of violating its airspace and failing to abide by other provisions of the resolution. '1701 was successful at ending the war in 2006, but we must be honest that nobody did anything to implement it,' Hochstein said after meeting with Lebanese Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri, a political ally of Hezbollah who is involved in cease-fire talks. In a separate development, the Israeli military apologized for a strike on Sunday in southern Lebanon that killed three Lebanese army soldiers. It said it targeted a vehicle in an area that Hezbollah had recently used for attacks without realizing it belonged to the Lebanese military. Lebanon’s army is a respected institution within the country, but it is not powerful enough to impose its will on Hezbollah or defend Lebanon from Israel’s invasion. The army has largely kept to the sidelines as Israel and Hezbollah have traded blows over the past year. US tries to revive Gaza cease-fire talks after Sinwar’s death The United States has expressed hope that the killing of Hamas leader Sinwar could give new impetus for a cease-fire in Gaza, which would give a major boost to parallel efforts to halt the fighting in Lebanon. The head of Israel’s Shin Bet security agency, Ronen Bar, visited Egypt for the second time in less than a week and had an hours-long meeting with Egyptian officials on Sunday, according to an Egyptian official who was not authorized to brief media and spoke on condition of anonymity. The official said Egypt, a key mediator between Israel and Hamas, remains opposed to any Israeli presence along the Gaza-Egypt border, a key sticking point in talks that sputtered to a halt in August. Hamas has said its demands remain unchanged after the killing of Sinwar. The militant group has said it will only release dozens of Israeli hostages in return for an Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, a lasting cease-fire and the release of a large number of Palestinian prisoners. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to destroy Hamas and recover all the captives, and says Israel must maintain an open-ended security presence in Gaza to keep Hamas from re-arming. Israel has been waging a major operation in northern Gaza, the hardest-hit part of the territory, for more than two weeks, and its forces have repeatedly returned to other areas of Gaza after saying Hamas had regrouped. Palestinian medical officials said on Monday they collected over a dozen bodies of people killed in Israel’s ongoing air and ground operation in northern Gaza. They included six men killed early Monday when they were trying to get drinking water in the urban Jabaliya refugee camp, the main focus of the operation, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. Four others, including two women, were killed in a strike on an area sheltering displaced people in Jabaliya, the ministry said. Another three people were killed in a strike on a school-turned-shelter in the border town of Beit Hanoun. On Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas-led militants blew holes in Israel’s security fence and stormed in, killing around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting another 250. Around 100 captives are still being held in Gaza, a third of whom are believed to be dead. Israel’s offensive in Gaza has killed more than 42,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities, who don’t distinguish combatants from civilians but say most of the dead were women and children. The war has destroyed large areas of Gaza and displaced about 90% of its population of 2.3 million people. ___ Magdy reported from Cairo.

Becky Sauerbrunn and over 100 women's soccer players protest FIFA deal with Saudi oil giant Aramco	ZURICH (AP) — Former U.S. national team captain Becky Sauerbrunn and Netherlands forward Vivianne Miedema are among more than 100 women's soccer players who have signed an open letter protesting FIFA's sponsorship deal with Saudi Arabian state oil giant Aramco. The letter calls the deal, which includes sponsorship at the 2027 Women's World Cup in Brazil, 'much worse than an own goal,' citing Saudi Arabia's record on the rights of women and LGBTQ+ people and the impact of Aramco's oil and gas production on climate change. Sauerbrunn voiced concern for women who are imprisoned in Saudi Arabia. 'The safety of those women, the rights of women, LGBTQ+ rights and the health of the planet need to take a much bigger priority over FIFA making more money,' Sauerbrunn said in comments via campaign group Athletes Of The World. The letter calls on FIFA to replace Aramco 'with alternative sponsors whose values align with gender equality, human rights and the safe future of our planet,' and to give players a voice on the ethical implications of future sponsorship deals. 'This letter shows that as players this is what we don’t want to stand for and accept within women’s football. It’s simple: this sponsorship is contradicting FIFA’s own commitments to human rights and the planet,' Miedema said. FIFA's deal with Aramco was announced in April as part of ever-closer ties between Saudi Arabia and world soccer's governing body. FIFA is expected to confirm Saudi Arabia as host of the 2034 men's World Cup in December. It is the only candidate for the tournament. 'FIFA values its partnership with Aramco and its many others commercial and rights partners. FIFA is an inclusive organisation with many commercial partners also supporting other organizations in football and other sports,' world soccer's governing body said in an emailed statement Monday, adding that commercial revenue is reinvested into developing women's soccer. ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer	https://apnews.com/article/fifa-saudi-arabia-aramco-becky-sauerbrunn-cb41913acfa00adba988cf73e0fc70b7	2024-10-21T00:30:53-07:00	
A Japanese police chief apologizes to a man acquitted after 50 years on death row	TOKYO (AP) — A Japanese police chief on Monday apologized in person to Iwao Hakamada for his decades-long suffering that started from an overbearing investigation and wrongful conviction that had kept him on death row until last month, when he was acquitted in a retrial. The 88-year-old Hakamada, a former boxer, was acquitted by the Shizuoka District Court, which said police and prosecutors had collaborated to fabricate and plant evidence against him, and forced him to confess with violent, hourslong closed interrogations. The acquittal was finalized earlier this month when the prosecution waived its right to appeal — though it complained about the ruling — finally ending Hakamada’s nearly 60-year legal battle to prove his innocence. Shizuoka Prefectural Police chief Takayoshi Tsuda on Monday visited Hakamada at his home and offered an apology in person. As he entered the room where Hakamada, his sister Hideko Hakamada and their supporter waited, Hakamada silently rose from his sofa to greet him. 'We are sorry to have caused you unspeakable mental distress and burden for as long as 58 years from the time of the arrest until the acquittal was finalized,' Tsuda said, as he stood straight in front of Hakamada and bowed deeply. 'We are terribly sorry.' Tsuda promised a 'meticulous and appropriate investigation.' Hakamada, who has difficulty carrying out conversation due to his mental condition from the decades of death row confinement, responded: 'What it means to have the authority ... Once you have the power, you’re not supposed to grumble.' Hakamada’s 91-year-old sister, who had stood by her brother through the long process to clear his name and now lives with him, thanked the police chief for visiting them. 'There is no use complaining to him after all these years. He was not involved in the case and he only came here as his duty,' she told reporters afterward. 'But I still accepted his visit just because I wanted (my brother) to have a clear break from his past as a death row inmate.' He was arrested in August, 1966, in the killing of an executive at a miso bean paste company and three of his family members in Hamamatsu, central Japan. He was initially sentenced to death in a 1968 district court ruling but was not executed because of the lengthy appeal and retrial process in Japan. It took nearly three decades for the Supreme Court to deny his first appeal for a retrial. His second appeal for a retrial, filed by his sister in 2008, was granted in 2014. The court ordered his release from his death row solitary cell but without removing his conviction, pending the retrial process. Hakamada was the world’s longest-serving death row prisoner and only the fifth death row inmate to be acquitted in a retrial in postwar Japan, where criminal trials take years and retrials are extremely rare. His case and acquittal have triggered calls for more transparency in the investigation, legal change to lower hurdles for a retrial and debate over death penalty in Japan.	https://apnews.com/article/japan-death-row-police-apology-hakamada-7226946cfbf17524a12a95370fa55733	2024-10-21T00:19:15-07:00	
Self-exiled Turkish spiritual leader Fethullah Gülen dies in the US	SAYLORSBURG, Pa. (AP) — Fethullah Gülen, a reclusive U.S.-based Islamic cleric who inspired a global social movement while facing accusations he masterminded a failed 2016 coup in his native Turkey, has died. Abdullah Bozkurt, the former editor of the Gülen-linked Today’s Zaman newspaper, who is now in exile in Sweden, said Monday he spoke to Gülen's nephew, Kemal Gülen, who confirmed the death. Fethullah Gülen was in his eighties and had long been in ill health. The Alliance for Shared Values, a New York-based group that promotes Gulen’s work in the U.S., confirmed his death on X and its website 'with sorrowful hearts and humble acceptance of Allah’s will.' It did not provide details. Gülen spent the last decades of his life in self-exile, living in a gated compound in Pennsylvania’s Pocono Mountains and wielding influence among his millions of followers. He espoused a philosophy that blended Sufism — a mystical form of Islam — with staunch advocacy of democracy, education, science and interfaith dialogue. It is not known who, if anyone, will lead the movement now. Gülen began as an ally of Turkish leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan but became a foe. He called Erdogan an authoritarian bent on accumulating power and crushing dissent. Erdogan cast Gülen as a terrorist, accusing him of orchestrating the attempted military coup on July 15, 2016, when factions within the military used tanks, warplanes and helicopters to try to overthrow Erdogan’s government. Heeding a call from the president, thousands took to the streets to oppose the takeover attempt. The coup-plotters fired at crowds and bombed parliament and other government buildings. A total of 251 people were killed and around 2,200 others were wounded. Around 35 alleged coup plotters were killed. Gülen adamantly denied involvement, and his supporters dismissed the charges as ridiculous and politically motivated. Turkey put Gülen on its most-wanted list and demanded his extradition, but the United States showed little inclination to send him back, saying it needed more evidence. Gülen was never charged with a crime in the U.S., and he consistently denounced terrorism as well as the coup plotters. Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said Monday that Gülen’s death 'will not make us complacent or relaxed. This organization has been a threat rarely seen in the history of our nation.' He called on Gülen’s followers to turn away from 'this treasonous wrong path.' In Turkey, Gülen’s movement — sometimes known as Hizmet, Turkish for 'service' — has been subjected to a broad crackdown. The government arrested tens of thousands of people for their alleged link to the coup plot, sacked more than 130,000 suspected supporters from civil service jobs and more than 23,000 from the military, and closed hundreds of businesses, schools and media organizations tied to Gülen. Gülen called the crackdown a witch hunt and denounced Turkey’s leaders as 'tyrants.' 'The last year has taken a toll on me as hundreds of thousands of innocent Turkish citizens are being punished simply because the government decides they are somehow ‘connected’ to me or the Hizmet movement and treats that alleged connection as a crime,' he said on the one-year anniversary of the failed coup. Ozgur Ozel, the leader of Turkey's main opposition Republican People's Party, said Gülen’s vast network remained a threat to Turkey. 'The founder is dead but the organization remains. No one should think that this danger has passed or is over. Everyone should be on guard against this organization,' Ozel said. Fethullah Gülen was born in Erzurum, in eastern Turkey. His official birth date was April 27, 1941, but that has long been in dispute. Y. Alp Aslandogan, who leads a New York-based group that promotes Gülen’s ideas and work, said Gülen was actually born sometime in 1938. Trained as an imam, or prayer leader, Gülen gained notice in Turkey some 50 years ago. He preached tolerance and dialogue between faiths, and he believed religion and science could go hand in hand. His belief in merging Islam with Western values and Turkish nationalism struck a chord with Turks, earning him millions of followers. Gülen’s acolytes built a loosely affiliated global network of charitable foundations, professional associations, businesses and schools in more than 100 countries, including 150 taxpayer-funded charter schools throughout the United States. In Turkey, supporters ran universities, hospitals, charities, a bank and a large media empire with newspapers and radio and TV stations. But Gülen was viewed with suspicion by some in his homeland, a deeply polarized country split between those loyal to its fiercely secular traditions and supporters of the Islamic-based party associated with Erdogan that came to power in 2002. Gülen had long refrained from openly supporting any political party, but his movement forged a de facto alliance with Erdogan against the country’s old guard of staunch, military-backed secularists, and Gülen’s media empire threw its weight behind Erdogan’s Islamic-oriented government. Gülenists helped the governing party win multiple elections. But the Erdogan-Gulen alliance began to crumble after the movement criticized government policy and exposed alleged corruption among Erdogan’s inner circle. Erdogan, who denied the allegations, grew weary of the growing influence of Gülen’s movement. The Turkish leader accused Gülen’s followers of infiltrating the country’s police and judiciary and setting up a parallel state, and began agitating for Gülen’s extradition to Turkey even before the failed 2016 coup. The cleric had lived in the United States since 1999, when he came to seek medical treatment. In 2000, with Gülen still in the U.S, Turkish authorities charged him with leading an Islamist plot to overthrow the country’s secular form of government and establish a religious state. Some of the accusations against him were based on a tape recording on which Gülen was alleged to have told supporters of an Islamic state to bide their time: 'If they come out too early, the world will quash their heads.' Gülen said his comments were taken out of context. The cleric was tried in absentia and acquitted, but he never returned to his homeland. He won a lengthy legal battle against the administration of then-President George W. Bush to obtain permanent residency in the U.S. Rarely seen in public, Gülen lived quietly on the grounds of an Islamic retreat center. He left mostly only to see doctors for ailments that included heart disease and diabetes, spending much of his time in prayer and meditation and receiving visitors from around the world. Gülen never married and did not have children. ___ Associated Press Writer Suzan Fraser contributed from Ankara, Turkey.	https://apnews.com/article/fethullah-gulen-turkey-dead-d808184b89acffcd1c9b24ba87d3d5f5	2024-10-21T00:11:37-07:00	
South Korea calls for immediate withdrawal of North Korean troops allegedly in Russia	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea on Monday demanded the immediate pullout of North Korean troops allegedly deployed in Russia as it summoned the Russian ambassador to protest deepening military cooperation between Pyongyang and Moscow. South Korea's spy agency said Friday it had confirmed that North Korea sent 1,500 special operation forces to Russia this month to support Moscow's war against Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy earlier said his government had intelligence that 10,000 North Korea soldiers were being prepared to join invading Russian forces. During a meeting with Russian Ambassador Georgy Zinoviev, Vice South Korean Foreign Minister Kim Hong Kyun 'condemned in the strongest terms' North Korea's troop dispatch that he said poses 'a grave security threat' to South Korea and the international community, the South Korean Foreign Ministry said in a statement. Kim said that South Korea in collaboration with the international community will mobilize all available means to deal with an act that threatens its vital national security interests, according to the statement. The Russian Embassy quoted Zinoviev as saying that the Russian-North Korean cooperation is not aimed against the security interests of South Korea. In a telephone call with NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte on Monday, South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol said that Seoul won’t sit idly by 'reckless' military cooperation between Pyongyang and Moscow. Yoon said South Korea will soon send a delegation to NATO to exchange information about Russian-North Korean cooperation, according to Yoon’s office. Rutte wrote on X that North Korea possibly fighting alongside Russia would 'mark a significant escalation.' The U.S. and NATO haven't confirmed that North Korean troops were sent to Russia. But the reports of their presence have already stoked concerns in South Korea that Russia might provide North Korea with sophisticated technologies that can sharply enhance the North's nuclear and missile programs in return for its troop dispatch. North Korea's advancing nuclear arsenal is a major security threat to South Korea. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un recently took steps to permanently terminate all relations with South Korea and threatened to use nuclear weapons preemptively. Some observers say South Korea will likely consider supplying weapons to Ukraine if Russian transfers of high-tech nuclear and missile technologies to North Korea are verified. South Korea has joined U.S.-led sanctions against Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. But South Korea hasn’t directly provided arms to Kyiv, citing its longstanding policy of not supplying weapons to countries actively engaged in conflicts. Russia has earlier denied using North Korean troops in its war with Ukraine. North Korea's state media hasn't commented on the matter. Ukrainian officials released a video allegedly showing North Korean soldiers lining up to collect Russian military clothes and bags at an unknown location. The Associated Press couldn’t verify the footage independently. Asked about the North Korean troops during a conference call with reporters Monday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that 'we are seeing a lot of contradictory information.' 'South Koreans say one thing, then the Pentagon says it has no confirmation of such statements. There is a lot of contradictory information,' Peskov said. 'It must be treated as such.' North Korea's troop deployment to Russia would be its first participation in a major war since the end of the 1950-53 Korean War. Many experts question how much North Korean troops would help Russia on the battlefield, citing their lack of combat experience. Cooperation between North Korea and Russia has flourished over the past two years. The U.S., South Korea and their partners have accused North Korea of supplying conventional arms to Russia in return for economic and military assistance. In June, Kim and Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a pact stipulating mutual military assistance if either country is attacked. __ Associated Press writer Kim Tong-hyung contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/north-south-korea-russia-ukraine-27780e4b672ee638b96099ec5f5168e4	2024-10-20T23:32:47-07:00	
Middle East latest: Israel apologizes for strike that killed 3 Lebanese soldiers	The Israeli military apologized Monday for a strike that killed three Lebanese soldiers in southern Lebanon, saying it is not battling the country's military and its troops believed they were targeting a vehicle belonging to the Hezbollah militant group. Israeli strikes meanwhile hit nearly a dozen branches of a Hezbollah-run financial institution that Israel says is used to fund attacks but where many ordinary people keep their savings. Last week, Hezbollah said it is entering a new phase in its fight against invading Israeli troops, as the region reckoned with the killing of top Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar in a battle with Israeli forces in Gaza. Sinwar was a chief architect of the attack on southern Israel that precipitated the latest escalating conflicts in the Middle East. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has pledged to annihilate Hamas and recover dozens of hostages held by the group. Hamas says it will only release the captives in return for a lasting cease-fire, a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and the release of Palestinian prisoners. On Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas-led militants blew holes in Israel’s security fence and stormed in, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting another 250. Israel’s offensive in Gaza has killed over 42,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities, who do not distinguish combatants from civilians. The war has destroyed large areas of Gaza and displaced about 90% of its population of 2.3 million people. ___ Here's the latest: Over a dozen bodies collected in northern Gaza, medical workers say CAIRO — Palestinian medical officials say they have collected over a dozen bodies of people killed in Israel’s ongoing air and ground operation in northern Gaza. The Gaza Health Ministry’s emergency service said they included six men killed early Monday when they were trying to get drinking water in the urban Jabaliya refugee camp, the main focus of the operation. Four others, including two women, were killed in a strike on an area sheltering displaced people in Jabaliya, it said. Another three people were killed in a strike on a school-turned-shelter in the border town of Beit Hanoun. Dr. Hossam Abu Safiyya, the director of the nearby Kamal Adwan Hospital, said it was overwhelmed with wounded people and patients. Israel launched the operation more than two weeks ago, saying Hamas militants had regrouped in Jabaliya after several previous military operations there. The military says it tries to avoid harming civilians. Israeli authorities have dramatically reduced the amount of aid allowed into Gaza, raising fears among Palestinians that they are implementing a surrender-or-starve plan advocated by retired Israeli generals. Israel ordered the entire population of the northern third of Gaza, including Gaza City, to evacuate to the south in the war’s opening weeks and reiterated those instructions this month. Around 400,000 people are believed to have remained in the north, which is encircled by Israeli forces and off limits to Palestinians who fled their homes there. Israeli police arrest 7 citizens allegedly paid by Iran to gather intelligence JERUSALEM — Israeli police have arrested seven citizens who they say were paid by Iran to collect intelligence for over two years. In a statement released Monday, Israel’s internal security agency and police said that the seven collected information about other Israelis and photographed Israeli military installations, including missile defense systems, air force and naval sites, and power plants. Iran paid them paid hundreds of thousands of dollars, often in cryptocurrency, the statement said. It did not provide evidence for the alleged plot. Israeli authorities say they have foiled several recent plots by Iran that involved recruiting Israelis for espionage or assassinations. Israel has vowed to retaliate for Iran’s Oct. 1 ballistic missile attack. Israeli air defenses shot down most of the missiles, but some hit Israeli military installations. Israel and Iran have waged a shadow war for years that burst to the surface after Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack triggered the war in Gaza. Israel and Iran exchanged fire directly for the first time in April. Iran supports armed groups across the region, including Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon. Macron calls for a cease-fire in a phone call with Netanyahu PARIS — French President Emmanuel Macron called once again for a cease-fire in Gaza and Lebanon in a phone call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday, the Elysee Palace said in a statement. Macron said the elimination of Hamas’ top leader Yahya Sinwar last week in Gaza 'must be an opportunity to begin a new phase of negotiation' for a cease-fire, the release of hostages and the entry of humanitarian aid into Gaza. Macron alo called for Israel to preserve infrastructure and protect civilians in Lebanon. Macron shared his intention to keep communication channels open with Teheran, 'to obtain guarantees on Iran’s nuclear program, ballistic program and regional policy,' the statement. Relations between the two leaders became tense recently after Macron called for 'a halt to arms exports for use in Gaza,' drawing strong criticism from Netanyahu. Head of Israel's security agency visited Cairo to discuss cease-fire talks CAIRO — The head of Israel’s internal security agency has visited Cairo to discuss reviving Gaza cease-fire talks after the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, officials said. Israel and Hamas, as well as Egypt, which has served as a key mediator, appear to still be divided over whether Israel would retain control over parts of Gaza, a dispute that dragged the talks to a halt in August. An Egyptian official said Ronen Bar, the head of Israel’s Shin Bet security agency, held an hourslong meeting Sunday with Egypt’s newly appointed intelligence chief, Hassan Mahmoud Rashad. An Israeli official also confirmed the visit, speaking on condition of anonymity because it was not publicized. The visit was widely reported by Israeli media. The Egyptian official, who was not authorized to brief media and spoke on condition of anonymity, said they discussed the possibility of reviving the negotiations after the death of Sinwar, who was killed in an Israeli military operation last week. The official said Egypt is still opposed to any Israeli presence in a strip of land running the length of the Gaza side of the territory’s border with Egypt, and that Hamas is unlikely to lift its demand for a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. Hamas has said its demands for a lasting cease-fire, Israel’s full withdrawal from Gaza and the release of a large number of Palestinian prisoners in return for dozens of hostages held in Gaza for over a year have not changed following Sinwar’s death. Bar also visited Egypt last Tuesday, before Sinwar’s death. — By Samy Magdy in Cairo and Julia Frankel in Jerusalem Lebanon's caretaker PM calls for implementation of UN resolution to end fighting BEIRUT — Lebanon’s caretaker prime minister says implementing a nearly 2-decade-old U.N. resolution still offers the best path to ending the Israel-Hezbollah war. In an interview with the Al-Arabiya network broadcast Monday, ahead of the arrival of a U.S. envoy, Najib Mikati said a new resolution appeared unlikely. 'There is no solution but a diplomatic solution, and the diplomatic solution is currently on the table,' he said. U.N. Security Council Resolution 1701, which ended the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war, called for Hezbollah to withdraw from the border and for U.N. peacekeepers and the Lebanese army to control southern Lebanon, without any Hezbollah or Israeli presence. Israel says the resolution was never implemented and that Hezbollah built up extensive military infrastructure right up to the border. Lebanon has long accused Israel of violating its airspace and failing to abide by other provisions of the resolution. U.S. envoy Amos Hochstein, who was in Beirut on Monday, said U.N. resolution 1701 is 'no longer enough' and a new mechanism must be put in place to ensure it is implemented 'fairly, accurately, transparently.' '1701 was successful at ending the war in 2006, but we must be honest that nobody did anything to implement it,' Hochstein said in a news conference after meeting with Berri. 'The lack of implementation over those years contributed to the conflict that we are in today.' Hezbollah, which said it would continue attacks on Israel until there is a cease-fire in Gaza, appears to have softened that position in recent weeks as Israeli strikes have eliminated much of its top leadership and pounded large areas of Lebanon. Hezbollah now says it supports the diplomatic efforts of Mikati and Lebanese Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri, a political ally of the militant group. Both Lebanese leaders have said they are no longer seeking to tie a cease-fire in Lebanon to one in Gaza. Israeli military apologizes for strike that killed Lebanese soldiers JERUSALEM — The Israeli military has apologized for a strike in southern Lebanon that killed three Lebanese soldiers. The military said it struck a truck on Sunday that had entered an area where it had previously targeted a Hezbollah truck transporting a launcher and missiles. The military said soldiers were not aware that the second truck belonged to the Lebanese army. The military said it is 'not operating against the Lebanese Army and apologizes for these unwanted circumstances.' Lebanon’s army is a respected institution within the country, but it is not powerful enough to impose its will on Hezbollah or defend Lebanon from Israel’s invasion. The army has largely kept to the sidelines as Israel and Hezbollah have traded blows over the past year. Israeli forces invaded southern Lebanon at the beginning of the month and have been operating in a narrow strip along the border. Israeli airstrikes have pounded large areas of the country, targeting what Israel says are Hezbollah sites. The militant group has fired thousands of rockets, missiles and drones into Israel since Oct. 8, 2023, the day after its ally Hamas launched a surprise attack into Israel, triggering the war in Gaza.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-hezbollah-mideast-latest-21-october-2024-b6a1782da26a614fcb3a3d4e42df0635	2024-10-20T23:22:09-07:00	
Moldova narrowly votes to secure path toward EU membership after accusing Russia of interference	CHISINAU, Moldova (AP) — Moldovans voted by a razor-thin majority in favor of securing the country’s path toward European Union membership, electoral data showed Monday, after the pro-Western president accused foreign interference and 'criminal groups' of trying to undermine the vote in the former Soviet republic. The 'No' vote appeared to be ahead until the last few thousand votes were counted from the large diaspora of Moldova, whose authorities have accused Russia of trying to destabilize the country. With 99.41% of votes counted in the EU referendum held Sunday, the 'Yes' vote stood at 50.39% and the 'No' vote at 49.61%, according to the Central Electoral Commission. A loss would have been a political disaster for the pro-Western government, which strongly supported the pro-EU campaign. On Monday, President Maia Sandu reiterated claims that unprecedented voter fraud and foreign interference had undermined the voting, calling it a 'vile attack' on Moldova’s sovereignty. 'Unfortunately, the justice system failed to do enough to prevent vote-rigging and corruption,' she told a news conference. 'Here, too, we must draw a line, correct what went wrong, and learn the lesson. We heard you: we know we must do more to fight corruption.' Moldovan authorities claim that Moscow has intensified a 'hybrid war' campaign to destabilize the country and derail its EU path. The allegations include funding pro-Moscow opposition groups, spreading disinformation, meddling in local elections and backing a major vote-buying scheme. Russia has repeatedly denied it is interfering in Moldova. Moldova applied to join the EU in the wake of Russia’s full-scale invasion of neighboring Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, and was granted candidate status that summer, alongside Ukraine. Brussels agreed in June to start membership negotiations. In Brussels, the EU’s executive branch, the European Commission, said its services had noted 'unprecedented interference and intimidation by Russia and its proxies, aiming to destabilize the democratic processes' in Moldova, and it underlined its continued support for Moldova on its EU accession path. Spokesperson Peter Stano told reporters that allegations of vote-buying, the bussing of voters and disinformation are only the most recent forms of Russian interference, and that attempts to undermine Moldova and its support for the EU have been going on for months. EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told Moldova's people: 'You’ve done it again! In the face of Russia’s hybrid tactics, Moldova shows that it is independent, it is strong and it wants a European future!' In the presidential race that was held at the same time, Sandu won the first round with 42% of the vote in a field of 11, short of an outright majority. She will face Alexandr Stoianoglo, a Russia-friendly former prosecutor general who outperformed polls with around 26% of the vote, in a runoff on Nov. 3. By the time polling stations closed at 9 p.m. Sunday, more than 1.5 million voters — about 51% of eligible voters — had cast ballots, according to the Central Electoral Commission. Moldova has a population of about 2.5 million. Cristian Cantir, a Moldovan associate professor of international relations at Oakland University, told The Associated Press that earlier polls might have 'overestimated the pro-EU feeling' inside Moldova and the referendum would have failed to pass without votes from outside the country. 'It’s going to be particularly problematic because ... it’s going to feed into narratives that are pushed by the Kremlin and pro-Russian forces,' he said. The White House on Monday called the referendum a 'historic step forward in Moldova’s European integration' but warned that Russia would try to interfere in next month’s runoff in the presidential race. 'The last several months Moscow has dedicated millions of dollars towards these efforts,' said U.S. national security spokesman John Kirby. 'Now, Russia did not succeed. The results demonstrate democracy is strong, as is the will and desire of the Moldovan people to advance toward European integration.' In early October, Moldovan law enforcement said it had uncovered a massive vote-buying scheme orchestrated by Ilan Shor, an exiled pro-Russia oligarch who currently lives in Russia, which paid 15 million euros ($16.2 million) to 130,000 people to undermine the two ballots. Shor was convicted in absentia last year of fraud and money laundering and sentenced to 15 years in prison in the case of $1 billion that went missing from Moldovan banks in 2014. He denied the allegations, saying the payments were legal and citing a right to freedom of expression. Shor’s populist Russia-friendly Shor Party was declared unconstitutional last year and banned. On Thursday, Moldovan authorities foiled another plot in which more than 100 young Moldovans received training in Moscow from private military groups on how to create civil unrest around the two votes. Some also attended more advanced training in 'guerrilla camps' in Serbia and Bosnia, police said, and four people were detained for 30 days. A pro-Western government has been in power in Moldova since 2021, a year after Sandu won the presidency. A parliamentary election will be held next year. ___ Associated Press writers Raf Casert and Lorne Cook contributed from Brussels; Aamer Madhani from Washington.	https://apnews.com/article/moldova-elections-eu-referendum-russia-325cb2c13beb1d76565a6e2aadef971a	2024-10-20T23:14:36-07:00	
US defense chief visits Kyiv for talks on how to keep supporting Ukraine's fight against Russia	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin arrived in Kyiv on an unannounced visit Monday, hours after a Russian drone attack on the Ukrainian capital and as Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy pushes Western partners to keep providing military support for the war. Austin said on the X platform that his fourth visit shows 'that the United States, alongside the international community, continues to stand by Ukraine.' Ukraine is having difficulty holding back a ferocious Russian campaign along the eastern front that is gradually compelling Kyiv’s forces to give up a series of towns, villages and hamlets. Zelenskyy is urging Western allies to support his so-called ‘victory plan’ to end the almost three-year war, which is Europe’s biggest conflict since World War II and has cost tens of thousands of lives on both sides, including many civilians. His strategy includes a formal invitation for Ukraine to join NATO and permission to use Western long-range missiles to strike military targets in Russia — steps Kyiv’s allies have previously balked at supporting. The Western response has been lukewarm, and Austin was expected to discuss the plan with Ukrainian officials in Kyiv. Zelenskyy said in a Sunday evening video address that his plan had won the backing of France, Lithuania, Nordic countries and 'many other allies' in the European Union which he didn’t name. The key country, however, is the United States, which is Ukraine’s biggest military supplier. Zelenskyy said he had received 'very positive signals from the United States,' but he stopped short of saying he had secured Washington’s endorsement for the plan. Russia fired three missiles and 116 Shahed drones at Ukraine overnight from Sunday to Monday, Ukraine's air force said. Machine gun fire and the noise of drones’ engines was heard in Kyiv’s center throughout the night. Authorities reported minor damages to civilian infrastructure caused by falling drone debris in the three districts of the city. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-us-austin-zelenskyy-562b5bd0ce4c8849d29b5a3d0fa7dfb4	2024-10-20T22:36:58-07:00
